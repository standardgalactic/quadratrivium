1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
So in the last few days as we see what started in Minneapolis and then went to Atlanta and

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,880
Seattle and then everywhere in the US, it's interesting how consuming a new cycle can

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,360
make the most concerning issue of three days ago almost completely absent in people's minds

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,120
and attention, but you also lose almost all perspective if that happens.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,480
So it's important to kind of pay attention to the sequence of things and the narrative

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,640
arc and the things that are not forefront in the attention cycle.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,640
So right before the racial violence became forefront, we were seeing in the US an escalation

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,280
towards violence that was very left-right oriented between red state, blue state, having different

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,560
focus around how they were going to open and it was kind of showing up as the mass squares

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:03,280
versus the non-mass squares and we saw armed people going to Capitol buildings in protest

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,360
of quarantine and shutdown.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,560
We also started to see an increase in racial focus in the news over the week leading up

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,960
to the case in Minneapolis that set it all off.

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:29,160
And I'm not going to say like a single narrative of some central command and control function

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,400
that I think is orchestrating everything, but I'm going to mention anomalies that I

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,520
think you should be paying attention to.

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,760
So we see the case of the man who was jogging and the retired cop and his son shot him.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,400
That was like a week before.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,280
And then we see increased news of white supremacy and a lot more images of white guys with guns

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,480
at Capitol buildings.

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:05,400
Then we see in relationship to the guy who was running and got shot and there were protests,

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,880
black open carry of weapons associated with the protests and then also black open carry

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:23,240
of weapons escorting a black lawmaker to the courthouse or some state building.

24
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,040
And then we see Joe Biden's comments about you ain't black and like just a whole bunch

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,440
of increase in race attention in primary news cycles.

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,600
And then we see the case with George Floyd.

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,800
So there's a big question for me of like, did we just have a particular and unusually

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
racist week?

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,840
Or does the news cycle not actually reflect the background rate of things for other reasons?

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,840
And for for every situation like we see with George Floyd, the number of those that aren't

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,040
caught like it's just it's just a much less rare phenomena than I think most people think

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
it is.

33
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,640
Sadly, I think most black people in inner cities know it's not as rare a phenomenon.

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,240
So then we see the video circulating that the we see this guy with a hammer and black

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,640
tactical gear breaking the windows of the auto zone right in Minneapolis.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,640
And we see people jumping to thinking, assessing that he's a cop as an agent provocateur, or

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,200
that he is a Antifa guy or a white supremacist or a Soros agent.

38
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,960
There's a lot of different hypotheses, but a lot of images are surfacing of the buildings

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,520
being set on fire and the windows being broken by white people at the black protest rallies

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,600
that were not breaking like the initial movement to property destruction and violence was not

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,040
actually them.

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,000
And broken windows theory is very clear that once like once the first Molotov cocktails

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,240
thrown, and it becomes much easier to engage in throwing Molotov cocktails once the first

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,360
windows are broken, because there's like a threshold to move past that that has already

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
been broken.

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:33,640
And so the idea that police officers or people with other agendas infiltrate a protest group

47
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,400
that is otherwise peaceful and throw the first rock to justify use of police force on the

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
other side, like that's a very well known phenomena.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
But right now we can hypothesize a lot of groups that would have a motive to do it for

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
a lot of reasons.

51
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,400
So some people either are buying the standard narrative or they're too quickly jumping to

52
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,880
the alternate narrative of it was the cop for this reason or it was the white supremacists

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:03,680
trying to blame the black guys or it was the deep state Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden supporting

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,000
liberals that are trying to create insight more reason to have people stay at home than

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,080
the quarantine already was to move towards their goal to steal an election.

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,920
There's like a gazillion hypotheses.

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,440
I think the problem is the people who aren't buying the mainstream media narrative are buying

58
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,040
the first alternate narrative that appeals to their sense making desire to not have uncertainty

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,800
and put the pieces together before there's adequate evidence that that alternate narrative

60
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,040
is actually much better.

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,200
So the guy who broke the windows was definitely not a normal part of the protest, but I don't

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:52,720
know who he was an agent for or what the motive was because the data that suggests any of

63
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,880
the 10 different hypotheses are not solid yet.

64
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,880
So one of the things I'm wanting to encourage is don't let your attention cycle be controlled

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,320
by the attention cycle of your social media feed or your mainstream news.

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,960
That's one thing.

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,560
The other thing is be very careful about how easy it is to get induced into being on one

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,360
side of group think and conflict theory.

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Let's talk about conflict theory for a moment.

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,520
There's a few types of natural cleavings or easy cleavings, if not natural, where it's

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,160
very easy to drive conflict between people.

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,920
Political left right is a very easy one.

73
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,120
You can do red state, blue state stuff.

74
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,120
You can do they have a make America great again hat versus a rainbow gay flag.

75
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,360
They're literally wearing flags of different kinds to symbolize red shirt, blue shirt,

76
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
like the type of team they're in, and then you can drive conflict between them, which

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,920
both creates a sense of clear sense making of I know who my team is.

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:06,440
I know what the group think of the narrative on my side is.

79
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,880
The red, blue is very easy.

80
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,640
People versus the cops is very easy.

81
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,240
Race issues are very easy.

82
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:22,880
Race is maybe the easiest because it's where the flag is biologically built in.

83
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,080
If everybody here has not studied conflict theory, you're going to have a hard time making

84
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,960
sense of the world without a good model of how conflict arises between people, how it

85
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,480
gets intentionally stirred up, how people resolve it.

86
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,000
There's a lot of different schools of conflict theory that are worth studying, but at minimum

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
everybody should know Rene Girard's work.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm not saying that I agree with Girard.

89
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,840
There are things that he said that were extremely insightful.

90
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,440
Specifically, his idea is that the fundamental nature of conflict comes from the fact that

91
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:16,160
desire is memetic, meaning that we learn to want stuff the same way we learn language

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,040
by watching other people, and that I don't know Mandarin and I don't know Swahili and

93
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,480
I don't know Dutch because I didn't watch people speaking those.

94
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,120
I watched people speak in English, so I got conditioned to think in a worldview through

95
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,520
aesthetic frames, through it's very deep how much my whole identity and everything was

96
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,640
conditioned by what I watched.

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,960
His argument is that much of what we want is also conditioned by watching people.

98
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,800
We end up innately wanting what other people have, which means that desire inexorably drives

99
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
conflict.

100
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,520
Somebody, people have stuff, you want that thing or similar kinds of things, then as

101
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,880
more people are wanting the same things and conflicting over it, the conflict itself becomes

102
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
memetic.

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,840
People learn through mimesis to identify with the Zionist or the anti-Zionist side based

104
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,680
on which side of the wall they grew up on or whatever the conflict they happen to have

105
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,400
been born into.

106
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,320
Then in Girard's model, the conflict continues to increase until there's so much embodied

107
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,160
energy that you're going to get something like a war and the least violent way to deal

108
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,440
with it is to have a scapegoat, a sacrificial, rather than a all against all war, be able

109
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,520
to have some sacrificial person that is able to be effectively blamed for the whole scenario

110
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,800
and then we're able to take them out and decrease the embodied conflict energy for a while and

111
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,320
then the cycle has to repeat.

112
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Girard's work really says that historically has been no way out of that and the role of

113
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,160
various religions was to figure out how to do scapegoating well and that that's what

114
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,960
all of the sacrifices of various religious traditions were about, that Christianity was

115
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,240
actually trying to get rid of scapegoating by showing that the person they scapegoated

116
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,760
was actually innocent and not only innocent but the highest kind of innocent so that the

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,320
way people would get out of his answer actually of how you get out of scapegoating was everyone

118
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,680
developed Christ-like virtues.

119
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,920
But specifically as critique said that by getting rid of religion and this is relevant

120
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,080
to the goals of this group that is trying to re-invoke some of the things religion did

121
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:47,200
like the development of human virtue, by getting rid of religion we got rid of the way of

122
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,320
dealing with the memetic conflict while simultaneously getting much much larger weapons of destruction

123
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,880
so that rather than have things heat up in Europe and kill a Jew sacrificially it had

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,360
to be this massive kind of killing of all of these Jews and so okay so why am I bringing

125
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,880
that up?

126
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,440
I think it's very easy to, I think there are lots of reasons to want to drive conflict

127
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,640
and to want to keep groups of people having attention focused in different ways.

128
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,480
Maybe this is actually the way I'll talk about it.

129
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,040
Power pretty much translates to power over other people.

130
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,040
To have power over their behaviors whether I want people to vote for me in a particular

131
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,440
way or I want them to buy my stuff or I want them to publicly support my ideas I need to

132
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,160
control other people's behavior to control their behavior I need to control their minds.

133
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:07,200
And so warfare is main mainly not fought with bullets like the kinetic warfare that we think

134
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,360
of as warfare that's fought with weapons is maybe one percent of warfare.

135
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,520
Ninety-nine percent of warfare is diplomatic warfare, political warfare, economic warfare,

136
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,120
narrative warfare, information warfare.

137
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,400
All of this comes together to what we call hybrid warfare or really just politics or

138
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,000
game theory or the game of power.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,400
But think of it as a hybrid or population-centric warfare.

140
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,840
So in this war the treasure being fought over is people's minds and the battleground

141
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,440
is people's minds.

142
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:58,960
The primary weapons are tools of narrative influence and emotional evocation and control

143
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,520
of the information flows.

144
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,240
And in these wars they're asymmetric wars because you have some actors that have access

145
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:18,440
to billion or trillion-dollar level information technologies, AI-empowered micro-targeting.

146
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,880
And then you have other people that are just trying to figure shit out on their own and

147
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,480
they don't even know they're in a war.

148
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,160
And they don't even know that their own mind is the battleground of the war and they think

149
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,000
they believe the shit they believe and they think they came to it on their own.

150
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,200
They think they're doing a good job sense-making and they don't realize that as they're researching

151
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,800
of the trillions of pages of shit they could see, the ones that they will ever even be

152
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
able to see based on what shows up in their YouTube feed or their Google search or manipulated

153
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,840
by algorithms that have agendas behind them.

154
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,840
As well as the original source material of whoever put it out for which reasons.

155
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,120
Okay, so zooming out from the current violence for a moment, we have an election coming up

156
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:12,280
in the US that will be radically consequential for the world, either way.

157
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,480
No matter who wins currently, whether the election is illegally tampered with and stolen

158
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,800
or not, half of the population will think it was.

159
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,120
This is a real problem, right?

160
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,400
Because what happens when a third to a half of the population no matter which way it goes

161
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,080
thinks that it was stolen and thinks it was radically consequential?

162
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:43,360
Well, like one of two really bad things happens, either the people get violent, much more so

163
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,440
than we currently have.

164
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,480
And that sets off one whole cascade of scenarios where they don't get violent and the people

165
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,800
who want to steal elections get even clearer that they just can with impunity.

166
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,480
So we're like, fuck, what do we do with this moving forward?

167
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,760
Now, mail-in ballots.

168
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,720
Are mail-in ballots easier to corrupt than in-person voting?

169
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,800
Yep, totally.

170
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,080
And COVID, as one reason, violence could be another, but COVID is one reason to have

171
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,040
mail-in ballots like, might there be reasons associated with that?

172
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Yeah.

173
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,240
Now, might there be reasons that people who really want Trump out of office would want

174
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,280
to initiate things that make Trump look worse and that say, look at all the bad shit that's

175
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,840
happening during Trump?

176
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,040
We could also talk about what motives the Trump campaign would have to be engaged in

177
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,760
something where you wouldn't want transfer of power to occur.

178
00:15:48,760 --> 00:16:00,080
So there's a version of this that is easy to buy for either political leaning.

179
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,520
I don't find that most successful politicians that I have encountered near the top of the

180
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,880
power actually believe red versus blue ideology.

181
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,360
They just believe in the game of power and they signal red versus blue ideology as part

182
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,480
of their memetic warfare to control the people that are going to vote for them.

183
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,640
Just like I don't think most of the people that end up engaging religions and holy wars

184
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,320
at the most strategic level really even are religious.

185
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,200
I think they know that these are ways to get people to do things for reasons that are mostly

186
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,120
strategic.

187
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,840
As we look at war a little bit more and we look at the tension heating up on the India-China

188
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:51,160
border is such a big deal like what's happening there and the India-China-Pakistan interaction

189
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,000
and the India-China-Russia interaction.

190
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,520
And as we look at it with COVID related stuff, obviously what happens to the spread of the

191
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:11,320
virus with all of the protests that are definitely not social distancing, well we'll find out.

192
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:18,440
What happens when like with Germany and South Korea and China who started to get second

193
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,200
waves of infection after reopening, what happens when we start to get second waves here and

194
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:32,480
the political tension is so heated around the idea of closing again.

195
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:42,920
And then we also start to see things like because of the COVID shutdown of transportation

196
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,000
the food supply system got radically damaged, right?

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,680
Give or take the food supply for two billion people got damaged.

198
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,480
And so Nigeria has a 25 million person insecure food population that all went from food insecure

199
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
to actually don't have food.

200
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:07,000
And now violence has been raising on the ground both insurgencies, local crime and Boko Haram.

201
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,480
That's probably going to trigger an exodus and a massive refugee situation.

202
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,440
But after Syria it's like where do the refugees go?

203
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,680
So then what comes from that conflict why so?

204
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,280
We're definitely at a unique moment in the world.

205
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,880
We're at a moment where because of the connectedness of supply chains because of the ability for

206
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,960
viruses in airplanes to move around the world so fast because of the ability of news cycles

207
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
to move so fast.

208
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,480
So we go from an event in Minneapolis to in every city because of those things the interconnection

209
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,880
for the cascade of events from anywhere to everywhere and from one sector to other sectors

210
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:57,120
is so high on top of systemic fragility on top of very high embodied emotional energy.

211
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:08,760
This next phase of time is going to see a continuance of a cascade of very serious problems.

212
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,840
How do we make sense of the world given all of these dynamics and how do we respond?

213
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,040
I always feel stuck when someone asks me that how do we for some very large audience if

214
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,320
we respond because it's going to be very different based on people's skills and capacities

215
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
and interests.

216
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,520
It's not like a very good generalized answer to that.

217
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,080
Like David, how are you responding?

218
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,880
Well you're trying to both put out information that helps people and share frames that help

219
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,040
people process information and maybe that helps them get less emotionally hijacked so

220
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,940
they can have some more clarity.

221
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,920
Like those seem like within your bailiwick of things to do that you can do super important

222
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,160
things that need done.

223
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,760
There's going to be an equivalent of that in totally different ways that everyone on

224
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,800
here has as a possibility.

225
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:19,660
So I think people recognizing that they actually have some choice in where they put their attention

226
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,280
and some choice in the meaning they make.

227
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:29,080
So both where they focus and actually they have choice in where they put their attention.

228
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,200
They have choice in the process of coming to belief.

229
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,160
Are they just kind of letting themselves by the conclusions put in front or are they really

230
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,840
asking that am I sure of this?

231
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,320
How would I be sure of this?

232
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,720
Because there's going to be a response to their own sense of certainty or uncertainty.

233
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,440
And they also have some choice in the meaning they make around the things and all of this

234
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
is going to affect their state.

235
00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:01,120
So that means that overwhelm is something someone really has a choice to indulge or not.

236
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,040
So sometimes I'll notice that there's so much coming in and I'm like what the fuck do I do

237
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
about this?

238
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,760
And there's a beginning impulse of overwhelm.

239
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,640
And I know I'm not trying to pretend or repress it but I also know that going into an overwhelmed

240
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,120
spiral is not useful and I have a kind of deep commitment to be useful.

241
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,320
So I have a deep commitment to want to think about things in a way that allows me to continue

242
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,440
to respond.

243
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,000
So I'll be like okay well let's just step back and actually write down what are all the things

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,080
that I see going on.

245
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
Let's make a situational assessment map.

246
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,400
So rather than just start to spiral into something like let me start to identify what are the

247
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
knowns, what are the unknowns, what are the things I might be able to do something about

248
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,320
where I want to put more of my sense making into that area because I might actually have

249
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,840
some agency in that area.

250
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,440
So some people on here that what is theirs to do will be largely around serving their

251
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:11,320
local communities but you know other people might have might work in the finance sector

252
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,440
and have specific things that they can do that are particularly meaningful to be able

253
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:27,040
to get the right types of projects funded or yeah I don't know.

254
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:35,200
What I can say not to do right is definitely make sure okay here's an important one I'll

255
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,360
say one thing to do.

256
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,440
Understand the basics of strategy if you're going to try and do anything so that you don't

257
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,760
just make shit worse or be totally useless.

258
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:57,840
So strategy 101 every response everything that you do if you're effective some people

259
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,360
will not like and it will evoke a counter response.

260
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,840
Factor the counter response in what you're doing and see if it's still a good idea.

261
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,840
If you are not factoring counter responses you are not doing strategy you are just being

262
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,480
reactive.

263
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:25,160
Now you might be super righteous in your reactivity but that does mean that you are actually upon

264
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,320
that is being manipulated by forces that are doing strategy you aren't actually doing strategy

265
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,200
and so if you're wanting to do something to make sure Trump doesn't get reelected or to

266
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:46,760
make sure that systemic racism gets addressed or whatever it is you just have to think in

267
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,840
this particular action who that will feel threatened by this will counter respond in

268
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,680
what ways and what resources are available to them and if I'm escalating the game right

269
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,920
if I'm increasing the war on one side driving an arms race of escalation am I driving it

270
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,360
in the right direction.

271
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,120
Do that if you aren't doing that then you're most likely escalating things in the wrong

272
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
direction with whatever you're doing.

273
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,000
I guess listening to you I mean we've done quite a lot of conversations around I think

274
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,760
phase shift for humanity was the first one where you talked about the self terminating

275
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,800
nature of the current dynamic and I guess it's one thing to talk about that and to

276
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,960
have seen it as a possibility it's another one when you feel it on a kind of visceral

277
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,840
level and I wonder I just wonder whether you because you talk I mean you use some beautiful

278
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,800
metaphors about the caterpillar and the butterfly and I'd say for talking about kind of phase

279
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,240
shift and self terminating systems you actually sketch out quite a sort of positive vision

280
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,320
as well has that changed or are you still.

281
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,400
That hasn't changed.

282
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,640
I think that everything that's happening right now.

283
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,360
Was going to happen some version of it there's a lot of path dependencies it it didn't have

284
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,680
to have COVID as a path and it could have been a different pandemic or it could have

285
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,560
been grid collapse or it could have been climate change driving refugees driving a war there's

286
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:47,000
a gazillion things that could have started the the systemic cascades but it was inevitable

287
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,840
which is why like that's mostly what I've talked about for the last six or seven years

288
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,000
was trying to help people see that was inevitable let's see what we can do to do anticipatory

289
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,600
good good things.

290
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,120
If you identify every area that there is a risk.

291
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,000
There is also a meaningful upside and this is a way to think about what might be yours

292
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,120
to do when an environmental niche gets disturbed it's much easier to have new things come in

293
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,160
and change the process.

294
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,800
So if we go through and look at all of the areas where there are major problems and where

295
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,080
there are major risks and say what is the system that's actually breaking down and what

296
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,440
would a better version of that system be and what could we do to implement those better

297
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,000
versions of the system rather than try to reinstate the security of the old ones that

298
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,080
would be a beginning of thinking about the opportunity space.

299
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,480
And we could talk about that with global finance we could talk about it with infrastructure

300
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,120
we could talk about it with the health care system on and on right the judicial reform

301
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,360
all those things.

302
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,280
Someone just posted this in the chat I think it's really true so far it seems the pandemic

303
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,760
and the crisis is accelerating all of the we're not in a shift into a new system it

304
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,120
seems to be just accelerating and compounding all of the worst aspects of the old one.

305
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:26,840
Do you have a sense of how that process might play out and where is the sort of hope in

306
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:34,640
that if there is any.

307
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Most people who care about things widely care about the global commons long term suck at

308
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:54,320
doing things like they suck at doing things at scale because most anyone who's good at

309
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,480
doing things at scale one at the game of power.

310
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,520
Because to do things at scale means to be able to influence things in a way that will

311
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,040
beat out competitors and go against people who want things to go otherwise.

312
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,760
So right now there's a lot of people like during the covid time there's a lot of people

313
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,440
feeling like they have more free time than ever.

314
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,640
But the most powerful people in the world have been busier than ever during this time

315
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:30,240
they have been consolidating the market and buying up distressed assets and massively

316
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,560
increasing opportunism during this time.

317
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:45,680
So one of the things I would say is necessary for it to be other than you just said David

318
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:54,720
is that the people who actually are committed to the well being of humanity and the earth

319
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,920
and civilization long term must learn to be how must learn how to be effective at actually

320
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,880
making things happen at a global level.

321
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Do you like to ask your question Robin.

322
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:16,440
Yes what do you have to say about yes the the resource of cross generational mentoring

323
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,120
and networking in the situation we're in.

324
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,240
It's complex.

325
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:35,040
It's easy to say cross generational collaboration is good like it's easy to say that diverse

326
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,240
perspectives of any kind being in conversation will enrich everyone who is there.

327
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,840
That's true.

328
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,160
The current situation that we're facing the last times we face situations that were relevantly

329
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,680
analogous none of those people are still alive in terms of the generations that actually

330
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,920
know anything about it like the people who were in World War two aren't still here the

331
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,640
people who are in the Great Depression aren't still here the people who are in the 1918 plague

332
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
aren't still here.

333
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,480
And this is like if you study generational theory like Strauss how for you study Baudrillard

334
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,200
typically things repeat on the cycle that once the people who had the hard one knowledge

335
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,120
are dead we repeat the thing because they're gone right.

336
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,280
So part of the generational connection I want people to do is study the work of the people

337
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,680
who really understood the last relevant issues who happened to be dead might have been alive

338
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,880
a little while ago.

339
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:45,200
Now there are still people who are involved in in Vietnam and the counterculture movement

340
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:55,440
and who are involved in different times that are relevant and to discuss.

341
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:04,200
So like I have a friend Mark Stallman he was involved during that generation but he

342
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:13,440
was doing intelligence work and like he was working with Freeman Dyson directly regarding

343
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,400
what was brought to JFK to do with Coruse Chaff that was a big part of what's led to

344
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,960
things broke down there.

345
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,200
So there's knowledge that he has firsthand that's super directly relevant.

346
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:37,200
But like when I look at the counterculture movement as a whole and I look at the Green

347
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,040
Revolution and the sexual revolution and the civil rights process and the women's rights

348
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,000
all the various things.

349
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,720
The deeper story that I see most of the activists who are there don't know.

350
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,640
The deeper story I see is like actually understanding co Intel Pro and how the FBI CIA and other

351
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:09,940
intelligence agencies actually infiltrated the the progressive movements to very specifically

352
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:15,600
derail them and get them focused on shit that would be ineffective that is that we're

353
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
still doing today.

354
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,920
So I happen to believe that there was intentional up regulation by those power structures of

355
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:31,720
postmodernism as a structure of thought because if the people who studied social science only

356
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,000
studied how to critique the game of power without actually knowing how to effectively

357
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,880
organize then it would make sure that they never could actually really do anything.

358
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,200
So if every time someone's organizing well you call it imperialism you won't end up

359
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,240
organizing well and becoming an imperialist so you'll just be noise and that's fine.

360
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:02,120
And the social sciences that are like actually studying the history of military theory and

361
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,320
political theory and and strategy itself got very down regulated in exchange for something

362
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,080
that would make people feel more righteous while being less effective.

363
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,960
And so I want to make sure that we're learning the right lessons from the right periods of

364
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,560
history.

365
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,080
So what I would say is that when I think about generations and I take all the generations

366
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,240
that are alive now I would say that ninety nine percent of the people in all those generations

367
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,320
have been the victims of intentional disinformation in a mostly just all confused so we can have

368
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,320
intergenerational sharing of some confused generations with others.

369
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:58,000
It's still nice to have different perspectives but I would mostly like for people to have

370
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,240
more clear and incisive insight at all and across a longer time period than their own

371
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,400
experience a deeper study of history and like that.

372
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,120
So I was just wondering what you know where you feel stuck and you feel like you're kind

373
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,200
of in a hopeless situation making space for grief.

374
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,400
So emotions of all kind can influence our sense making they can also influence our choice

375
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,600
making.

376
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,480
I want.

377
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,160
We all know what it's like to have emotions that are not being clearly processed influence

378
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:44,640
our choice making in damaging ways right reacting out of anger or whatever.

379
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,080
But then we can also say OK so I don't want to be reactive emotionally so I'm going to

380
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:57,720
suppress emotions and pretend to do like do a bad version of stoicism and just numb down

381
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:06,960
emotional intelligence in which case I'm taking one whole type of information one whole way

382
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,160
of sense making and turning it off and you could call emotion.

383
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,320
This is reductive but I'm just saying one lens you could call emotion a way of being

384
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,360
able to read warm data.

385
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,120
Partly our emotion is responding to the situation partly our emotion is responding to the narrative

386
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,280
we make of the situation.

387
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,560
So in terms of the narrative we make that's where we want to do CBT or DBT or Byron Katie's

388
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,640
the work or Krishna Murthy's inquiry to see where did I make up some meaning that fucked

389
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,200
me up.

390
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,560
But then there are sometimes where it's like if I see a cop kneeling on someone's neck

391
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:54,320
and killing them and I don't feel angry something is wrong with me like that's not about meaning

392
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,800
making I to actually try and say no I'm only upset because of meaning making means I have

393
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,520
to instantiate a metaphysics where nothing matters and then say well I meaning made well

394
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,960
yes I have a metaphysics where things matter and in a metaphysics where anything matters

395
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,360
then if the sacred is being harmed I can feel pissed off I can feel sad I can feel scared

396
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:26,320
right so you know I'm kind of inundated in data about catastrophic risk so the most fucked

397
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,400
up things all the time and so it doesn't have the same emotional response immediately that

398
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,800
it did the first time that I was exposed to it but I still will just sit back put my computer

399
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,000
down and just cry when I think about what's fucking happening in Nigeria or when I think

400
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,760
about what's about to happen or because if I don't I will actually have to dead in something

401
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,800
and then I become less sensitive which means my sensing decreases and the wholeness of

402
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,760
self decreases so yeah you neither want to let you neither want to repress the emotions

403
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,000
and not listen to them and learn from them nor do you want to just unconsciously act

404
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,040
on them you want to incorporate that into a way that you're connecting to and making

405
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:18,320
sense of reality this was one of the talks from the rebel wisdom festival a dozen more
