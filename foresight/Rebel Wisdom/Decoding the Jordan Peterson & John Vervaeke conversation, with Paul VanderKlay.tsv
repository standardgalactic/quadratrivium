0	10480	So this is a film about the recent conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Bovakie and
10480	14560	for it I'm joined by Paul van der Klee, how are you doing Paul?
14560	17160	I'm doing well, it's great to be here.
17160	23040	Awesome, yeah and I'm really glad to have you here to kind of make sense of what happened
23040	27280	because it's a conversation that we and a lot of other people were really really looking
27280	29920	forward to.
29920	36040	Real anticipation seeing Jordan and John together and I think there was a real split in reaction
36040	40240	to it between people going what was that?
40240	46120	If you look at the comments section below it I've never seen so many people respond negatively
46120	52840	to Jordan's interruptions of John, I'd say that's the main sort of theme of the comments
52840	61480	which is extraordinary in itself but also that there's a lot of, I kind of like it like
61480	65920	panning for gold because there are a lot of golden nuggets within the conversation but
65920	73920	it's quite difficult to access them, it didn't flow very well and I think it's a really interesting,
73920	78800	I think shining a light on what actually happened and maybe what the backstory was could give
78800	81520	a lot of help to people to make sense of it.
81520	86920	All of the difference in perspectives between John and Jordan, what was really going on
86920	91520	and I'm going to sort of just do a quick little bit of framing first Paul before we get into
91520	96240	kind of your reaction to it and what we made of it when we first saw it but if people are
96240	100920	not familiar with John's work, maybe they're very familiar with Jordan but not so familiar
100920	108440	with John, so John Vaveke is worked alongside Jordan in the psychology department at the
108440	115320	University of Toronto, they both have deep interests in kind of the area of myth, religion,
115320	121200	the deep story of Western culture, John had this series Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,
121200	127640	50 episodes that he brought out probably in the wake of Jordan's kind of appearance on
127640	134080	the stage as a kind of, it probably prompted a little bit by that and John has had a huge
134120	138920	amount of really interesting conversations over the last couple of years with people
138920	144160	yourself, Jonathan Pageau, many of the people in the same kind of orbit around these sort
144160	153440	of central questions of meaning, questions of meaning, questions of the deep stories
153440	159720	that drive us all of the same topics that Jordan is really interested in.
159760	165320	I was fascinated by the clickbait title that Jordan chose for the video, a conversation
165320	172120	so intense it might be psychedelic which is interesting as well, this feels like a really
172120	180320	significant coming together of perspectives that we've been waiting and wanting to see.
180320	185640	I'd like to start by saying they had a real enthusiasm for each other and a real, I'm
185720	189480	going to play a little clip now that came up at the end like the real enthusiasm and warmth
189480	190760	between the two of them.
190760	198520	Being a great proponent of yours, I mean that in the sense of noting the greatness that's
198520	203560	in you and seeing how it's manifested itself, especially in your relationship with your
203560	208360	students and noticing that and having admiration and respect for that.
208360	214520	And I respect your work and I disagree with it in parts but we've always been able to do that
214600	218360	in a way that is born with affection and respect.
218360	222920	Well God, it's always nice to find someone who disagrees with your work who could help correct it.
222920	224440	Exactly, seeing the other guys.
224440	227560	I mean thank God man, that's why I want to talk to you, I don't like being wrong
228600	232840	so and I know you don't and so no doubt we're still both pretty wrong.
233960	239160	Mostly so, if the history of science is something we should pay attention to which we should.
239160	241800	Yes, or the history of our own life for that matter.
242360	246360	And I know Paul, you've put out a couple of reaction videos to this and you've sort of been
246920	249080	wrestling a little bit with what happened.
249640	253640	Maybe you could start by framing what you were hoping for from the conversation and what your
253640	256440	reaction has been to it so far.
257400	260360	I too was very much looking forward to this conversation.
260360	269160	I know, I know John's work fairly well at least in these areas and I know he's got some critiques
269160	278600	of Jordan's approach to meaning through narrative, through hero mythology and I was really anticipating
278600	285400	those two working through some of those kinds of issues and they never got there.
286040	291800	I, my reaction like many other peoples was what was that?
291800	295080	I had never heard Jordan like that before.
295960	303640	I was amazed at how well John Vervecchi sort of rolled with all of the redirections
303640	305080	that happened in the conversation.
305640	308680	You fundamentally understand God by saying what God is not
309320	311320	but not of course randomly, right?
311960	313240	What you're trying to do is-
313240	315480	Oh, that's sort of like the God of the gaps.
315480	318360	Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
318360	319000	Oh, sorry.
319000	321960	No, no, that's- don't apologize, we're friends talking.
321960	328760	Well, I don't I don't want to derail the conversation. So it's been it's been like
328760	333000	this and it's been wonderful. It feels to me like doing Petrie behind that conversation,
333000	338080	especially on Jordan's side. I think part of it is he, you know, he and John Revekey
338080	346160	last spoke in 2015. John Revekey has continued his academic trajectory. And I think with
346160	351520	his YouTube channel and all of these conversations with him sort of discovered a whole new pathway
352000	360840	where Jordan has been busy with his health, the culture war stuff. So I saw I'm I'm seeing this
360840	368280	much more as a video where Jordan is to a degree getting introduced for the first time with what
368280	375240	John has been doing for the last five years. Yeah, and that was my sense as well was that John
375360	382040	was, John is so enthusiastic anyway. Like he's he brought that enthusiasm to the conversation.
382040	388200	And Jordan, I think, got him got kind of swept up in that to some degree as well. And it was kind
388200	393240	of John reporting back to Jordan, like, look what you've been missing, or look what's been going
393240	398040	on. Look at all this interesting stuff that's been happening. But I want to start by pointing
398040	404280	like the central paradox of the conversation is that John's central interest is in Deologos,
404600	409400	which is kind of a shared dialogue that goes somewhere new. And he kind of summarized it in
409400	417480	there with talking about Phylius Sophia versus Phylius Nicaea. Phylius Nicaea meaning the love of
417480	422520	victory. Phylius Sophia meaning the love of knowledge. We haven't talked about why people
422520	428200	want us to talk. And the reason they want us to talk is because our ideas dovetail to a substantial
428200	432840	degree and also diverge interestingly. And so I guess they want us to talk so that we can think.
433800	437160	Well, that's it. And I see that's what I was going to say. That's one of the defining. I would
437160	443000	say one of the defining. It certainly seems to be the case as a defining criteria for Socrates,
443000	449240	that if you and I can get to places in the Deologos that we couldn't get to individually,
449240	455880	then real Deologos has has come into existence. And that's Phylius Sophia, the love of wisdom,
455880	461400	as opposed to Phylius Nicaea, the love of victory. And so right, right, right. I didn't know those
461400	469400	phrases. Phylius Sophia, which is the Phylius Sophia. Wisdom is the feminine essence of God.
470120	474680	Yeah. Well, the Phylius is, you know, it's itself a collaborative love.
475480	485240	Did you say Phylius? Yeah. Phylius and Phylius. Phylius Sophia. So Phylius Sophia. The three
485240	492120	loves, the Aros Phylius Agape. This is Phylius. And Phylius is the love that is expressed and
492120	496840	shared in community. And then Sophia, of course, is the word for wisdom. That's where we get
496840	502520	philosophy from. Phylius Nicaea is the love of victory, like Nike victory.
503080	508760	Right. And yeah, it's interesting because the, tell me what you think of this. I think the YouTube
508760	514920	dialogues that we undertake are characterized by Phylius Sophia. And the YouTube dialogues
514920	523800	conducted in the main by the, what would you call it, legacy media are Phyla, Phylius Nicaea.
523800	530680	Phylius Nicaea. And I think people appreciate Phylius Sophia much better. You better believe
530680	534840	it. I certainly appreciate it much better. For John, this is, and he studied it a lot as a
534840	539320	cognitive scientist. It's how can you have a conversation that goes somewhere new that builds
539320	544520	upon itself, that is not about trying to best the other person or just kind of repeat what you
544520	550200	already know. But how can you have a dialogue where you discover new territory together? And I
550200	556440	think the interesting thing for me is given that that was the subject of their talk, the question
556440	563480	is how much they achieved that in that conversation. And I mean, if you go by the YouTube comments,
563560	570680	you probably say that they didn't achieve it very much. And it goes to the heart, I think of
571560	576360	what I consider like the trajectory of Jordan Peterson over the last, since his kind of eruption
576360	585080	onto the stage, the whole Peterson phenomenon of 2018 onwards, that sense of novelty and whether,
587400	592760	like my overall sense of him getting slightly stuck in his story, which I'll come to a little bit
593640	598680	in a bit. But there was this weird, almost performative contradiction, given the topic that
599400	604360	John has made this kind of lifetime study of, of what does it mean to get that into a flow state
604360	607640	together? What does it mean to explore new territory together? What does it mean to
608440	615000	actually know the cognitive science of what is going on physiologically when we're in this kind
615000	623080	of flow state of exploration? And I like my overall sense is that I would love to see,
624280	627400	and this is not judgmental, because Jordan is obviously coming back from a huge
628440	634120	number of difficulties, the health problems, and it's kind of certainly not up to full strength.
634120	642680	But to the hope is that in time, we might see Jordan enter more into those kind of conversations.
642760	647240	But I felt that it was, there were elements, there were moments of that in this conversation
647240	652600	with John, but it was very glitchy. Like there wasn't so much of a sense of a shared
654040	659320	edifice that they were both building together. There was a sort of, I think there were moments
659320	665000	of that, but it also just felt, I think glitchy is probably the best word that I can think of.
665960	675000	I agree. In some ways, I contrast this with Jordan's first talk with Sam Harris with Brett
675000	682040	Weinstein there. In that first talk in Vancouver, Jordan was very clearly trying to build something,
682600	689320	and Sam wasn't playing. Sam sort of played this knock it down game, and Jordan kept trying to
689320	695240	construct something. Sam kept trying to knock things down. In this conversation, I don't think
695240	704360	Jordan was trying to knock things down. I think he was, I hear in many places in the video,
704360	713400	he's trying to grasp, to assimilate, to figure out where John is at. And so he's doing a lot of
713480	720760	attempts at recognition, attempts at connection, but usually what you get with that hopefully
720760	727400	is a weaving together of things. Whereas there, it was sort of two tracks. John would mention
727400	730840	something, and Jordan would connect it with something, and John would go a little further,
730840	735800	and Jordan would connect it to something else. John was very gracious in sort of developing
735800	741240	that connection a little bit, but then John continued to want to get back to
742680	746840	something a little bit more consistent. And I think actually through the video,
748040	755640	John was able to make some impact, at least in terms of John's four Ps of knowledge, expanding
755640	764040	beyond the propositional into the perspectival participatory. And I think that was helpful.
764120	766920	And at the end of the video, I think they achieved some of that.
768120	773160	Yeah, and I'd love to maybe go into with you sort of sifting some of those
773880	779880	flecks of gold from the interview in a second. I just thought I'd, my overall sense about this
779880	785320	sense of Deologos, this sense of going somewhere new in a conversation, I'd like to just sort of
785320	791720	drill into that because my sense of what, when I first discovered Jordan Peterson in 2017,
791720	799160	watching his lectures was, there was this real sense of exploration, like he was going on a
799160	804200	journey, you could sort of see him in the Maps of Meaning series in 2017. It was not a dialogue,
804200	809240	but it kind of was. You saw him, he'd find one of his students who was listening and he'd speak to
809240	814760	them, and he'd respond to kind of the mood in the room. And you got this sense of there was a lot
814760	819800	and aliveness to his exploration. It was like he was walking in a landscape and putting things
819800	824360	together as he was walking. And I think that was part of what was really compelling about
824360	833240	him in that sense. And then I think when he first came to attention in 2018, he had a series of
833240	837720	conversations with people that also felt like they had that kind of sense of exploration.
838840	846360	And then we saw him go on this book tour where he was pretty much with differences, like not
846360	853240	every evening was the same, but he was doing the same story pretty much every night. And my sense
853240	859320	is that over time he got more and more trapped in that story, that he wasn't really on that sense of
859320	864600	exploration or on that sense of kind of novelty anymore. And I think that, I mean, people that I
864600	869000	know who knew him at the time also said they found him sort of, he got a little bit more stuck and
869000	874680	a little bit more reactive. And one of the amazing things that I think a lot of us really respect
874680	882600	about him is he also reflected on that himself. I remember a question that he answered in an AMA
882600	887000	a while ago that I'll probably play the clip from here. He talked about the corruption of his soul
887000	890440	that he recognized and the way that he was responding to journalists, for example.
891400	897400	The problem is I'm becoming too much on guard. And I've noticed a developing sense of impatience
898360	904280	within me and some suspicion. And that's not good. I don't want to be in situations where
904280	910040	those are my fundamental orientations. It's a sign of a certain amount of internal corruption on my
910040	917880	part. And I want to be in situations where I'm speaking with people, speaking honestly to people
917880	922840	who are honestly listening. And this is what I felt coming through quite a bit in the conversation
922920	929160	with John. It came in and came out this sense of John would say something that sparked a story
929160	934760	that Jordan already knew. And he'd start kind of telling that story. And I've seen that quite a
934760	941880	lot in some of his interviews since he's come back. And it reminds me as a journalist, whenever I
941880	949480	interview someone usually quite prominent, who's been interviewed a lot in the past, you know that
949480	954360	if you ask them certain questions, they're going to give you a story. And it's almost impossible to
954360	959800	get them out of that once they start. The more the more famous someone is, the more used to
959800	965000	they are to telling that story. It's like, okay, here comes the story about this. I won't name any
965000	969640	names. But it's happened quite a lot. And part of your job as a journalist, like how can I get them
969640	974760	out of those tram tracks and into new territory? And sometimes it's very, very difficult because
974760	980840	anything you say, they'll just go into the story they already know. And I've had the sense sometimes
980840	985240	with Jordan in the conversations he had since he's got back, a guest will say something, and then
985240	990280	it's like, okay, now it's the Cain and Abel story. Now it's the Tower of Abel story. And it's like,
990280	995320	as the audience, we've already heard all of those things. And there's something in that. It's like,
995320	998760	it's the, when you go and see a band, and it's like, well, play the hits, you already know,
998760	1005080	there's a little bit of that. But that was, I felt that coming up quite a bit in the John
1005080	1009160	conversation that John would say something, and then Jordan would kind of go into something that
1009160	1014760	we were already familiar with. And that's also how I, having tracked the whole kind of intellectual
1014760	1019160	dark web conversation, that's where that kind of glitched out as well for me was this sense of,
1020280	1025640	for various tribal reasons, for various kind of aligned incentive reasons for various
1026600	1032920	that that sense of exploration and novelty that I felt in 2018 2019 just fell away.
1033480	1038520	Audience capture being another issue, like all of these different things start to start to just,
1038520	1043560	and I think because of the nature of the media environment we're in at the moment, it literally
1043560	1051080	warps around you. You don't, you start to kind of tune out anyone who doesn't have a positive,
1051080	1054680	you've got an infinite amount of feedback. So you only start listening to the supportive stuff,
1054760	1060120	you start kind of just producing stuff for the your traditional audience. Some things become
1060120	1065080	profitable, admitting you're wrong about certain things is not profitable. All of those kind of
1065080	1069880	factors start to come in as well. But that's why I think this is such a fascinating conversation to
1069880	1077160	analyze, because the topic at hand, Deologos emergent alive dialogue is the thing I think
1078840	1082760	that we that we were attracted to originally. And I think it's also the thing that could
1082760	1092040	that will that could potentially be Jordan's healing as well in some ways. Like I think that's
1092040	1097480	what he needs that sense of like pursuing truth in an original in an interesting and in an
1097480	1102840	unscripted way again. I think that would that's the sort of the juice in some ways.
1103720	1108920	The description on the video, I initially I was quite surprised the video was released at all
1109560	1116760	because of the strangeness of it. And I think that was known because of the strange psychedelic
1116760	1125320	reference in the title. My take on this increasingly is is more shamanic. And I think what you
1125320	1136360	described is is what Jordan needs in that something needs to disrupt his sense making.
1136360	1143480	We need to see in him a hunger again for something other than a lot of the political
1143480	1151080	or social transformations he's been talking about. And and I think you're right that the irony of the
1151080	1159560	video is that this is about Deologos. And that is what we were looking for from it. And that is,
1159560	1166760	I think in many ways what Jordan needs. Now, I'm fully aware that as a Christian minister using
1166760	1176520	the word shamanic will raise a lot of eyebrows among Christians. But as a as a working preacher
1176520	1186440	and minister, that is exactly the way the Bible works in a preacher's soul. Because the Bible
1186440	1192760	is a very strange book. And especially the teachings of Jesus, they're supposed to disrupt.
1192760	1197240	And if you read the sermon on the mount, after 2000 years, nobody's really quite sure what that
1197240	1203640	sermon means. And in that sense, it's rather shamanic in that it's supposed to break up our sense
1203640	1213000	making. So I think I think a number of us are looking for that for Jordan and from Jordan,
1213000	1219720	because with, you know, what I often call his first wave, I think that's what propelled him.
1219720	1227000	When he came onto the scene, we heard something in that moment that broke up sort of the,
1227720	1235720	the stage sense making and said, Oh, here's some fresh insight. Now, whether Jordan has that in
1235720	1242360	him or not, I've spoken to a number of his undergraduate and graduate students who some
1242360	1250840	of whom say things like he, your first, your first impression, your first for your first take
1250840	1257320	for Jordan for a while is very, is very much that way. But then you, once you've heard about,
1257320	1264600	you know, the rats and the wolves, and then he sort of, then, okay, this is all map territory,
1264600	1270840	and you move on. And so I agree very much that I think if Jordan is going to
1272840	1280120	really content to find, to be able to make the kinds of contribution we saw in 2017, 2018,
1281000	1286760	he's going to need different conversation partners. And I don't know that the current
1288040	1294280	conversations he's doing, which have many of which are sort of book interviews, but they're
1294280	1301640	not really interviews. In other words, he's, I, in some ways, I, I see him trying to get at Dea
1301640	1308920	Logos. And here, John Vervake actually has in a very, you know, serious way, he's been studying it.
1309480	1318360	And so I would love to see Jordan sort of come to John and say, help me, John, you know, find a
1318360	1326840	new way of having transformative conversations that not only transform me, but transform even
1326840	1334120	an audience. And, and I think, as Jonathan Peugeot said, hopefully transform what is a fan base,
1334120	1342520	which isn't particularly helpful, but maybe a broader community where they can be, where there
1342520	1348040	can be productive pushback and productive engagement that allows all of us to grow.
1348360	1352120	And, you know, that's what I've seen in a lot of, in a lot of your community and,
1352120	1354360	and the way that you've pursued this work.
1356360	1360920	Yeah. And I'd like to play that clip from Jonathan Peugeot now.
1361800	1365720	You're always aiming at something that's better, or you wouldn't be aiming. You're always moving
1365720	1371000	towards something that's better, or you wouldn't be moving. So then why wouldn't you move towards
1371000	1377800	the greatest good? Yeah. Well, it's because it's terrifying, I suppose in part. But then as, you
1377800	1384600	know, I've tried to put that into practice in my life and it's tearing me into pieces.
1385480	1393480	Yeah. I don't know, though, if, if one of the reasons is because you're also alone.
1395000	1402120	And I, you know, because you, I mean, at least to my understanding, you're not in a, in a, in a
1402120	1407080	community. Well, it's hard to say. I mean, it's hard to say.
1408920	1413800	Because fans are certainly having laughs. Well, they've been a community. I mean,
1413800	1418600	one of the things that has held me together certainly is the commitment that I feel to,
1420440	1427240	to the people who've been so positive towards me and my family. I mean, it was very subtle,
1427240	1437160	but I got the sense in that, that Jonathan was questioning, but the whole fan versus peer dynamic,
1437160	1444120	which I think we can all slip into on this, in this, this, the weird kind of nature of, of the,
1444120	1448280	the business that we're in, if we're making content, and particularly if we're sort of,
1448280	1453160	if that's a big part of our lives or a big part of our business, it's very difficult to,
1453400	1459000	it's very difficult to avoid that dynamic, especially if in some ways you're kind of
1459000	1465080	financially tied up with it as well. But I think this was, yeah, I think that's what Jonathan,
1465080	1468920	I haven't checked that with Jonathan, to be honest, but that was what I made of that
1469560	1475720	interaction was, was a sort of cautionary, wo wo careful fans are not people coming up to you
1475720	1480760	after a lecture, people kind of in your comments threads, they're not the same as, as peers who
1480760	1486440	will challenge your thinking, who will reflect back to you and will help you to kind of develop.
1487000	1490840	And, and that's what was also beautiful about the conversation with John is,
1490840	1495480	as Jordan reflected at the end, he was, he's glad to have those relationships and,
1496120	1501560	and that's what's exciting, potentially about them continuing those conversations and
1501640	1507640	continuing the, the dialogue. I think part of what needs to enter into,
1510280	1514760	into these, into the space that we're, we're sort of creating and exploring
1515640	1521800	is the question of institution, because in a university context, the university is supposed
1521800	1528040	to provide that in a church context, the church is supposed to provide that what we're sort of
1528040	1536600	doing out here in YouTube land does not really provide that. We might have some peer accountability,
1536600	1541640	if I say something that I lose status in the eyes of David Fuller or Rebel Wisdom or John
1541640	1547480	Vervake or Jonathan Peugeot, there might be a little bit of accountability in there, but I think
1548760	1554680	asking deeper questions about structures and institutions would be helpful in
1555640	1564920	creating communities where that afford this over a long period of time. And, and I don't think any
1564920	1572600	of us quite know how to do that, because I don't know that we've necessarily been able to create
1572600	1579560	structures that afford that very well. Can you explain what you think those might look like?
1579800	1588120	I don't know, because again, obviously as a, as a working pastor,
1589560	1595560	churches have some of those dynamics, but all the same, those same issues of audience capture
1596120	1602120	are very true for clergy, because you get captured by your congregation. They pay your salary,
1602120	1605480	and so then clergy, then maybe go to different places.
1607800	1614760	I think what we've seen created, I mean, John Vervake will often talk about
1614760	1619720	this little corner of the internet where we're having conversations with you, with Jonathan
1619720	1628440	Peugeot, with each other. We've got some of that going, but we, you know, and I like what
1628440	1634600	Peugeot said to him when he said, you know, fans are not a church. Okay, well, what, what is this
1634600	1641320	church supposed to do? A church, and this is actually my, churches in the modernist frame have
1641320	1647800	become these little propaganda machines. And I think that is there undoing right now, because for
1647800	1653320	many people, the last place you would go to have an open conversation about you, what you really
1653320	1659080	think, even if it's heterodox, would be a church, because you'll lose status for heterodoxy.
1660920	1666760	Heterodoxy in itself is not necessarily helpful. And I think John's idea of Dia Logos, where you've
1666760	1672360	got, where you've got two people seeking truth, early in the conversation, Jordan Peterson talked
1672360	1680200	about sort of hunting philosophia, which I thought was good. But that's more of what we need. And
1681160	1689320	perhaps what we should think about more are hunting bands where, you know, people, people
1689320	1696680	have practiced ways of collaboration. They know each other's skills. Yet what motivates the hunt
1696680	1703640	for the tribe is the need for food. And I think as you described, what happens to people when they
1703640	1711800	get a very high status, wealthy, successful, they're no longer on the hunt. And there is a certain,
1712920	1720040	you know, Jordan's been back now since January. It's not clear what he's doing, but I fear a
1720040	1727320	certain lostness because he's had a couple of successful books. You know, anybody will talk to
1727960	1734200	him, almost anybody who he wants to will talk to him. Where's the hunt?
1735320	1745160	Well, the hunt is the internal drive towards truth, which I think was what really drew so many of
1745160	1755240	us to him originally. I would say there is an open question. You have to see what are the
1755240	1762360	confounding factors in that. I mean, the whole idea of petus and ink nowadays, I think, is something
1762360	1770120	that do you have the incentive structure still to go for truth, especially when certain things that
1770120	1777560	you say get a certain audience. And it's very difficult not to kind of follow that, even if
1777560	1784760	that's completely unconscious. And then there's various things that you can easily dismiss people
1784760	1790360	who are critical of you as being bad faith or motivated by some other kind of, oh, they're just
1790360	1798040	trying to get views off my name or whatever that might be. And then you start screening out people
1798040	1803480	who might have useful things to reflect back to you. And you see that happen constantly in this
1804360	1810920	landscape. And then you've got the comment sections, you've got, I mean, I find that, and I think also
1810920	1818120	a little bit of self reflection and awareness of like that happens to all of us, probably to
1818120	1825960	rebel wisdom as much as anyone. I can't deny that I'm conscious of the comment section. But at the
1825960	1832520	same time, what I will say is there's a paradox of, I don't think, I think people have still got in
1832520	1838600	their minds this sort of like alternative versus mainstream. What they don't realize is once you've
1838600	1846200	created a little thing around being alternative, that becomes the status quo at that point.
1846760	1851560	So I'll put out films that they'll be like, Oh, that's too consensus or that's too status quo.
1851560	1856280	It's like, not for this ecosystem, it isn't. I know that when I put out certain things,
1856280	1860840	it's going to get a bad reaction from from the comment section. It's like, what's more brave,
1860840	1866360	putting out anti woke stuff that I know is going to go down incredibly well in this little ecosystem
1866920	1871000	that I'm part of, or putting stuff out that's going to challenge that perspective.
1872760	1877720	I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm, I'm have to be aware of my own biases as well. Like,
1878280	1882360	I know there's a lot of people are like, Oh, you, you come from mainstream media,
1882360	1887400	your BBC channel for or whatever, and you're just still part of that. It's like, well,
1887400	1892840	maybe I have some of that. But also, I think there's a lot of values that were held within the
1892840	1897320	tradition of journalism around truth seeking, that maybe a lot of journalism has lost. But I
1897320	1904600	think the alternative media has lost it, never really had it. And that's the key point that I
1904600	1910520	keep coming back to. It's like the incentive structures of the alternative are not conducive
1910520	1918840	to truth seeking at all. The incentive structures of the mainstream are increasingly less conducive
1919560	1924040	to truth seeking as well. But that's why we're in this really terrifying valley,
1924040	1929880	what I've called the uncanny valley between the two. And that's what kind of obsesses me. And I'm
1930440	1937640	fascinated by because we're all like Jordan Peterson. All of us are trying to pursue truth in our own
1937640	1946840	kind of limited way and sense made together. And I think you're that brings back to what
1946840	1953320	you were saying before of like, how do we do this? Because we've seen we can't really do this alone.
1953320	1958840	We've seen so many cautionary tales of people being captured by their audience of being,
1960040	1964600	yeah, basically falling by the wayside, the entire kind of history of the IDW is like
1964600	1969880	one by one falling by the wayside. And as an alternative sense making structure,
1970600	1974920	like that's a terrible cautionary tale. Like these are very, very smart people and they all got
1975240	1979640	captured in one way or another, or most of them got captured in one way or another,
1980520	1984760	or fell out or stopped kind of moving forward or whatever it whatever it is.
1986360	1989160	But yeah, that question of how do we do this and some kind of
1989960	1996360	bands of hunters, like you say, I think is the way to do it is to is to be in relationship with
1996360	2000920	people who are able to challenge us and we're able to kind of develop our kind of sharpener
2001880	2003880	and knives against each other.
2006120	2014360	Part of the irony of the taking down of the mass media culture has been that
2015160	2021880	part of what afforded truth seeking and internal critique, self critique,
2022840	2030600	within that culture was its, well, its establishment, its sense of establishment.
2031480	2036680	I was speaking with an accountant who was a neighbor of mine who used to work for newspapers
2036680	2041160	and he said, you know, in the 70s and 80s, newspapers were enormously profitable.
2041720	2047480	And what that afforded was the New York Times could have, I mean, in a sense, they were so
2047480	2052200	well established, they could have all kinds of self criticism built into it.
2052680	2058280	And I think as you well described, a lot of alternative media is so captured by audience,
2058920	2063000	they can't afford to waver from their, from their dogma.
2063560	2069720	And now we're seeing that in the mass media as well, because they're so hungry, they can't afford.
2069720	2075480	I thought that came quite through, I thought that came through quite well in Peterson's Barry
2075480	2081560	Weiss interview. And so actually with the decline of blue church, we're finding blue church
2081560	2091320	increasingly acting like alternative, let's say, you know, narrowly, you know, narrow agenda
2092520	2099320	organisms. And so again, I think there's, there's both a, a kind of a, a hunger driven,
2099320	2106040	a hunger for the truth driven that has to be willing to say, I don't, I don't care how poor
2106040	2113560	this makes me, I'm that hungry, but then probably also on the other side, where you have structures
2113560	2120360	that say, okay, I can, I can reasonably afford to pursue the truth and I know it will cost me,
2121160	2128760	but I'm, you know, that is what we do. And this kind of corruption, I think you find,
2129400	2135000	I certainly see it in church structures, but now we're seeing it in, as I think Jordan Hall
2135000	2140920	nicely says, blue church structures as well. It's a weird paradox that as the alternative
2141640	2150360	gets stronger, the mainstream is becoming more alternative. Yes. Yeah. I wonder just whether
2150360	2155480	we might go back to, as we sort of taught, as I mentioned, sort of panning for gold, like the
2155480	2163000	gold flex in the, in the conversation. I mean, I was really interested in what they were talking
2163640	2169240	about related to the, they touched on postmodernism, but only very briefly.
2171160	2175640	John was talking about sort of Foucault and Derrida having a little bit more of a complex,
2176200	2180840	it being a slightly more complex picture than is often painted of the, of the postmodernists.
2180840	2184360	And that felt, that felt rich in itself, that could have been a conversation.
2184360	2187800	If the mainstream of Western culture is the mainstream of human culture,
2188760	2192200	or akin to it, so akin to that shamanic tradition, for example,
2192920	2199000	then the claim is that that mainstream is, is the desire for power. And that's the opposite
2199000	2204680	of what we're saying. Genuinely, the opposite. It's the antithesis to that, because that isn't,
2205560	2213720	isn't Philo Nikea, the antithesis to? Yeah, I think it is. Well, I mean, that's part of it.
2214040	2217640	Is it, is it genuinely the antithesis? I mean, so is this, is this a claim of,
2218360	2222680	is this a claim of satanic possession of the West? I mean, is the, is the,
2222680	2228040	is the culture war that deep? Well, I don't know. I mean, the claim is that it's about fundamentals.
2229240	2233720	Right. It's a fundamental critique of Western society. It means fundamental. That's why
2233720	2237800	Derrida went after philogo centric, philogo centrism.
2237800	2242760	Yeah. And I think, and there's in Foucault, it does similar things, but the thing you have,
2242760	2248440	you have to remember is, you know, toward the ends of Derrida's career, right? He's reaching into
2249000	2253000	Neoplatonic mysticism, negative theology is something he starts to take an interest in,
2253000	2258520	and Foucault, you know, you know, technologies of the self. And he gets very deeply interested
2258520	2262600	in the work of Pierre Hadeau, right? And what is ancient philosophy and the wisdom tradition
2262600	2266440	and Philea Sophia? And he starts to turn towards it and starts to recognize it as
2266440	2271320	I know nothing of that. I know nothing of that. Yeah. Well, that's what, so I mean,
2271320	2274360	well, that's, that's very interesting. And then he dies.
2274360	2275960	Yeah. Foucault also.
2275960	2278920	Or Foucault. No, Derrida, we were, sorry, we were speaking of Derrida.
2278920	2281880	I was speaking of both. I said, you see Foucault getting very interested in
2282600	2287960	negative theology, Neoplatonic mysticism. And then you see Foucault getting very interested in,
2287960	2291080	you know, Stoicism and Pierre Hadeau's work.
2292040	2299480	There's an irony in Peterson's work that I thought really came between the Michael Malice and the
2299480	2308200	Barry Weiss. Because on one hand, Peterson has made a name for himself bashing post-modernity.
2309320	2322520	But Peterson is himself post-modern in some deep ways. And a regular critique of Peterson,
2322520	2327720	you had James K. Smith, a professor from Calvin University on your program. And he,
2328440	2333640	you know, this is one of his critiques of Peterson as well. And I, I think,
2335080	2337800	I think the way forward for someone like Peterson.
2339000	2343800	In what, in what way, Paul, in what way is Jordan Peterson post-modern?
2344520	2353080	Modernity is dying. And when, and, and John in that conversation nicely set up the contrast
2353080	2361640	between the three P's, which are much more lived experience, perspectival, procedural.
2361640	2367720	And, and so you've got the one P, which is propositional. And modernity is all about
2368920	2374120	the world of objects, where, where Peterson, when Peterson begins maps of meaning,
2374760	2379560	there are two ways to view the world, a world of objects and a form for action. And so Peterson
2379560	2385160	very much takes the pragmatists through modernity. But within that pragmatism,
2386200	2393880	there is what, what John Vervecchi talks about those three P's. And in this, in this beautiful
2393880	2400520	section, at a point that John Vervecchi makes all often, he says, what is emerging out of cognitive
2400520	2409160	science is a recognition that our ability to grasp something means sort of taking it into
2409240	2415960	ourselves. We grasp the cup and about minute 25 in there, he goes through that. We grasp the cup.
2415960	2421880	In other words, something of the cup has to get into my mind. And so the subject object distinction
2422600	2431800	is being broken down by cognitive science. And that is, that is something within post-modernity
2431800	2437560	that they in fact have been working at. Because within post-modernity, there's a critique of
2437560	2446520	that subject object. We are, we are disinterested viewers from above who see the world as it is.
2447080	2455720	And cognitive science is saying, that's not how we know the world at all. And, and Peterson
2456920	2466440	with his sort of ancient modern approach has always sort of flexed in that direction and asked
2467160	2477880	questions that make rigid modernists like Sam Harris uncomfortable. And so when you look at,
2477880	2485160	you know, Peterson drew such a strange breadth of fans, some of them, you know,
2486600	2491400	as, as John Vervecchi said in that interview, people do not appreciate how radical
2491400	2500120	Jonathan Peugeot is. And he's so radical because he's so ancient. And that ancient modern has been
2500120	2508840	attention in church circles now for the last 20 years as modernity is receding. And as there is a
2508840	2518040	recognition that proposition as such is always necessary. It's deeply embedded in the scientific
2518040	2527720	effort, but is insufficient for human beings to actually move forward and increasingly is
2527720	2533000	an insufficient descriptor. And this deeply critiques Protestantism, which is of course,
2533000	2539000	I'm a Protestant minister, deeply critiques the ways that we have framed communities.
2539960	2548360	So that has always been in Peterson and John is in some ways pushing him on that and saying,
2549400	2554840	okay, what does that mean as a scientist? Because Peterson has always, if you listen to
2554840	2560680	Peterson and Barry Weiss, they're lamenting the loss of blue church, you know, whoa,
2560680	2566840	blue church has fallen. And well, that's, Jordan's been pushing it.
2567160	2573320	Yeah, you can argue he's probably one of the primary factors in the loss of
2574120	2578680	faith that so many people had in blue church, meaning the sort of media establishment.
2579560	2587320	I think he he certainly and potentially quite deliberately embarked on a on his
2588360	2593800	mission to show up or or one of the one of the effects was to show up all of the limitations
2593800	2603720	of that structure. Yeah, but I think yeah, I like that idea. And I think you're right that kind of
2604360	2611880	the contrast and conflict between him and Sam Harris is very much Sam Harris from from Will
2611880	2620040	Barry in terms is orange, modern, completely modern, rationality rules. And in a way,
2620840	2627240	Peterson probably is postmodern relative to that, because he's
2628840	2635160	but arguably he's also, I mean, he's not, you could argue he's metamodern, I don't know if you
2635160	2640520	know those distinctions. So the idea in integral theory is that you've got modernism science,
2641160	2647880	which is the structure, then postmodernism was effectively a kind of deconstructive force around
2647880	2654040	that, which is obviously something Peterson plays himself against. But in a way,
2654840	2663000	Peterson is postmodern in his critique of modernism, but he's reconstituting it. So in a way, you
2663000	2671240	probably would put him integral or or, yeah, integral or metamodern, I mean, there's different
2671240	2678200	words for it. But effectively, it's the word for a perspective that can observe and understand
2678200	2684840	the other perspective that understands what postmodernism is. It understands what modernism is.
2684840	2688200	Because within those worldviews, they can't actually understand the critiques, they can't
2688200	2694440	understand the the other worldviews. Whereas the the the idea is that there's an integral worldview
2694440	2699320	that can actually understand all of these different perspectives. And I'd say that's where I probably
2699320	2707640	place Peterson within that. But his critiques are are the same as yeah, his critiques of science
2707640	2714440	scientism and materialism are very similar to a lot of the postmodern critiques. That's interesting.
2715240	2722680	And I just and Peterson partly gets there because of his Darwinian truth. And that's,
2722760	2726120	I mean, when he showed up in the in the Christian sphere,
2727400	2737320	he basically uses Darwin to give an account for the credibility of, let's call it ancient wisdom,
2737320	2747800	because if the wisdom has survived this long, that is a tell for truth. But modernity arose
2747800	2757960	in the frustration with the letdown of certain forms of ancient wisdom. And, you know, I don't
2757960	2763560	know very much about, you know, I've listened to some of your content about integral theory. But
2764840	2771480	I think with each passing, there's always in the initial stages of passing, there's always
2771480	2779560	throwing too much away. And then after sort of the the tragedy of the revolution,
2780440	2785880	those who are a little bit beyond it say, all right, well, what of modernity should we keep?
2786440	2792840	And what of modernity was unhelpful? And that's successive over all of the various patterns
2792840	2800920	that went before. And Peterson, I think part of what he has shown is he has that capacity
2801960	2807320	but and again, to come back to Dia Logos, the I think the questions are
2808920	2816600	what kinds of conversation partners, what kinds of needs are going to help him to
2817640	2825000	fulfill that potential that I think that potential is I think what a lot of us saw in him and say,
2825080	2832840	there's real potential there for breakthroughs beyond some of the siloed structures. And again,
2832840	2840840	it's someone in the church, a tremendous weakness of the church has been its siloed nature. It either
2840840	2849080	has borders that are too thin, where it's always just me to me to me to behind any new, you know,
2849080	2856280	progressive cause or it's so rigid that, you know, we're just going to try to outlast the world,
2856280	2861320	but that isn't working. So and Peterson showed, I think, potential for
2862120	2865720	affording some breakthroughs with a lot of these boundary issues.
2868200	2874760	Yeah, this feels very, you know, very narratively right to kind of finish maybe on this on this
2874760	2882600	point. And I agree that the idea that who are the dialogue partners that he maybe needs to engage
2882600	2887640	in to recapture that sense of exploration. I think John is definitely one. And I think
2888520	2893800	pretty much all the people who John has been in dialogue with over the last two years,
2893800	2898440	like all of those, there's some fascinating conversations with people like Bernardo Castro
2898440	2906520	and Jonathan Pageau and others exploring and getting into the stream of thought,
2906520	2911000	like jumping into the stream of thought and swimming together, this sort of sense of
2911560	2915880	rather than coming from a fixed position, a sort of more malleable position where you're in dialogue
2915880	2922120	with others and evolving your thinking. I also would like if people are watching this and they're
2922120	2927320	not familiar with John Bovaki's work, I wanted to reference some of the films that I think would
2927320	2932760	help kind of frame him in a better way than happened in that conversation maybe. We put out
2932760	2938200	a few interviews with him, one called Flow States and Wisdom, another one after the
2938200	2943960	Meaning Crisis, which is where he kind of frames his new Deologos project. And another great dialogue
2943960	2949720	between John and Peter Limburg called the Evolving Conversation. I want to put up the title cards
2949720	2954760	from those on over the video and people can kind of find them in the show notes below. And also,
2955720	2963880	maybe just touch on we've been trying to kind of like how come I trained as a counselor,
2963880	2967880	but that's my background and I trained in a form of Deologos called Inquiry,
2967880	2972840	which is really in dialogue with another person trying to get to the edge of our understanding,
2972840	2977720	trying to articulate what's going on in the relational field between us and to take ourselves
2977720	2982840	somewhere new in that kind of exploration. And we've tried to do that as well with the courses
2982920	2988280	that we're running as well, with John Bovaki as one of the guest faculty on our Sense Making 101
2988280	2993240	course. I'd like to give a little plug for that. If you enjoyed the conversation with John or you
2993240	2999960	want to learn more, check out that course because that's part of the answer for me is like I don't
2999960	3005160	think we can do this without becoming different kind of, as you said before, without allowing
3005160	3012120	ourselves to be transformed. And that's really what we've been trying to do, like how can we do,
3012120	3019160	it's why we've had such a focus on practice and such a focus on events and
3021240	3026920	sessions that try and work with some of these technologies. And I also point people towards
3026920	3033560	other really amazing technologies like circling, like Inquiry, all of the empathy circles,
3033560	3037480	glass bead games, some of these other kind of technologies, because I think,
3038440	3042120	and then that links back to what we were saying before about John's
3042840	3048600	4p cognitive science, the propositional is not enough. The propositional is one aspect,
3048600	3055640	but the procedural, the perspectival and the participatory is absolutely crucial. And yeah,
3055640	3062120	I think that's hopefully what we're all trying to kind of bring more in our own ways.
3062120	3071400	And from, I mean, from the church side of things, I mean, churches have part of that
3071400	3077560	conversation that I thought was very interesting was when they, when John was talking about grasping
3077560	3086600	the cup, you have a sense that you can look at the light, or you can see through the light. And
3086600	3093240	they're both valid perspectives. But there needs to be a transformation that occurs, obviously,
3093240	3097880	in Christian tradition, you know, we've got a lot of words for this, this is conversion, this is
3097880	3104840	quickening, this is, and, and, and you need to do that in order to know, it isn't the question,
3104840	3109160	as in a modern sense, where you sit above it, and you, you look at all the pieces and you
3109160	3117720	take an analysis, you actually have to step into it in order to know. And, and that's sort of
3117720	3127160	connects, I think, the knowing and loving. Because in, you do not know unless you love,
3128280	3135960	and, and in some ways, you cannot love unless you know at least something. So, I mean, that,
3136040	3142440	at least for a Christian minister, that's always a part of, of my work and, and always the, the
3142440	3148680	question of continuing to reform institutions. Always a pleasure, Paul. And I really like
3148680	3155480	your new setup. You're looking very professional. Well, thank you, David. I am, I don't try too
3155480	3162600	hard at that, but I appreciate it. Awesome. Our ability to make sense of the world is breaking
3162600	3168200	down. We're making more and more consequential choices with worse and worse sense making to
3168200	3174760	inform those choices, which is kind of running increasingly fast through the woods, increasingly
3174760	3179880	blind. Over the last two years, Rebel Wisdom has interviewed some of the world's top thinkers.
3180600	3187880	Now we've brought them together for an eight week online course, Sense Making 101, with Daniel
3187880	3195880	Schmacktenburger, Diane Musho-Hamilton, John Vivecchi, Doshin Roshi, and more. Improve your
3195880	3205160	sense making, develop your sovereignty, and join a wider community looking to do the same.
