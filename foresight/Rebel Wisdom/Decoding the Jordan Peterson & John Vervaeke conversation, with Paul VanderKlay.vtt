WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
So this is a film about the recent conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Bovakie and

00:10.480 --> 00:14.560
for it I'm joined by Paul van der Klee, how are you doing Paul?

00:14.560 --> 00:17.160
I'm doing well, it's great to be here.

00:17.160 --> 00:23.040
Awesome, yeah and I'm really glad to have you here to kind of make sense of what happened

00:23.040 --> 00:27.280
because it's a conversation that we and a lot of other people were really really looking

00:27.280 --> 00:29.920
forward to.

00:29.920 --> 00:36.040
Real anticipation seeing Jordan and John together and I think there was a real split in reaction

00:36.040 --> 00:40.240
to it between people going what was that?

00:40.240 --> 00:46.120
If you look at the comments section below it I've never seen so many people respond negatively

00:46.120 --> 00:52.840
to Jordan's interruptions of John, I'd say that's the main sort of theme of the comments

00:52.840 --> 01:01.480
which is extraordinary in itself but also that there's a lot of, I kind of like it like

01:01.480 --> 01:05.920
panning for gold because there are a lot of golden nuggets within the conversation but

01:05.920 --> 01:13.920
it's quite difficult to access them, it didn't flow very well and I think it's a really interesting,

01:13.920 --> 01:18.800
I think shining a light on what actually happened and maybe what the backstory was could give

01:18.800 --> 01:21.520
a lot of help to people to make sense of it.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.920
All of the difference in perspectives between John and Jordan, what was really going on

01:26.920 --> 01:31.520
and I'm going to sort of just do a quick little bit of framing first Paul before we get into

01:31.520 --> 01:36.240
kind of your reaction to it and what we made of it when we first saw it but if people are

01:36.240 --> 01:40.920
not familiar with John's work, maybe they're very familiar with Jordan but not so familiar

01:40.920 --> 01:48.440
with John, so John Vaveke is worked alongside Jordan in the psychology department at the

01:48.440 --> 01:55.320
University of Toronto, they both have deep interests in kind of the area of myth, religion,

01:55.320 --> 02:01.200
the deep story of Western culture, John had this series Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

02:01.200 --> 02:07.640
50 episodes that he brought out probably in the wake of Jordan's kind of appearance on

02:07.640 --> 02:14.080
the stage as a kind of, it probably prompted a little bit by that and John has had a huge

02:14.120 --> 02:18.920
amount of really interesting conversations over the last couple of years with people

02:18.920 --> 02:24.160
yourself, Jonathan Pageau, many of the people in the same kind of orbit around these sort

02:24.160 --> 02:33.440
of central questions of meaning, questions of meaning, questions of the deep stories

02:33.440 --> 02:39.720
that drive us all of the same topics that Jordan is really interested in.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.320
I was fascinated by the clickbait title that Jordan chose for the video, a conversation

02:45.320 --> 02:52.120
so intense it might be psychedelic which is interesting as well, this feels like a really

02:52.120 --> 03:00.320
significant coming together of perspectives that we've been waiting and wanting to see.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.640
I'd like to start by saying they had a real enthusiasm for each other and a real, I'm

03:05.720 --> 03:09.480
going to play a little clip now that came up at the end like the real enthusiasm and warmth

03:09.480 --> 03:10.760
between the two of them.

03:10.760 --> 03:18.520
Being a great proponent of yours, I mean that in the sense of noting the greatness that's

03:18.520 --> 03:23.560
in you and seeing how it's manifested itself, especially in your relationship with your

03:23.560 --> 03:28.360
students and noticing that and having admiration and respect for that.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.520
And I respect your work and I disagree with it in parts but we've always been able to do that

03:34.600 --> 03:38.360
in a way that is born with affection and respect.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.920
Well God, it's always nice to find someone who disagrees with your work who could help correct it.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.440
Exactly, seeing the other guys.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.560
I mean thank God man, that's why I want to talk to you, I don't like being wrong

03:48.600 --> 03:52.840
so and I know you don't and so no doubt we're still both pretty wrong.

03:53.960 --> 03:59.160
Mostly so, if the history of science is something we should pay attention to which we should.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.800
Yes, or the history of our own life for that matter.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.360
And I know Paul, you've put out a couple of reaction videos to this and you've sort of been

04:06.920 --> 04:09.080
wrestling a little bit with what happened.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.640
Maybe you could start by framing what you were hoping for from the conversation and what your

04:13.640 --> 04:16.440
reaction has been to it so far.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.360
I too was very much looking forward to this conversation.

04:20.360 --> 04:29.160
I know, I know John's work fairly well at least in these areas and I know he's got some critiques

04:29.160 --> 04:38.600
of Jordan's approach to meaning through narrative, through hero mythology and I was really anticipating

04:38.600 --> 04:45.400
those two working through some of those kinds of issues and they never got there.

04:46.040 --> 04:51.800
I, my reaction like many other peoples was what was that?

04:51.800 --> 04:55.080
I had never heard Jordan like that before.

04:55.960 --> 05:03.640
I was amazed at how well John Vervecchi sort of rolled with all of the redirections

05:03.640 --> 05:05.080
that happened in the conversation.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.680
You fundamentally understand God by saying what God is not

05:09.320 --> 05:11.320
but not of course randomly, right?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.240
What you're trying to do is-

05:13.240 --> 05:15.480
Oh, that's sort of like the God of the gaps.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.360
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.000
Oh, sorry.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.960
No, no, that's- don't apologize, we're friends talking.

05:21.960 --> 05:28.760
Well, I don't I don't want to derail the conversation. So it's been it's been like

05:28.760 --> 05:33.000
this and it's been wonderful. It feels to me like doing Petrie behind that conversation,

05:33.000 --> 05:38.080
especially on Jordan's side. I think part of it is he, you know, he and John Revekey

05:38.080 --> 05:46.160
last spoke in 2015. John Revekey has continued his academic trajectory. And I think with

05:46.160 --> 05:51.520
his YouTube channel and all of these conversations with him sort of discovered a whole new pathway

05:52.000 --> 06:00.840
where Jordan has been busy with his health, the culture war stuff. So I saw I'm I'm seeing this

06:00.840 --> 06:08.280
much more as a video where Jordan is to a degree getting introduced for the first time with what

06:08.280 --> 06:15.240
John has been doing for the last five years. Yeah, and that was my sense as well was that John

06:15.360 --> 06:22.040
was, John is so enthusiastic anyway. Like he's he brought that enthusiasm to the conversation.

06:22.040 --> 06:28.200
And Jordan, I think, got him got kind of swept up in that to some degree as well. And it was kind

06:28.200 --> 06:33.240
of John reporting back to Jordan, like, look what you've been missing, or look what's been going

06:33.240 --> 06:38.040
on. Look at all this interesting stuff that's been happening. But I want to start by pointing

06:38.040 --> 06:44.280
like the central paradox of the conversation is that John's central interest is in Deologos,

06:44.600 --> 06:49.400
which is kind of a shared dialogue that goes somewhere new. And he kind of summarized it in

06:49.400 --> 06:57.480
there with talking about Phylius Sophia versus Phylius Nicaea. Phylius Nicaea meaning the love of

06:57.480 --> 07:02.520
victory. Phylius Sophia meaning the love of knowledge. We haven't talked about why people

07:02.520 --> 07:08.200
want us to talk. And the reason they want us to talk is because our ideas dovetail to a substantial

07:08.200 --> 07:12.840
degree and also diverge interestingly. And so I guess they want us to talk so that we can think.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.160
Well, that's it. And I see that's what I was going to say. That's one of the defining. I would

07:17.160 --> 07:23.000
say one of the defining. It certainly seems to be the case as a defining criteria for Socrates,

07:23.000 --> 07:29.240
that if you and I can get to places in the Deologos that we couldn't get to individually,

07:29.240 --> 07:35.880
then real Deologos has has come into existence. And that's Phylius Sophia, the love of wisdom,

07:35.880 --> 07:41.400
as opposed to Phylius Nicaea, the love of victory. And so right, right, right. I didn't know those

07:41.400 --> 07:49.400
phrases. Phylius Sophia, which is the Phylius Sophia. Wisdom is the feminine essence of God.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.680
Yeah. Well, the Phylius is, you know, it's itself a collaborative love.

07:55.480 --> 08:05.240
Did you say Phylius? Yeah. Phylius and Phylius. Phylius Sophia. So Phylius Sophia. The three

08:05.240 --> 08:12.120
loves, the Aros Phylius Agape. This is Phylius. And Phylius is the love that is expressed and

08:12.120 --> 08:16.840
shared in community. And then Sophia, of course, is the word for wisdom. That's where we get

08:16.840 --> 08:22.520
philosophy from. Phylius Nicaea is the love of victory, like Nike victory.

08:23.080 --> 08:28.760
Right. And yeah, it's interesting because the, tell me what you think of this. I think the YouTube

08:28.760 --> 08:34.920
dialogues that we undertake are characterized by Phylius Sophia. And the YouTube dialogues

08:34.920 --> 08:43.800
conducted in the main by the, what would you call it, legacy media are Phyla, Phylius Nicaea.

08:43.800 --> 08:50.680
Phylius Nicaea. And I think people appreciate Phylius Sophia much better. You better believe

08:50.680 --> 08:54.840
it. I certainly appreciate it much better. For John, this is, and he studied it a lot as a

08:54.840 --> 08:59.320
cognitive scientist. It's how can you have a conversation that goes somewhere new that builds

08:59.320 --> 09:04.520
upon itself, that is not about trying to best the other person or just kind of repeat what you

09:04.520 --> 09:10.200
already know. But how can you have a dialogue where you discover new territory together? And I

09:10.200 --> 09:16.440
think the interesting thing for me is given that that was the subject of their talk, the question

09:16.440 --> 09:23.480
is how much they achieved that in that conversation. And I mean, if you go by the YouTube comments,

09:23.560 --> 09:30.680
you probably say that they didn't achieve it very much. And it goes to the heart, I think of

09:31.560 --> 09:36.360
what I consider like the trajectory of Jordan Peterson over the last, since his kind of eruption

09:36.360 --> 09:45.080
onto the stage, the whole Peterson phenomenon of 2018 onwards, that sense of novelty and whether,

09:47.400 --> 09:52.760
like my overall sense of him getting slightly stuck in his story, which I'll come to a little bit

09:53.640 --> 09:58.680
in a bit. But there was this weird, almost performative contradiction, given the topic that

09:59.400 --> 10:04.360
John has made this kind of lifetime study of, of what does it mean to get that into a flow state

10:04.360 --> 10:07.640
together? What does it mean to explore new territory together? What does it mean to

10:08.440 --> 10:15.000
actually know the cognitive science of what is going on physiologically when we're in this kind

10:15.000 --> 10:23.080
of flow state of exploration? And I like my overall sense is that I would love to see,

10:24.280 --> 10:27.400
and this is not judgmental, because Jordan is obviously coming back from a huge

10:28.440 --> 10:34.120
number of difficulties, the health problems, and it's kind of certainly not up to full strength.

10:34.120 --> 10:42.680
But to the hope is that in time, we might see Jordan enter more into those kind of conversations.

10:42.760 --> 10:47.240
But I felt that it was, there were elements, there were moments of that in this conversation

10:47.240 --> 10:52.600
with John, but it was very glitchy. Like there wasn't so much of a sense of a shared

10:54.040 --> 10:59.320
edifice that they were both building together. There was a sort of, I think there were moments

10:59.320 --> 11:05.000
of that, but it also just felt, I think glitchy is probably the best word that I can think of.

11:05.960 --> 11:15.000
I agree. In some ways, I contrast this with Jordan's first talk with Sam Harris with Brett

11:15.000 --> 11:22.040
Weinstein there. In that first talk in Vancouver, Jordan was very clearly trying to build something,

11:22.600 --> 11:29.320
and Sam wasn't playing. Sam sort of played this knock it down game, and Jordan kept trying to

11:29.320 --> 11:35.240
construct something. Sam kept trying to knock things down. In this conversation, I don't think

11:35.240 --> 11:44.360
Jordan was trying to knock things down. I think he was, I hear in many places in the video,

11:44.360 --> 11:53.400
he's trying to grasp, to assimilate, to figure out where John is at. And so he's doing a lot of

11:53.480 --> 12:00.760
attempts at recognition, attempts at connection, but usually what you get with that hopefully

12:00.760 --> 12:07.400
is a weaving together of things. Whereas there, it was sort of two tracks. John would mention

12:07.400 --> 12:10.840
something, and Jordan would connect it with something, and John would go a little further,

12:10.840 --> 12:15.800
and Jordan would connect it to something else. John was very gracious in sort of developing

12:15.800 --> 12:21.240
that connection a little bit, but then John continued to want to get back to

12:22.680 --> 12:26.840
something a little bit more consistent. And I think actually through the video,

12:28.040 --> 12:35.640
John was able to make some impact, at least in terms of John's four Ps of knowledge, expanding

12:35.640 --> 12:44.040
beyond the propositional into the perspectival participatory. And I think that was helpful.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.920
And at the end of the video, I think they achieved some of that.

12:48.120 --> 12:53.160
Yeah, and I'd love to maybe go into with you sort of sifting some of those

12:53.880 --> 12:59.880
flecks of gold from the interview in a second. I just thought I'd, my overall sense about this

12:59.880 --> 13:05.320
sense of Deologos, this sense of going somewhere new in a conversation, I'd like to just sort of

13:05.320 --> 13:11.720
drill into that because my sense of what, when I first discovered Jordan Peterson in 2017,

13:11.720 --> 13:19.160
watching his lectures was, there was this real sense of exploration, like he was going on a

13:19.160 --> 13:24.200
journey, you could sort of see him in the Maps of Meaning series in 2017. It was not a dialogue,

13:24.200 --> 13:29.240
but it kind of was. You saw him, he'd find one of his students who was listening and he'd speak to

13:29.240 --> 13:34.760
them, and he'd respond to kind of the mood in the room. And you got this sense of there was a lot

13:34.760 --> 13:39.800
and aliveness to his exploration. It was like he was walking in a landscape and putting things

13:39.800 --> 13:44.360
together as he was walking. And I think that was part of what was really compelling about

13:44.360 --> 13:53.240
him in that sense. And then I think when he first came to attention in 2018, he had a series of

13:53.240 --> 13:57.720
conversations with people that also felt like they had that kind of sense of exploration.

13:58.840 --> 14:06.360
And then we saw him go on this book tour where he was pretty much with differences, like not

14:06.360 --> 14:13.240
every evening was the same, but he was doing the same story pretty much every night. And my sense

14:13.240 --> 14:19.320
is that over time he got more and more trapped in that story, that he wasn't really on that sense of

14:19.320 --> 14:24.600
exploration or on that sense of kind of novelty anymore. And I think that, I mean, people that I

14:24.600 --> 14:29.000
know who knew him at the time also said they found him sort of, he got a little bit more stuck and

14:29.000 --> 14:34.680
a little bit more reactive. And one of the amazing things that I think a lot of us really respect

14:34.680 --> 14:42.600
about him is he also reflected on that himself. I remember a question that he answered in an AMA

14:42.600 --> 14:47.000
a while ago that I'll probably play the clip from here. He talked about the corruption of his soul

14:47.000 --> 14:50.440
that he recognized and the way that he was responding to journalists, for example.

14:51.400 --> 14:57.400
The problem is I'm becoming too much on guard. And I've noticed a developing sense of impatience

14:58.360 --> 15:04.280
within me and some suspicion. And that's not good. I don't want to be in situations where

15:04.280 --> 15:10.040
those are my fundamental orientations. It's a sign of a certain amount of internal corruption on my

15:10.040 --> 15:17.880
part. And I want to be in situations where I'm speaking with people, speaking honestly to people

15:17.880 --> 15:22.840
who are honestly listening. And this is what I felt coming through quite a bit in the conversation

15:22.920 --> 15:29.160
with John. It came in and came out this sense of John would say something that sparked a story

15:29.160 --> 15:34.760
that Jordan already knew. And he'd start kind of telling that story. And I've seen that quite a

15:34.760 --> 15:41.880
lot in some of his interviews since he's come back. And it reminds me as a journalist, whenever I

15:41.880 --> 15:49.480
interview someone usually quite prominent, who's been interviewed a lot in the past, you know that

15:49.480 --> 15:54.360
if you ask them certain questions, they're going to give you a story. And it's almost impossible to

15:54.360 --> 15:59.800
get them out of that once they start. The more the more famous someone is, the more used to

15:59.800 --> 16:05.000
they are to telling that story. It's like, okay, here comes the story about this. I won't name any

16:05.000 --> 16:09.640
names. But it's happened quite a lot. And part of your job as a journalist, like how can I get them

16:09.640 --> 16:14.760
out of those tram tracks and into new territory? And sometimes it's very, very difficult because

16:14.760 --> 16:20.840
anything you say, they'll just go into the story they already know. And I've had the sense sometimes

16:20.840 --> 16:25.240
with Jordan in the conversations he had since he's got back, a guest will say something, and then

16:25.240 --> 16:30.280
it's like, okay, now it's the Cain and Abel story. Now it's the Tower of Abel story. And it's like,

16:30.280 --> 16:35.320
as the audience, we've already heard all of those things. And there's something in that. It's like,

16:35.320 --> 16:38.760
it's the, when you go and see a band, and it's like, well, play the hits, you already know,

16:38.760 --> 16:45.080
there's a little bit of that. But that was, I felt that coming up quite a bit in the John

16:45.080 --> 16:49.160
conversation that John would say something, and then Jordan would kind of go into something that

16:49.160 --> 16:54.760
we were already familiar with. And that's also how I, having tracked the whole kind of intellectual

16:54.760 --> 16:59.160
dark web conversation, that's where that kind of glitched out as well for me was this sense of,

17:00.280 --> 17:05.640
for various tribal reasons, for various kind of aligned incentive reasons for various

17:06.600 --> 17:12.920
that that sense of exploration and novelty that I felt in 2018 2019 just fell away.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.520
Audience capture being another issue, like all of these different things start to start to just,

17:18.520 --> 17:23.560
and I think because of the nature of the media environment we're in at the moment, it literally

17:23.560 --> 17:31.080
warps around you. You don't, you start to kind of tune out anyone who doesn't have a positive,

17:31.080 --> 17:34.680
you've got an infinite amount of feedback. So you only start listening to the supportive stuff,

17:34.760 --> 17:40.120
you start kind of just producing stuff for the your traditional audience. Some things become

17:40.120 --> 17:45.080
profitable, admitting you're wrong about certain things is not profitable. All of those kind of

17:45.080 --> 17:49.880
factors start to come in as well. But that's why I think this is such a fascinating conversation to

17:49.880 --> 17:57.160
analyze, because the topic at hand, Deologos emergent alive dialogue is the thing I think

17:58.840 --> 18:02.760
that we that we were attracted to originally. And I think it's also the thing that could

18:02.760 --> 18:12.040
that will that could potentially be Jordan's healing as well in some ways. Like I think that's

18:12.040 --> 18:17.480
what he needs that sense of like pursuing truth in an original in an interesting and in an

18:17.480 --> 18:22.840
unscripted way again. I think that would that's the sort of the juice in some ways.

18:23.720 --> 18:28.920
The description on the video, I initially I was quite surprised the video was released at all

18:29.560 --> 18:36.760
because of the strangeness of it. And I think that was known because of the strange psychedelic

18:36.760 --> 18:45.320
reference in the title. My take on this increasingly is is more shamanic. And I think what you

18:45.320 --> 18:56.360
described is is what Jordan needs in that something needs to disrupt his sense making.

18:56.360 --> 19:03.480
We need to see in him a hunger again for something other than a lot of the political

19:03.480 --> 19:11.080
or social transformations he's been talking about. And and I think you're right that the irony of the

19:11.080 --> 19:19.560
video is that this is about Deologos. And that is what we were looking for from it. And that is,

19:19.560 --> 19:26.760
I think in many ways what Jordan needs. Now, I'm fully aware that as a Christian minister using

19:26.760 --> 19:36.520
the word shamanic will raise a lot of eyebrows among Christians. But as a as a working preacher

19:36.520 --> 19:46.440
and minister, that is exactly the way the Bible works in a preacher's soul. Because the Bible

19:46.440 --> 19:52.760
is a very strange book. And especially the teachings of Jesus, they're supposed to disrupt.

19:52.760 --> 19:57.240
And if you read the sermon on the mount, after 2000 years, nobody's really quite sure what that

19:57.240 --> 20:03.640
sermon means. And in that sense, it's rather shamanic in that it's supposed to break up our sense

20:03.640 --> 20:13.000
making. So I think I think a number of us are looking for that for Jordan and from Jordan,

20:13.000 --> 20:19.720
because with, you know, what I often call his first wave, I think that's what propelled him.

20:19.720 --> 20:27.000
When he came onto the scene, we heard something in that moment that broke up sort of the,

20:27.720 --> 20:35.720
the stage sense making and said, Oh, here's some fresh insight. Now, whether Jordan has that in

20:35.720 --> 20:42.360
him or not, I've spoken to a number of his undergraduate and graduate students who some

20:42.360 --> 20:50.840
of whom say things like he, your first, your first impression, your first for your first take

20:50.840 --> 20:57.320
for Jordan for a while is very, is very much that way. But then you, once you've heard about,

20:57.320 --> 21:04.600
you know, the rats and the wolves, and then he sort of, then, okay, this is all map territory,

21:04.600 --> 21:10.840
and you move on. And so I agree very much that I think if Jordan is going to

21:12.840 --> 21:20.120
really content to find, to be able to make the kinds of contribution we saw in 2017, 2018,

21:21.000 --> 21:26.760
he's going to need different conversation partners. And I don't know that the current

21:28.040 --> 21:34.280
conversations he's doing, which have many of which are sort of book interviews, but they're

21:34.280 --> 21:41.640
not really interviews. In other words, he's, I, in some ways, I, I see him trying to get at Dea

21:41.640 --> 21:48.920
Logos. And here, John Vervake actually has in a very, you know, serious way, he's been studying it.

21:49.480 --> 21:58.360
And so I would love to see Jordan sort of come to John and say, help me, John, you know, find a

21:58.360 --> 22:06.840
new way of having transformative conversations that not only transform me, but transform even

22:06.840 --> 22:14.120
an audience. And, and I think, as Jonathan Peugeot said, hopefully transform what is a fan base,

22:14.120 --> 22:22.520
which isn't particularly helpful, but maybe a broader community where they can be, where there

22:22.520 --> 22:28.040
can be productive pushback and productive engagement that allows all of us to grow.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.120
And, you know, that's what I've seen in a lot of, in a lot of your community and,

22:32.120 --> 22:34.360
and the way that you've pursued this work.

22:36.360 --> 22:40.920
Yeah. And I'd like to play that clip from Jonathan Peugeot now.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.720
You're always aiming at something that's better, or you wouldn't be aiming. You're always moving

22:45.720 --> 22:51.000
towards something that's better, or you wouldn't be moving. So then why wouldn't you move towards

22:51.000 --> 22:57.800
the greatest good? Yeah. Well, it's because it's terrifying, I suppose in part. But then as, you

22:57.800 --> 23:04.600
know, I've tried to put that into practice in my life and it's tearing me into pieces.

23:05.480 --> 23:13.480
Yeah. I don't know, though, if, if one of the reasons is because you're also alone.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.120
And I, you know, because you, I mean, at least to my understanding, you're not in a, in a, in a

23:22.120 --> 23:27.080
community. Well, it's hard to say. I mean, it's hard to say.

23:28.920 --> 23:33.800
Because fans are certainly having laughs. Well, they've been a community. I mean,

23:33.800 --> 23:38.600
one of the things that has held me together certainly is the commitment that I feel to,

23:40.440 --> 23:47.240
to the people who've been so positive towards me and my family. I mean, it was very subtle,

23:47.240 --> 23:57.160
but I got the sense in that, that Jonathan was questioning, but the whole fan versus peer dynamic,

23:57.160 --> 24:04.120
which I think we can all slip into on this, in this, this, the weird kind of nature of, of the,

24:04.120 --> 24:08.280
the business that we're in, if we're making content, and particularly if we're sort of,

24:08.280 --> 24:13.160
if that's a big part of our lives or a big part of our business, it's very difficult to,

24:13.400 --> 24:19.000
it's very difficult to avoid that dynamic, especially if in some ways you're kind of

24:19.000 --> 24:25.080
financially tied up with it as well. But I think this was, yeah, I think that's what Jonathan,

24:25.080 --> 24:28.920
I haven't checked that with Jonathan, to be honest, but that was what I made of that

24:29.560 --> 24:35.720
interaction was, was a sort of cautionary, wo wo careful fans are not people coming up to you

24:35.720 --> 24:40.760
after a lecture, people kind of in your comments threads, they're not the same as, as peers who

24:40.760 --> 24:46.440
will challenge your thinking, who will reflect back to you and will help you to kind of develop.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.840
And, and that's what was also beautiful about the conversation with John is,

24:50.840 --> 24:55.480
as Jordan reflected at the end, he was, he's glad to have those relationships and,

24:56.120 --> 25:01.560
and that's what's exciting, potentially about them continuing those conversations and

25:01.640 --> 25:07.640
continuing the, the dialogue. I think part of what needs to enter into,

25:10.280 --> 25:14.760
into these, into the space that we're, we're sort of creating and exploring

25:15.640 --> 25:21.800
is the question of institution, because in a university context, the university is supposed

25:21.800 --> 25:28.040
to provide that in a church context, the church is supposed to provide that what we're sort of

25:28.040 --> 25:36.600
doing out here in YouTube land does not really provide that. We might have some peer accountability,

25:36.600 --> 25:41.640
if I say something that I lose status in the eyes of David Fuller or Rebel Wisdom or John

25:41.640 --> 25:47.480
Vervake or Jonathan Peugeot, there might be a little bit of accountability in there, but I think

25:48.760 --> 25:54.680
asking deeper questions about structures and institutions would be helpful in

25:55.640 --> 26:04.920
creating communities where that afford this over a long period of time. And, and I don't think any

26:04.920 --> 26:12.600
of us quite know how to do that, because I don't know that we've necessarily been able to create

26:12.600 --> 26:19.560
structures that afford that very well. Can you explain what you think those might look like?

26:19.800 --> 26:28.120
I don't know, because again, obviously as a, as a working pastor,

26:29.560 --> 26:35.560
churches have some of those dynamics, but all the same, those same issues of audience capture

26:36.120 --> 26:42.120
are very true for clergy, because you get captured by your congregation. They pay your salary,

26:42.120 --> 26:45.480
and so then clergy, then maybe go to different places.

26:47.800 --> 26:54.760
I think what we've seen created, I mean, John Vervake will often talk about

26:54.760 --> 26:59.720
this little corner of the internet where we're having conversations with you, with Jonathan

26:59.720 --> 27:08.440
Peugeot, with each other. We've got some of that going, but we, you know, and I like what

27:08.440 --> 27:14.600
Peugeot said to him when he said, you know, fans are not a church. Okay, well, what, what is this

27:14.600 --> 27:21.320
church supposed to do? A church, and this is actually my, churches in the modernist frame have

27:21.320 --> 27:27.800
become these little propaganda machines. And I think that is there undoing right now, because for

27:27.800 --> 27:33.320
many people, the last place you would go to have an open conversation about you, what you really

27:33.320 --> 27:39.080
think, even if it's heterodox, would be a church, because you'll lose status for heterodoxy.

27:40.920 --> 27:46.760
Heterodoxy in itself is not necessarily helpful. And I think John's idea of Dia Logos, where you've

27:46.760 --> 27:52.360
got, where you've got two people seeking truth, early in the conversation, Jordan Peterson talked

27:52.360 --> 28:00.200
about sort of hunting philosophia, which I thought was good. But that's more of what we need. And

28:01.160 --> 28:09.320
perhaps what we should think about more are hunting bands where, you know, people, people

28:09.320 --> 28:16.680
have practiced ways of collaboration. They know each other's skills. Yet what motivates the hunt

28:16.680 --> 28:23.640
for the tribe is the need for food. And I think as you described, what happens to people when they

28:23.640 --> 28:31.800
get a very high status, wealthy, successful, they're no longer on the hunt. And there is a certain,

28:32.920 --> 28:40.040
you know, Jordan's been back now since January. It's not clear what he's doing, but I fear a

28:40.040 --> 28:47.320
certain lostness because he's had a couple of successful books. You know, anybody will talk to

28:47.960 --> 28:54.200
him, almost anybody who he wants to will talk to him. Where's the hunt?

28:55.320 --> 29:05.160
Well, the hunt is the internal drive towards truth, which I think was what really drew so many of

29:05.160 --> 29:15.240
us to him originally. I would say there is an open question. You have to see what are the

29:15.240 --> 29:22.360
confounding factors in that. I mean, the whole idea of petus and ink nowadays, I think, is something

29:22.360 --> 29:30.120
that do you have the incentive structure still to go for truth, especially when certain things that

29:30.120 --> 29:37.560
you say get a certain audience. And it's very difficult not to kind of follow that, even if

29:37.560 --> 29:44.760
that's completely unconscious. And then there's various things that you can easily dismiss people

29:44.760 --> 29:50.360
who are critical of you as being bad faith or motivated by some other kind of, oh, they're just

29:50.360 --> 29:58.040
trying to get views off my name or whatever that might be. And then you start screening out people

29:58.040 --> 30:03.480
who might have useful things to reflect back to you. And you see that happen constantly in this

30:04.360 --> 30:10.920
landscape. And then you've got the comment sections, you've got, I mean, I find that, and I think also

30:10.920 --> 30:18.120
a little bit of self reflection and awareness of like that happens to all of us, probably to

30:18.120 --> 30:25.960
rebel wisdom as much as anyone. I can't deny that I'm conscious of the comment section. But at the

30:25.960 --> 30:32.520
same time, what I will say is there's a paradox of, I don't think, I think people have still got in

30:32.520 --> 30:38.600
their minds this sort of like alternative versus mainstream. What they don't realize is once you've

30:38.600 --> 30:46.200
created a little thing around being alternative, that becomes the status quo at that point.

30:46.760 --> 30:51.560
So I'll put out films that they'll be like, Oh, that's too consensus or that's too status quo.

30:51.560 --> 30:56.280
It's like, not for this ecosystem, it isn't. I know that when I put out certain things,

30:56.280 --> 31:00.840
it's going to get a bad reaction from from the comment section. It's like, what's more brave,

31:00.840 --> 31:06.360
putting out anti woke stuff that I know is going to go down incredibly well in this little ecosystem

31:06.920 --> 31:11.000
that I'm part of, or putting stuff out that's going to challenge that perspective.

31:12.760 --> 31:17.720
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm, I'm have to be aware of my own biases as well. Like,

31:18.280 --> 31:22.360
I know there's a lot of people are like, Oh, you, you come from mainstream media,

31:22.360 --> 31:27.400
your BBC channel for or whatever, and you're just still part of that. It's like, well,

31:27.400 --> 31:32.840
maybe I have some of that. But also, I think there's a lot of values that were held within the

31:32.840 --> 31:37.320
tradition of journalism around truth seeking, that maybe a lot of journalism has lost. But I

31:37.320 --> 31:44.600
think the alternative media has lost it, never really had it. And that's the key point that I

31:44.600 --> 31:50.520
keep coming back to. It's like the incentive structures of the alternative are not conducive

31:50.520 --> 31:58.840
to truth seeking at all. The incentive structures of the mainstream are increasingly less conducive

31:59.560 --> 32:04.040
to truth seeking as well. But that's why we're in this really terrifying valley,

32:04.040 --> 32:09.880
what I've called the uncanny valley between the two. And that's what kind of obsesses me. And I'm

32:10.440 --> 32:17.640
fascinated by because we're all like Jordan Peterson. All of us are trying to pursue truth in our own

32:17.640 --> 32:26.840
kind of limited way and sense made together. And I think you're that brings back to what

32:26.840 --> 32:33.320
you were saying before of like, how do we do this? Because we've seen we can't really do this alone.

32:33.320 --> 32:38.840
We've seen so many cautionary tales of people being captured by their audience of being,

32:40.040 --> 32:44.600
yeah, basically falling by the wayside, the entire kind of history of the IDW is like

32:44.600 --> 32:49.880
one by one falling by the wayside. And as an alternative sense making structure,

32:50.600 --> 32:54.920
like that's a terrible cautionary tale. Like these are very, very smart people and they all got

32:55.240 --> 32:59.640
captured in one way or another, or most of them got captured in one way or another,

33:00.520 --> 33:04.760
or fell out or stopped kind of moving forward or whatever it whatever it is.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.160
But yeah, that question of how do we do this and some kind of

33:09.960 --> 33:16.360
bands of hunters, like you say, I think is the way to do it is to is to be in relationship with

33:16.360 --> 33:20.920
people who are able to challenge us and we're able to kind of develop our kind of sharpener

33:21.880 --> 33:23.880
and knives against each other.

33:26.120 --> 33:34.360
Part of the irony of the taking down of the mass media culture has been that

33:35.160 --> 33:41.880
part of what afforded truth seeking and internal critique, self critique,

33:42.840 --> 33:50.600
within that culture was its, well, its establishment, its sense of establishment.

33:51.480 --> 33:56.680
I was speaking with an accountant who was a neighbor of mine who used to work for newspapers

33:56.680 --> 34:01.160
and he said, you know, in the 70s and 80s, newspapers were enormously profitable.

34:01.720 --> 34:07.480
And what that afforded was the New York Times could have, I mean, in a sense, they were so

34:07.480 --> 34:12.200
well established, they could have all kinds of self criticism built into it.

34:12.680 --> 34:18.280
And I think as you well described, a lot of alternative media is so captured by audience,

34:18.920 --> 34:23.000
they can't afford to waver from their, from their dogma.

34:23.560 --> 34:29.720
And now we're seeing that in the mass media as well, because they're so hungry, they can't afford.

34:29.720 --> 34:35.480
I thought that came quite through, I thought that came through quite well in Peterson's Barry

34:35.480 --> 34:41.560
Weiss interview. And so actually with the decline of blue church, we're finding blue church

34:41.560 --> 34:51.320
increasingly acting like alternative, let's say, you know, narrowly, you know, narrow agenda

34:52.520 --> 34:59.320
organisms. And so again, I think there's, there's both a, a kind of a, a hunger driven,

34:59.320 --> 35:06.040
a hunger for the truth driven that has to be willing to say, I don't, I don't care how poor

35:06.040 --> 35:13.560
this makes me, I'm that hungry, but then probably also on the other side, where you have structures

35:13.560 --> 35:20.360
that say, okay, I can, I can reasonably afford to pursue the truth and I know it will cost me,

35:21.160 --> 35:28.760
but I'm, you know, that is what we do. And this kind of corruption, I think you find,

35:29.400 --> 35:35.000
I certainly see it in church structures, but now we're seeing it in, as I think Jordan Hall

35:35.000 --> 35:40.920
nicely says, blue church structures as well. It's a weird paradox that as the alternative

35:41.640 --> 35:50.360
gets stronger, the mainstream is becoming more alternative. Yes. Yeah. I wonder just whether

35:50.360 --> 35:55.480
we might go back to, as we sort of taught, as I mentioned, sort of panning for gold, like the

35:55.480 --> 36:03.000
gold flex in the, in the conversation. I mean, I was really interested in what they were talking

36:03.640 --> 36:09.240
about related to the, they touched on postmodernism, but only very briefly.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.640
John was talking about sort of Foucault and Derrida having a little bit more of a complex,

36:16.200 --> 36:20.840
it being a slightly more complex picture than is often painted of the, of the postmodernists.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.360
And that felt, that felt rich in itself, that could have been a conversation.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.800
If the mainstream of Western culture is the mainstream of human culture,

36:28.760 --> 36:32.200
or akin to it, so akin to that shamanic tradition, for example,

36:32.920 --> 36:39.000
then the claim is that that mainstream is, is the desire for power. And that's the opposite

36:39.000 --> 36:44.680
of what we're saying. Genuinely, the opposite. It's the antithesis to that, because that isn't,

36:45.560 --> 36:53.720
isn't Philo Nikea, the antithesis to? Yeah, I think it is. Well, I mean, that's part of it.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.640
Is it, is it genuinely the antithesis? I mean, so is this, is this a claim of,

36:58.360 --> 37:02.680
is this a claim of satanic possession of the West? I mean, is the, is the,

37:02.680 --> 37:08.040
is the culture war that deep? Well, I don't know. I mean, the claim is that it's about fundamentals.

37:09.240 --> 37:13.720
Right. It's a fundamental critique of Western society. It means fundamental. That's why

37:13.720 --> 37:17.800
Derrida went after philogo centric, philogo centrism.

37:17.800 --> 37:22.760
Yeah. And I think, and there's in Foucault, it does similar things, but the thing you have,

37:22.760 --> 37:28.440
you have to remember is, you know, toward the ends of Derrida's career, right? He's reaching into

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Neoplatonic mysticism, negative theology is something he starts to take an interest in,

37:33.000 --> 37:38.520
and Foucault, you know, you know, technologies of the self. And he gets very deeply interested

37:38.520 --> 37:42.600
in the work of Pierre Hadeau, right? And what is ancient philosophy and the wisdom tradition

37:42.600 --> 37:46.440
and Philea Sophia? And he starts to turn towards it and starts to recognize it as

37:46.440 --> 37:51.320
I know nothing of that. I know nothing of that. Yeah. Well, that's what, so I mean,

37:51.320 --> 37:54.360
well, that's, that's very interesting. And then he dies.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.960
Yeah. Foucault also.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.920
Or Foucault. No, Derrida, we were, sorry, we were speaking of Derrida.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.880
I was speaking of both. I said, you see Foucault getting very interested in

38:02.600 --> 38:07.960
negative theology, Neoplatonic mysticism. And then you see Foucault getting very interested in,

38:07.960 --> 38:11.080
you know, Stoicism and Pierre Hadeau's work.

38:12.040 --> 38:19.480
There's an irony in Peterson's work that I thought really came between the Michael Malice and the

38:19.480 --> 38:28.200
Barry Weiss. Because on one hand, Peterson has made a name for himself bashing post-modernity.

38:29.320 --> 38:42.520
But Peterson is himself post-modern in some deep ways. And a regular critique of Peterson,

38:42.520 --> 38:47.720
you had James K. Smith, a professor from Calvin University on your program. And he,

38:48.440 --> 38:53.640
you know, this is one of his critiques of Peterson as well. And I, I think,

38:55.080 --> 38:57.800
I think the way forward for someone like Peterson.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.800
In what, in what way, Paul, in what way is Jordan Peterson post-modern?

39:04.520 --> 39:13.080
Modernity is dying. And when, and, and John in that conversation nicely set up the contrast

39:13.080 --> 39:21.640
between the three P's, which are much more lived experience, perspectival, procedural.

39:21.640 --> 39:27.720
And, and so you've got the one P, which is propositional. And modernity is all about

39:28.920 --> 39:34.120
the world of objects, where, where Peterson, when Peterson begins maps of meaning,

39:34.760 --> 39:39.560
there are two ways to view the world, a world of objects and a form for action. And so Peterson

39:39.560 --> 39:45.160
very much takes the pragmatists through modernity. But within that pragmatism,

39:46.200 --> 39:53.880
there is what, what John Vervecchi talks about those three P's. And in this, in this beautiful

39:53.880 --> 40:00.520
section, at a point that John Vervecchi makes all often, he says, what is emerging out of cognitive

40:00.520 --> 40:09.160
science is a recognition that our ability to grasp something means sort of taking it into

40:09.240 --> 40:15.960
ourselves. We grasp the cup and about minute 25 in there, he goes through that. We grasp the cup.

40:15.960 --> 40:21.880
In other words, something of the cup has to get into my mind. And so the subject object distinction

40:22.600 --> 40:31.800
is being broken down by cognitive science. And that is, that is something within post-modernity

40:31.800 --> 40:37.560
that they in fact have been working at. Because within post-modernity, there's a critique of

40:37.560 --> 40:46.520
that subject object. We are, we are disinterested viewers from above who see the world as it is.

40:47.080 --> 40:55.720
And cognitive science is saying, that's not how we know the world at all. And, and Peterson

40:56.920 --> 41:06.440
with his sort of ancient modern approach has always sort of flexed in that direction and asked

41:07.160 --> 41:17.880
questions that make rigid modernists like Sam Harris uncomfortable. And so when you look at,

41:17.880 --> 41:25.160
you know, Peterson drew such a strange breadth of fans, some of them, you know,

41:26.600 --> 41:31.400
as, as John Vervecchi said in that interview, people do not appreciate how radical

41:31.400 --> 41:40.120
Jonathan Peugeot is. And he's so radical because he's so ancient. And that ancient modern has been

41:40.120 --> 41:48.840
attention in church circles now for the last 20 years as modernity is receding. And as there is a

41:48.840 --> 41:58.040
recognition that proposition as such is always necessary. It's deeply embedded in the scientific

41:58.040 --> 42:07.720
effort, but is insufficient for human beings to actually move forward and increasingly is

42:07.720 --> 42:13.000
an insufficient descriptor. And this deeply critiques Protestantism, which is of course,

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
I'm a Protestant minister, deeply critiques the ways that we have framed communities.

42:19.960 --> 42:28.360
So that has always been in Peterson and John is in some ways pushing him on that and saying,

42:29.400 --> 42:34.840
okay, what does that mean as a scientist? Because Peterson has always, if you listen to

42:34.840 --> 42:40.680
Peterson and Barry Weiss, they're lamenting the loss of blue church, you know, whoa,

42:40.680 --> 42:46.840
blue church has fallen. And well, that's, Jordan's been pushing it.

42:47.160 --> 42:53.320
Yeah, you can argue he's probably one of the primary factors in the loss of

42:54.120 --> 42:58.680
faith that so many people had in blue church, meaning the sort of media establishment.

42:59.560 --> 43:07.320
I think he he certainly and potentially quite deliberately embarked on a on his

43:08.360 --> 43:13.800
mission to show up or or one of the one of the effects was to show up all of the limitations

43:13.800 --> 43:23.720
of that structure. Yeah, but I think yeah, I like that idea. And I think you're right that kind of

43:24.360 --> 43:31.880
the contrast and conflict between him and Sam Harris is very much Sam Harris from from Will

43:31.880 --> 43:40.040
Barry in terms is orange, modern, completely modern, rationality rules. And in a way,

43:40.840 --> 43:47.240
Peterson probably is postmodern relative to that, because he's

43:48.840 --> 43:55.160
but arguably he's also, I mean, he's not, you could argue he's metamodern, I don't know if you

43:55.160 --> 44:00.520
know those distinctions. So the idea in integral theory is that you've got modernism science,

44:01.160 --> 44:07.880
which is the structure, then postmodernism was effectively a kind of deconstructive force around

44:07.880 --> 44:14.040
that, which is obviously something Peterson plays himself against. But in a way,

44:14.840 --> 44:23.000
Peterson is postmodern in his critique of modernism, but he's reconstituting it. So in a way, you

44:23.000 --> 44:31.240
probably would put him integral or or, yeah, integral or metamodern, I mean, there's different

44:31.240 --> 44:38.200
words for it. But effectively, it's the word for a perspective that can observe and understand

44:38.200 --> 44:44.840
the other perspective that understands what postmodernism is. It understands what modernism is.

44:44.840 --> 44:48.200
Because within those worldviews, they can't actually understand the critiques, they can't

44:48.200 --> 44:54.440
understand the the other worldviews. Whereas the the the idea is that there's an integral worldview

44:54.440 --> 44:59.320
that can actually understand all of these different perspectives. And I'd say that's where I probably

44:59.320 --> 45:07.640
place Peterson within that. But his critiques are are the same as yeah, his critiques of science

45:07.640 --> 45:14.440
scientism and materialism are very similar to a lot of the postmodern critiques. That's interesting.

45:15.240 --> 45:22.680
And I just and Peterson partly gets there because of his Darwinian truth. And that's,

45:22.760 --> 45:26.120
I mean, when he showed up in the in the Christian sphere,

45:27.400 --> 45:37.320
he basically uses Darwin to give an account for the credibility of, let's call it ancient wisdom,

45:37.320 --> 45:47.800
because if the wisdom has survived this long, that is a tell for truth. But modernity arose

45:47.800 --> 45:57.960
in the frustration with the letdown of certain forms of ancient wisdom. And, you know, I don't

45:57.960 --> 46:03.560
know very much about, you know, I've listened to some of your content about integral theory. But

46:04.840 --> 46:11.480
I think with each passing, there's always in the initial stages of passing, there's always

46:11.480 --> 46:19.560
throwing too much away. And then after sort of the the tragedy of the revolution,

46:20.440 --> 46:25.880
those who are a little bit beyond it say, all right, well, what of modernity should we keep?

46:26.440 --> 46:32.840
And what of modernity was unhelpful? And that's successive over all of the various patterns

46:32.840 --> 46:40.920
that went before. And Peterson, I think part of what he has shown is he has that capacity

46:41.960 --> 46:47.320
but and again, to come back to Dia Logos, the I think the questions are

46:48.920 --> 46:56.600
what kinds of conversation partners, what kinds of needs are going to help him to

46:57.640 --> 47:05.000
fulfill that potential that I think that potential is I think what a lot of us saw in him and say,

47:05.080 --> 47:12.840
there's real potential there for breakthroughs beyond some of the siloed structures. And again,

47:12.840 --> 47:20.840
it's someone in the church, a tremendous weakness of the church has been its siloed nature. It either

47:20.840 --> 47:29.080
has borders that are too thin, where it's always just me to me to me to behind any new, you know,

47:29.080 --> 47:36.280
progressive cause or it's so rigid that, you know, we're just going to try to outlast the world,

47:36.280 --> 47:41.320
but that isn't working. So and Peterson showed, I think, potential for

47:42.120 --> 47:45.720
affording some breakthroughs with a lot of these boundary issues.

47:48.200 --> 47:54.760
Yeah, this feels very, you know, very narratively right to kind of finish maybe on this on this

47:54.760 --> 48:02.600
point. And I agree that the idea that who are the dialogue partners that he maybe needs to engage

48:02.600 --> 48:07.640
in to recapture that sense of exploration. I think John is definitely one. And I think

48:08.520 --> 48:13.800
pretty much all the people who John has been in dialogue with over the last two years,

48:13.800 --> 48:18.440
like all of those, there's some fascinating conversations with people like Bernardo Castro

48:18.440 --> 48:26.520
and Jonathan Pageau and others exploring and getting into the stream of thought,

48:26.520 --> 48:31.000
like jumping into the stream of thought and swimming together, this sort of sense of

48:31.560 --> 48:35.880
rather than coming from a fixed position, a sort of more malleable position where you're in dialogue

48:35.880 --> 48:42.120
with others and evolving your thinking. I also would like if people are watching this and they're

48:42.120 --> 48:47.320
not familiar with John Bovaki's work, I wanted to reference some of the films that I think would

48:47.320 --> 48:52.760
help kind of frame him in a better way than happened in that conversation maybe. We put out

48:52.760 --> 48:58.200
a few interviews with him, one called Flow States and Wisdom, another one after the

48:58.200 --> 49:03.960
Meaning Crisis, which is where he kind of frames his new Deologos project. And another great dialogue

49:03.960 --> 49:09.720
between John and Peter Limburg called the Evolving Conversation. I want to put up the title cards

49:09.720 --> 49:14.760
from those on over the video and people can kind of find them in the show notes below. And also,

49:15.720 --> 49:23.880
maybe just touch on we've been trying to kind of like how come I trained as a counselor,

49:23.880 --> 49:27.880
but that's my background and I trained in a form of Deologos called Inquiry,

49:27.880 --> 49:32.840
which is really in dialogue with another person trying to get to the edge of our understanding,

49:32.840 --> 49:37.720
trying to articulate what's going on in the relational field between us and to take ourselves

49:37.720 --> 49:42.840
somewhere new in that kind of exploration. And we've tried to do that as well with the courses

49:42.920 --> 49:48.280
that we're running as well, with John Bovaki as one of the guest faculty on our Sense Making 101

49:48.280 --> 49:53.240
course. I'd like to give a little plug for that. If you enjoyed the conversation with John or you

49:53.240 --> 49:59.960
want to learn more, check out that course because that's part of the answer for me is like I don't

49:59.960 --> 50:05.160
think we can do this without becoming different kind of, as you said before, without allowing

50:05.160 --> 50:12.120
ourselves to be transformed. And that's really what we've been trying to do, like how can we do,

50:12.120 --> 50:19.160
it's why we've had such a focus on practice and such a focus on events and

50:21.240 --> 50:26.920
sessions that try and work with some of these technologies. And I also point people towards

50:26.920 --> 50:33.560
other really amazing technologies like circling, like Inquiry, all of the empathy circles,

50:33.560 --> 50:37.480
glass bead games, some of these other kind of technologies, because I think,

50:38.440 --> 50:42.120
and then that links back to what we were saying before about John's

50:42.840 --> 50:48.600
4p cognitive science, the propositional is not enough. The propositional is one aspect,

50:48.600 --> 50:55.640
but the procedural, the perspectival and the participatory is absolutely crucial. And yeah,

50:55.640 --> 51:02.120
I think that's hopefully what we're all trying to kind of bring more in our own ways.

51:02.120 --> 51:11.400
And from, I mean, from the church side of things, I mean, churches have part of that

51:11.400 --> 51:17.560
conversation that I thought was very interesting was when they, when John was talking about grasping

51:17.560 --> 51:26.600
the cup, you have a sense that you can look at the light, or you can see through the light. And

51:26.600 --> 51:33.240
they're both valid perspectives. But there needs to be a transformation that occurs, obviously,

51:33.240 --> 51:37.880
in Christian tradition, you know, we've got a lot of words for this, this is conversion, this is

51:37.880 --> 51:44.840
quickening, this is, and, and, and you need to do that in order to know, it isn't the question,

51:44.840 --> 51:49.160
as in a modern sense, where you sit above it, and you, you look at all the pieces and you

51:49.160 --> 51:57.720
take an analysis, you actually have to step into it in order to know. And, and that's sort of

51:57.720 --> 52:07.160
connects, I think, the knowing and loving. Because in, you do not know unless you love,

52:08.280 --> 52:15.960
and, and in some ways, you cannot love unless you know at least something. So, I mean, that,

52:16.040 --> 52:22.440
at least for a Christian minister, that's always a part of, of my work and, and always the, the

52:22.440 --> 52:28.680
question of continuing to reform institutions. Always a pleasure, Paul. And I really like

52:28.680 --> 52:35.480
your new setup. You're looking very professional. Well, thank you, David. I am, I don't try too

52:35.480 --> 52:42.600
hard at that, but I appreciate it. Awesome. Our ability to make sense of the world is breaking

52:42.600 --> 52:48.200
down. We're making more and more consequential choices with worse and worse sense making to

52:48.200 --> 52:54.760
inform those choices, which is kind of running increasingly fast through the woods, increasingly

52:54.760 --> 52:59.880
blind. Over the last two years, Rebel Wisdom has interviewed some of the world's top thinkers.

53:00.600 --> 53:07.880
Now we've brought them together for an eight week online course, Sense Making 101, with Daniel

53:07.880 --> 53:15.880
Schmacktenburger, Diane Musho-Hamilton, John Vivecchi, Doshin Roshi, and more. Improve your

53:15.880 --> 53:25.160
sense making, develop your sovereignty, and join a wider community looking to do the same.
