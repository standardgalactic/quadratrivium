194420	200580	the same thing again. It's very difficult to let go of this mentality that gives you,
200580	206580	I'll have that, I'll take that. And it's a very selfish kind of way of thinking, not
206580	211860	a communitarian way of thinking, it's not a broad picture, it's a very narrow picture,
211860	217260	it sees the short term, not the long term. And it's perfectly successful in its own terms,
217260	221220	but what it doesn't see is it's leading into a blind alley.
221380	224980	One of the criticisms of your work I've seen, and I think you actually addressed it at the
224980	230660	beginning of the RSA animation, that there was a very simplistic understanding of right brain,
230660	236900	left brain in the past, maybe the 60s and 70s. And a lot of people say, well that's been discredited,
236900	242020	the whole idea of these two parts of the brain doing different things has been completely discredited.
242020	248180	Yes, well that was one of the hurdles I had to get over. And probably if I'd had a regular career
248260	254740	where I had to just churn my way through an academic career, bringing out papers every
254740	260740	few months, I'd never have had the leisure and time. Well it wasn't leisure, it was time stolen
260740	265700	from my clinical work. But actually I spent 20 years looking at the literature and there's no
265700	271220	question. I mean it would be absurd to suggest there's no difference. For a start, the most
271220	275700	primitive creatures that we know about going back 700 million years, the very first ones
275780	281300	that have a neural network already have an asymmetrical neural network. And that has simply
281300	291300	become more, if you like, more pronounced as we go up the evolutionary tree. So the two halves
291300	295380	of the brain are just clearly different, they're different sizes, different weights, different
295380	300740	shapes, they have different cell called gyro patterns, that's the convolutions in the surface of the
301460	306180	brain. They have different preponderances of grey and white matter, different preponderances
306180	312180	of neurotransmitters, they react differently to hormones, they're just different. And it's no
312180	316820	good saying there isn't a difference. Also psychologically they're clearly different because
316820	322100	we know that the left hemisphere, for example, is the one that speaks, it's the one that does
322100	327940	certain aspects of language. And the right hemisphere we know has other faculties that I
327940	336100	spend the book explaining. So it's just that people latched onto a very simple minded model and
336100	340420	that model was that of a machine. Now the question you ask of a machine is what does it do?
341140	344980	And if you ask the question what does the left hemisphere do and what does the right hemisphere
344980	351140	do, the answers that came out of pop psychology in the 70s and 80s, the left hemisphere does reason
351140	356420	and language and the right hemisphere does emotion and visual spatial things is not true.
356420	361700	They're both involved in everything, but they're involved in different ways, in reliably different
361700	369380	ways. So it's not the what of the brain, it's the how. And that's a very important question,
369380	374580	but it's not one that scientists are so readily going to ask because they're mainly interested
374580	380900	in mechanism. But actually it's as plain as the nose on your face when you come to look at it,
380900	387940	that there are these vast differences in the disposition of these two neural networks towards
387940	394180	the world. They pay attention in completely different ways and when you pay attention to the world
394180	401780	you see different things in it. And so if they do that they're going to construct two different
401780	407460	versions of the world. We talk a lot on this channel about the meta conversation, the idea that
407460	413940	what we need is a conversation that opens up to the not knowing, to what needs to emerge beyond
413940	418740	and what it feels like is happening now increasingly with social media, is people are getting stuck
418740	424660	more and more in certainty and in what they do know. Is that a right brain, left brain phenomena?
424660	430420	Well it can be looked at in that way in that one of the features of the left hemisphere is that it
430980	437140	prefers what it's already familiar with and it finds it very difficult to shift set. So once
437140	442900	it's stuck into something it keeps on repeating it. Whereas the right hemisphere Rhamachandran,
442900	448740	BS Rhamachandran, well-known neuroscientist, calls it the devil's advocate because it's able to see
448740	456420	other things and it's saying yes but, yes but is a Zen saying that I very much like. So you can
456420	462340	see it that way. The right hemisphere is much more able to be flexible and also very importantly
462980	468420	although or not although but just because the two hemispheres have different takes on the
468420	473940	one they have different takes on their own relationship. So the left hemisphere's take is
473940	482100	an exclusive one either this is right or that is right and therefore what I know excludes what you
482100	488340	know. Whereas the right hemisphere's take is a both and take that there's a room for what the left
488340	495140	hemisphere does. There's a point in analysis but there's also a point in synthesis and imagination
495780	503300	and what we are desperately lacking is that overall synthesis. It seems to me that at the moment
503940	509860	we officially pride ourselves on being a very free thinking people. I'm going to sound like a
509860	519380	terrible funny daddy but I think the intellectual world was far more open in the 60s and 70s when
519380	525780	I grew up than it is today. It's closed down to a number of dogmas and the internet which is a
525780	530820	wonderful thing hasn't helped because it's possible for people to get trapped in bubbles
530820	535860	where they reinforce the things they believe without really hearing other points of view.
536660	542180	I'm a keen proponent that in education one of the most important things one must do
542820	548340	is teach people always to invert everything they believe and see the value in it. In fact
548340	553860	I believe there should be in government a department of inverse policy so whatever the
553860	559700	government is proposing there should be a department that is dedicated to seeing what would happen if
559700	565460	we did the precise opposite and it should be you know centrally funded and I think it would
565460	570580	be a very useful exercise but really it's an intellectual exercise that we all need to do.
570580	575940	If we start being too certain about anything it means we've missed something else. This brings us
575940	582740	to a very important metaphysical point which is that a thing and its opposite according to the
582740	587700	left hemisphere are simply as far apart as they can be and we move always in a linear way to what
587700	595300	we identify as good. Everything I know tells me that in fact opposites are connected and if you pretend
595300	602820	that you are only having one you don't notice the dark side and this is terribly true in psychiatry.
602820	610980	It's almost an attuism to say that a lot of the work one does as a psychiatrist is helping people
610980	617140	to see that there is a good side to what it is that they fear and dislike in themselves but there
617140	622180	is also a dark side to the bits that they pride themselves on and that you cannot get rid of
622260	628740	the dark side you accept it and work with moving it towards something creative and all creativity
628740	634100	and all life is creative our mental world is creative our daily reality is creative partly
634100	639780	by us not out of nowhere but it's grounded in something else but we help creative. That process
639780	645940	depends on opposition it depends on a degree of resistance actually and as soon as you've decided
646020	652340	that X, Y and Z are good and their opposites are bad and we must have more and more and more and more
652340	658500	of the thing we've decided is good you end up reaping a whirlwind because the things you didn't
658500	665540	take note of come back and bite you in the bum and I think that what we are now seeing in the very
665540	674820	destructive and damaging and regrettable moves of you know Brexit and Trump and so on are entirely
674820	682260	understandable reactions which I can perfectly well forgive from people who have just been told
682260	688340	that their opinions are no good because these are things we don't talk about these are things that
688340	693540	you know a liberal person knows that liberty equality and fraternity is all it's about and the
693540	699140	opposites don't matter so I think we're we're enduring now a backlash that we could have avoided
699220	705060	by having a mature conversation yes this is good but also we've got to take into account that
705940	710900	this is what we've talked about quite a lot on the channel and our perspective is that we're seeing
710900	716260	the shadow of liberalism that Trump and Brexit are both the shadow of liberalism I didn't know
716260	722180	that that was what you said but it's exactly what I believe yeah I mean you mentioned a lot of different
722180	727060	psychological things because I mean Jung's idea of the shadow is a perfect one and at some sense it
727060	732660	feels to us that this is the time of the integration of the shadow that what we're seeing
732660	736660	through the democratisation of different forms of media is all the things and the cracks between
736660	741220	things that we thought we'd got rid of are now rising up and are going to have to be dealt with
741220	748660	again have to be integrated yes how do we do that well of course there is no you're not expecting
748660	754420	me to have some simple answer and one of the difficulties is that we have accelerated the
754420	762180	pace of change so fast that the kind of changes that we require not only sort of won't but simply
762180	772740	cannot be made to happen that fast um we're in a crisis which requires something to happen
772740	781460	very quickly really because accelerating technological advance has put machine guns
781460	787220	in the hands of toddlers we have not increased in wisdom in fact I believe we have lost wisdom
787220	794660	in the west and yet we have gained enormously and are gaining very fast in power inevitably if
794660	800820	you put power in the hands of people who have no wisdom this is a formula for disaster and we see
800820	806900	it in the current environmental disaster we're facing we see it in the destruction of species
806900	814260	we see it in the destruction of the lives of indigenous people we see it in the mind control
814260	822420	that is already being put into effect in china with enormously sophisticated ai that tracks the
822420	828900	faces the movements the everything the thoughts of all its citizens and we believe oh well that's
828900	836020	china but that could never happen here but that is very naive democracy our kind of democracy
836020	841780	is fragile it's not the norm it's something very precious and it can easily be destroyed
841780	846900	especially in an atmosphere where we don't know who or what to believe which is becoming more and
846900	852660	more a problem so we have got ourselves into a very difficult situation and i'm not suggesting
852660	859620	there is an easy fix to it but there are things that we could do um to try and get away from this
859620	865140	I mean one they're going to have to involve radical changes we can't expect to go on living
865780	870340	the kind of lives we do with the demands on the world there's just not sustainable they're not
870340	878580	sustainable even for us and now that um 10 times as many people will want to claim these rights to
878580	885220	extraordinary privilege the world simply cannot sustain it so we've been living on on fool's gold
885220	890740	if you like so what are the practical things that can be done if if your diagnosis is correct
890820	894820	and that we're looking at a world that's ever more sort of narrow and rational
896020	906020	how do we get out of that yes easier said than done um and there are patients that you cannot help
906020	912740	which is one of the first things you have to know in my trade um but I believe one of the things I
912740	918260	can do I can't do much but one thing I can do is raise awareness and I think that's happening
918260	925380	so people are becoming much more aware of in a way I've opened people's minds to things they already
925380	932900	knew one of the communist things people say is I had this feeling of sudden recognition that all
932900	940740	my life I kind of felt all this but had no way of articulating it so I think that that is one thing
940740	947700	so of course it's just a start in terms of practical things I mean we've got to begin my completely
948260	954260	rethinking education at the moment it's about shoveling information into people not training
954260	963860	them to think critically to think imaginatively uh I was lucky in that in my education I was taught
963860	969380	to to think of all sides of the question as soon as I believe something passionately I would be
969380	974020	asked to defend the exact opposite position which is a very important exercise that I think no
974020	979860	one should leave school without doing you know this is what you believe speak about it now speak
979860	984980	about and defend the opposite position and we will score you on how well you do that exercise
985780	992900	that is good but it's also about imagination I mean education is drawing out faculties within
992900	1000500	people it's not shoveling facts into people that is the reverse of education so I think the emphasis on
1001300	1011060	you know a cliched caricature would be but it's not unfortunately that far from the truth
1011060	1016820	you're doing English A level there are six points you must make about Jane Austen you know
1016820	1024340	to me that is the death of English literature and so is conforming it to current preoccupations
1024340	1030740	with whatever brilliant we think they are filtering it through isms of you know political
1030740	1037140	correctness instead of putting all that to the side and simply opening oneself to the incredible gift
1037140	1041140	of something that somebody created which can work on you in all kinds of ways
1041140	1046420	that you don't now conceive the more you approach things with preconceptions the worse it is this
1046420	1052340	this was really interesting watching the documentary you sent over you mentioned identity
1052340	1058820	politics as a left brain phenomena that it's effectively it's a it's another certainty or it
1058820	1063860	can become another certainty because what we're doing through that is for example you're taking a
1063860	1068900	work of literature and you're critiquing it not in the way that it kind of reflects the grandeur of
1068900	1074180	the human spirit or the developmental journey of the individual it's it's it's about okay how does it
1074820	1080420	it which immediately diminishes it from that to that yes and can you talk about that and there's
1080500	1085540	nothing new in it as a left brain as a left brain phenomena i can but i'd also first like to
1086500	1091140	just gloss your remark because it's interesting i didn't actually mention identity politics anywhere
1091140	1096420	in the film but what happened you say political correctness or was there some no what happened
1096420	1102420	was and i didn't know this that in the film as you know roan williams is interviewed and the way
1102420	1107140	the film was made was i would go and meet somebody we would be filmed talking together and then there
1107140	1111540	was always a bit where i went out and they just talked to that person because then they were free
1111540	1117220	to say whatever they wanted to say and a bit that i had never seen until the film was completed
1117220	1126180	was where roan williams chose for some reason to talk about um the angry black and white views
1126180	1131540	of people who just know what is right and won't listen to other people and want it legislated
1131540	1138420	and he just said you you cannot create a better society by legislating this kind of thing we need
1138420	1143780	to develop a society in which people can have we can listen to one another and have reasonable
1143780	1149300	conversations and he actually made the point that by trying to stamp out certain things you don't
1149300	1155620	diminish the anxiety behind it you ramp it up which is exactly what we're seeing which is another
1155620	1162100	psychological truth of repression yes i mean one of the there are many problems here the one is
1162100	1169540	the left hand this is far too certain that it knows what's what it's far too clear that things are
1169540	1176100	unipola that there are just goods whereas you know once you see something that is much clearer
1176100	1181540	and oriental tradition that everything has comes inevitably with its opposite you don't think
1181540	1187780	like that anymore it doesn't see things contextually it doesn't see individuals it's not
1187780	1194340	prepared to listen to another point of view it's just saying this guy i have heard on twitter has
1194340	1200100	said something you know which is now a sound bite you don't hear all all the rest that went around it
1200100	1205620	you don't see this as part of somebody's journey that it might be worth listening to you just dismiss
1206340	1214660	now i believe very strongly once again that it it's not the what it's the how if i've said that
1214660	1220580	before i'm going to say it again and again in life it is not the what it is the how it's the
1220580	1225940	disposition you have now i believe it is possible to say anything and i don't think there should be
1225940	1232660	things that nobody can say i think we should have a system where anyone can say anything but they
1232660	1241140	must say it in a way that is not inflammatory and that is open to reason and discussion so that
1241140	1246420	applies to both sides of a political argument and in that same section of the film it made an
1246420	1253460	interesting point that anger lateralizes to the left brain so that so that if we're in our
1253460	1258740	sort of left brain certainty anger is the result anger and aggression you know people think the
1258740	1264420	left hemisphere i mean the old view was when it might be a bit dull but it's terribly reliable
1264420	1270820	and it's down to earth and it doesn't get emotional well number one it is not down to earth it's
1270820	1278180	in a fantasy world number two it is not reliable um there's good work coming out of gazaniga's lab
1278180	1283140	showing you know he was the man who said the right hemisphere has about as much intelligence as a
1283220	1289540	chimpanzee i mean that was 30 40 years ago but still his lab is now producing wonderful data
1289540	1294500	showing that the right hemisphere is far more sophisticated at making judgments much more
1294500	1300660	reliable the left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions is open to bias and in terms of
1300660	1307060	emotion the left hemisphere is far from devoid of emotion the most lateralizer of all emotions is
1307060	1314980	anger and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere lateralizes just means what it means that when
1314980	1323220	people are experiencing anger there is a great increase in activity in the left hemisphere and
1323220	1327380	you know the chapter and verse for that it's somebody called harm and jones has done a lot of
1328660	1333380	research into that but the chapter and verse will be in in the master and is in the master
1333380	1340500	there was a really interesting example with birds and i don't maybe you want to kind of explain
1340500	1345460	very simply how because that that for me really illustrates the difference between the two the two
1345460	1351540	ways of of interacting with the world yes well well the um you know human neurosciences were busy
1351540	1357860	dismissing it the um animal scientists were simply getting on with what science scientists
1357860	1363700	are supposed to do which was observing and taking note and they noticed that birds and animals
1363700	1371860	use their two hemispheres for different purposes it's easy to observe in a bird because in most
1371860	1377780	birds the input from the right eye goes straight to the left hemisphere and the input from the left
1377780	1383140	eye goes straight to the right hemisphere it's not true of humans it's more complicated but at least
1383140	1387540	in birds and quite a lot of animals that have eyes on the side of the head you can tell which
1387540	1392980	hemisphere is engaged by just looking at which eye is being used for this particular moment
1393700	1401780	and what they noticed was that birds and animals reliably seem to use their left hemisphere for
1401780	1408180	latching on to a small detail like i need to pick up that piece of seed on the background of grid
1409780	1416660	and they use their right hemisphere the left eye for everything else for who others are around
1416740	1422500	is there a predator um is my mate nearby because i would like to share this all that contextual
1422500	1429140	information is the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere is literally seeing a tiny piece of
1429140	1438660	reality now that was in itself an aha moment i could see that this if this was in any way true
1438660	1446020	about humans it would have colossal implications because i have a background in philosophy and i
1446020	1451700	know that attention changes the world so if there's a big difference in attention one is
1452260	1457620	fragmentary piecemeal narrow the other is broad sustained and vigilant they're going to
1458820	1464820	see two different realities and so that got me into then looking at the human history and lo and
1464820	1471220	behold this difference is very marked in human beings so if people have a right hemisphere stroke
1471220	1476740	they can have this pathological narrowing of the window of attention like looking the wrong way
1476740	1483140	down the telescope and you're the sort of the grand theory as well is that we are in a world that
1483140	1488740	has concentrated more and more and more on this narrow atomistic mechanical way of looking at the
1488740	1497380	world and neglecting the more holistic the more um relational aspects well it seems to me and that's
1497380	1502260	the subject of a book i'm now writing that actually we don't start from things and then have to
1502260	1507460	work out how they relate and how this thing this billiard ball hits that one and so on but in fact
1507460	1518420	that there are very broad patterns and flows in the world and that what we call things are the
1518420	1525220	sort of bits that stand out to our attention their little nexuses if you like that go oh i
1525220	1530580	recognise that little familiar thing that i'm going to call that a but actually everything is
1530580	1536580	part of a larger picture and the trouble with focusing on detail is not only do you miss the
1536580	1545060	overall meaning the overall purpose the overall connection the way in which this has ramifications
1545060	1551060	the bits that are not explicit the thing that is not in the spotlight which is everything else
1551060	1556180	but you also think that you can understand the world by taking one thing and putting it
1556180	1561940	with another and building it up as you'd build a meccano set or you know mend the bike in the
1561940	1572260	garage but the world is not like that i wrote down from the rsa animation left abstraction power
1572260	1578420	to manipulate the already known fixed static isolated decontextualised explicit ultimately
1578500	1584900	lifeless right individual changing evolved interconnected implicit incarnate living
1584900	1591140	never entirely known and that reminded me very much of what martin buber talked about that we
1591140	1596020	have the i it relationships of the i thou relationships which i found very profound i
1596020	1600740	also studied philosophy when i was when i was at university and that that really stuck with me that
1600740	1605620	there are two different types of relationships we can have in the world one the i thou is essentially
1606260	1610980	there is an unknown ability about that relationship is that something do you think that maps on
1610980	1618340	absolutely and there is also a reciprocity in the i thou relationship whereas in the i it relationship
1618340	1624260	it's a unidirectional one which is about power and influence whereas the other one is about
1624260	1631540	a reverberative responsive coming into being of something so that is a very important distinction
1631620	1637780	and i relate the i thou and the i it to the evolution of language we won't have time to because
1637780	1643700	it's a long story but it's in the book but in brief i believe that language emerged from
1644660	1650340	what you might call music in other words the music of speech the sounds and that
1651380	1658660	denotative language is a kind of special set of a much more richly embedded embodied
1658740	1666260	connotative way of communicating and that it became necessary when we were no longer in groups
1666260	1674020	where you were largely just talking i to thou but we're talking about a third party or something
1674020	1681060	else we had designs on and so that is how where language becomes very important i've seen your work
1681060	1686660	reference in many many different places particularly by people who are talking about the
1686660	1692500	more spiritual the more even an author called gary lackman i don't know if you're aware of him
1692500	1699940	so he he's written a series of books about the the hidden occult history of western thought
1699940	1704660	and he uses your work as a way of saying as a way of kind of maybe giving it scientific
1704660	1709700	respectability or at least explaining this could be a process that we're going through these
1709700	1716340	these more holistic ways of knowing have never been part of the western kind of mainstream
1716340	1722740	traddition and maybe that's because of the right brain left brain split do you do you agree with that
1723220	1726980	well i think there is not true that they've not been present in the tradition
1730100	1736260	i know what he's talking about but they're very much present in pre-socratic philosophy
1737300	1743220	as we know something very important and i think very damaging happened to western philosophy
1743220	1753060	with Plato and Aristotle and particularly with Plato um but these other aspects in the west
1753060	1759540	have been more expressed in our extremely powerful music uh one thing you can say about western
1759540	1766980	civilization it in many ways it's it lacks the wisdom of oriental civilization but it has produced
1767060	1776100	colossally rich music and so it also produced you know Shakespeare so i would say our art
1777540	1784420	is where it has been expressed but when we start doing philosophy we're like well we've got to make
1784420	1789860	this consistent and i see that and it goes in there and this bit leads to that and whereas
1790740	1794900	you're you're therefore as as i say sort of building things up from little certainties
1795460	1799300	well the first thing is there are no certainties to start from they're intuitive
1799300	1805140	you have to start from axioms reason is based on intuition and it ends in intuition
1807060	1811540	um so i think there are those elements of there but they have been
1812580	1819380	sidelined and neglected the key thing one must remember about the left hemisphere
1819380	1825540	is that it's it's bright enough but not very bright it doesn't really see that there are things
1825540	1833780	that it doesn't know um it's so hermetic its world is so self contained and consistent and
1833780	1838420	self referential that it doesn't feel the need of anything else because it's not sensing that there's
1838420	1846500	something bigger the right hemisphere sees what is implicit what is going on not just in the foreground
1846580	1852900	but in the in the background in the context in all these things that are everything that we really
1852900	1864500	value love and art and we used to value spiritual truths these things are only approachable in an
1864500	1870260	indirect implicit way and as soon as you start to say well we need to pin this down and make it
1870260	1878420	certain you're already on the wrong track so i think that's gary's right to point to that
1878980	1883700	it's just that i think there's more to the story and you you talked about um that
1884740	1890100	rationality begins in intuition so well yes it has to i mean in fact it begins in intuition
1890100	1896580	in two ways one is that um we we can't rationally prove why reason is a helpful tool
1896580	1903220	we intuit that it is a useful tool but secondly when we begin reasoning we have to begin from
1903220	1910340	quite a host of assumptions science officially claims to make no assumptions in fact makes
1910340	1916660	quite a few assumptions before it gets started it has to that's not a criticism the system can't
1916660	1923060	work without somewhere to start because nothing can be supported on nothing it has to be on something
1923060	1931140	before it can get started so that's what i mean and it also ends in intuition because the results
1931140	1937940	of reasoning have to be reintegrated into a broader picture so it's an intermediary tool
1938740	1945300	reason and indeed the left hemisphere is an intermediary tool one way of thinking of it
1945300	1951700	is it's like this when you learn a musical instrument you're first attracted to a piece of
1951700	1957620	music in a broad sort of way then you start trying to play it and you realise you have to go
1957620	1962900	over and over the fingering in bar 18 and you know there's a return to the dominant at bar 32
1962900	1968580	or whatever it is but then when you've done all that that's not time wasted but when you come to
1968580	1973860	perform it if you're still thinking like that you can't perform the relationship with the hemispheres
1973860	1978740	is a bit like that the immediate grasp of something that the overall take on it is right
1978820	1983860	hemisphere the left hemisphere then gets to work and does procedural matters but then it's the
1983860	1988740	right hemisphere that must reintegrate that information that is not lost that process was
1988740	1994340	valuable but it mustn't stop there in a nutshell i think in our society we stop with the light
1994340	2000020	left hemisphere we don't allow it to be reintegrated into a much bigger richer picture which is in
2000020	2005860	touch with all the stuff that the left hemisphere doesn't know it doesn't know this reminds me quite
2005860	2014020	a lot of richard tarnas who yes who i'm afraid i haven't read yeah no i i he his book had a huge
2014020	2020340	impact on me when i was when i was at university but but effectively he said that he told the story
2020340	2025700	of western philosophy and said that it had become more and more isolating more and more a prison of
2025700	2031620	the intellect and that the way out would be to re-embrace intuition re-embrace direct knowledge
2031620	2037940	and that we couldn't get out until we did um so it just it seems that it maps on very very clearly
2037940	2045300	to to the picture that you're you're painting yes um the that's right and the other thing one ought
2045300	2053620	to say is that philosophy has made strides in the last couple of hundred years and i think that
2053620	2064660	um there's been a redressing of that particularly in early on in in hegel and in the the german idealist
2064660	2074020	victor shelling and so forth uh to an extent in nature who's a mad genius um but mainly in the
2074020	2084980	traddition of two uh two groups one is the american pragmatists uh cspers uh william james
2084980	2094500	and john jewell and the other is the um phenomenological tradition in europe uh heiligur uh
2094500	2103540	melaponte sheila hustle to a degree uh so i think and the later vittgenstein would fit with that
2103540	2110980	the earlier vittgenstein uh not you there was a comment on the rsa video from a physicist
2111620	2118580	who said that he found it very useful in looking at why they were so far away from coming up with
2118580	2123140	a theory of everything because his sense was that they're looking at the individual details and
2123140	2129700	not looking at the whole does that make sense it certainly does and i hadn't seen that um comment
2129700	2136340	but um well one of the gratifying things has been the number of physicists who have written
2136340	2142820	to me saying uh there are enormous resonances between your work and what we are doing in physics
2143940	2150820	i'm um far too unskilled to to recognise those although i have an idea of the shape of what
2150820	2155780	they're talking about and recently i've been trying to equate myself with quantum field theory
2155780	2163940	which is actually a very interesting development out of quantum mechanics um and i will try to write a bit
2163940	2170100	about that in my current book but only after running it by some very kind physicist friends
2171060	2179700	but i think what is um important is that what i'm saying if it is true will apply to everything
2179700	2184420	because it's about the nature of reality and the people who are at the cold face of reality
2184420	2191060	are poets and physicists and you know they have written to me saying uh how how much they feel
2191060	2198260	a resonance but what has struck me is that people that i didn't expect like lawyers and people in the
2198260	2205300	world of finance and economists you know are some of my most um frequent correspondents because
2205300	2212340	they say what you're describing is exactly the problems in our realm so i'm delighted because
2212340	2219620	i've never had the slightest belief or hope that this could happen but that what i'm saying has
2219620	2232500	been picked up by people in all walks of life
2242340	2243700	you
