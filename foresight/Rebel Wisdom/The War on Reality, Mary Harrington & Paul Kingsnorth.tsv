0	14760	This is the first ever conversation between two of my favourite cultural commentators,
14760	19720	the writers Paul Kingsnorth and Mary Harrington, and it's all about the overlaps between their
19720	24200	thought and their analysis of what we're calling the war on reality.
24640	30520	Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine, all the time in the writing I'm doing at the
30520	34600	moment. It's not my word, I've stolen from writers like D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell
34600	39560	and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years. And
39560	44400	I'm really talking about this giant techno industrial monstrosity that is in our heads
44400	48520	and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the
48520	52280	project of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on
52320	57960	God and consequently we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place
57960	63880	within that. I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of what you call the
63880	70200	machine, Paul, wants to turn everything into standing reserve. It wants to enclose everything.
71080	74520	It started with the commons and then it started patenting things and now it's moving on to
74520	79560	patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences. I invited them to dialogue because I had an
79560	84360	intuition they'd be able to go deep together. And this went even better than I expected.
84360	88600	I think it's a really important development in the cultural conversation and I'll come back
88600	98280	and explain why at the end. So, hope you enjoy it. Paul Kings North, Mary Harrington, welcome.
99240	105480	Thanks for having me. Good to be here. So, this is, I believe, the first time that you
105480	109640	both have been in dialogue with each other. You've both written for Unheard. So, you've been
110360	116680	in the same online magazine and there's a lot of overlaps between your thinking. So,
116680	122760	I'm really looking forward to this conversation. And as I thought maybe it'd be good to start maybe
122760	126120	with asking you each, because I know you've both been looking forward to being in dialogue with
126120	131320	each other, what it is that you are looking forward to talking about and what you find
131320	136200	interesting in each other's thought before we dive into some of the topics we prepared.
137400	141800	I like Paul's conception of the machine. I'd be happy to talk about that for an hour and a half.
143720	147560	Yeah, I mean, I think we're coming at the same thing from a different perspective actually. I
147560	153240	really like, I love the notion of reactionary feminism actually. Apart from being a great catch
153240	157960	phrase, it actually really opens up a lot of really necessary questions about and not just about
158600	162200	women's issues either, but just broadly about limits and the body and nature.
162200	164600	Yes, yes, yes, yes, you get it. You get it, you see.
164600	169320	I do get it because you're coming from a feminist perspective at the same sort of stuff I think
169320	174280	I'm writing about from whatever perspective I write. The moment you start thinking about reactionary
174280	177640	feminism, you realise it's reactionary eco-feminism and then you're away.
177640	182840	Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose what I would say I'm coming from, I suppose, is my background as
182840	187400	a former environmental activist, somebody who writes and thinks about the natural world a lot,
187400	190520	and you don't have to do that for very long before you realise that obviously we're
190520	194600	intimately a part of it. And the whole thing is a question of limits and whether or not we can
194600	199160	break them. And then the questions about the body and the questions about women's and men's bodies
199160	203000	and the questions about the reality of being human and the questions about rainforests and
203000	206520	climate change turn out to be the same questions, which is how we live within limits.
206520	208440	Good, well, that's it. We've dealt with everything.
209400	210520	So that's good. Thanks, David.
211320	214120	Great. Mary and Paul, thank you very much.
215000	218520	Yeah, that's it. That's the tweet. That's what it says.
219480	227080	Yeah, that's a really great introduction. And as you said, Paul, that the idea is
227960	234280	that somehow the modern world seems to be in conflict with itself, or at least with the
234280	238920	natural world. And this is something you've touched on in your writing, and Mary, you've touched on
238920	245480	as well. Could we start by framing that? How do you see that from the sort of biggest picture?
246360	252120	Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine all the time in the writing I'm doing
252120	256360	at the moment. It's not my word. I've stolen from writers like D. H. Lawrence and George Orwell
256360	260040	and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years.
261080	266120	And I'm really talking about this giant techno-industrial monstrosity that is in our heads
266200	270600	and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the project
270600	275560	of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on God. And consequently,
275560	280680	we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place within that.
280680	286360	And we've decided that through the use of technology, science and reason, we can effectively
286360	290440	build a new world which doesn't seem to limit us in any way. And we've decided that any limits at
290440	294520	all, whether they're the limits that our body provides or the limits that the natural world
294520	301800	provides us with or even the limits of our behaviour towards each other, are disgraceful
301800	307720	chains that prevent us from being free and rational in the individuals. And so I think it's a big,
308920	315000	it's just a very big, very old way of seeing that is manifesting itself in silicon and plastic
315000	320600	all around us. And as I say, coming at that from the perspective of an environmentalist or a former
320600	325720	one, what I saw was the green movement being entirely sucked into this way of seeing. And I
325720	331160	became, I became a greener years ago because I was entranced by the smallest beautiful model that
331160	335960	the Greens used to believe in in the 70s. When I was a little boy, you know, the world of EF Schumacher
335960	340760	and Leopold Korr and Gandhi and Tolstoy and everyone else who told us to live within natural
340760	346120	limits in a way that would actually be nourishing to us. And the green movement instead brought
346120	351160	into this machine thinking in which it saw climate change and other issues as technological
351160	356520	problems to be solved with more technology, all of which sucks us into the same project of busting
356520	361160	down limits. So now environmentalism has become a question of how many wind farms you can get up
361160	366520	and whether you should use nuclear power and GM crops, whether you should do X, Y and Z to effectively
366520	373320	create a quote, sustainable limitless machine world. All paths kind of lead back to this
373320	378600	modern way of seeing almost every question. I mean, Mary comes at this from, from, from as far as I
378600	382920	can see from the angle of, you know, from the feminist angle, but as she says, it's, it's the
382920	387160	same question, actually, you can just approach it in from all of your different sort of personal
387880	393960	perspectives. And it all leads you back to this attitude we have to nature and human nature.
395960	400920	Yeah, I agree. I suppose I sort of come, I found myself coming at it from the perspective
400920	407000	of the things that you can't say from within that model, and rather direct experience, particularly
407000	411400	of what it is about being a mother that you can't put into words from within the model.
411960	416600	And I've theorized, I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of, you know,
417480	422040	what you call the machine pool. See, it wants to turn everything into standing reserve, you know,
422040	426840	it wants to, it wants to enclose everything, you know, it started with the commons and then it
426840	431960	started patenting things and now it's moving on to patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences
431960	438280	and you know, but it wants to, it wants to move things from being naturally occurring to biosemiotic,
438280	444360	you know, relationships with one another to being inert resources that can be instrumentalized
444360	450680	and ideally commodified and turned into, turned into something that can be used for something
450680	455320	and sort of unmoored from its relational context. That's the basic movement, unmoor something from
455320	459320	its relational context and then turn it into things which can be traded back and forth in a
459320	464360	sort of liquid and limitless way. So if that's the basic model, the problem with that from the
464360	470760	perspective of a feminist and a mother is that everything that matters, everything that's important
470760	477800	about being a mother is impossible, you can't, is not visible within that model. Because all
477800	482200	of mothering is about pattern and all of mothering is about repetition, you know, it's about, it's
482200	486600	about showing up for your baby every day in all the little ways that are important because the
486600	491080	baby's completely dependent on you and all the, all the things which are nice about it are impossible
491080	495320	to frame in those, in terms of the machine because they can't be commodified. I mean, you know, it's
495320	501880	easy to sort of wax sentimental about your baby's first laugh. But yeah, I think a lot of mothers
501880	506200	will relate to the experience of getting to the end of the day and having had actually a lovely day,
506200	509960	but then somebody asks them, oh, what did you do today? And you, you, you can't say,
510680	516520	you just can't sum it up because you did stuff and you were there and it was in the moment and
517080	520760	just the, the day went by and bits of it were probably really boring. But if you try and explain
520760	525240	it to somebody from, from the perspective that's outside the relationship and that sort of dynamic
525240	531400	business of kind of sustaining a tiny dependent person, if you like, with the, with the energy and
533400	538520	with your own body and your own way of being in the world. And you try and explain that sort of
538520	545240	dynamic activity to somebody who isn't part of it and who isn't within those relationships with you,
545240	549080	they'll just be like, well, that sounds pretty dull and repetitive. And it kind of is, you know,
549080	552680	I mean, if you have a, if you have a functioning brain and an education, it does get boring after
552680	557320	a bit, but it's also really important and it's also really lovely. And I mean, this is, you know,
557320	561320	as somebody with a functioning brain and an education and also a deep, deep love of my
561320	565960	daughter, these are all things which I've kind of wrestled with and found myself theorizing as
565960	571720	well as doing. And I've, and I've come to realize that it's, it's another, it's another angle on
571720	576280	the same problem that I think Paul is wrestling with, which is about how the things, the things
576280	580600	which matter and the things which sustain us and the things which are meaning making and the
580600	586680	things which are genuinely sustainable and create sustainable life in relation to other life are
586680	591240	all pattern based. Then none of them are, none of them are information based, they're all meaning
591240	596280	based. And information, if you like, is blind to meaning, because meaning, meaning in here's in
596280	601160	pattern and repetition and the everyday and the ordinary and the relational. And the moment you
601160	605960	turn it into standing reserve, the moment you enclose it, instrumentalize it and send it out
605960	611720	as inert stuff to be liquefied in one sort of a market or another, it becomes information and it
611720	616600	stops being meaningful. The moment you commodify a child that, I mean, you understand, you understand
616600	621320	where I'm going. Yeah, and we are there, aren't we? We are pretty much commodifying children
621320	626120	already. We are literally commodifying children as a whole. There are rows and rows of cots in
626120	633000	bombshells as in Ukraine, where children which were commissioned by parents elsewhere in a rented
633000	638520	uterus are waiting for their commissioning parents to come and collect them. I say parents in the
638520	643480	loosest possible sense. This is not, this is not a form of parenthood, which I recognize as such.
644360	647160	But yes, we are commodifying children at this point.
647720	651800	We're commodifying everything and I think that the notion of enclosure is really important. I
651800	654680	keep coming back to this one as well, again and again and again. I mean, you could argue that
654680	660280	this whole process begins literally with the enclosures, land enclosures in Britain from, say,
660280	665160	the 15th century onwards. And, you know, global capitalism, if you like, global industrialism
665160	669160	is a process of enclosing everything. So you start off with the land, then you go on to the workers,
669160	673720	then you go on to the human body, you go on to the natural world. Everything's enclosed.
673720	679880	And it's also a process of making everybody rootless and making everything rootless. It's about,
680760	684440	if Mary talks about relationships, I suppose I talk about roots, which is pretty much a different
684440	688200	way of saying the same thing. If you're rooted in a place, if you're rooted in your relationship
688200	693400	with a family, if you're rooted in your own body, if you're rooted in the environment around you,
693400	698600	then you have something which, as Mary says, you can't actually commodify. You can't commodify that
698600	706360	sense of being. Well, you can, and they do. But in the real sense of what it actually means to be
706360	710280	human, it's not measurable. But everything has to be measurable in the age of the machine. It has to
710280	715800	be measurable. It has to be commodifiable. It has to be profitable. Because that's the only way we
715800	719640	can measure whether we're progressing. And of course, we must always progress towards something
719640	725320	better by enclosing and by uprooting and by turning everything into a standing reserve. And that
725320	730600	actually breaks the business of being human in the world. It breaks, I mean, you talk a lot about
730600	735400	sense making, David, and you can't sense make it. If you can't make sense of any of these
735400	740760	relationships, if they've been broken, and I do think that so much of the kind of madness in the
740760	745240	culture at the moment, apart from being driven by social media, is also just actually being driven
745240	749640	by the destruction of things which, for millennia, we've thought were completely normal, including
749640	753320	what motherhood is and what fatherhood is and what families are and what it means to be in a place.
754040	758600	All of this kind of stuff that nobody had to question much. Now suddenly, everything has to
758600	762120	be questioned. And there aren't really answers, because it doesn't make sense.
764120	768600	Yeah, I want to, it's a good question. And I wonder whether this is going to help make more
768600	775800	sense or less sense, bringing in the sort of metaphysical dimension, because you both talk
775800	781800	about this. And the concept that people may or may not be familiar with the kind of
781800	787240	Gnosticism, the idea that this is a very deep-rooted pattern of thinking where the real world is
787240	793960	somehow fake, is somehow kind of an illusion, and actually, there's a sort of inner essence that
793960	798440	is real, is sort of very much mimicked. I think both of you have referred to this in your writings,
798440	803800	is kind of mimicked in the way that our attitude to the world now seems to be. And so I wonder,
803800	807720	do you think that kind of, I'd love to hear about the sort of the metaphysical frame that you
807800	812200	are both bringing, and also whether you think that that kind of makes things more intelligible or
812200	819400	less? I've used the phrase fully automated luxury Gnosticism. With a slightly flippantly,
819400	825480	I've borrowed it from Aaron Bastani's book, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, where he imagines that
825480	830600	actually left wing utopia is going to be attained by the automation of everything, presumably the
830600	834120	liquefaction translation of everything into standing reserve, which is just going to bring
834120	840440	about a world of eternal abundance for everyone somehow. With apologies to Bastani, I've not
840440	845400	actually read the book, but I gather that that's the gist of it, Fully Automated Luxury Communism,
845400	853240	so I borrowed that for Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, which is, well, I don't believe it's
853240	861080	coming, but I think it's an aspiration which is being sold to us, of which the reality is perhaps
861080	866680	less appealing. If you like, it's Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism is this kind of high sounding
866680	871400	promise that we're all going to be able to escape the constraints of our body into something
872360	876680	into a miraculous world where really we can do anything, whether that's the metaverse and
877320	881960	with a haptic interface that means somehow we can see and feel and touch and taste
881960	887560	things in this imaginary digitally constructed world, and we'll never actually need to have any
887560	892360	kind of reference back to what's happening in our physical, in the physical plane at all.
892920	899480	Or, you know, any number of other sort of techno fixes for the problems of materiality and the
899480	903880	problems of embodiment. I suppose it's one of those things where I sort of mean first and ask
903880	910360	questions later or decide what it is I mean by it later. Well, I mean, you often end up, I mean,
910360	914040	I started, I did that with reactionary feminism as well, and it's completely turned into a thing.
914040	918600	So sometimes, sometimes it's just good to go, it's good to walk backwards for a bit and see
918600	924920	where you end up. So yeah, I mean, but Paul, Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, you know,
924920	929400	can we, can we fully automate it? How luxurious would it be? You know, how Gnostic is it?
931960	936440	It is interesting that there's the notion of Gnosticism is floating around a bit at the moment.
936440	943320	So historically, the Gnostic movement was a sort of very loose collection of beliefs that were
943320	947480	around in the early centuries of the Christian church. And the Christian church declared them
947480	953800	heretical because effectively Gnosticism says, as you suggest, David, that this world is either,
953800	958440	is either fake or it's something to be transcended. So what you do with, I mean, Gnosis literally means
958440	964200	knowledge. It means a kind of secret knowledge. So the Gnostic movement is, is promoted and still
964200	968440	promotes actually the idea that you can escape the body and the physical realm if you have the
968440	973400	right kind of secret knowledge. And the Christians said and say that this is a heresy because
973400	979080	Christianity is embodied, just as Christ was a kind of melding of the human and the divine.
979080	986440	That's what we are. And so Christianity is not the Christian claim is not that we're going to
986440	990600	escape from physical reality and float off to somewhere better. It's that physical reality
990600	995720	can be transformed. Whereas the Gnostic say, no, this is basically a hell. And the Gnostic tradition
995720	1002200	also has the has this great notion of the demiurge. There's an evil being who thinks he's God,
1002200	1006840	and he is the one who has created matter. And so matter is inherently evil. And so the human
1006840	1012440	spirit is a divine spark trapped in matter and we want to escape from it back to the back to the
1012440	1016920	place where we belong. So it's not much of a leap from that to Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse.
1016920	1020840	It's not much of a leap from that to what Silicon Valley is doing. I mean, openly doing and openly
1020840	1026680	talking about which is attempting to transcend the messy horribleness of physical reality so
1026680	1031240	that we don't have to die so that we don't have to give birth so that we don't have to be the sex
1031240	1037560	that we were born so that we don't have to be anything that's actually relational and anything
1037560	1044120	that limits what we imagine our free will is. This is my daughter visiting the podcast there
1045080	1050760	because it's so interesting. Yeah, so that's I mean, and it is exactly that that's the Gnostic
1050760	1057480	promise today. And it's it's the notion that the physical reality of stuff is escapable. But this
1057480	1061000	time we're not doing it through secret Gnostic religious knowledge, we're doing it through
1061000	1066200	technology, which is our equivalent of that. And it's no joke to say that this is exactly where
1066200	1069720	the project is headed. You only have to listen to Ray Kurzweil speaking or any of these other
1069720	1073560	guys in Silicon Valley, Elon Musk or any of them, they're very open about this. It's the
1074600	1077720	great dream of where we're supposed to end up. And I think Mary's right, we're not going to get
1077720	1081240	there because of all sorts of actual physical realities that are going to get in the way.
1081880	1085800	But I think we're going to do a lot of damage as we attempt to. And I also think it's an elite
1085800	1090040	project, you know, it's not something that's available to the majority of humanity. This is,
1090040	1092840	you know, this is something you do in your New Zealand bunker, primarily.
1094680	1098600	Well, there are some there are deep photographs doing the rounds of people where, you know,
1098600	1104120	homeless guys with metaverse golfers on. And actually, that's good. It's egalitarian at least.
1105160	1110120	Right. Right. Right. Also an incredibly bleak advert for the metaverse itself,
1111080	1117480	which I think accidentally says the quiet part out loud, where some washed up old dog who used
1117480	1121800	to have a great life being the life and soul of the party or, you know, loved and surrounded by
1121800	1127480	friends and is now lonely and, you know, doesn't live on his own and miserable and, you know,
1127480	1133240	but basically has a crap life and comes into the metaverse and just makes it all come back again,
1133240	1138600	but fictionally and digitally created. And that's a happy ending to the story.
1140040	1144040	Well, in fact, what the advert is saying very clearly is if you have a shit life,
1144040	1147240	come and sit in the metaverse and you can pretend it's not so shit.
1148520	1150840	You know what it always strikes good news apparently.
1151400	1156360	Yeah, I mean, this is like the matrix written from the point of view of a script in which
1156360	1162040	Agent Smith is the good guy, isn't it? This is where we are. We've been 20 years on,
1162040	1166840	we're 20 years on and we've just we're telling the same story, but now it's good news. Yeah.
1168840	1174040	And as you said, I don't actually think we're going to get there because it's somebody still
1174040	1178680	has to take the bins out, bluntly. I mean, this again is the feminist point. You know,
1178680	1182200	somebody still has to do the dishes. And even if it's a machine does the dishes,
1182200	1188280	someone still has to unload the dishwasher. You know, so it is eventually titles all the way
1188280	1194600	down. Somebody still has to grow the food. And all of and even if you build robots to grow the food,
1194600	1198920	somebody's got to service the robots. And then somebody's got to do the dishes for them somewhere
1198920	1203560	at the bottom is somebody doing the dishes. And they're probably not in the metaverse while they're
1203560	1209320	doing the dishes. So yeah, it's an elite project at the end of the day. And someone somewhere
1209320	1211960	is cleaning up the rubbish that's left behind after the big party.
1214840	1221160	Yeah, and you had a really interesting insight as well that there's a kind of the memetic warfare
1221160	1225720	that goes alongside of the information warfare that goes alongside it seems to be more and more
1225720	1237320	about any kind of hint of fixity or reality is now called essentialism is now kind of to be
1237320	1242920	attacked memetically, I guess. And that that I find a really interesting development.
1242920	1250840	Not just essentialism, it's fascism. To state that limits exist and continue to exist,
1250840	1256520	no matter how hard you push against them is is now is now framed straightforwardly as fascist.
1257320	1260280	You know, even if you're just observing something which is there, you know,
1260280	1263320	the act of noticing it is makes you crypto fascist.
1263720	1267960	Yeah, it's a very, very interesting one. There's this whole notion of essentialism,
1268760	1272760	which has become such a boo word on the left. And as Mary says, very quickly becomes an accusation
1272760	1278920	of fascism. Apart from being a stupid representation of actually what fascism is, it's just very,
1278920	1285960	it's very telling that the people who use that language who always self titled progressives
1287080	1292120	believe that as you say, any any kind of limits, any kind of actual roots in the natural world
1292840	1298200	is is not only evil, but it's somehow associated with like the worst political project in human
1298200	1303400	history. And it's, you know, it's not it's not just it's not even just a smear, it's like there's
1303400	1308680	a real belief in this, you know, there's there's a real sense that if you are talking about limits
1308680	1314840	being either even real or beneficial, or having to live within say your own body or live with the
1314840	1321720	natural world as it is or whatever it is, then you are somehow pushing at the door of some kind of
1321720	1328120	yeah, vicious ethnocentric racial warfare or whatever it is. And it's like it's almost like
1328120	1332280	people have had their minds bent by the machine to believe that if you actually have to live within
1332280	1338200	the God given limits of nature, or if you use a phrase like that, then, you know, you're such a
1338200	1342200	troubling person that you have to be removed. So who's left? The only people who are left are
1342200	1347960	people who believe there are no limits at all. And in this kind of merger of, I suppose, progressive
1347960	1353880	left ideology and machine Gnosticism, it's very weird. And it's happening very quickly as well.
1353880	1359480	And it's almost impossible in some cases to have conversations, you know, about this without, as
1359480	1366600	Mary says, having the having the F word thrown at you, which is, yeah, again, I think in other
1366600	1370440	in other maybe more sane parts of the world and in other more sane times, these conversations
1370440	1373640	are possible, they were possible five years ago, 10 years ago, you know, you could sit around talking
1373640	1378760	about all this Huxley. And there would be no problem. But suddenly, it's accelerated into a
1378760	1383800	very strange place. I mean, it does. It depends a little bit where you stand and who you're
1383800	1388760	speaking to. I think just a very immediate example, my very good friend, Louise Perry,
1388760	1393320	who's recently written a book about the case against the sexual revolution,
1393320	1397480	when which she argues from her background is as a broadly left liberal feminist,
1398440	1403960	who's sort of but but working, but worked in a rape shelter and left her questioning a lot of
1403960	1408440	a lot of what she had internalized about what the sexual revolution meant, who it was for,
1409000	1413320	and what it was actually doing. And so she's written a whole book about her perspective on
1413320	1417320	this with chapter titles that I would think sort of would have been, as you say, five years ago,
1417320	1421560	very difficult to argue with, like loveless sex is not empowering, people are not commodities,
1421560	1424920	you know, listen to your mother, all sort of fairly, fairly sensible, you would think
1425000	1431560	straightforward statements to make. And somebody, somebody of, you know, within within the academy
1433400	1440520	posted the screenshot of her chapter headings today, saying this is a real mask off moment,
1440520	1444120	you know, look at this, look at the horrors which are which are coming forth from, you know,
1444120	1450200	the various other sort of imputations of the F word. And I mean, but the and was then then
1450200	1455160	received quite a lot of replies to the effect of which bit of people are not commodities,
1455160	1460360	are you objecting to them? And really, really, the response was, though, there is nothing here
1460360	1463960	that any of us disagree with, you know, this is actually not really this is this is this all
1463960	1469960	sounds very sensible, which which indeed it does, you know, loveless sex really is not empowering,
1469960	1475480	certainly not to women anyway. But there are, I suppose what I'm trying to say is there are a
1475480	1481560	lot of people out there who see this stuff, and feel endlessly wordlessly frustrated with this
1481560	1488920	stuff. And, and don't just just aren't really sure how to mobilize against this stuff, because
1488920	1494120	it's because the the the sort of integrated message messaging apparatus, which is transmitting,
1494120	1501000	it seems, seems very well articulated and very, very sort of all encompassing. But actually,
1501000	1506360	it isn't actually, it isn't creeped through the cracks, people still have eyes and functioning
1506360	1511080	brains. Because because this would be a sort of pushback, sorry to interrupt, this would be a sort
1511080	1515640	of pushback, I think, saying, Well, maybe there are, because with social media, especially, it's
1515640	1519880	very easy to make any kind of case and say, Well, everyone thinks this one, actually, maybe it's
1519880	1524280	just a few people, because the pushback would be, okay, maybe there's a few people who are kind of
1524280	1528280	saying that this person's a fascist for for asserting that there are kind of gender roles or
1528280	1535800	whatever. But is this not is this not kind of nut picking, kind of extreme examples, rather than
1535800	1542600	kind of a wider mood or a wider kind of feeling? Well, I think the sort of I would say there's
1542600	1547480	two ways of looking at that. It's very difficult to discern what public opinion actually is now,
1547480	1554600	because Twitter both is and is not the real world. And you know. And also, you know, there are,
1554600	1560440	I think you can you can argue about how how impactful a silent majority actually is compared
1560440	1566760	to the concerted efforts of a very small group of extremely committed zealots, which, you know,
1566760	1571160	I think if you look at history, it tend to be more effective than any amount of silent majority.
1571720	1576280	So, so from that perspective, you know, the cards are the cards are stacked in favor of the fully
1576280	1580360	automated luxury Nostics, because they have the mic and they really, really, really believe this
1580360	1588600	stuff. But I don't know, I think there are, I think that I really think there are hard limits
1588600	1595320	to it. You know, there are hard limits to how how much women, as has been very abundantly evident
1595320	1599320	in Britain recently, and increasingly so in America, too, there are limits to how much women
1599320	1606120	will tolerate being told that a woman is anybody who says they're a woman, for example, you know,
1606120	1612840	which is which is the most egregious and the most in your face, battlefront in the in the
1612840	1619320	push for no limits whatsoever on in turn, in individual self actualization on any terms whatsoever.
1619320	1626600	That's the most sort of that that's the most egregious front in that particular. I mean,
1626600	1631880	there are there are many others. But it's also it's also the one which is mobilizing the most
1631880	1636360	sort of cross party resistance. Because I mean, if you've grown, if you've grown a new human
1636360	1641000	inside your literal uterus, you know what a woman is. And it's also notable how many of the people
1641000	1645640	how many of the men who pay lip service to this idea that a woman is anybody who says they're
1645640	1650280	already immediately knows what a woman is the moment they want to render uterus. You know, there
1650280	1655560	are these all this stuff is very it's it's full of slippages and it's full of bad faith and it's
1655560	1660360	full of inconsistency and everybody knows that to be the case. Because at the end of the day,
1660360	1665320	you know, the the liquefaction of everything, I've just been writing a chapter about this
1665320	1669480	actually, you know, is that the this the the liquefaction of everything doesn't actually work
1669480	1673160	because because it's premised on the idea that there's no such thing as nature and no such
1673160	1678680	thing as human nature. And that's not actually true. So what it does in the end is it it successfully
1678680	1684840	liquefies all of the norms or all of these established structures. But because because
1684840	1689800	human nature continues to exist, it then it simply reframes that as a set of supply and demand
1689800	1696120	problems. So instead of instead of having, you know, codes for in the instead of having courtship
1696120	1702200	rituals, you have the sexual marketplace. And that's a straightforward reordering of the the
1702200	1707560	sex differences between men and women, you know, which, you know, had quite elaborate social codes
1707560	1711800	ordered around them, you know, in order to kind of balance the balance the interests of men and
1711800	1716600	women, you know, under particular economic circumstances, you liquefy that you blow it
1716600	1719400	all out of the water and say no, actually, everybody can just do what they want now.
1720200	1724600	But and what what happens is not that everybody does what they want. Exactly. What have because
1724600	1729960	people still people still have urges which are not rational. And some of those are connected to
1729960	1735720	reproductive roles, they just are. But but instead, but and because this stuff goes on existing,
1735720	1739640	it just it just gets reabsorbed into the marketplace and it becomes a set of supply and
1739640	1745240	demand problems. And the same the same is now happening with biological sex, you know, it's
1745240	1749640	either being, you know, the desire to be one sex or another is being is being reimagined as a set
1749640	1753640	of supply and demand problems. You know, there are already medical papers out there, we are talking
1753640	1758920	about, you know, uterus transplants into men who men who identify as women. I don't know where they're
1758920	1764520	going to get the uterus is from, but presumably from from women who identify as men or who knows,
1764520	1769000	who knows anyway, there's this is being imagined as you know, a set of Lego parts that could just
1769000	1772680	be swapped so that they're in the right place, presumably through some sort of marketplace.
1772680	1775960	And the same goes again for babies, you know, women are still the only people who can just
1775960	1782600	date new humans. So so here again, because we were we're in the process of liquefying all of the
1782600	1787960	norms. But but we haven't in the process successfully managed to abolish the underlying
1787960	1794120	material facts, you know, on which those norms are built. We just end up we end up reimagining
1794120	1797720	them as a set of supply and demand problems. So now if you need a uterus, you just go and rent one.
1798680	1805400	And but the point is the liquefaction doesn't work. And so the and my sense is there's a
1805960	1810920	there's a kind of frustration there among the automated luxury nostics, because every time
1810920	1814520	they try and every time they try and get to the bottom, to the point where actually we really
1814520	1819960	have just attained full grey goo Satanism. It just it never quite works because it's because
1819960	1824280	there's always there's always another level of materiality, which has its patterns and continues
1824280	1831960	to be what it is. And I, it's a very depressing, very pessimistic sort of a hope. But I do, I
1831960	1837960	have some, you know, if I have hope, it's in the fact that that that persists. It just is. And
1837960	1842600	it doesn't matter how many times you try and liquefy, it continues. Yeah, and I think that's
1842600	1846920	really, that's a great summary of it all. I mean, this is, I've written quite a few times in these
1846920	1852840	essays and doing at the moment about the how revolutions effectively, especially progressive
1852920	1856920	revolutions always clear the ground for the machine. They think they're creating a utopia.
1856920	1860360	And what actually happens from the French Revolution onwards, is you destroy all the
1860360	1865160	customary structures, you destroy the traditions, you destroy the structures from families to
1865160	1870040	community level structures up to church level, you literally you, you know, you burn down the
1870040	1874120	churches and you try to destroy the family and you read it to be the land. And what happens then
1874120	1878200	is you just create a void and into the void commerce rushes. And so as Mary says, everything
1878200	1883400	becomes commodified. And so the result of your grand utopian progressive revolution is not
1883400	1887480	a fairer world. It's effectively a world that is more commodified, more individualistic,
1888600	1892760	and more, more prey to the machine. And that brings us to the point after about 200 years
1892760	1897480	that we've got to now where everything is a commodity. But there are a lot of people who
1897480	1902440	consider themselves to be progressive who have confused out with liberation. And this is really
1902440	1907160	what liberation has come down to as Mary is also saying better than me is liberation from nature
1907160	1911320	at all levels, liberation from the body, liberation from everything around you. And
1911320	1915240	this this I think explains the kind of the people who scream about fascism and the people who are
1915240	1919480	so committed to this is they genuinely think, well, effectively, they're blanks latest, right,
1919480	1924680	they genuinely believe that if you can remove all of the supposed change the tires down from
1924680	1930040	from the reality of biological sex to the existence of family to national culture to
1930040	1935320	whatever it is that you think is getting in the way of equality in utopia. Then we're all
1935320	1938680	then we're all the same. And then we can indeed all choose to have babies ought to be men ought to
1938680	1942840	be women ought to live anywhere ought to be whatever we want. But that's not true because
1942840	1947880	we're hefted, you know, we're hefted and we're rooted in whatever cultural or background or
1947880	1954280	biology we have. And there are some things you shouldn't, you can't get away from. But also
1954280	1958840	you shouldn't want to because they actually make you human. And that's the thing that there's this
1958840	1965080	notion that these structures that have always in most societies and most times been customary
1965080	1971240	from the family to the village to the religious institution, whatever it is, that they are
1971240	1976600	bad things which which limit us as opposed to the possibility that they are actually things
1976600	1983800	which enrich us and which structure our urges in useful ways. And that's that's the point where
1983800	1989640	can I have to probably painfully rediscover that we we probably built these structures for a reason
1989640	1993400	and we lived in certain ways for a reason. And however imperfect those ways might have been for
1993400	1998600	lots of people, and they're hardly unimprovable, they still probably built on a knowledge of human
1998600	2003640	nature that we're now pretending isn't there anymore. And yeah, we're getting to the point
2003640	2009320	where we've deconstructed almost everything. And as Mary said, there's a kind of there's a grinning
2009320	2015560	face at the bottom of it is not looking good. I've come I've come gradually to the conclusion
2015560	2020920	that actually gender ideology is mostly particularly transgender children. It's
2020920	2026760	are being instrumentalized, you know, there are some seriously distressed people who are for
2026760	2031800	for all men or a number of range of different often quite complicated, you know, personally
2031800	2036360	very painful reasons, you're deeply unhappy in their bodies and in the world as it is,
2036360	2041080	you know, and I think that's that's often a rational response to finding themselves in a
2041080	2045240	very in an absolutely intolerable place, you know, particularly adolescent women,
2046200	2049880	who find themselves in a world so saturated with porn that actually to me it seems a
2049880	2054280	completely reasonable response to take hormones that make that make you resemble a male and cut
2054280	2059640	off your breasts. I mean, I would probably be tempted if I were 14 today. So, you know, from
2059640	2065640	that point of view, I have no I have no beef with with people who are trying to find some relief
2066200	2072440	in in a embodied condition that they find intolerable. You know, that's not who I pick
2072440	2079160	a fight with. But what what I see is a subset of very distressed people who are being instrumentalized
2079160	2083880	in pursuit of a much bigger project, which is the deregulation of human nature as such.
2084520	2088920	If you like the deregulation of the of the human body, you know, much the same way as
2088920	2093960	the financial sector was deregulated in the 1980s, the aim is to deregulate the body
2094680	2099720	and deregulate the idea that we had that the body has a nature, because that opens that opens up
2101240	2107640	boundless commercial sphere in which, you know, organs regenerate self regenerating organs can
2107640	2112040	be synthesized in laboratories. Human animal chimeras can be developed for who knows what
2112040	2116200	purposes. I mean, you know, the possibilities are endless if you're a mad scientist with no
2116200	2124600	no ethics. But you have to you have to render an inexcusably low status, any sort of the
2124600	2130760	currently still pervasive common conviction act with truth, in fact, not conviction truth,
2130760	2135320	that humans have a nature, and that, you know, males are normatively one way and females are
2135320	2139560	normatively another. And, you know, humans have a normal number of limbs and so on and so forth.
2139560	2144680	You have to you have to completely denormalize destabilize and liquefy that consensus before
2144680	2149320	you before you can embark on the, you know, deregulatory business opportunities that flow
2149320	2156280	from that. Yeah, no, I think that's right. That's exactly what's happening. And the demonizing of
2156280	2161640	the of the turfs and the fascists and everybody else is precisely part of that project, which is
2161880	2167320	to silence and to provide endless new names for the people who are saying exactly that.
2168840	2173480	Really interesting what you're saying about the, like, what is the sort of the
2174440	2178760	question that arises? Like, what's the most fundamental driver? Because you you mentioned,
2178760	2185800	Paul, that you felt like commerce was filling the gap of this sort of revolutionary moment.
2186520	2191000	But are you saying that you think commerce is is actually the driver or is the driver
2191720	2196040	deeper? Is the driver some kind of, I mean, you've called it the machine, but how
2196040	2199880	where do you think that machine lives? Do you think it's kind of a psychological structure or a
2201640	2206360	yeah, what what do you think is actually, because it's also kind of for me kind of maps onto some
2206360	2211720	of the conspiracy thinking as well, where I see a lot of the time people kind of collapse around
2212680	2218360	looking for an agent, a specific agent or a specific set of agents, whereas actually there
2218360	2224680	is a sort of tendency towards often that seems deeper. So where where do you locate those those
2224680	2229560	drivers? Yeah, well, I have a terrible feeling that the driver is metaphysical. I mean, this is not
2229560	2235000	just about making money. There's a lot of interest in that. But there's I keep I always talk about
2235000	2239160	this fascinating book by Kevin Kelly called What Technology Wants, which is a really good book to
2239240	2243480	read. You should read it, Mary, if you haven't already, it's a few years old now, but it's
2243480	2247720	Kevin Kelly is one of the Silicon Valley guys. And he's very much into the notion that
2248360	2252040	something is being created, which he calls the technium, which is pretty much the same as I
2252040	2258200	suppose why I'm calling the machine. And he says, look, this thing is becoming self aware. And
2258200	2262760	that's the point, right? It's starting to manage itself is starting to push its own direction,
2262760	2268600	starting to starting to manifest. And this is again, the attitude of a lot of the guys behind
2268680	2274920	this project that they think they're creating the next, they think they're building the next
2274920	2278520	level of evolutionary consciousness. You know, this is why they're so obsessed at the moment,
2278520	2282920	I think with artificial intelligence, they really think they can create post humans. And they think
2282920	2287720	perhaps this is Kevin Kelly's explicit notion that humanity is just a stepping stone on the
2288680	2292440	way to something greater, greater consciousness that they're helping to build, but which is also
2292440	2297880	weirdly manifesting through them. So it's a very quasi religious thing that is happening. I'm not
2297880	2302120	saying everybody involved in it believes that there's a lot of profiteering just, and a lot of
2302120	2305800	kind of mind is following the herd. But there's something going on with the creation of this
2306440	2316440	post human metaverse machine, machine, machinist sort of post human, anti human, non human
2317640	2322360	world in which it literally is it's a metaphysical project in which they're trying to recreate or
2322360	2327640	build a heaven on earth, entirely reconstructed. I mean, you hear it a lot when people talk about
2327640	2331720	how they want to go and live in, they want to terraform Mars or they want to fly off and live
2331720	2337160	on moon bases. Because that's the fantasy, the explicit fantasy of how they can create an entire
2337160	2345080	planet right from the dust up in their own image. So there's something in it that is very much bigger
2345080	2351480	than just a kind of profit scrabble. And again, you don't need a conspiracy theory in which there
2351480	2356440	are six evil people in a bunker making a plan. You just need enough people to buy into something
2357160	2361160	which is moving already, which I think is where we're going. And it's kind of the inevitable
2361960	2366600	result of the whole attitude, the whole worldview of modernity, I think, to come back to what we
2366600	2370760	started with, with the notion of the rational individual who can detach himself from nature
2370760	2375240	and build his own paradise. Now we've got the technology to do it, but we will have soon.
2376200	2380200	And that's really what encompasses the whole thing, I think. So it's an ideology or even
2380200	2385720	a religious worldview that drives it, I think. You said, I feel like you're sidling along the
2385720	2389480	edge of implying that it's not so much that we have ideas as that ideas have us.
2391560	2395560	Yeah, well, I think that's true. I suppose, yeah, that's not a bad way of putting it.
2396280	2400600	We are, I mean, I think you see this really manifesting on social media. It's one reason
2400600	2407000	I don't have any social media accounts. People are being entirely controlled by ideas and by
2407000	2415000	visions and by ideologies or whatever these things are. They're not the great, the famous
2415000	2420760	I support the current thing meme is quite funny, but it also has a kind of deeper meaning to it,
2420760	2425560	which is that there's, you know, you're being controlled when you're on your smartphone looking
2425560	2431240	at this stuff, you can feel it. And so, yeah, ideas have us, memes have us, metaphysics have us
2431240	2437960	entirely, I think. And they can almost become self-replicating in the age of the machine and they are.
2438840	2444120	I would agree with that. I mean, I'm hopelessly compromised in that way, Paul,
2445880	2449000	for fully cognizant of my cyborg state.
2449000	2452840	Well, you're so good at meming, Mary, it would be a shame if you thought.
2453720	2456120	Well, you can't be completely unplugged if you've noticed that.
2456760	2460760	No, I'm not completely unplugged. No, I do pop in here and there. And one of the reasons I don't
2460760	2465960	have social media is that I know very well, because I did have a Twitter account for a while
2465960	2469640	years ago. I know very well that I would get tempted to start doing exactly the same thing.
2469640	2473800	I'd get sucked into that really easily. It's not, it's not a puritan position so much as a
2473800	2476840	practical one. I know it would rot my brain. So I keep away.
2478200	2483160	Yeah, I'm very ambivalent about my own relationship to Twitter. But one, I suppose the thing I wanted
2483160	2488200	to lob in here, which is it's a conversation I've had a number of times with, you know, other people
2488200	2498520	who are sort of embedded in the cyborg memeplex as I am, who will cheerfully chat to you about the
2498520	2504040	fact that they know perfectly well that the memeplex that you see on the internet is, you know,
2504040	2508360	that the memeplex is real. But the what you, the simulacrum of it you see on the internet is not,
2508360	2513960	it's not the thing. And who can see the difference very clearly. Now, I suspect that there are a
2513960	2518040	lot of people who sport the current thing you can't see the difference. But there are, there are
2518760	2524040	a surprising number of people out there who see what the, what the internet memeplex is a metaphor
2524040	2529400	for and recognise that it actually exists and is out there. See what it's a metaphor for? What do
2529400	2534040	you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Well, I mean, it's actually, what it's a metaphor for
2534040	2537400	is the thing that we started off talking about, you know, when you, when you were referenced,
2537400	2543800	I was talking about patterns and meanings and the relational, the relational nature of everything
2544360	2550520	in, in, in human culture and the natural world. We are another person of, if we're,
2550520	2554040	well, we're talking about, you know, people, shadow people who should be part of this conversation,
2554040	2559960	you know, a dear friend of mine, Wendy Wheeler, who died a couple of years ago, who was a pioneer
2559960	2567720	in biosemiotics, wrote a lot about her work was very, it was multidisciplinary. And it crossed,
2567720	2573720	and it was based on the thesis that everything in the natural world is not, it's not based on
2573800	2577960	information, it's based on meaning, everything in the natural world is a series of relational
2577960	2585320	dialogues between different meaning making systems, which I found an incredibly illuminating way
2585320	2593080	of thinking about how, how organisms exist in relation to one another. But I think one of
2593080	2597480	the classic examples is, you know, there's a lovely video about this somewhere on the internet,
2597480	2603560	what happened, what happened when they reintroduced wolves into, so into a national park in America.
2604120	2612200	And through a concatenating series of impacts that reintroducing the apex predator had on various,
2612200	2617400	various natural systems through the sort of, you know, concatenating interrelations of these
2617400	2621000	various systems, it ended up changing the path of the rivers that ran through the,
2621000	2626600	ran through the nature reserve. Because, because some wolves ate some more, some more large animals,
2626600	2630200	there were, there was a different sort of vegetation and that meant smaller animals went over
2630200	2633720	there instead. And that in turn meant something else and something else and something else and
2633720	2638680	eventually the rivers changed course. And that's what I mean when I say that the memeplex is real.
2639240	2643480	Because in a sense, the normative patterned behaviors of each of these species acting in
2643480	2648440	relationship to one another, you know, acts like a series, it's metaphorically speaking, you could
2648440	2654520	say it's a series of means that, that exist in dynamic dialogue with one another. And in the
2654520	2660280	course of doing that, you know, they, that process, if you like, manifests in, in what we see
2660280	2665240	materially in the natural world. And I suppose that's probably, that's probably the clearest
2665240	2670040	articulation I can give of what I think the actual memeplex is. And that's, and that memeplex,
2670040	2674840	if you like, the actual memeplex is not one in which humans exist as separate from the natural
2674840	2679240	world. Because obviously, we're, we're having impacts on the natural world all the time.
2680200	2684520	I suppose one of the, I keep chickens at home. They stop me if this is getting, getting too
2684520	2690280	weird or too lateral for you. I keep chickens. I think a lot about chickens because I like chickens.
2690280	2694520	You know, they're, they're kind of psychopathic and they're kind of miniature dinosaurs and other
2694520	2699800	things. But, but they're also one of the most successful bird species on, I think they might be
2699800	2703960	the most successful bird species on the planet. And they've done that by existing in a dialogue
2703960	2707640	with humans. You know, they're not the only domesticated animal in that way. And obviously,
2707640	2711480	a lot of them have to take one for the team. But, you know, at a species level, it's a very
2711480	2716840	effective survival strategy. You know, I think there are, there are countless billions of chickens
2716840	2724040	in the world. And it works from a, from a species point of view. But, you know, unless, unless you're
2724040	2728120	a, you're a fully paid up member of the machine, and you want to keep, you want to keep chickens
2728120	2732360	in battery farms. You know, if you're, if you're keeping, if you're keeping animals like that,
2732360	2736040	you sort of, you have to, you have to do so roughly in accordance with their nature.
2737000	2741640	You can, you can exist in a functional, you know, ongoing sustainable dialogue with a domestic
2741640	2746600	animal. But, you know, unless you, unless you imprison them and, and doctor them in various
2746600	2750600	ways to make them tolerate it, you have to, you have to keep them in conditions where they can
2750600	2754120	scratch, for example, if they're chickens or if they're, if they're sheep, they need different
2754120	2758840	conditions. And so, so there's a, there's a kind of ongoing dynamic relationship where, you know,
2758840	2763880	the animal, animal husbandry is partly about meeting the animal where it is. And it's partly
2763880	2769240	about, partly about how a domestic animal does a species level response to that, you know, and
2769240	2773480	over times, you know, specialist breeds evolve. And, you know, there are, there are particular
2773480	2777640	different types of, sorry, I'm probably getting very arcane with this, but it's just, you know,
2777640	2782280	once you get into those, you know, the, the, the semiotics of, of human animal interactions,
2782280	2786760	you know, it's just boundlessly rich terrain. You know, there are, there are, there are
2786760	2792600	differences in how good at giving birth unaided, different, different breeds of sheep are,
2792600	2798040	because I think it's, I think it's the herdwicks, which are, which are normally kept on very barren
2798040	2802840	upland terrain in the, in the north of England. And because you just can't get up there during
2802840	2806680	lambing season, basically the ones, the ones that survive are the ones who can give birth without
2806680	2810840	any help. And there are other breeds of sheep, which are kept in lowland territory under much
2810840	2816840	closer watch, who are, who generally need help, a lot more help with lambing because they, over
2816840	2821400	time, they've just evolved that way. And you can see, you can see how that would work, you know,
2821400	2825640	the herdwicks, the, the herdwicks that make it are the ones, are the offspring of, of mothers,
2825640	2830120	of youths that can, that can give birth on their own. And, and just over time, they've got much
2830120	2834760	better at it. And there are other breeds of sheep, which, which, which aren't. And, and these are,
2834760	2840360	these are the sorts of dynamic interactions between humans and the animal kingdom or,
2841960	2845960	and, and I mean, you, you can, you can point to any number of different examples. I think there's
2845960	2850200	a, another one, which I really like is the North American peppered moth, which over the last
2850280	2856680	hundred years has become, it's become darker as a consequence of evolving in much more
2856680	2860520	polluted conditions. It used to be, it used to be mostly white. I think some of them,
2861240	2864840	then they have, they have different patterns and over, over the last hundred years, they've
2864840	2871080	become darker because the human influence on their environment has, has, has made for,
2871080	2875080	has, has meant they need a different color of camouflage in order to survive. So, so we're
2875080	2879240	constantly existing in dialogue with the natural world, you know, with this sort of memeplex.
2879320	2884280	And I think the, the fundamental fantasy of the machine that we're somehow separable from it
2884280	2888520	and entitled to instrumentalize it, you know, once you, if you look at it from inside the
2888520	2893400	memeplex or you look at it from a perspective of thinking about us as participants in this
2893400	2899880	and entangled in this enormous sort of multi species, interspecies memeplex, it's, it's,
2899880	2904520	it's a sort of monstrous imposition and just a fundamental category error.
2905160	2909160	Yeah. And this, this takes me right back to the point about environmentalism that we talked
2909160	2912600	about right at the beginning, really, where I come in, I suppose, you know, this is a sort
2912600	2917560	of a conversation about Gaia theory, really. This is a conversation about the interconnectedness of
2917560	2921880	all things and the fact that there's no separation between humans of nature and that we're entirely
2921880	2927800	reliant on everything else, but that living in urban interconnected societies, we can very easily
2927800	2933240	pretend that that's not true until we start keeping chickens or any, any number of other things.
2933240	2938920	But it is, it is exactly why it is impossible for the new metaphysics of the machine to succeed in
2938920	2947320	the end, because what it's trying to do is, as I say, recreate, recreate or to create a new world
2947320	2951400	on the basis that the current world is a standing reserve on the basis that the current world is
2951400	2957480	just a fake or not a fake, but a pure material realm that there's nothing to it, that there's
2957480	2960840	no consciousness, why doesn't the human mind that there's no real interconnections that there's
2960840	2966520	nothing, that there's nothing sacred, that there's nothing higher than us, that there's nothing
2967480	2971960	that may be operating outside our purview. And that's not true. And that's not a religious claim
2971960	2976360	either. You can, you can read any number of scientific papers these days about the consciousness
2976360	2981640	of trees and the interconnectedness of fungal mycelia and any number of interesting studies
2981640	2987160	which demonstrate that things that are not human tend to be a lot more conscious and interconnected
2987240	2990840	than we might assume in the modern age, which incidentally is something that most
2990840	2997560	indigenous people know instinctively and traditionally. So that's real. So what we are
2997560	3003880	doing precisely is trying to break apart and instrumentalize and break down into material
3003880	3008280	parts, something which actually is alive that we're part of, which is the planet itself.
3008920	3012920	We're playing, we're literally playing God, except God knows what he's doing and we don't.
3013880	3017400	And that's why, that's why it hits the buffers and it will keep hitting the buffers.
3017400	3021000	And at the micro level, you know, a human body is a real thing and you can't,
3021000	3023640	you can't change it beyond a certain point. And at the macro level,
3024440	3028920	there's something very big and interwoven going on with the planet itself that we don't understand
3028920	3033080	and we can't, and we can't fiddle with beyond a certain point. And we're just going to learn
3033080	3036760	it the hard way. That's what's going to happen. We're going to learn it the hard way because we
3036760	3044280	don't want to learn it by paying attention. I wanted to throw in a concept around this
3044280	3048920	question of like what's driving it. And I wonder whether you both might have seen this,
3048920	3054680	but a lot of talk recently about the kind of concept of the egregore and which is a sort of
3054680	3063240	idea of maybe we are all the individual human brain as connected to a smartphone, just choosing to
3063240	3069640	kind of upregulate certain messages or not based on kind of ideological reasons could be seen as a
3069640	3075400	kind of individual neuron in a wider sort of group consciousness that we're not, we don't know where
3075400	3080680	that is going, that that's sort of almost like a, that could be, do you think that's a useful concept?
3080680	3089400	And that could kind of explain sort of a kind of wider perspective of an intention that we're
3089400	3094600	part of, but we don't fully understand where its destination or direction of travel is.
3095240	3101160	Yeah, well, it's an occult concept, isn't it, egregores? I've seen a few people
3101720	3107320	chatting about it recently. I mean, there's certainly a sense that you can come back to that
3107320	3111560	notion that we're being controlled by something that's bigger than us. And I think fundamentally
3111560	3115160	that is happening through the internet. I wrote quite a fun short story a few years ago called
3115160	3119320	The Basilisk, which was all about this, which I quite enjoyed writing. I should just write
3119320	3122360	short stories because there's a much quicker way of trying to explain all this than putting it in
3122360	3129480	essays. But that was precisely about the possibility that something is controlling us through the web,
3129480	3133800	whether that something is a sort of a mind force that we create in some ways, or whether it's
3133800	3138280	something else. I don't know, but there's something, there's something going on which is bigger than
3138280	3144680	us. The internet has manifested it. And it's part of the craziness. And it's really difficult to
3144680	3150680	pin down. But it's people talking about egregores is one sort of pointer to the fact that people
3150680	3156760	can again feel that there's something much bigger behind the weird on-screen interactions that no
3156760	3162760	one can quite explain or put their finger on. Well, I would love to do a part two where we talk
3162760	3168840	about what we're going to do, what we do now. Because if we've reached the bottom, if we've
3168840	3174440	reached the bottom, and there really is nowhere further down, I mean, there might be a lot along
3174680	3180200	way further down. But if we've reached the point where we've liquefied everything, what happens
3180200	3185240	next, I think that's a question I would love to talk over with you. No, it's a big one. Yeah,
3185240	3190040	how to live through it, how to make sense of it, how to resist it. Yeah, that would be a great chat.
3191000	3194360	Awesome. So this is diagnosis, and then we have a follow up with solution.
3196680	3202120	No promises, no promises. Yeah, Mary, Mary and Paul, thank you very much. Thank you.
3204840	3211560	So I hope you enjoyed that. I really loved the conversation while I was part of it,
3211560	3215720	and I listened to it again afterwards and something really landed. So I'm going to try
3215720	3219480	and explain why I think this is significant. Maybe you can let me know what you make of
3219480	3225480	this in the comments. I think what this conversation was is a moving towards a synthesis position
3225480	3231000	between what you might call dissident right and dissident left. It's explaining how the extreme
3231080	3235560	woke agenda is liquefying all structures, which is what the right is angry about.
3235560	3241000	But Paul explains that ultimately this is in the interests of capital and it's a corporate agenda,
3241000	3245800	which is what the left is upset about. And it also validates the feelings of the conspiracy
3245800	3250840	minded that something coordinated is going on, but locates the source of the problem not in a
3250840	3257560	shadowy cabal, but in the metaphysical, what Paul calls the machine, and Mary calls fully automated
3257560	3264280	luxury Gnosticism. So I think this is inching towards a synthesis position. And what's more
3264280	3270440	powerful is the way that they both deliver their message with wit, intelligence and depth.
3270440	3274760	And with none of the reactivity and anger that characterizes so much of this debate.
3275560	3280600	So I really do think this is a step forward. And I'm looking forward to hosting them again in
3280600	3285320	dialogue, along with rebel wisdom members, which we're going to do soon. So if you want to join
3285320	3290920	that conversation, check out the membership options below in the show notes and hope to see you there.
