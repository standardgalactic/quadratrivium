0	8720	So in the last few days as we see what started in Minneapolis and then went to Atlanta and
8720	13880	Seattle and then everywhere in the US, it's interesting how consuming a new cycle can
13880	20360	make the most concerning issue of three days ago almost completely absent in people's minds
20360	25120	and attention, but you also lose almost all perspective if that happens.
25120	29480	So it's important to kind of pay attention to the sequence of things and the narrative
29480	34640	arc and the things that are not forefront in the attention cycle.
34640	41640	So right before the racial violence became forefront, we were seeing in the US an escalation
41640	48280	towards violence that was very left-right oriented between red state, blue state, having different
48280	52560	focus around how they were going to open and it was kind of showing up as the mass squares
52560	63280	versus the non-mass squares and we saw armed people going to Capitol buildings in protest
63280	67360	of quarantine and shutdown.
67360	73560	We also started to see an increase in racial focus in the news over the week leading up
73560	78960	to the case in Minneapolis that set it all off.
78960	89160	And I'm not going to say like a single narrative of some central command and control function
89160	92400	that I think is orchestrating everything, but I'm going to mention anomalies that I
92400	96520	think you should be paying attention to.
96520	103760	So we see the case of the man who was jogging and the retired cop and his son shot him.
103760	106400	That was like a week before.
106400	114280	And then we see increased news of white supremacy and a lot more images of white guys with guns
114280	116480	at Capitol buildings.
116480	125400	Then we see in relationship to the guy who was running and got shot and there were protests,
125400	130880	black open carry of weapons associated with the protests and then also black open carry
130880	143240	of weapons escorting a black lawmaker to the courthouse or some state building.
143240	148040	And then we see Joe Biden's comments about you ain't black and like just a whole bunch
148040	156440	of increase in race attention in primary news cycles.
156440	159600	And then we see the case with George Floyd.
159600	164800	So there's a big question for me of like, did we just have a particular and unusually
164800	167760	racist week?
167760	174840	Or does the news cycle not actually reflect the background rate of things for other reasons?
174840	182840	And for for every situation like we see with George Floyd, the number of those that aren't
182840	190040	caught like it's just it's just a much less rare phenomena than I think most people think
190040	191040	it is.
191040	199640	Sadly, I think most black people in inner cities know it's not as rare a phenomenon.
199640	206240	So then we see the video circulating that the we see this guy with a hammer and black
206240	211640	tactical gear breaking the windows of the auto zone right in Minneapolis.
211640	218640	And we see people jumping to thinking, assessing that he's a cop as an agent provocateur, or
218640	224200	that he is a Antifa guy or a white supremacist or a Soros agent.
224200	228960	There's a lot of different hypotheses, but a lot of images are surfacing of the buildings
228960	235520	being set on fire and the windows being broken by white people at the black protest rallies
235520	242600	that were not breaking like the initial movement to property destruction and violence was not
242600	244040	actually them.
244040	250000	And broken windows theory is very clear that once like once the first Molotov cocktails
250000	256240	thrown, and it becomes much easier to engage in throwing Molotov cocktails once the first
256240	262360	windows are broken, because there's like a threshold to move past that that has already
262360	263800	been broken.
263800	273640	And so the idea that police officers or people with other agendas infiltrate a protest group
273640	279400	that is otherwise peaceful and throw the first rock to justify use of police force on the
279400	282000	other side, like that's a very well known phenomena.
282000	286080	But right now we can hypothesize a lot of groups that would have a motive to do it for
286080	287080	a lot of reasons.
287080	291400	So some people either are buying the standard narrative or they're too quickly jumping to
291400	295880	the alternate narrative of it was the cop for this reason or it was the white supremacists
295880	303680	trying to blame the black guys or it was the deep state Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden supporting
303680	309000	liberals that are trying to create insight more reason to have people stay at home than
309000	313080	the quarantine already was to move towards their goal to steal an election.
313080	315920	There's like a gazillion hypotheses.
315920	323440	I think the problem is the people who aren't buying the mainstream media narrative are buying
323440	329040	the first alternate narrative that appeals to their sense making desire to not have uncertainty
329040	333800	and put the pieces together before there's adequate evidence that that alternate narrative
333800	337040	is actually much better.
337040	344200	So the guy who broke the windows was definitely not a normal part of the protest, but I don't
344200	352720	know who he was an agent for or what the motive was because the data that suggests any of
352720	355880	the 10 different hypotheses are not solid yet.
355880	362880	So one of the things I'm wanting to encourage is don't let your attention cycle be controlled
362880	367320	by the attention cycle of your social media feed or your mainstream news.
367320	368960	That's one thing.
368960	375560	The other thing is be very careful about how easy it is to get induced into being on one
375560	378360	side of group think and conflict theory.
378360	382960	Let's talk about conflict theory for a moment.
382960	389520	There's a few types of natural cleavings or easy cleavings, if not natural, where it's
389520	393160	very easy to drive conflict between people.
393160	394920	Political left right is a very easy one.
394920	397120	You can do red state, blue state stuff.
397120	404120	You can do they have a make America great again hat versus a rainbow gay flag.
404120	409360	They're literally wearing flags of different kinds to symbolize red shirt, blue shirt,
409360	414080	like the type of team they're in, and then you can drive conflict between them, which
414080	418920	both creates a sense of clear sense making of I know who my team is.
418920	426440	I know what the group think of the narrative on my side is.
426440	428880	The red, blue is very easy.
428880	431640	People versus the cops is very easy.
431640	433240	Race issues are very easy.
433240	442880	Race is maybe the easiest because it's where the flag is biologically built in.
442880	449080	If everybody here has not studied conflict theory, you're going to have a hard time making
449080	453960	sense of the world without a good model of how conflict arises between people, how it
453960	457480	gets intentionally stirred up, how people resolve it.
457480	464000	There's a lot of different schools of conflict theory that are worth studying, but at minimum
464000	472000	everybody should know Rene Girard's work.
472000	474680	I'm not saying that I agree with Girard.
474680	480840	There are things that he said that were extremely insightful.
480960	488440	Specifically, his idea is that the fundamental nature of conflict comes from the fact that
488440	496160	desire is memetic, meaning that we learn to want stuff the same way we learn language
496160	502040	by watching other people, and that I don't know Mandarin and I don't know Swahili and
502040	504480	I don't know Dutch because I didn't watch people speaking those.
504480	509120	I watched people speak in English, so I got conditioned to think in a worldview through
509160	515520	aesthetic frames, through it's very deep how much my whole identity and everything was
515520	517640	conditioned by what I watched.
517640	524960	His argument is that much of what we want is also conditioned by watching people.
524960	530800	We end up innately wanting what other people have, which means that desire inexorably drives
530800	531800	conflict.
531800	537520	Somebody, people have stuff, you want that thing or similar kinds of things, then as
537560	541880	more people are wanting the same things and conflicting over it, the conflict itself becomes
541880	542880	memetic.
542880	548840	People learn through mimesis to identify with the Zionist or the anti-Zionist side based
548840	553680	on which side of the wall they grew up on or whatever the conflict they happen to have
553680	555400	been born into.
555400	561320	Then in Girard's model, the conflict continues to increase until there's so much embodied
561320	566160	energy that you're going to get something like a war and the least violent way to deal
566200	572440	with it is to have a scapegoat, a sacrificial, rather than a all against all war, be able
572440	579520	to have some sacrificial person that is able to be effectively blamed for the whole scenario
579520	584800	and then we're able to take them out and decrease the embodied conflict energy for a while and
584800	591320	then the cycle has to repeat.
591480	599280	Girard's work really says that historically has been no way out of that and the role of
599280	605160	various religions was to figure out how to do scapegoating well and that that's what
605160	610960	all of the sacrifices of various religious traditions were about, that Christianity was
610960	615240	actually trying to get rid of scapegoating by showing that the person they scapegoated
615240	620760	was actually innocent and not only innocent but the highest kind of innocent so that the
620760	626320	way people would get out of his answer actually of how you get out of scapegoating was everyone
626320	630680	developed Christ-like virtues.
630680	634920	But specifically as critique said that by getting rid of religion and this is relevant
634920	639080	to the goals of this group that is trying to re-invoke some of the things religion did
639080	647200	like the development of human virtue, by getting rid of religion we got rid of the way of
647280	655320	dealing with the memetic conflict while simultaneously getting much much larger weapons of destruction
655320	660880	so that rather than have things heat up in Europe and kill a Jew sacrificially it had
660880	669360	to be this massive kind of killing of all of these Jews and so okay so why am I bringing
669360	676880	that up?
676960	685440	I think it's very easy to, I think there are lots of reasons to want to drive conflict
685440	691640	and to want to keep groups of people having attention focused in different ways.
691640	697480	Maybe this is actually the way I'll talk about it.
697480	702040	Power pretty much translates to power over other people.
702080	707040	To have power over their behaviors whether I want people to vote for me in a particular
707040	712440	way or I want them to buy my stuff or I want them to publicly support my ideas I need to
712440	718160	control other people's behavior to control their behavior I need to control their minds.
718160	727200	And so warfare is main mainly not fought with bullets like the kinetic warfare that we think
727200	732360	of as warfare that's fought with weapons is maybe one percent of warfare.
732360	737520	Ninety-nine percent of warfare is diplomatic warfare, political warfare, economic warfare,
737520	740120	narrative warfare, information warfare.
740120	745400	All of this comes together to what we call hybrid warfare or really just politics or
745400	750000	game theory or the game of power.
750000	757400	But think of it as a hybrid or population-centric warfare.
757400	764840	So in this war the treasure being fought over is people's minds and the battleground
764840	768440	is people's minds.
768440	778960	The primary weapons are tools of narrative influence and emotional evocation and control
778960	783520	of the information flows.
783520	788240	And in these wars they're asymmetric wars because you have some actors that have access
788240	798440	to billion or trillion-dollar level information technologies, AI-empowered micro-targeting.
798440	800880	And then you have other people that are just trying to figure shit out on their own and
800880	803480	they don't even know they're in a war.
803480	807160	And they don't even know that their own mind is the battleground of the war and they think
807160	810000	they believe the shit they believe and they think they came to it on their own.
810000	816200	They think they're doing a good job sense-making and they don't realize that as they're researching
816200	820800	of the trillions of pages of shit they could see, the ones that they will ever even be
820800	825760	able to see based on what shows up in their YouTube feed or their Google search or manipulated
825760	830840	by algorithms that have agendas behind them.
830840	834840	As well as the original source material of whoever put it out for which reasons.
835840	843120	Okay, so zooming out from the current violence for a moment, we have an election coming up
843120	852280	in the US that will be radically consequential for the world, either way.
852280	858480	No matter who wins currently, whether the election is illegally tampered with and stolen
858480	863800	or not, half of the population will think it was.
863800	866120	This is a real problem, right?
866120	870400	Because what happens when a third to a half of the population no matter which way it goes
870400	874080	thinks that it was stolen and thinks it was radically consequential?
874080	883360	Well, like one of two really bad things happens, either the people get violent, much more so
883360	887440	than we currently have.
887440	891480	And that sets off one whole cascade of scenarios where they don't get violent and the people
891480	897800	who want to steal elections get even clearer that they just can with impunity.
897800	902480	So we're like, fuck, what do we do with this moving forward?
902480	905760	Now, mail-in ballots.
905760	912720	Are mail-in ballots easier to corrupt than in-person voting?
912720	915800	Yep, totally.
915800	921080	And COVID, as one reason, violence could be another, but COVID is one reason to have
921080	926040	mail-in ballots like, might there be reasons associated with that?
926040	927040	Yeah.
927040	931240	Now, might there be reasons that people who really want Trump out of office would want
931240	936280	to initiate things that make Trump look worse and that say, look at all the bad shit that's
936280	938840	happening during Trump?
938840	945040	We could also talk about what motives the Trump campaign would have to be engaged in
945040	948760	something where you wouldn't want transfer of power to occur.
948760	960080	So there's a version of this that is easy to buy for either political leaning.
960080	964520	I don't find that most successful politicians that I have encountered near the top of the
964520	968880	power actually believe red versus blue ideology.
968880	973360	They just believe in the game of power and they signal red versus blue ideology as part
973360	978480	of their memetic warfare to control the people that are going to vote for them.
978480	986640	Just like I don't think most of the people that end up engaging religions and holy wars
986640	992320	at the most strategic level really even are religious.
992320	996200	I think they know that these are ways to get people to do things for reasons that are mostly
996200	1000120	strategic.
1000120	1003840	As we look at war a little bit more and we look at the tension heating up on the India-China
1003840	1011160	border is such a big deal like what's happening there and the India-China-Pakistan interaction
1011160	1016000	and the India-China-Russia interaction.
1016000	1021520	And as we look at it with COVID related stuff, obviously what happens to the spread of the
1021520	1031320	virus with all of the protests that are definitely not social distancing, well we'll find out.
1031320	1038440	What happens when like with Germany and South Korea and China who started to get second
1038440	1044200	waves of infection after reopening, what happens when we start to get second waves here and
1044200	1052480	the political tension is so heated around the idea of closing again.
1052480	1062920	And then we also start to see things like because of the COVID shutdown of transportation
1062920	1066000	the food supply system got radically damaged, right?
1066000	1070680	Give or take the food supply for two billion people got damaged.
1070680	1077480	And so Nigeria has a 25 million person insecure food population that all went from food insecure
1077480	1079920	to actually don't have food.
1079920	1087000	And now violence has been raising on the ground both insurgencies, local crime and Boko Haram.
1087000	1093480	That's probably going to trigger an exodus and a massive refugee situation.
1093480	1096440	But after Syria it's like where do the refugees go?
1096440	1099680	So then what comes from that conflict why so?
1099680	1102280	We're definitely at a unique moment in the world.
1102280	1107880	We're at a moment where because of the connectedness of supply chains because of the ability for
1107880	1112960	viruses in airplanes to move around the world so fast because of the ability of news cycles
1112960	1113960	to move so fast.
1113960	1121480	So we go from an event in Minneapolis to in every city because of those things the interconnection
1121480	1125880	for the cascade of events from anywhere to everywhere and from one sector to other sectors
1125880	1137120	is so high on top of systemic fragility on top of very high embodied emotional energy.
1137120	1148760	This next phase of time is going to see a continuance of a cascade of very serious problems.
1148760	1155840	How do we make sense of the world given all of these dynamics and how do we respond?
1155840	1161040	I always feel stuck when someone asks me that how do we for some very large audience if
1161040	1165320	we respond because it's going to be very different based on people's skills and capacities
1165320	1166320	and interests.
1166320	1171520	It's not like a very good generalized answer to that.
1171520	1174080	Like David, how are you responding?
1174080	1181880	Well you're trying to both put out information that helps people and share frames that help
1181880	1186040	people process information and maybe that helps them get less emotionally hijacked so
1186040	1187940	they can have some more clarity.
1187940	1193920	Like those seem like within your bailiwick of things to do that you can do super important
1193920	1198160	things that need done.
1198160	1202760	There's going to be an equivalent of that in totally different ways that everyone on
1202760	1206800	here has as a possibility.
1206800	1219660	So I think people recognizing that they actually have some choice in where they put their attention
1219660	1222280	and some choice in the meaning they make.
1222280	1229080	So both where they focus and actually they have choice in where they put their attention.
1229080	1232200	They have choice in the process of coming to belief.
1232200	1237160	Are they just kind of letting themselves by the conclusions put in front or are they really
1237160	1238840	asking that am I sure of this?
1238840	1241320	How would I be sure of this?
1241320	1246720	Because there's going to be a response to their own sense of certainty or uncertainty.
1246720	1250440	And they also have some choice in the meaning they make around the things and all of this
1250440	1251920	is going to affect their state.
1251920	1261120	So that means that overwhelm is something someone really has a choice to indulge or not.
1261520	1266040	So sometimes I'll notice that there's so much coming in and I'm like what the fuck do I do
1266040	1267040	about this?
1267040	1268760	And there's a beginning impulse of overwhelm.
1268760	1275640	And I know I'm not trying to pretend or repress it but I also know that going into an overwhelmed
1275640	1281120	spiral is not useful and I have a kind of deep commitment to be useful.
1281120	1285320	So I have a deep commitment to want to think about things in a way that allows me to continue
1285320	1287440	to respond.
1287440	1291000	So I'll be like okay well let's just step back and actually write down what are all the things
1291000	1292080	that I see going on.
1292080	1295840	Let's make a situational assessment map.
1295840	1300400	So rather than just start to spiral into something like let me start to identify what are the
1300400	1303840	knowns, what are the unknowns, what are the things I might be able to do something about
1303840	1307320	where I want to put more of my sense making into that area because I might actually have
1307320	1311840	some agency in that area.
1311840	1317440	So some people on here that what is theirs to do will be largely around serving their
1317440	1331320	local communities but you know other people might have might work in the finance sector
1331320	1335440	and have specific things that they can do that are particularly meaningful to be able
1335440	1347040	to get the right types of projects funded or yeah I don't know.
1347040	1355200	What I can say not to do right is definitely make sure okay here's an important one I'll
1355200	1359360	say one thing to do.
1359360	1364440	Understand the basics of strategy if you're going to try and do anything so that you don't
1364440	1368760	just make shit worse or be totally useless.
1368760	1377840	So strategy 101 every response everything that you do if you're effective some people
1377840	1383360	will not like and it will evoke a counter response.
1383360	1390840	Factor the counter response in what you're doing and see if it's still a good idea.
1390840	1395840	If you are not factoring counter responses you are not doing strategy you are just being
1395840	1397480	reactive.
1397480	1405160	Now you might be super righteous in your reactivity but that does mean that you are actually upon
1405160	1411320	that is being manipulated by forces that are doing strategy you aren't actually doing strategy
1411320	1417200	and so if you're wanting to do something to make sure Trump doesn't get reelected or to
1417200	1426760	make sure that systemic racism gets addressed or whatever it is you just have to think in
1426760	1433840	this particular action who that will feel threatened by this will counter respond in
1433840	1440680	what ways and what resources are available to them and if I'm escalating the game right
1440680	1446920	if I'm increasing the war on one side driving an arms race of escalation am I driving it
1446920	1450360	in the right direction.
1450360	1457120	Do that if you aren't doing that then you're most likely escalating things in the wrong
1457120	1458880	direction with whatever you're doing.
1458880	1466000	I guess listening to you I mean we've done quite a lot of conversations around I think
1466000	1470760	phase shift for humanity was the first one where you talked about the self terminating
1470760	1477800	nature of the current dynamic and I guess it's one thing to talk about that and to
1477800	1481960	have seen it as a possibility it's another one when you feel it on a kind of visceral
1481960	1487840	level and I wonder I just wonder whether you because you talk I mean you use some beautiful
1487840	1494800	metaphors about the caterpillar and the butterfly and I'd say for talking about kind of phase
1494800	1501240	shift and self terminating systems you actually sketch out quite a sort of positive vision
1501240	1506320	as well has that changed or are you still.
1507320	1513400	That hasn't changed.
1513400	1518640	I think that everything that's happening right now.
1518640	1524360	Was going to happen some version of it there's a lot of path dependencies it it didn't have
1524360	1528680	to have COVID as a path and it could have been a different pandemic or it could have
1528680	1533560	been grid collapse or it could have been climate change driving refugees driving a war there's
1533560	1547000	a gazillion things that could have started the the systemic cascades but it was inevitable
1547000	1551840	which is why like that's mostly what I've talked about for the last six or seven years
1551840	1558000	was trying to help people see that was inevitable let's see what we can do to do anticipatory
1558000	1560600	good good things.
1560600	1567120	If you identify every area that there is a risk.
1567120	1573000	There is also a meaningful upside and this is a way to think about what might be yours
1573000	1578120	to do when an environmental niche gets disturbed it's much easier to have new things come in
1578120	1584160	and change the process.
1584160	1589800	So if we go through and look at all of the areas where there are major problems and where
1589800	1595080	there are major risks and say what is the system that's actually breaking down and what
1595080	1599440	would a better version of that system be and what could we do to implement those better
1599440	1604000	versions of the system rather than try to reinstate the security of the old ones that
1604000	1608080	would be a beginning of thinking about the opportunity space.
1608080	1611480	And we could talk about that with global finance we could talk about it with infrastructure
1611480	1616120	we could talk about it with the health care system on and on right the judicial reform
1616120	1619360	all those things.
1619920	1626280	Someone just posted this in the chat I think it's really true so far it seems the pandemic
1626280	1631760	and the crisis is accelerating all of the we're not in a shift into a new system it
1631760	1637120	seems to be just accelerating and compounding all of the worst aspects of the old one.
1637120	1646840	Do you have a sense of how that process might play out and where is the sort of hope in
1646840	1654640	that if there is any.
1654640	1665560	Most people who care about things widely care about the global commons long term suck at
1665560	1674320	doing things like they suck at doing things at scale because most anyone who's good at
1674360	1678480	doing things at scale one at the game of power.
1678480	1684520	Because to do things at scale means to be able to influence things in a way that will
1684520	1690040	beat out competitors and go against people who want things to go otherwise.
1690040	1694760	So right now there's a lot of people like during the covid time there's a lot of people
1694760	1698440	feeling like they have more free time than ever.
1698440	1702640	But the most powerful people in the world have been busier than ever during this time
1702640	1710240	they have been consolidating the market and buying up distressed assets and massively
1710240	1716560	increasing opportunism during this time.
1716560	1725680	So one of the things I would say is necessary for it to be other than you just said David
1725680	1734720	is that the people who actually are committed to the well being of humanity and the earth
1734720	1742920	and civilization long term must learn to be how must learn how to be effective at actually
1742920	1744880	making things happen at a global level.
1744880	1747680	Do you like to ask your question Robin.
1747680	1756440	Yes what do you have to say about yes the the resource of cross generational mentoring
1756440	1763120	and networking in the situation we're in.
1763120	1766240	It's complex.
1766240	1775040	It's easy to say cross generational collaboration is good like it's easy to say that diverse
1775040	1780240	perspectives of any kind being in conversation will enrich everyone who is there.
1780240	1784840	That's true.
1784840	1791160	The current situation that we're facing the last times we face situations that were relevantly
1791160	1797680	analogous none of those people are still alive in terms of the generations that actually
1797680	1801920	know anything about it like the people who were in World War two aren't still here the
1801920	1805640	people who are in the Great Depression aren't still here the people who are in the 1918 plague
1805640	1807000	aren't still here.
1807000	1813480	And this is like if you study generational theory like Strauss how for you study Baudrillard
1813480	1818200	typically things repeat on the cycle that once the people who had the hard one knowledge
1818200	1823120	are dead we repeat the thing because they're gone right.
1823120	1829280	So part of the generational connection I want people to do is study the work of the people
1829280	1833680	who really understood the last relevant issues who happened to be dead might have been alive
1833680	1836880	a little while ago.
1836880	1845200	Now there are still people who are involved in in Vietnam and the counterculture movement
1845200	1855440	and who are involved in different times that are relevant and to discuss.
1855440	1864200	So like I have a friend Mark Stallman he was involved during that generation but he
1864200	1873440	was doing intelligence work and like he was working with Freeman Dyson directly regarding
1873440	1880400	what was brought to JFK to do with Coruse Chaff that was a big part of what's led to
1880400	1881960	things broke down there.
1881960	1888200	So there's knowledge that he has firsthand that's super directly relevant.
1888200	1897200	But like when I look at the counterculture movement as a whole and I look at the Green
1897200	1905040	Revolution and the sexual revolution and the civil rights process and the women's rights
1905040	1908000	all the various things.
1908000	1913720	The deeper story that I see most of the activists who are there don't know.
1913720	1920640	The deeper story I see is like actually understanding co Intel Pro and how the FBI CIA and other
1920640	1929940	intelligence agencies actually infiltrated the the progressive movements to very specifically
1929940	1935600	derail them and get them focused on shit that would be ineffective that is that we're
1935600	1937640	still doing today.
1937640	1943920	So I happen to believe that there was intentional up regulation by those power structures of
1943920	1951720	postmodernism as a structure of thought because if the people who studied social science only
1951720	1956000	studied how to critique the game of power without actually knowing how to effectively
1956000	1960880	organize then it would make sure that they never could actually really do anything.
1960880	1966200	So if every time someone's organizing well you call it imperialism you won't end up
1966200	1973240	organizing well and becoming an imperialist so you'll just be noise and that's fine.
1973240	1982120	And the social sciences that are like actually studying the history of military theory and
1982120	1989320	political theory and and strategy itself got very down regulated in exchange for something
1989320	1996080	that would make people feel more righteous while being less effective.
1997080	2001960	And so I want to make sure that we're learning the right lessons from the right periods of
2001960	2007560	history.
2007560	2012080	So what I would say is that when I think about generations and I take all the generations
2012080	2019240	that are alive now I would say that ninety nine percent of the people in all those generations
2019240	2024320	have been the victims of intentional disinformation in a mostly just all confused so we can have
2024320	2030320	intergenerational sharing of some confused generations with others.
2030320	2038000	It's still nice to have different perspectives but I would mostly like for people to have
2038000	2043240	more clear and incisive insight at all and across a longer time period than their own
2043240	2046400	experience a deeper study of history and like that.
2046400	2050120	So I was just wondering what you know where you feel stuck and you feel like you're kind
2050120	2054200	of in a hopeless situation making space for grief.
2054200	2061400	So emotions of all kind can influence our sense making they can also influence our choice
2061400	2063600	making.
2063600	2067480	I want.
2067480	2073160	We all know what it's like to have emotions that are not being clearly processed influence
2073160	2084640	our choice making in damaging ways right reacting out of anger or whatever.
2084640	2090080	But then we can also say OK so I don't want to be reactive emotionally so I'm going to
2090080	2097720	suppress emotions and pretend to do like do a bad version of stoicism and just numb down
2097720	2106960	emotional intelligence in which case I'm taking one whole type of information one whole way
2106960	2114160	of sense making and turning it off and you could call emotion.
2114160	2118320	This is reductive but I'm just saying one lens you could call emotion a way of being
2118320	2124360	able to read warm data.
2124360	2129120	Partly our emotion is responding to the situation partly our emotion is responding to the narrative
2129120	2131280	we make of the situation.
2131280	2135560	So in terms of the narrative we make that's where we want to do CBT or DBT or Byron Katie's
2135560	2139640	the work or Krishna Murthy's inquiry to see where did I make up some meaning that fucked
2139640	2141200	me up.
2141200	2147560	But then there are sometimes where it's like if I see a cop kneeling on someone's neck
2147560	2154320	and killing them and I don't feel angry something is wrong with me like that's not about meaning
2154320	2159800	making I to actually try and say no I'm only upset because of meaning making means I have
2159800	2164520	to instantiate a metaphysics where nothing matters and then say well I meaning made well
2164520	2168960	yes I have a metaphysics where things matter and in a metaphysics where anything matters
2168960	2175360	then if the sacred is being harmed I can feel pissed off I can feel sad I can feel scared
2175360	2186320	right so you know I'm kind of inundated in data about catastrophic risk so the most fucked
2186320	2191400	up things all the time and so it doesn't have the same emotional response immediately that
2191400	2197800	it did the first time that I was exposed to it but I still will just sit back put my computer
2197800	2203000	down and just cry when I think about what's fucking happening in Nigeria or when I think
2203000	2208760	about what's about to happen or because if I don't I will actually have to dead in something
2208760	2212800	and then I become less sensitive which means my sensing decreases and the wholeness of
2212800	2220760	self decreases so yeah you neither want to let you neither want to repress the emotions
2220760	2225000	and not listen to them and learn from them nor do you want to just unconsciously act
2225000	2232040	on them you want to incorporate that into a way that you're connecting to and making
2232040	2238320	sense of reality this was one of the talks from the rebel wisdom festival a dozen more
