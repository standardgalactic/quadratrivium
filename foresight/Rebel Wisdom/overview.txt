1. The conversation revolved around the concept of externalities and their impact on systems, particularly how negative externalities can be minimized within a complex system.
   
2. There's an analogy drawn from the US Constitution's creation, where the Founding Fathers engaged in a similar process of stress testing various scenarios to prevent tyranny. This approach involved continuous discussion and consideration of potential risks, which is applicable to our current societal challenges.

3. Technology plays a dual role: on one hand, it has the potential to accelerate destruction (as per the reference to Moloch), while on the other, it facilitates cooperation and coordination among people, as seen in platforms like internet forums that enable sharing of information and learning across time.

4. The guest mentioned working on a series related to complexity and Moloch, which involves acting for the first time. This project aims to explore and bring to life the concepts discussed.

5. A reminder is given that the guest will be appearing at the "State of Sense Making" free event at the end of September, and viewers are encouraged to check out their YouTube channel for more content, with links provided in the show notes.

6. Rebel Wisdom has launched an eight-week online course called "Sense Making 101," which brings together top thinkers like Daniel Schmacktenberger, Diane Mushow-Hamilton, and John Vivecchi to help individuals improve their sense-making abilities, develop personal sovereignty, and join a community with similar goals. This course aims to equip participants with the tools necessary to navigate an increasingly complex world.

1. The interplay between reason (left hemisphere) and intuition (right hemisphere) is crucial for a holistic understanding of reality. Iyengar suggests that reasoning is like learning to play an instrument—it requires focused practice, but this isn't the end of the process. The true value comes when the learned details are reintegrated into a larger, more intuitive understanding.

2. Richard Tarnas' work, which influenced Iyengar during his university years, emphasizes that Western philosophy has become increasingly compartmentalized and intellectually bound, proposing that re-embracing intuition is key to transcending this limitation.

3. The field of philosophy has made strides towards reconciling reason with intuition, particularly through the works of German idealists like Hegel and Schelling, American pragmatists like William James and John Dewey, and phenomenologists like Edmund Husserl and later Wittgenstein.

4. A physicist's comment on an RSA video resonated with Iyengar, highlighting how the detailed focus of scientists in search of a 'Theory of Everything' might be missing the bigger picture—akin to the relationship between reasoning and intuition.

5. Iyengar's work has been found useful and resonant by physicists and individuals from various professions, indicating that the principles he discusses are universal and applicable across different domains of human experience and endeavor.

1. **John Bovaki's Background and Work**: John Bovaki is a counselor trained in Deologos Inquiry, which emphasizes dialogue and exploration of understanding in a relational field. He has contributed to various Rebel Wisdom interviews, including "Flow States and Wisdom," "After the Meaning Crisis," and "The Evolving Conversation."

2. **Integration of Technologies**: The emphasis on practice and events in Rebel Wisdom is designed to facilitate transformation through various technologies like circling, Inquiry, empathy circles, glass bead games, and others, which are crucial alongside propositional knowledge.

3. **Sense Making 101 Course**: To delve deeper into the topics discussed with John Bovaki, Rebel Wisdom offers an online course called Sense Making 101, featuring guest faculty like John Bovaki himself, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Diane Musho Hamilton, and more. The course aims to improve participants' sense making abilities, develop personal sovereignty, and connect with a community engaged in similar self-improvement efforts.

4. **The Intersection of Knowing and Loving**: In the context of Christianity, John Bovaki emphasizes that knowing requires loving, and vice versa. This perspective is reminiscent of the Christian tradition's concepts of conversion, quickening, and the necessity of stepping into experiences to truly understand them.

5. **Challenges in Sense Making**: The current state of sense making is precarious, with increasingly significant decisions being made based on poor sense making due to rapid changes in our world. This is a call to action for individuals to enhance their ability to make sense of the world around them.

1. The discussion revolves around the importance of understanding power structures, especially within postmodern thought, and how critique without effective organization can lead to ineffectiveness or unintended consequences like imperialism.

2. The social sciences have shifted towards more immediate forms of critique at the expense of studying historical military and political theory, which has led to less effective organizing and potential confusion among scholars.

3. There is a call for clearer and more incisive insights across generations, with a deeper study of history being advocated for better understanding and sense-making.

4. Emotions play a significant role in both processing information and making choices. Emotional suppression can be as damaging as reactive emotional responses.

5. Narratives we construct around situations can significantly influence our emotions and perceptions. Techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Byron Katie's "The Work," or Jiddu Krishnamurti's inquiry can help identify and challenge flawed meanings we ascribe to events.

6. The necessity of feeling emotions appropriately, even when faced with repeated exposure to catastrophic risks or global injustices, is emphasized. It's important to maintain emotional sensitivity and a connection to reality, incorporating emotional responses into one's understanding of the world.

7. The Rebel Wisdom Festival highlights interdisciplinary discussions on sense-making, with additional films from the festival available to members. The community encourages learning and growth through various resources, including online courses and workshops.

Checking Rebel Wisdom/The War on Reality, Mary Harrington & Paul Kingsnorth.txt
1. Mary and Paul from The Pure Products of Benjamin Franklin podcast had a discussion with James Bridle on the future of the internet and its potential to liquefy all structures of society, leading to chaos and confusion.
   
2. They explored the idea that the extreme "woke" agenda is a part of this liquefaction process, which has been observed by many on the dissident right. However, Paul argues that this agenda ultimately serves the interests of capital and large corporations, which aligns with some concerns from the dissident left.

3. The conversation touched upon the concept of egregores, which could be seen as a collective consciousness or group mind emerging from interconnected devices like smartphones, raising questions about our individual and collective intentions within this new reality.

4. James Bridle introduced the notion of "fully automated luxury Gnosticism," which reflects the idea that we are disconnected from the reality we are creating through technology, particularly the internet.

5. The discussion was notable for its calm, reasoned approach to a highly charged subject, avoiding the reactivity and anger often found in debates about these issues.

6. This conversation represents a step towards a synthesis position between dissident right and left perspectives, offering a nuanced understanding of the forces at play in our increasingly interconnected world.

7. James Bridle expressed his interest in hosting another dialogue with Mary and Paul, along with Rebel Wisdom members, to further explore these themes and solutions, which you can join if you're interested in this topic.
