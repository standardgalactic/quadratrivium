the same thing again. It's very difficult to let go of this mentality that gives you,

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I'll have that, I'll take that. And it's a very selfish kind of way of thinking, not

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,860
a communitarian way of thinking, it's not a broad picture, it's a very narrow picture,

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,260
it sees the short term, not the long term. And it's perfectly successful in its own terms,

50
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,220
but what it doesn't see is it's leading into a blind alley.

51
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,980
One of the criticisms of your work I've seen, and I think you actually addressed it at the

52
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,660
beginning of the RSA animation, that there was a very simplistic understanding of right brain,

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,900
left brain in the past, maybe the 60s and 70s. And a lot of people say, well that's been discredited,

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,020
the whole idea of these two parts of the brain doing different things has been completely discredited.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,180
Yes, well that was one of the hurdles I had to get over. And probably if I'd had a regular career

56
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,740
where I had to just churn my way through an academic career, bringing out papers every

57
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,740
few months, I'd never have had the leisure and time. Well it wasn't leisure, it was time stolen

58
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,700
from my clinical work. But actually I spent 20 years looking at the literature and there's no

59
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,220
question. I mean it would be absurd to suggest there's no difference. For a start, the most

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,700
primitive creatures that we know about going back 700 million years, the very first ones

61
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,300
that have a neural network already have an asymmetrical neural network. And that has simply

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:51,300
become more, if you like, more pronounced as we go up the evolutionary tree. So the two halves

63
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,380
of the brain are just clearly different, they're different sizes, different weights, different

64
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,740
shapes, they have different cell called gyro patterns, that's the convolutions in the surface of the

65
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,180
brain. They have different preponderances of grey and white matter, different preponderances

66
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,180
of neurotransmitters, they react differently to hormones, they're just different. And it's no

67
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,820
good saying there isn't a difference. Also psychologically they're clearly different because

68
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,100
we know that the left hemisphere, for example, is the one that speaks, it's the one that does

69
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,940
certain aspects of language. And the right hemisphere we know has other faculties that I

70
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:36,100
spend the book explaining. So it's just that people latched onto a very simple minded model and

71
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,420
that model was that of a machine. Now the question you ask of a machine is what does it do?

72
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,980
And if you ask the question what does the left hemisphere do and what does the right hemisphere

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,140
do, the answers that came out of pop psychology in the 70s and 80s, the left hemisphere does reason

74
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,420
and language and the right hemisphere does emotion and visual spatial things is not true.

75
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,700
They're both involved in everything, but they're involved in different ways, in reliably different

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,380
ways. So it's not the what of the brain, it's the how. And that's a very important question,

77
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,580
but it's not one that scientists are so readily going to ask because they're mainly interested

78
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,900
in mechanism. But actually it's as plain as the nose on your face when you come to look at it,

79
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,940
that there are these vast differences in the disposition of these two neural networks towards

80
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,180
the world. They pay attention in completely different ways and when you pay attention to the world

81
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:41,780
you see different things in it. And so if they do that they're going to construct two different

82
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,460
versions of the world. We talk a lot on this channel about the meta conversation, the idea that

83
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,940
what we need is a conversation that opens up to the not knowing, to what needs to emerge beyond

84
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,740
and what it feels like is happening now increasingly with social media, is people are getting stuck

85
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,660
more and more in certainty and in what they do know. Is that a right brain, left brain phenomena?

86
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,420
Well it can be looked at in that way in that one of the features of the left hemisphere is that it

87
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:17,140
prefers what it's already familiar with and it finds it very difficult to shift set. So once

88
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,900
it's stuck into something it keeps on repeating it. Whereas the right hemisphere Rhamachandran,

89
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,740
BS Rhamachandran, well-known neuroscientist, calls it the devil's advocate because it's able to see

90
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:36,420
other things and it's saying yes but, yes but is a Zen saying that I very much like. So you can

91
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:42,340
see it that way. The right hemisphere is much more able to be flexible and also very importantly

92
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,420
although or not although but just because the two hemispheres have different takes on the

93
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,940
one they have different takes on their own relationship. So the left hemisphere's take is

94
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,100
an exclusive one either this is right or that is right and therefore what I know excludes what you

95
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,340
know. Whereas the right hemisphere's take is a both and take that there's a room for what the left

96
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,140
hemisphere does. There's a point in analysis but there's also a point in synthesis and imagination

97
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:23,300
and what we are desperately lacking is that overall synthesis. It seems to me that at the moment

98
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,860
we officially pride ourselves on being a very free thinking people. I'm going to sound like a

99
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:39,380
terrible funny daddy but I think the intellectual world was far more open in the 60s and 70s when

100
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,780
I grew up than it is today. It's closed down to a number of dogmas and the internet which is a

101
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,820
wonderful thing hasn't helped because it's possible for people to get trapped in bubbles

102
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,860
where they reinforce the things they believe without really hearing other points of view.

103
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm a keen proponent that in education one of the most important things one must do

104
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,340
is teach people always to invert everything they believe and see the value in it. In fact

105
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,860
I believe there should be in government a department of inverse policy so whatever the

106
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,700
government is proposing there should be a department that is dedicated to seeing what would happen if

107
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,460
we did the precise opposite and it should be you know centrally funded and I think it would

108
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,580
be a very useful exercise but really it's an intellectual exercise that we all need to do.

109
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,940
If we start being too certain about anything it means we've missed something else. This brings us

110
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,740
to a very important metaphysical point which is that a thing and its opposite according to the

111
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,700
left hemisphere are simply as far apart as they can be and we move always in a linear way to what

112
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:55,300
we identify as good. Everything I know tells me that in fact opposites are connected and if you pretend

113
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,820
that you are only having one you don't notice the dark side and this is terribly true in psychiatry.

114
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,980
It's almost an attuism to say that a lot of the work one does as a psychiatrist is helping people

115
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,140
to see that there is a good side to what it is that they fear and dislike in themselves but there

116
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,180
is also a dark side to the bits that they pride themselves on and that you cannot get rid of

117
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,740
the dark side you accept it and work with moving it towards something creative and all creativity

118
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,100
and all life is creative our mental world is creative our daily reality is creative partly

119
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,780
by us not out of nowhere but it's grounded in something else but we help creative. That process

120
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,940
depends on opposition it depends on a degree of resistance actually and as soon as you've decided

121
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:52,340
that X, Y and Z are good and their opposites are bad and we must have more and more and more and more

122
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,500
of the thing we've decided is good you end up reaping a whirlwind because the things you didn't

123
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,540
take note of come back and bite you in the bum and I think that what we are now seeing in the very

124
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:14,820
destructive and damaging and regrettable moves of you know Brexit and Trump and so on are entirely

125
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,260
understandable reactions which I can perfectly well forgive from people who have just been told

126
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:28,340
that their opinions are no good because these are things we don't talk about these are things that

127
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,540
you know a liberal person knows that liberty equality and fraternity is all it's about and the

128
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,140
opposites don't matter so I think we're we're enduring now a backlash that we could have avoided

129
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,060
by having a mature conversation yes this is good but also we've got to take into account that

130
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,900
this is what we've talked about quite a lot on the channel and our perspective is that we're seeing

131
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,260
the shadow of liberalism that Trump and Brexit are both the shadow of liberalism I didn't know

132
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,180
that that was what you said but it's exactly what I believe yeah I mean you mentioned a lot of different

133
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,060
psychological things because I mean Jung's idea of the shadow is a perfect one and at some sense it

134
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,660
feels to us that this is the time of the integration of the shadow that what we're seeing

135
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,660
through the democratisation of different forms of media is all the things and the cracks between

136
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,220
things that we thought we'd got rid of are now rising up and are going to have to be dealt with

137
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,660
again have to be integrated yes how do we do that well of course there is no you're not expecting

138
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,420
me to have some simple answer and one of the difficulties is that we have accelerated the

139
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:42,180
pace of change so fast that the kind of changes that we require not only sort of won't but simply

140
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:52,740
cannot be made to happen that fast um we're in a crisis which requires something to happen

141
00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:01,460
very quickly really because accelerating technological advance has put machine guns

142
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,220
in the hands of toddlers we have not increased in wisdom in fact I believe we have lost wisdom

143
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,660
in the west and yet we have gained enormously and are gaining very fast in power inevitably if

144
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,820
you put power in the hands of people who have no wisdom this is a formula for disaster and we see

145
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,900
it in the current environmental disaster we're facing we see it in the destruction of species

146
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:34,260
we see it in the destruction of the lives of indigenous people we see it in the mind control

147
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:42,420
that is already being put into effect in china with enormously sophisticated ai that tracks the

148
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,900
faces the movements the everything the thoughts of all its citizens and we believe oh well that's

149
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:56,020
china but that could never happen here but that is very naive democracy our kind of democracy

150
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,780
is fragile it's not the norm it's something very precious and it can easily be destroyed

151
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,900
especially in an atmosphere where we don't know who or what to believe which is becoming more and

152
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,660
more a problem so we have got ourselves into a very difficult situation and i'm not suggesting

153
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,620
there is an easy fix to it but there are things that we could do um to try and get away from this

154
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,140
I mean one they're going to have to involve radical changes we can't expect to go on living

155
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,340
the kind of lives we do with the demands on the world there's just not sustainable they're not

156
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:38,580
sustainable even for us and now that um 10 times as many people will want to claim these rights to

157
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:45,220
extraordinary privilege the world simply cannot sustain it so we've been living on on fool's gold

158
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,740
if you like so what are the practical things that can be done if if your diagnosis is correct

159
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,820
and that we're looking at a world that's ever more sort of narrow and rational

160
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:06,020
how do we get out of that yes easier said than done um and there are patients that you cannot help

161
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,740
which is one of the first things you have to know in my trade um but I believe one of the things I

162
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,260
can do I can't do much but one thing I can do is raise awareness and I think that's happening

163
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,380
so people are becoming much more aware of in a way I've opened people's minds to things they already

164
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,900
knew one of the communist things people say is I had this feeling of sudden recognition that all

165
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:40,740
my life I kind of felt all this but had no way of articulating it so I think that that is one thing

166
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,700
so of course it's just a start in terms of practical things I mean we've got to begin my completely

167
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,260
rethinking education at the moment it's about shoveling information into people not training

168
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:03,860
them to think critically to think imaginatively uh I was lucky in that in my education I was taught

169
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,380
to to think of all sides of the question as soon as I believe something passionately I would be

170
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,020
asked to defend the exact opposite position which is a very important exercise that I think no

171
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,860
one should leave school without doing you know this is what you believe speak about it now speak

172
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,980
about and defend the opposite position and we will score you on how well you do that exercise

173
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,900
that is good but it's also about imagination I mean education is drawing out faculties within

174
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:40,500
people it's not shoveling facts into people that is the reverse of education so I think the emphasis on

175
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:51,060
you know a cliched caricature would be but it's not unfortunately that far from the truth

176
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,820
you're doing English A level there are six points you must make about Jane Austen you know

177
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:04,340
to me that is the death of English literature and so is conforming it to current preoccupations

178
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,740
with whatever brilliant we think they are filtering it through isms of you know political

179
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:17,140
correctness instead of putting all that to the side and simply opening oneself to the incredible gift

180
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,140
of something that somebody created which can work on you in all kinds of ways

181
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,420
that you don't now conceive the more you approach things with preconceptions the worse it is this

182
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,340
this was really interesting watching the documentary you sent over you mentioned identity

183
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,820
politics as a left brain phenomena that it's effectively it's a it's another certainty or it

184
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,860
can become another certainty because what we're doing through that is for example you're taking a

185
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,900
work of literature and you're critiquing it not in the way that it kind of reflects the grandeur of

186
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,180
the human spirit or the developmental journey of the individual it's it's it's about okay how does it

187
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,420
it which immediately diminishes it from that to that yes and can you talk about that and there's

188
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,540
nothing new in it as a left brain as a left brain phenomena i can but i'd also first like to

189
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,140
just gloss your remark because it's interesting i didn't actually mention identity politics anywhere

190
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,420
in the film but what happened you say political correctness or was there some no what happened

191
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,420
was and i didn't know this that in the film as you know roan williams is interviewed and the way

192
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,140
the film was made was i would go and meet somebody we would be filmed talking together and then there

193
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,540
was always a bit where i went out and they just talked to that person because then they were free

194
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,220
to say whatever they wanted to say and a bit that i had never seen until the film was completed

195
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:46,180
was where roan williams chose for some reason to talk about um the angry black and white views

196
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,540
of people who just know what is right and won't listen to other people and want it legislated

197
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:58,420
and he just said you you cannot create a better society by legislating this kind of thing we need

198
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,780
to develop a society in which people can have we can listen to one another and have reasonable

199
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,300
conversations and he actually made the point that by trying to stamp out certain things you don't

200
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,620
diminish the anxiety behind it you ramp it up which is exactly what we're seeing which is another

201
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,100
psychological truth of repression yes i mean one of the there are many problems here the one is

202
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:29,540
the left hand this is far too certain that it knows what's what it's far too clear that things are

203
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:36,100
unipola that there are just goods whereas you know once you see something that is much clearer

204
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,540
and oriental tradition that everything has comes inevitably with its opposite you don't think

205
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,780
like that anymore it doesn't see things contextually it doesn't see individuals it's not

206
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,340
prepared to listen to another point of view it's just saying this guy i have heard on twitter has

207
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,100
said something you know which is now a sound bite you don't hear all all the rest that went around it

208
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,620
you don't see this as part of somebody's journey that it might be worth listening to you just dismiss

209
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:14,660
now i believe very strongly once again that it it's not the what it's the how if i've said that

210
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,580
before i'm going to say it again and again in life it is not the what it is the how it's the

211
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,940
disposition you have now i believe it is possible to say anything and i don't think there should be

212
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,660
things that nobody can say i think we should have a system where anyone can say anything but they

213
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:41,140
must say it in a way that is not inflammatory and that is open to reason and discussion so that

214
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,420
applies to both sides of a political argument and in that same section of the film it made an

215
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:53,460
interesting point that anger lateralizes to the left brain so that so that if we're in our

216
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,740
sort of left brain certainty anger is the result anger and aggression you know people think the

217
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,420
left hemisphere i mean the old view was when it might be a bit dull but it's terribly reliable

218
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:10,820
and it's down to earth and it doesn't get emotional well number one it is not down to earth it's

219
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:18,180
in a fantasy world number two it is not reliable um there's good work coming out of gazaniga's lab

220
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,140
showing you know he was the man who said the right hemisphere has about as much intelligence as a

221
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,540
chimpanzee i mean that was 30 40 years ago but still his lab is now producing wonderful data

222
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,500
showing that the right hemisphere is far more sophisticated at making judgments much more

223
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,660
reliable the left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions is open to bias and in terms of

224
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:47,060
emotion the left hemisphere is far from devoid of emotion the most lateralizer of all emotions is

225
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:54,980
anger and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere lateralizes just means what it means that when

226
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:03,220
people are experiencing anger there is a great increase in activity in the left hemisphere and

227
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,380
you know the chapter and verse for that it's somebody called harm and jones has done a lot of

228
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,380
research into that but the chapter and verse will be in in the master and is in the master

229
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:20,500
there was a really interesting example with birds and i don't maybe you want to kind of explain

230
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,460
very simply how because that that for me really illustrates the difference between the two the two

231
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,540
ways of of interacting with the world yes well well the um you know human neurosciences were busy

232
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:37,860
dismissing it the um animal scientists were simply getting on with what science scientists

233
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,700
are supposed to do which was observing and taking note and they noticed that birds and animals

234
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:51,860
use their two hemispheres for different purposes it's easy to observe in a bird because in most

235
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,780
birds the input from the right eye goes straight to the left hemisphere and the input from the left

236
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,140
eye goes straight to the right hemisphere it's not true of humans it's more complicated but at least

237
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,540
in birds and quite a lot of animals that have eyes on the side of the head you can tell which

238
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,980
hemisphere is engaged by just looking at which eye is being used for this particular moment

239
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:21,780
and what they noticed was that birds and animals reliably seem to use their left hemisphere for

240
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,180
latching on to a small detail like i need to pick up that piece of seed on the background of grid

241
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:36,660
and they use their right hemisphere the left eye for everything else for who others are around

242
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,500
is there a predator um is my mate nearby because i would like to share this all that contextual

243
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,140
information is the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere is literally seeing a tiny piece of

244
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:58,660
reality now that was in itself an aha moment i could see that this if this was in any way true

245
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:06,020
about humans it would have colossal implications because i have a background in philosophy and i

246
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,700
know that attention changes the world so if there's a big difference in attention one is

247
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,620
fragmentary piecemeal narrow the other is broad sustained and vigilant they're going to

248
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,820
see two different realities and so that got me into then looking at the human history and lo and

249
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,220
behold this difference is very marked in human beings so if people have a right hemisphere stroke

250
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,740
they can have this pathological narrowing of the window of attention like looking the wrong way

251
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,140
down the telescope and you're the sort of the grand theory as well is that we are in a world that

252
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,740
has concentrated more and more and more on this narrow atomistic mechanical way of looking at the

253
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:57,380
world and neglecting the more holistic the more um relational aspects well it seems to me and that's

254
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,260
the subject of a book i'm now writing that actually we don't start from things and then have to

255
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,460
work out how they relate and how this thing this billiard ball hits that one and so on but in fact

256
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:18,420
that there are very broad patterns and flows in the world and that what we call things are the

257
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:25,220
sort of bits that stand out to our attention their little nexuses if you like that go oh i

258
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,580
recognise that little familiar thing that i'm going to call that a but actually everything is

259
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,580
part of a larger picture and the trouble with focusing on detail is not only do you miss the

260
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:45,060
overall meaning the overall purpose the overall connection the way in which this has ramifications

261
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:51,060
the bits that are not explicit the thing that is not in the spotlight which is everything else

262
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,180
but you also think that you can understand the world by taking one thing and putting it

263
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,940
with another and building it up as you'd build a meccano set or you know mend the bike in the

264
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:12,260
garage but the world is not like that i wrote down from the rsa animation left abstraction power

265
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,420
to manipulate the already known fixed static isolated decontextualised explicit ultimately

266
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,900
lifeless right individual changing evolved interconnected implicit incarnate living

267
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,140
never entirely known and that reminded me very much of what martin buber talked about that we

268
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,020
have the i it relationships of the i thou relationships which i found very profound i

269
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,740
also studied philosophy when i was when i was at university and that that really stuck with me that

270
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,620
there are two different types of relationships we can have in the world one the i thou is essentially

271
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,980
there is an unknown ability about that relationship is that something do you think that maps on

272
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:58,340
absolutely and there is also a reciprocity in the i thou relationship whereas in the i it relationship

273
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,260
it's a unidirectional one which is about power and influence whereas the other one is about

274
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,540
a reverberative responsive coming into being of something so that is a very important distinction

275
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:17,780
and i relate the i thou and the i it to the evolution of language we won't have time to because

276
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,700
it's a long story but it's in the book but in brief i believe that language emerged from

277
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,340
what you might call music in other words the music of speech the sounds and that

278
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:38,660
denotative language is a kind of special set of a much more richly embedded embodied

279
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:46,260
connotative way of communicating and that it became necessary when we were no longer in groups

280
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:54,020
where you were largely just talking i to thou but we're talking about a third party or something

281
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:01,060
else we had designs on and so that is how where language becomes very important i've seen your work

282
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,660
reference in many many different places particularly by people who are talking about the

283
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,500
more spiritual the more even an author called gary lackman i don't know if you're aware of him

284
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:19,940
so he he's written a series of books about the the hidden occult history of western thought

285
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,660
and he uses your work as a way of saying as a way of kind of maybe giving it scientific

286
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,700
respectability or at least explaining this could be a process that we're going through these

287
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:36,340
these more holistic ways of knowing have never been part of the western kind of mainstream

288
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,740
traddition and maybe that's because of the right brain left brain split do you do you agree with that

289
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,980
well i think there is not true that they've not been present in the tradition

290
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,260
i know what he's talking about but they're very much present in pre-socratic philosophy

291
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,220
as we know something very important and i think very damaging happened to western philosophy

292
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:13,060
with Plato and Aristotle and particularly with Plato um but these other aspects in the west

293
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:19,540
have been more expressed in our extremely powerful music uh one thing you can say about western

294
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:26,980
civilization it in many ways it's it lacks the wisdom of oriental civilization but it has produced

295
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:36,100
colossally rich music and so it also produced you know Shakespeare so i would say our art

296
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:44,420
is where it has been expressed but when we start doing philosophy we're like well we've got to make

297
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,860
this consistent and i see that and it goes in there and this bit leads to that and whereas

298
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,900
you're you're therefore as as i say sort of building things up from little certainties

299
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,300
well the first thing is there are no certainties to start from they're intuitive

300
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,140
you have to start from axioms reason is based on intuition and it ends in intuition

301
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,540
um so i think there are those elements of there but they have been

302
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,380
sidelined and neglected the key thing one must remember about the left hemisphere

303
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:25,540
is that it's it's bright enough but not very bright it doesn't really see that there are things

304
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:33,780
that it doesn't know um it's so hermetic its world is so self contained and consistent and

305
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,420
self referential that it doesn't feel the need of anything else because it's not sensing that there's

306
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:46,500
something bigger the right hemisphere sees what is implicit what is going on not just in the foreground

307
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,900
but in the in the background in the context in all these things that are everything that we really

308
00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:04,500
value love and art and we used to value spiritual truths these things are only approachable in an

309
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,260
indirect implicit way and as soon as you start to say well we need to pin this down and make it

310
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,420
certain you're already on the wrong track so i think that's gary's right to point to that

311
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,700
it's just that i think there's more to the story and you you talked about um that

312
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,100
rationality begins in intuition so well yes it has to i mean in fact it begins in intuition

313
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:36,580
in two ways one is that um we we can't rationally prove why reason is a helpful tool

314
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,220
we intuit that it is a useful tool but secondly when we begin reasoning we have to begin from

315
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,340
quite a host of assumptions science officially claims to make no assumptions in fact makes

316
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,660
quite a few assumptions before it gets started it has to that's not a criticism the system can't

317
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:03,060
work without somewhere to start because nothing can be supported on nothing it has to be on something

318
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:11,140
before it can get started so that's what i mean and it also ends in intuition because the results

319
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,940
of reasoning have to be reintegrated into a broader picture so it's an intermediary tool

320
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,300
reason and indeed the left hemisphere is an intermediary tool one way of thinking of it

321
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:31,700
is it's like this when you learn a musical instrument you're first attracted to a piece of

322
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,620
music in a broad sort of way then you start trying to play it and you realise you have to go

323
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,900
over and over the fingering in bar 18 and you know there's a return to the dominant at bar 32

324
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,580
or whatever it is but then when you've done all that that's not time wasted but when you come to

325
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,860
perform it if you're still thinking like that you can't perform the relationship with the hemispheres

326
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,740
is a bit like that the immediate grasp of something that the overall take on it is right

327
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,860
hemisphere the left hemisphere then gets to work and does procedural matters but then it's the

328
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,740
right hemisphere that must reintegrate that information that is not lost that process was

329
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,340
valuable but it mustn't stop there in a nutshell i think in our society we stop with the light

330
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,020
left hemisphere we don't allow it to be reintegrated into a much bigger richer picture which is in

331
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,860
touch with all the stuff that the left hemisphere doesn't know it doesn't know this reminds me quite

332
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:34,020
a lot of richard tarnas who yes who i'm afraid i haven't read yeah no i i he his book had a huge

333
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,340
impact on me when i was when i was at university but but effectively he said that he told the story

334
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,700
of western philosophy and said that it had become more and more isolating more and more a prison of

335
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,620
the intellect and that the way out would be to re-embrace intuition re-embrace direct knowledge

336
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:57,940
and that we couldn't get out until we did um so it just it seems that it maps on very very clearly

337
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:05,300
to to the picture that you're you're painting yes um the that's right and the other thing one ought

338
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:13,620
to say is that philosophy has made strides in the last couple of hundred years and i think that

339
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:24,660
um there's been a redressing of that particularly in early on in in hegel and in the the german idealist

340
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:34,020
victor shelling and so forth uh to an extent in nature who's a mad genius um but mainly in the

341
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:44,980
traddition of two uh two groups one is the american pragmatists uh cspers uh william james

342
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:54,500
and john jewell and the other is the um phenomenological tradition in europe uh heiligur uh

343
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:03,540
melaponte sheila hustle to a degree uh so i think and the later vittgenstein would fit with that

344
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:10,980
the earlier vittgenstein uh not you there was a comment on the rsa video from a physicist

345
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:18,580
who said that he found it very useful in looking at why they were so far away from coming up with

346
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,140
a theory of everything because his sense was that they're looking at the individual details and

347
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,700
not looking at the whole does that make sense it certainly does and i hadn't seen that um comment

348
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:36,340
but um well one of the gratifying things has been the number of physicists who have written

349
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:42,820
to me saying uh there are enormous resonances between your work and what we are doing in physics

350
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,820
i'm um far too unskilled to to recognise those although i have an idea of the shape of what

351
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,780
they're talking about and recently i've been trying to equate myself with quantum field theory

352
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:03,940
which is actually a very interesting development out of quantum mechanics um and i will try to write a bit

353
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:10,100
about that in my current book but only after running it by some very kind physicist friends

354
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:19,700
but i think what is um important is that what i'm saying if it is true will apply to everything

355
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,420
because it's about the nature of reality and the people who are at the cold face of reality

356
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,060
are poets and physicists and you know they have written to me saying uh how how much they feel

357
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,260
a resonance but what has struck me is that people that i didn't expect like lawyers and people in the

358
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,300
world of finance and economists you know are some of my most um frequent correspondents because

359
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:52,340
they say what you're describing is exactly the problems in our realm so i'm delighted because

360
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:59,620
i've never had the slightest belief or hope that this could happen but that what i'm saying has

361
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:12,500
been picked up by people in all walks of life

362
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,700
you
