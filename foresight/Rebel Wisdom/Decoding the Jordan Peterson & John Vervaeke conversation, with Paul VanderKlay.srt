1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
So this is a film about the recent conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Bovakie and

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,560
for it I'm joined by Paul van der Klee, how are you doing Paul?

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm doing well, it's great to be here.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,040
Awesome, yeah and I'm really glad to have you here to kind of make sense of what happened

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,280
because it's a conversation that we and a lot of other people were really really looking

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,920
forward to.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,040
Real anticipation seeing Jordan and John together and I think there was a real split in reaction

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,240
to it between people going what was that?

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,120
If you look at the comments section below it I've never seen so many people respond negatively

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,840
to Jordan's interruptions of John, I'd say that's the main sort of theme of the comments

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,480
which is extraordinary in itself but also that there's a lot of, I kind of like it like

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,920
panning for gold because there are a lot of golden nuggets within the conversation but

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,920
it's quite difficult to access them, it didn't flow very well and I think it's a really interesting,

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,800
I think shining a light on what actually happened and maybe what the backstory was could give

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,520
a lot of help to people to make sense of it.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,920
All of the difference in perspectives between John and Jordan, what was really going on

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,520
and I'm going to sort of just do a quick little bit of framing first Paul before we get into

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
kind of your reaction to it and what we made of it when we first saw it but if people are

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,920
not familiar with John's work, maybe they're very familiar with Jordan but not so familiar

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,440
with John, so John Vaveke is worked alongside Jordan in the psychology department at the

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,320
University of Toronto, they both have deep interests in kind of the area of myth, religion,

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,200
the deep story of Western culture, John had this series Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,640
50 episodes that he brought out probably in the wake of Jordan's kind of appearance on

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,080
the stage as a kind of, it probably prompted a little bit by that and John has had a huge

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,920
amount of really interesting conversations over the last couple of years with people

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,160
yourself, Jonathan Pageau, many of the people in the same kind of orbit around these sort

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:33,440
of central questions of meaning, questions of meaning, questions of the deep stories

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,720
that drive us all of the same topics that Jordan is really interested in.

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,320
I was fascinated by the clickbait title that Jordan chose for the video, a conversation

30
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,120
so intense it might be psychedelic which is interesting as well, this feels like a really

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:00,320
significant coming together of perspectives that we've been waiting and wanting to see.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,640
I'd like to start by saying they had a real enthusiasm for each other and a real, I'm

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,480
going to play a little clip now that came up at the end like the real enthusiasm and warmth

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
between the two of them.

35
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Being a great proponent of yours, I mean that in the sense of noting the greatness that's

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,560
in you and seeing how it's manifested itself, especially in your relationship with your

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,360
students and noticing that and having admiration and respect for that.

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,520
And I respect your work and I disagree with it in parts but we've always been able to do that

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,360
in a way that is born with affection and respect.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Well God, it's always nice to find someone who disagrees with your work who could help correct it.

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Exactly, seeing the other guys.

42
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,560
I mean thank God man, that's why I want to talk to you, I don't like being wrong

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,840
so and I know you don't and so no doubt we're still both pretty wrong.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,160
Mostly so, if the history of science is something we should pay attention to which we should.

45
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,800
Yes, or the history of our own life for that matter.

46
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,360
And I know Paul, you've put out a couple of reaction videos to this and you've sort of been

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,080
wrestling a little bit with what happened.

48
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Maybe you could start by framing what you were hoping for from the conversation and what your

49
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,440
reaction has been to it so far.

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,360
I too was very much looking forward to this conversation.

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:29,160
I know, I know John's work fairly well at least in these areas and I know he's got some critiques

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:38,600
of Jordan's approach to meaning through narrative, through hero mythology and I was really anticipating

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,400
those two working through some of those kinds of issues and they never got there.

54
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,800
I, my reaction like many other peoples was what was that?

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,080
I had never heard Jordan like that before.

56
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,640
I was amazed at how well John Vervecchi sort of rolled with all of the redirections

57
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,080
that happened in the conversation.

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,680
You fundamentally understand God by saying what God is not

59
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
but not of course randomly, right?

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,240
What you're trying to do is-

61
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, that's sort of like the God of the gaps.

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,360
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, sorry.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,960
No, no, that's- don't apologize, we're friends talking.

65
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Well, I don't I don't want to derail the conversation. So it's been it's been like

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,000
this and it's been wonderful. It feels to me like doing Petrie behind that conversation,

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,080
especially on Jordan's side. I think part of it is he, you know, he and John Revekey

68
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,160
last spoke in 2015. John Revekey has continued his academic trajectory. And I think with

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,520
his YouTube channel and all of these conversations with him sort of discovered a whole new pathway

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,840
where Jordan has been busy with his health, the culture war stuff. So I saw I'm I'm seeing this

71
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,280
much more as a video where Jordan is to a degree getting introduced for the first time with what

72
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,240
John has been doing for the last five years. Yeah, and that was my sense as well was that John

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,040
was, John is so enthusiastic anyway. Like he's he brought that enthusiasm to the conversation.

74
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,200
And Jordan, I think, got him got kind of swept up in that to some degree as well. And it was kind

75
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,240
of John reporting back to Jordan, like, look what you've been missing, or look what's been going

76
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,040
on. Look at all this interesting stuff that's been happening. But I want to start by pointing

77
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,280
like the central paradox of the conversation is that John's central interest is in Deologos,

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,400
which is kind of a shared dialogue that goes somewhere new. And he kind of summarized it in

79
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,480
there with talking about Phylius Sophia versus Phylius Nicaea. Phylius Nicaea meaning the love of

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,520
victory. Phylius Sophia meaning the love of knowledge. We haven't talked about why people

81
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,200
want us to talk. And the reason they want us to talk is because our ideas dovetail to a substantial

82
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,840
degree and also diverge interestingly. And so I guess they want us to talk so that we can think.

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
Well, that's it. And I see that's what I was going to say. That's one of the defining. I would

84
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,000
say one of the defining. It certainly seems to be the case as a defining criteria for Socrates,

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,240
that if you and I can get to places in the Deologos that we couldn't get to individually,

86
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,880
then real Deologos has has come into existence. And that's Phylius Sophia, the love of wisdom,

87
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,400
as opposed to Phylius Nicaea, the love of victory. And so right, right, right. I didn't know those

88
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,400
phrases. Phylius Sophia, which is the Phylius Sophia. Wisdom is the feminine essence of God.

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,680
Yeah. Well, the Phylius is, you know, it's itself a collaborative love.

90
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:05,240
Did you say Phylius? Yeah. Phylius and Phylius. Phylius Sophia. So Phylius Sophia. The three

91
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,120
loves, the Aros Phylius Agape. This is Phylius. And Phylius is the love that is expressed and

92
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,840
shared in community. And then Sophia, of course, is the word for wisdom. That's where we get

93
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,520
philosophy from. Phylius Nicaea is the love of victory, like Nike victory.

94
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,760
Right. And yeah, it's interesting because the, tell me what you think of this. I think the YouTube

95
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,920
dialogues that we undertake are characterized by Phylius Sophia. And the YouTube dialogues

96
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:43,800
conducted in the main by the, what would you call it, legacy media are Phyla, Phylius Nicaea.

97
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,680
Phylius Nicaea. And I think people appreciate Phylius Sophia much better. You better believe

98
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,840
it. I certainly appreciate it much better. For John, this is, and he studied it a lot as a

99
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,320
cognitive scientist. It's how can you have a conversation that goes somewhere new that builds

100
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,520
upon itself, that is not about trying to best the other person or just kind of repeat what you

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,200
already know. But how can you have a dialogue where you discover new territory together? And I

102
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,440
think the interesting thing for me is given that that was the subject of their talk, the question

103
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,480
is how much they achieved that in that conversation. And I mean, if you go by the YouTube comments,

104
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,680
you probably say that they didn't achieve it very much. And it goes to the heart, I think of

105
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,360
what I consider like the trajectory of Jordan Peterson over the last, since his kind of eruption

106
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:45,080
onto the stage, the whole Peterson phenomenon of 2018 onwards, that sense of novelty and whether,

107
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,760
like my overall sense of him getting slightly stuck in his story, which I'll come to a little bit

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,680
in a bit. But there was this weird, almost performative contradiction, given the topic that

109
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,360
John has made this kind of lifetime study of, of what does it mean to get that into a flow state

110
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,640
together? What does it mean to explore new territory together? What does it mean to

111
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,000
actually know the cognitive science of what is going on physiologically when we're in this kind

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,080
of flow state of exploration? And I like my overall sense is that I would love to see,

113
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,400
and this is not judgmental, because Jordan is obviously coming back from a huge

114
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,120
number of difficulties, the health problems, and it's kind of certainly not up to full strength.

115
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,680
But to the hope is that in time, we might see Jordan enter more into those kind of conversations.

116
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,240
But I felt that it was, there were elements, there were moments of that in this conversation

117
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,600
with John, but it was very glitchy. Like there wasn't so much of a sense of a shared

118
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,320
edifice that they were both building together. There was a sort of, I think there were moments

119
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,000
of that, but it also just felt, I think glitchy is probably the best word that I can think of.

120
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:15,000
I agree. In some ways, I contrast this with Jordan's first talk with Sam Harris with Brett

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,040
Weinstein there. In that first talk in Vancouver, Jordan was very clearly trying to build something,

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,320
and Sam wasn't playing. Sam sort of played this knock it down game, and Jordan kept trying to

123
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,240
construct something. Sam kept trying to knock things down. In this conversation, I don't think

124
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:44,360
Jordan was trying to knock things down. I think he was, I hear in many places in the video,

125
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,400
he's trying to grasp, to assimilate, to figure out where John is at. And so he's doing a lot of

126
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,760
attempts at recognition, attempts at connection, but usually what you get with that hopefully

127
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,400
is a weaving together of things. Whereas there, it was sort of two tracks. John would mention

128
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,840
something, and Jordan would connect it with something, and John would go a little further,

129
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,800
and Jordan would connect it to something else. John was very gracious in sort of developing

130
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,240
that connection a little bit, but then John continued to want to get back to

131
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,840
something a little bit more consistent. And I think actually through the video,

132
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:35,640
John was able to make some impact, at least in terms of John's four Ps of knowledge, expanding

133
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:44,040
beyond the propositional into the perspectival participatory. And I think that was helpful.

134
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,920
And at the end of the video, I think they achieved some of that.

135
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,160
Yeah, and I'd love to maybe go into with you sort of sifting some of those

136
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,880
flecks of gold from the interview in a second. I just thought I'd, my overall sense about this

137
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,320
sense of Deologos, this sense of going somewhere new in a conversation, I'd like to just sort of

138
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,720
drill into that because my sense of what, when I first discovered Jordan Peterson in 2017,

139
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,160
watching his lectures was, there was this real sense of exploration, like he was going on a

140
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,200
journey, you could sort of see him in the Maps of Meaning series in 2017. It was not a dialogue,

141
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,240
but it kind of was. You saw him, he'd find one of his students who was listening and he'd speak to

142
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,760
them, and he'd respond to kind of the mood in the room. And you got this sense of there was a lot

143
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,800
and aliveness to his exploration. It was like he was walking in a landscape and putting things

144
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,360
together as he was walking. And I think that was part of what was really compelling about

145
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,240
him in that sense. And then I think when he first came to attention in 2018, he had a series of

146
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,720
conversations with people that also felt like they had that kind of sense of exploration.

147
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,360
And then we saw him go on this book tour where he was pretty much with differences, like not

148
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,240
every evening was the same, but he was doing the same story pretty much every night. And my sense

149
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,320
is that over time he got more and more trapped in that story, that he wasn't really on that sense of

150
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,600
exploration or on that sense of kind of novelty anymore. And I think that, I mean, people that I

151
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,000
know who knew him at the time also said they found him sort of, he got a little bit more stuck and

152
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,680
a little bit more reactive. And one of the amazing things that I think a lot of us really respect

153
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,600
about him is he also reflected on that himself. I remember a question that he answered in an AMA

154
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,000
a while ago that I'll probably play the clip from here. He talked about the corruption of his soul

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,440
that he recognized and the way that he was responding to journalists, for example.

156
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,400
The problem is I'm becoming too much on guard. And I've noticed a developing sense of impatience

157
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,280
within me and some suspicion. And that's not good. I don't want to be in situations where

158
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,040
those are my fundamental orientations. It's a sign of a certain amount of internal corruption on my

159
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,880
part. And I want to be in situations where I'm speaking with people, speaking honestly to people

160
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,840
who are honestly listening. And this is what I felt coming through quite a bit in the conversation

161
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,160
with John. It came in and came out this sense of John would say something that sparked a story

162
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,760
that Jordan already knew. And he'd start kind of telling that story. And I've seen that quite a

163
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,880
lot in some of his interviews since he's come back. And it reminds me as a journalist, whenever I

164
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:49,480
interview someone usually quite prominent, who's been interviewed a lot in the past, you know that

165
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,360
if you ask them certain questions, they're going to give you a story. And it's almost impossible to

166
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,800
get them out of that once they start. The more the more famous someone is, the more used to

167
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,000
they are to telling that story. It's like, okay, here comes the story about this. I won't name any

168
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,640
names. But it's happened quite a lot. And part of your job as a journalist, like how can I get them

169
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,760
out of those tram tracks and into new territory? And sometimes it's very, very difficult because

170
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,840
anything you say, they'll just go into the story they already know. And I've had the sense sometimes

171
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,240
with Jordan in the conversations he had since he's got back, a guest will say something, and then

172
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,280
it's like, okay, now it's the Cain and Abel story. Now it's the Tower of Abel story. And it's like,

173
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,320
as the audience, we've already heard all of those things. And there's something in that. It's like,

174
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,760
it's the, when you go and see a band, and it's like, well, play the hits, you already know,

175
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:45,080
there's a little bit of that. But that was, I felt that coming up quite a bit in the John

176
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,160
conversation that John would say something, and then Jordan would kind of go into something that

177
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,760
we were already familiar with. And that's also how I, having tracked the whole kind of intellectual

178
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,160
dark web conversation, that's where that kind of glitched out as well for me was this sense of,

179
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,640
for various tribal reasons, for various kind of aligned incentive reasons for various

180
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,920
that that sense of exploration and novelty that I felt in 2018 2019 just fell away.

181
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,520
Audience capture being another issue, like all of these different things start to start to just,

182
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,560
and I think because of the nature of the media environment we're in at the moment, it literally

183
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:31,080
warps around you. You don't, you start to kind of tune out anyone who doesn't have a positive,

184
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,680
you've got an infinite amount of feedback. So you only start listening to the supportive stuff,

185
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,120
you start kind of just producing stuff for the your traditional audience. Some things become

186
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,080
profitable, admitting you're wrong about certain things is not profitable. All of those kind of

187
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,880
factors start to come in as well. But that's why I think this is such a fascinating conversation to

188
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,160
analyze, because the topic at hand, Deologos emergent alive dialogue is the thing I think

189
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,760
that we that we were attracted to originally. And I think it's also the thing that could

190
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:12,040
that will that could potentially be Jordan's healing as well in some ways. Like I think that's

191
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,480
what he needs that sense of like pursuing truth in an original in an interesting and in an

192
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,840
unscripted way again. I think that would that's the sort of the juice in some ways.

193
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,920
The description on the video, I initially I was quite surprised the video was released at all

194
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:36,760
because of the strangeness of it. And I think that was known because of the strange psychedelic

195
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:45,320
reference in the title. My take on this increasingly is is more shamanic. And I think what you

196
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:56,360
described is is what Jordan needs in that something needs to disrupt his sense making.

197
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,480
We need to see in him a hunger again for something other than a lot of the political

198
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:11,080
or social transformations he's been talking about. And and I think you're right that the irony of the

199
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:19,560
video is that this is about Deologos. And that is what we were looking for from it. And that is,

200
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,760
I think in many ways what Jordan needs. Now, I'm fully aware that as a Christian minister using

201
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:36,520
the word shamanic will raise a lot of eyebrows among Christians. But as a as a working preacher

202
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:46,440
and minister, that is exactly the way the Bible works in a preacher's soul. Because the Bible

203
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,760
is a very strange book. And especially the teachings of Jesus, they're supposed to disrupt.

204
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,240
And if you read the sermon on the mount, after 2000 years, nobody's really quite sure what that

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,640
sermon means. And in that sense, it's rather shamanic in that it's supposed to break up our sense

206
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:13,000
making. So I think I think a number of us are looking for that for Jordan and from Jordan,

207
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,720
because with, you know, what I often call his first wave, I think that's what propelled him.

208
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:27,000
When he came onto the scene, we heard something in that moment that broke up sort of the,

209
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,720
the stage sense making and said, Oh, here's some fresh insight. Now, whether Jordan has that in

210
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,360
him or not, I've spoken to a number of his undergraduate and graduate students who some

211
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:50,840
of whom say things like he, your first, your first impression, your first for your first take

212
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:57,320
for Jordan for a while is very, is very much that way. But then you, once you've heard about,

213
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,600
you know, the rats and the wolves, and then he sort of, then, okay, this is all map territory,

214
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,840
and you move on. And so I agree very much that I think if Jordan is going to

215
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:20,120
really content to find, to be able to make the kinds of contribution we saw in 2017, 2018,

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,760
he's going to need different conversation partners. And I don't know that the current

217
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:34,280
conversations he's doing, which have many of which are sort of book interviews, but they're

218
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,640
not really interviews. In other words, he's, I, in some ways, I, I see him trying to get at Dea

219
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,920
Logos. And here, John Vervake actually has in a very, you know, serious way, he's been studying it.

220
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:58,360
And so I would love to see Jordan sort of come to John and say, help me, John, you know, find a

221
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:06,840
new way of having transformative conversations that not only transform me, but transform even

222
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,120
an audience. And, and I think, as Jonathan Peugeot said, hopefully transform what is a fan base,

223
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:22,520
which isn't particularly helpful, but maybe a broader community where they can be, where there

224
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,040
can be productive pushback and productive engagement that allows all of us to grow.

225
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,120
And, you know, that's what I've seen in a lot of, in a lot of your community and,

226
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,360
and the way that you've pursued this work.

227
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,920
Yeah. And I'd like to play that clip from Jonathan Peugeot now.

228
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,720
You're always aiming at something that's better, or you wouldn't be aiming. You're always moving

229
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,000
towards something that's better, or you wouldn't be moving. So then why wouldn't you move towards

230
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,800
the greatest good? Yeah. Well, it's because it's terrifying, I suppose in part. But then as, you

231
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,600
know, I've tried to put that into practice in my life and it's tearing me into pieces.

232
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Yeah. I don't know, though, if, if one of the reasons is because you're also alone.

233
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,120
And I, you know, because you, I mean, at least to my understanding, you're not in a, in a, in a

234
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,080
community. Well, it's hard to say. I mean, it's hard to say.

235
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,800
Because fans are certainly having laughs. Well, they've been a community. I mean,

236
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,600
one of the things that has held me together certainly is the commitment that I feel to,

237
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,240
to the people who've been so positive towards me and my family. I mean, it was very subtle,

238
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:57,160
but I got the sense in that, that Jonathan was questioning, but the whole fan versus peer dynamic,

239
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,120
which I think we can all slip into on this, in this, this, the weird kind of nature of, of the,

240
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,280
the business that we're in, if we're making content, and particularly if we're sort of,

241
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,160
if that's a big part of our lives or a big part of our business, it's very difficult to,

242
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,000
it's very difficult to avoid that dynamic, especially if in some ways you're kind of

243
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,080
financially tied up with it as well. But I think this was, yeah, I think that's what Jonathan,

244
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,920
I haven't checked that with Jonathan, to be honest, but that was what I made of that

245
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,720
interaction was, was a sort of cautionary, wo wo careful fans are not people coming up to you

246
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,760
after a lecture, people kind of in your comments threads, they're not the same as, as peers who

247
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,440
will challenge your thinking, who will reflect back to you and will help you to kind of develop.

248
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,840
And, and that's what was also beautiful about the conversation with John is,

249
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,480
as Jordan reflected at the end, he was, he's glad to have those relationships and,

250
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,560
and that's what's exciting, potentially about them continuing those conversations and

251
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,640
continuing the, the dialogue. I think part of what needs to enter into,

252
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,760
into these, into the space that we're, we're sort of creating and exploring

253
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,800
is the question of institution, because in a university context, the university is supposed

254
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:28,040
to provide that in a church context, the church is supposed to provide that what we're sort of

255
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:36,600
doing out here in YouTube land does not really provide that. We might have some peer accountability,

256
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,640
if I say something that I lose status in the eyes of David Fuller or Rebel Wisdom or John

257
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,480
Vervake or Jonathan Peugeot, there might be a little bit of accountability in there, but I think

258
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,680
asking deeper questions about structures and institutions would be helpful in

259
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:04,920
creating communities where that afford this over a long period of time. And, and I don't think any

260
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:12,600
of us quite know how to do that, because I don't know that we've necessarily been able to create

261
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,560
structures that afford that very well. Can you explain what you think those might look like?

262
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:28,120
I don't know, because again, obviously as a, as a working pastor,

263
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:35,560
churches have some of those dynamics, but all the same, those same issues of audience capture

264
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,120
are very true for clergy, because you get captured by your congregation. They pay your salary,

265
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,480
and so then clergy, then maybe go to different places.

266
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,760
I think what we've seen created, I mean, John Vervake will often talk about

267
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,720
this little corner of the internet where we're having conversations with you, with Jonathan

268
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Peugeot, with each other. We've got some of that going, but we, you know, and I like what

269
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,600
Peugeot said to him when he said, you know, fans are not a church. Okay, well, what, what is this

270
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,320
church supposed to do? A church, and this is actually my, churches in the modernist frame have

271
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,800
become these little propaganda machines. And I think that is there undoing right now, because for

272
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,320
many people, the last place you would go to have an open conversation about you, what you really

273
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,080
think, even if it's heterodox, would be a church, because you'll lose status for heterodoxy.

274
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,760
Heterodoxy in itself is not necessarily helpful. And I think John's idea of Dia Logos, where you've

275
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,360
got, where you've got two people seeking truth, early in the conversation, Jordan Peterson talked

276
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:00,200
about sort of hunting philosophia, which I thought was good. But that's more of what we need. And

277
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:09,320
perhaps what we should think about more are hunting bands where, you know, people, people

278
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,680
have practiced ways of collaboration. They know each other's skills. Yet what motivates the hunt

279
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,640
for the tribe is the need for food. And I think as you described, what happens to people when they

280
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:31,800
get a very high status, wealthy, successful, they're no longer on the hunt. And there is a certain,

281
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:40,040
you know, Jordan's been back now since January. It's not clear what he's doing, but I fear a

282
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,320
certain lostness because he's had a couple of successful books. You know, anybody will talk to

283
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,200
him, almost anybody who he wants to will talk to him. Where's the hunt?

284
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:05,160
Well, the hunt is the internal drive towards truth, which I think was what really drew so many of

285
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:15,240
us to him originally. I would say there is an open question. You have to see what are the

286
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,360
confounding factors in that. I mean, the whole idea of petus and ink nowadays, I think, is something

287
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:30,120
that do you have the incentive structure still to go for truth, especially when certain things that

288
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:37,560
you say get a certain audience. And it's very difficult not to kind of follow that, even if

289
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:44,760
that's completely unconscious. And then there's various things that you can easily dismiss people

290
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,360
who are critical of you as being bad faith or motivated by some other kind of, oh, they're just

291
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:58,040
trying to get views off my name or whatever that might be. And then you start screening out people

292
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,480
who might have useful things to reflect back to you. And you see that happen constantly in this

293
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,920
landscape. And then you've got the comment sections, you've got, I mean, I find that, and I think also

294
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:18,120
a little bit of self reflection and awareness of like that happens to all of us, probably to

295
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,960
rebel wisdom as much as anyone. I can't deny that I'm conscious of the comment section. But at the

296
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,520
same time, what I will say is there's a paradox of, I don't think, I think people have still got in

297
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,600
their minds this sort of like alternative versus mainstream. What they don't realize is once you've

298
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:46,200
created a little thing around being alternative, that becomes the status quo at that point.

299
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,560
So I'll put out films that they'll be like, Oh, that's too consensus or that's too status quo.

300
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,280
It's like, not for this ecosystem, it isn't. I know that when I put out certain things,

301
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,840
it's going to get a bad reaction from from the comment section. It's like, what's more brave,

302
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,360
putting out anti woke stuff that I know is going to go down incredibly well in this little ecosystem

303
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,000
that I'm part of, or putting stuff out that's going to challenge that perspective.

304
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,720
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm, I'm have to be aware of my own biases as well. Like,

305
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,360
I know there's a lot of people are like, Oh, you, you come from mainstream media,

306
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,400
your BBC channel for or whatever, and you're just still part of that. It's like, well,

307
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,840
maybe I have some of that. But also, I think there's a lot of values that were held within the

308
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,320
tradition of journalism around truth seeking, that maybe a lot of journalism has lost. But I

309
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,600
think the alternative media has lost it, never really had it. And that's the key point that I

310
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,520
keep coming back to. It's like the incentive structures of the alternative are not conducive

311
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:58,840
to truth seeking at all. The incentive structures of the mainstream are increasingly less conducive

312
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,040
to truth seeking as well. But that's why we're in this really terrifying valley,

313
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,880
what I've called the uncanny valley between the two. And that's what kind of obsesses me. And I'm

314
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,640
fascinated by because we're all like Jordan Peterson. All of us are trying to pursue truth in our own

315
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:26,840
kind of limited way and sense made together. And I think you're that brings back to what

316
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,320
you were saying before of like, how do we do this? Because we've seen we can't really do this alone.

317
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,840
We've seen so many cautionary tales of people being captured by their audience of being,

318
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,600
yeah, basically falling by the wayside, the entire kind of history of the IDW is like

319
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,880
one by one falling by the wayside. And as an alternative sense making structure,

320
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,920
like that's a terrible cautionary tale. Like these are very, very smart people and they all got

321
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,640
captured in one way or another, or most of them got captured in one way or another,

322
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,760
or fell out or stopped kind of moving forward or whatever it whatever it is.

323
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,160
But yeah, that question of how do we do this and some kind of

324
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,360
bands of hunters, like you say, I think is the way to do it is to is to be in relationship with

325
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,920
people who are able to challenge us and we're able to kind of develop our kind of sharpener

326
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
and knives against each other.

327
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Part of the irony of the taking down of the mass media culture has been that

328
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,880
part of what afforded truth seeking and internal critique, self critique,

329
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,600
within that culture was its, well, its establishment, its sense of establishment.

330
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,680
I was speaking with an accountant who was a neighbor of mine who used to work for newspapers

331
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,160
and he said, you know, in the 70s and 80s, newspapers were enormously profitable.

332
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,480
And what that afforded was the New York Times could have, I mean, in a sense, they were so

333
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,200
well established, they could have all kinds of self criticism built into it.

334
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,280
And I think as you well described, a lot of alternative media is so captured by audience,

335
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,000
they can't afford to waver from their, from their dogma.

336
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,720
And now we're seeing that in the mass media as well, because they're so hungry, they can't afford.

337
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:35,480
I thought that came quite through, I thought that came through quite well in Peterson's Barry

338
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,560
Weiss interview. And so actually with the decline of blue church, we're finding blue church

339
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:51,320
increasingly acting like alternative, let's say, you know, narrowly, you know, narrow agenda

340
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:59,320
organisms. And so again, I think there's, there's both a, a kind of a, a hunger driven,

341
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,040
a hunger for the truth driven that has to be willing to say, I don't, I don't care how poor

342
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,560
this makes me, I'm that hungry, but then probably also on the other side, where you have structures

343
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,360
that say, okay, I can, I can reasonably afford to pursue the truth and I know it will cost me,

344
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:28,760
but I'm, you know, that is what we do. And this kind of corruption, I think you find,

345
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,000
I certainly see it in church structures, but now we're seeing it in, as I think Jordan Hall

346
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,920
nicely says, blue church structures as well. It's a weird paradox that as the alternative

347
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:50,360
gets stronger, the mainstream is becoming more alternative. Yes. Yeah. I wonder just whether

348
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,480
we might go back to, as we sort of taught, as I mentioned, sort of panning for gold, like the

349
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:03,000
gold flex in the, in the conversation. I mean, I was really interested in what they were talking

350
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,240
about related to the, they touched on postmodernism, but only very briefly.

351
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,640
John was talking about sort of Foucault and Derrida having a little bit more of a complex,

352
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,840
it being a slightly more complex picture than is often painted of the, of the postmodernists.

353
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,360
And that felt, that felt rich in itself, that could have been a conversation.

354
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,800
If the mainstream of Western culture is the mainstream of human culture,

355
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,200
or akin to it, so akin to that shamanic tradition, for example,

356
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,000
then the claim is that that mainstream is, is the desire for power. And that's the opposite

357
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,680
of what we're saying. Genuinely, the opposite. It's the antithesis to that, because that isn't,

358
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:53,720
isn't Philo Nikea, the antithesis to? Yeah, I think it is. Well, I mean, that's part of it.

359
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,640
Is it, is it genuinely the antithesis? I mean, so is this, is this a claim of,

360
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,680
is this a claim of satanic possession of the West? I mean, is the, is the,

361
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,040
is the culture war that deep? Well, I don't know. I mean, the claim is that it's about fundamentals.

362
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,720
Right. It's a fundamental critique of Western society. It means fundamental. That's why

363
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,800
Derrida went after philogo centric, philogo centrism.

364
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah. And I think, and there's in Foucault, it does similar things, but the thing you have,

365
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,440
you have to remember is, you know, toward the ends of Derrida's career, right? He's reaching into

366
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Neoplatonic mysticism, negative theology is something he starts to take an interest in,

367
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,520
and Foucault, you know, you know, technologies of the self. And he gets very deeply interested

368
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,600
in the work of Pierre Hadeau, right? And what is ancient philosophy and the wisdom tradition

369
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,440
and Philea Sophia? And he starts to turn towards it and starts to recognize it as

370
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,320
I know nothing of that. I know nothing of that. Yeah. Well, that's what, so I mean,

371
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,360
well, that's, that's very interesting. And then he dies.

372
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,960
Yeah. Foucault also.

373
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Or Foucault. No, Derrida, we were, sorry, we were speaking of Derrida.

374
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,880
I was speaking of both. I said, you see Foucault getting very interested in

375
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,960
negative theology, Neoplatonic mysticism. And then you see Foucault getting very interested in,

376
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,080
you know, Stoicism and Pierre Hadeau's work.

377
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,480
There's an irony in Peterson's work that I thought really came between the Michael Malice and the

378
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:28,200
Barry Weiss. Because on one hand, Peterson has made a name for himself bashing post-modernity.

379
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:42,520
But Peterson is himself post-modern in some deep ways. And a regular critique of Peterson,

380
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,720
you had James K. Smith, a professor from Calvin University on your program. And he,

381
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,640
you know, this is one of his critiques of Peterson as well. And I, I think,

382
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,800
I think the way forward for someone like Peterson.

383
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,800
In what, in what way, Paul, in what way is Jordan Peterson post-modern?

384
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:13,080
Modernity is dying. And when, and, and John in that conversation nicely set up the contrast

385
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:21,640
between the three P's, which are much more lived experience, perspectival, procedural.

386
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,720
And, and so you've got the one P, which is propositional. And modernity is all about

387
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,120
the world of objects, where, where Peterson, when Peterson begins maps of meaning,

388
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,560
there are two ways to view the world, a world of objects and a form for action. And so Peterson

389
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,160
very much takes the pragmatists through modernity. But within that pragmatism,

390
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,880
there is what, what John Vervecchi talks about those three P's. And in this, in this beautiful

391
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,520
section, at a point that John Vervecchi makes all often, he says, what is emerging out of cognitive

392
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:09,160
science is a recognition that our ability to grasp something means sort of taking it into

393
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,960
ourselves. We grasp the cup and about minute 25 in there, he goes through that. We grasp the cup.

394
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,880
In other words, something of the cup has to get into my mind. And so the subject object distinction

395
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:31,800
is being broken down by cognitive science. And that is, that is something within post-modernity

396
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,560
that they in fact have been working at. Because within post-modernity, there's a critique of

397
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:46,520
that subject object. We are, we are disinterested viewers from above who see the world as it is.

398
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:55,720
And cognitive science is saying, that's not how we know the world at all. And, and Peterson

399
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:06,440
with his sort of ancient modern approach has always sort of flexed in that direction and asked

400
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:17,880
questions that make rigid modernists like Sam Harris uncomfortable. And so when you look at,

401
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:25,160
you know, Peterson drew such a strange breadth of fans, some of them, you know,

402
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,400
as, as John Vervecchi said in that interview, people do not appreciate how radical

403
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:40,120
Jonathan Peugeot is. And he's so radical because he's so ancient. And that ancient modern has been

404
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:48,840
attention in church circles now for the last 20 years as modernity is receding. And as there is a

405
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:58,040
recognition that proposition as such is always necessary. It's deeply embedded in the scientific

406
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:07,720
effort, but is insufficient for human beings to actually move forward and increasingly is

407
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,000
an insufficient descriptor. And this deeply critiques Protestantism, which is of course,

408
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm a Protestant minister, deeply critiques the ways that we have framed communities.

409
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:28,360
So that has always been in Peterson and John is in some ways pushing him on that and saying,

410
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,840
okay, what does that mean as a scientist? Because Peterson has always, if you listen to

411
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,680
Peterson and Barry Weiss, they're lamenting the loss of blue church, you know, whoa,

412
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,840
blue church has fallen. And well, that's, Jordan's been pushing it.

413
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,320
Yeah, you can argue he's probably one of the primary factors in the loss of

414
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,680
faith that so many people had in blue church, meaning the sort of media establishment.

415
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:07,320
I think he he certainly and potentially quite deliberately embarked on a on his

416
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,800
mission to show up or or one of the one of the effects was to show up all of the limitations

417
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:23,720
of that structure. Yeah, but I think yeah, I like that idea. And I think you're right that kind of

418
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:31,880
the contrast and conflict between him and Sam Harris is very much Sam Harris from from Will

419
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:40,040
Barry in terms is orange, modern, completely modern, rationality rules. And in a way,

420
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,240
Peterson probably is postmodern relative to that, because he's

421
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:55,160
but arguably he's also, I mean, he's not, you could argue he's metamodern, I don't know if you

422
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,520
know those distinctions. So the idea in integral theory is that you've got modernism science,

423
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:07,880
which is the structure, then postmodernism was effectively a kind of deconstructive force around

424
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,040
that, which is obviously something Peterson plays himself against. But in a way,

425
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:23,000
Peterson is postmodern in his critique of modernism, but he's reconstituting it. So in a way, you

426
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,240
probably would put him integral or or, yeah, integral or metamodern, I mean, there's different

427
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:38,200
words for it. But effectively, it's the word for a perspective that can observe and understand

428
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,840
the other perspective that understands what postmodernism is. It understands what modernism is.

429
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,200
Because within those worldviews, they can't actually understand the critiques, they can't

430
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,440
understand the the other worldviews. Whereas the the the idea is that there's an integral worldview

431
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,320
that can actually understand all of these different perspectives. And I'd say that's where I probably

432
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:07,640
place Peterson within that. But his critiques are are the same as yeah, his critiques of science

433
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,440
scientism and materialism are very similar to a lot of the postmodern critiques. That's interesting.

434
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,680
And I just and Peterson partly gets there because of his Darwinian truth. And that's,

435
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,120
I mean, when he showed up in the in the Christian sphere,

436
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:37,320
he basically uses Darwin to give an account for the credibility of, let's call it ancient wisdom,

437
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:47,800
because if the wisdom has survived this long, that is a tell for truth. But modernity arose

438
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:57,960
in the frustration with the letdown of certain forms of ancient wisdom. And, you know, I don't

439
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,560
know very much about, you know, I've listened to some of your content about integral theory. But

440
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:11,480
I think with each passing, there's always in the initial stages of passing, there's always

441
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:19,560
throwing too much away. And then after sort of the the tragedy of the revolution,

442
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,880
those who are a little bit beyond it say, all right, well, what of modernity should we keep?

443
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,840
And what of modernity was unhelpful? And that's successive over all of the various patterns

444
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:40,920
that went before. And Peterson, I think part of what he has shown is he has that capacity

445
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,320
but and again, to come back to Dia Logos, the I think the questions are

446
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:56,600
what kinds of conversation partners, what kinds of needs are going to help him to

447
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,000
fulfill that potential that I think that potential is I think what a lot of us saw in him and say,

448
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:12,840
there's real potential there for breakthroughs beyond some of the siloed structures. And again,

449
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:20,840
it's someone in the church, a tremendous weakness of the church has been its siloed nature. It either

450
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:29,080
has borders that are too thin, where it's always just me to me to me to behind any new, you know,

451
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:36,280
progressive cause or it's so rigid that, you know, we're just going to try to outlast the world,

452
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,320
but that isn't working. So and Peterson showed, I think, potential for

453
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,720
affording some breakthroughs with a lot of these boundary issues.

454
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:54,760
Yeah, this feels very, you know, very narratively right to kind of finish maybe on this on this

455
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:02,600
point. And I agree that the idea that who are the dialogue partners that he maybe needs to engage

456
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,640
in to recapture that sense of exploration. I think John is definitely one. And I think

457
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,800
pretty much all the people who John has been in dialogue with over the last two years,

458
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,440
like all of those, there's some fascinating conversations with people like Bernardo Castro

459
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:26,520
and Jonathan Pageau and others exploring and getting into the stream of thought,

460
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,000
like jumping into the stream of thought and swimming together, this sort of sense of

461
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,880
rather than coming from a fixed position, a sort of more malleable position where you're in dialogue

462
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,120
with others and evolving your thinking. I also would like if people are watching this and they're

463
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,320
not familiar with John Bovaki's work, I wanted to reference some of the films that I think would

464
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,760
help kind of frame him in a better way than happened in that conversation maybe. We put out

465
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,200
a few interviews with him, one called Flow States and Wisdom, another one after the

466
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,960
Meaning Crisis, which is where he kind of frames his new Deologos project. And another great dialogue

467
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,720
between John and Peter Limburg called the Evolving Conversation. I want to put up the title cards

468
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,760
from those on over the video and people can kind of find them in the show notes below. And also,

469
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:23,880
maybe just touch on we've been trying to kind of like how come I trained as a counselor,

470
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,880
but that's my background and I trained in a form of Deologos called Inquiry,

471
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,840
which is really in dialogue with another person trying to get to the edge of our understanding,

472
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,720
trying to articulate what's going on in the relational field between us and to take ourselves

473
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,840
somewhere new in that kind of exploration. And we've tried to do that as well with the courses

474
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,280
that we're running as well, with John Bovaki as one of the guest faculty on our Sense Making 101

475
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,240
course. I'd like to give a little plug for that. If you enjoyed the conversation with John or you

476
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:59,960
want to learn more, check out that course because that's part of the answer for me is like I don't

477
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,160
think we can do this without becoming different kind of, as you said before, without allowing

478
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,120
ourselves to be transformed. And that's really what we've been trying to do, like how can we do,

479
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:19,160
it's why we've had such a focus on practice and such a focus on events and

480
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,920
sessions that try and work with some of these technologies. And I also point people towards

481
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,560
other really amazing technologies like circling, like Inquiry, all of the empathy circles,

482
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,480
glass bead games, some of these other kind of technologies, because I think,

483
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,120
and then that links back to what we were saying before about John's

484
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,600
4p cognitive science, the propositional is not enough. The propositional is one aspect,

485
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:55,640
but the procedural, the perspectival and the participatory is absolutely crucial. And yeah,

486
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,120
I think that's hopefully what we're all trying to kind of bring more in our own ways.

487
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:11,400
And from, I mean, from the church side of things, I mean, churches have part of that

488
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,560
conversation that I thought was very interesting was when they, when John was talking about grasping

489
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:26,600
the cup, you have a sense that you can look at the light, or you can see through the light. And

490
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:33,240
they're both valid perspectives. But there needs to be a transformation that occurs, obviously,

491
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,880
in Christian tradition, you know, we've got a lot of words for this, this is conversion, this is

492
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:44,840
quickening, this is, and, and, and you need to do that in order to know, it isn't the question,

493
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,160
as in a modern sense, where you sit above it, and you, you look at all the pieces and you

494
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:57,720
take an analysis, you actually have to step into it in order to know. And, and that's sort of

495
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:07,160
connects, I think, the knowing and loving. Because in, you do not know unless you love,

496
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,960
and, and in some ways, you cannot love unless you know at least something. So, I mean, that,

497
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,440
at least for a Christian minister, that's always a part of, of my work and, and always the, the

498
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,680
question of continuing to reform institutions. Always a pleasure, Paul. And I really like

499
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:35,480
your new setup. You're looking very professional. Well, thank you, David. I am, I don't try too

500
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:42,600
hard at that, but I appreciate it. Awesome. Our ability to make sense of the world is breaking

501
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,200
down. We're making more and more consequential choices with worse and worse sense making to

502
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,760
inform those choices, which is kind of running increasingly fast through the woods, increasingly

503
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,880
blind. Over the last two years, Rebel Wisdom has interviewed some of the world's top thinkers.

504
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:07,880
Now we've brought them together for an eight week online course, Sense Making 101, with Daniel

505
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:15,880
Schmacktenburger, Diane Musho-Hamilton, John Vivecchi, Doshin Roshi, and more. Improve your

506
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:25,160
sense making, develop your sovereignty, and join a wider community looking to do the same.
