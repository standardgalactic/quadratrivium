WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
This is the first ever conversation between two of my favourite cultural commentators,

00:14.760 --> 00:19.720
the writers Paul Kingsnorth and Mary Harrington, and it's all about the overlaps between their

00:19.720 --> 00:24.200
thought and their analysis of what we're calling the war on reality.

00:24.640 --> 00:30.520
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine, all the time in the writing I'm doing at the

00:30.520 --> 00:34.600
moment. It's not my word, I've stolen from writers like D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell

00:34.600 --> 00:39.560
and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years. And

00:39.560 --> 00:44.400
I'm really talking about this giant techno industrial monstrosity that is in our heads

00:44.400 --> 00:48.520
and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the

00:48.520 --> 00:52.280
project of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on

00:52.320 --> 00:57.960
God and consequently we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place

00:57.960 --> 01:03.880
within that. I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of what you call the

01:03.880 --> 01:10.200
machine, Paul, wants to turn everything into standing reserve. It wants to enclose everything.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.520
It started with the commons and then it started patenting things and now it's moving on to

01:14.520 --> 01:19.560
patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences. I invited them to dialogue because I had an

01:19.560 --> 01:24.360
intuition they'd be able to go deep together. And this went even better than I expected.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.600
I think it's a really important development in the cultural conversation and I'll come back

01:28.600 --> 01:38.280
and explain why at the end. So, hope you enjoy it. Paul Kings North, Mary Harrington, welcome.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.480
Thanks for having me. Good to be here. So, this is, I believe, the first time that you

01:45.480 --> 01:49.640
both have been in dialogue with each other. You've both written for Unheard. So, you've been

01:50.360 --> 01:56.680
in the same online magazine and there's a lot of overlaps between your thinking. So,

01:56.680 --> 02:02.760
I'm really looking forward to this conversation. And as I thought maybe it'd be good to start maybe

02:02.760 --> 02:06.120
with asking you each, because I know you've both been looking forward to being in dialogue with

02:06.120 --> 02:11.320
each other, what it is that you are looking forward to talking about and what you find

02:11.320 --> 02:16.200
interesting in each other's thought before we dive into some of the topics we prepared.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.800
I like Paul's conception of the machine. I'd be happy to talk about that for an hour and a half.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.560
Yeah, I mean, I think we're coming at the same thing from a different perspective actually. I

02:27.560 --> 02:33.240
really like, I love the notion of reactionary feminism actually. Apart from being a great catch

02:33.240 --> 02:37.960
phrase, it actually really opens up a lot of really necessary questions about and not just about

02:38.600 --> 02:42.200
women's issues either, but just broadly about limits and the body and nature.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, you get it. You get it, you see.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.320
I do get it because you're coming from a feminist perspective at the same sort of stuff I think

02:49.320 --> 02:54.280
I'm writing about from whatever perspective I write. The moment you start thinking about reactionary

02:54.280 --> 02:57.640
feminism, you realise it's reactionary eco-feminism and then you're away.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.840
Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose what I would say I'm coming from, I suppose, is my background as

03:02.840 --> 03:07.400
a former environmental activist, somebody who writes and thinks about the natural world a lot,

03:07.400 --> 03:10.520
and you don't have to do that for very long before you realise that obviously we're

03:10.520 --> 03:14.600
intimately a part of it. And the whole thing is a question of limits and whether or not we can

03:14.600 --> 03:19.160
break them. And then the questions about the body and the questions about women's and men's bodies

03:19.160 --> 03:23.000
and the questions about the reality of being human and the questions about rainforests and

03:23.000 --> 03:26.520
climate change turn out to be the same questions, which is how we live within limits.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.440
Good, well, that's it. We've dealt with everything.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.520
So that's good. Thanks, David.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.120
Great. Mary and Paul, thank you very much.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.520
Yeah, that's it. That's the tweet. That's what it says.

03:39.480 --> 03:47.080
Yeah, that's a really great introduction. And as you said, Paul, that the idea is

03:47.960 --> 03:54.280
that somehow the modern world seems to be in conflict with itself, or at least with the

03:54.280 --> 03:58.920
natural world. And this is something you've touched on in your writing, and Mary, you've touched on

03:58.920 --> 04:05.480
as well. Could we start by framing that? How do you see that from the sort of biggest picture?

04:06.360 --> 04:12.120
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine all the time in the writing I'm doing

04:12.120 --> 04:16.360
at the moment. It's not my word. I've stolen from writers like D. H. Lawrence and George Orwell

04:16.360 --> 04:20.040
and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years.

04:21.080 --> 04:26.120
And I'm really talking about this giant techno-industrial monstrosity that is in our heads

04:26.200 --> 04:30.600
and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the project

04:30.600 --> 04:35.560
of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on God. And consequently,

04:35.560 --> 04:40.680
we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place within that.

04:40.680 --> 04:46.360
And we've decided that through the use of technology, science and reason, we can effectively

04:46.360 --> 04:50.440
build a new world which doesn't seem to limit us in any way. And we've decided that any limits at

04:50.440 --> 04:54.520
all, whether they're the limits that our body provides or the limits that the natural world

04:54.520 --> 05:01.800
provides us with or even the limits of our behaviour towards each other, are disgraceful

05:01.800 --> 05:07.720
chains that prevent us from being free and rational in the individuals. And so I think it's a big,

05:08.920 --> 05:15.000
it's just a very big, very old way of seeing that is manifesting itself in silicon and plastic

05:15.000 --> 05:20.600
all around us. And as I say, coming at that from the perspective of an environmentalist or a former

05:20.600 --> 05:25.720
one, what I saw was the green movement being entirely sucked into this way of seeing. And I

05:25.720 --> 05:31.160
became, I became a greener years ago because I was entranced by the smallest beautiful model that

05:31.160 --> 05:35.960
the Greens used to believe in in the 70s. When I was a little boy, you know, the world of EF Schumacher

05:35.960 --> 05:40.760
and Leopold Korr and Gandhi and Tolstoy and everyone else who told us to live within natural

05:40.760 --> 05:46.120
limits in a way that would actually be nourishing to us. And the green movement instead brought

05:46.120 --> 05:51.160
into this machine thinking in which it saw climate change and other issues as technological

05:51.160 --> 05:56.520
problems to be solved with more technology, all of which sucks us into the same project of busting

05:56.520 --> 06:01.160
down limits. So now environmentalism has become a question of how many wind farms you can get up

06:01.160 --> 06:06.520
and whether you should use nuclear power and GM crops, whether you should do X, Y and Z to effectively

06:06.520 --> 06:13.320
create a quote, sustainable limitless machine world. All paths kind of lead back to this

06:13.320 --> 06:18.600
modern way of seeing almost every question. I mean, Mary comes at this from, from, from as far as I

06:18.600 --> 06:22.920
can see from the angle of, you know, from the feminist angle, but as she says, it's, it's the

06:22.920 --> 06:27.160
same question, actually, you can just approach it in from all of your different sort of personal

06:27.880 --> 06:33.960
perspectives. And it all leads you back to this attitude we have to nature and human nature.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.920
Yeah, I agree. I suppose I sort of come, I found myself coming at it from the perspective

06:40.920 --> 06:47.000
of the things that you can't say from within that model, and rather direct experience, particularly

06:47.000 --> 06:51.400
of what it is about being a mother that you can't put into words from within the model.

06:51.960 --> 06:56.600
And I've theorized, I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of, you know,

06:57.480 --> 07:02.040
what you call the machine pool. See, it wants to turn everything into standing reserve, you know,

07:02.040 --> 07:06.840
it wants to, it wants to enclose everything, you know, it started with the commons and then it

07:06.840 --> 07:11.960
started patenting things and now it's moving on to patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences

07:11.960 --> 07:18.280
and you know, but it wants to, it wants to move things from being naturally occurring to biosemiotic,

07:18.280 --> 07:24.360
you know, relationships with one another to being inert resources that can be instrumentalized

07:24.360 --> 07:30.680
and ideally commodified and turned into, turned into something that can be used for something

07:30.680 --> 07:35.320
and sort of unmoored from its relational context. That's the basic movement, unmoor something from

07:35.320 --> 07:39.320
its relational context and then turn it into things which can be traded back and forth in a

07:39.320 --> 07:44.360
sort of liquid and limitless way. So if that's the basic model, the problem with that from the

07:44.360 --> 07:50.760
perspective of a feminist and a mother is that everything that matters, everything that's important

07:50.760 --> 07:57.800
about being a mother is impossible, you can't, is not visible within that model. Because all

07:57.800 --> 08:02.200
of mothering is about pattern and all of mothering is about repetition, you know, it's about, it's

08:02.200 --> 08:06.600
about showing up for your baby every day in all the little ways that are important because the

08:06.600 --> 08:11.080
baby's completely dependent on you and all the, all the things which are nice about it are impossible

08:11.080 --> 08:15.320
to frame in those, in terms of the machine because they can't be commodified. I mean, you know, it's

08:15.320 --> 08:21.880
easy to sort of wax sentimental about your baby's first laugh. But yeah, I think a lot of mothers

08:21.880 --> 08:26.200
will relate to the experience of getting to the end of the day and having had actually a lovely day,

08:26.200 --> 08:29.960
but then somebody asks them, oh, what did you do today? And you, you, you can't say,

08:30.680 --> 08:36.520
you just can't sum it up because you did stuff and you were there and it was in the moment and

08:37.080 --> 08:40.760
just the, the day went by and bits of it were probably really boring. But if you try and explain

08:40.760 --> 08:45.240
it to somebody from, from the perspective that's outside the relationship and that sort of dynamic

08:45.240 --> 08:51.400
business of kind of sustaining a tiny dependent person, if you like, with the, with the energy and

08:53.400 --> 08:58.520
with your own body and your own way of being in the world. And you try and explain that sort of

08:58.520 --> 09:05.240
dynamic activity to somebody who isn't part of it and who isn't within those relationships with you,

09:05.240 --> 09:09.080
they'll just be like, well, that sounds pretty dull and repetitive. And it kind of is, you know,

09:09.080 --> 09:12.680
I mean, if you have a, if you have a functioning brain and an education, it does get boring after

09:12.680 --> 09:17.320
a bit, but it's also really important and it's also really lovely. And I mean, this is, you know,

09:17.320 --> 09:21.320
as somebody with a functioning brain and an education and also a deep, deep love of my

09:21.320 --> 09:25.960
daughter, these are all things which I've kind of wrestled with and found myself theorizing as

09:25.960 --> 09:31.720
well as doing. And I've, and I've come to realize that it's, it's another, it's another angle on

09:31.720 --> 09:36.280
the same problem that I think Paul is wrestling with, which is about how the things, the things

09:36.280 --> 09:40.600
which matter and the things which sustain us and the things which are meaning making and the

09:40.600 --> 09:46.680
things which are genuinely sustainable and create sustainable life in relation to other life are

09:46.680 --> 09:51.240
all pattern based. Then none of them are, none of them are information based, they're all meaning

09:51.240 --> 09:56.280
based. And information, if you like, is blind to meaning, because meaning, meaning in here's in

09:56.280 --> 10:01.160
pattern and repetition and the everyday and the ordinary and the relational. And the moment you

10:01.160 --> 10:05.960
turn it into standing reserve, the moment you enclose it, instrumentalize it and send it out

10:05.960 --> 10:11.720
as inert stuff to be liquefied in one sort of a market or another, it becomes information and it

10:11.720 --> 10:16.600
stops being meaningful. The moment you commodify a child that, I mean, you understand, you understand

10:16.600 --> 10:21.320
where I'm going. Yeah, and we are there, aren't we? We are pretty much commodifying children

10:21.320 --> 10:26.120
already. We are literally commodifying children as a whole. There are rows and rows of cots in

10:26.120 --> 10:33.000
bombshells as in Ukraine, where children which were commissioned by parents elsewhere in a rented

10:33.000 --> 10:38.520
uterus are waiting for their commissioning parents to come and collect them. I say parents in the

10:38.520 --> 10:43.480
loosest possible sense. This is not, this is not a form of parenthood, which I recognize as such.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.160
But yes, we are commodifying children at this point.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.800
We're commodifying everything and I think that the notion of enclosure is really important. I

10:51.800 --> 10:54.680
keep coming back to this one as well, again and again and again. I mean, you could argue that

10:54.680 --> 11:00.280
this whole process begins literally with the enclosures, land enclosures in Britain from, say,

11:00.280 --> 11:05.160
the 15th century onwards. And, you know, global capitalism, if you like, global industrialism

11:05.160 --> 11:09.160
is a process of enclosing everything. So you start off with the land, then you go on to the workers,

11:09.160 --> 11:13.720
then you go on to the human body, you go on to the natural world. Everything's enclosed.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.880
And it's also a process of making everybody rootless and making everything rootless. It's about,

11:20.760 --> 11:24.440
if Mary talks about relationships, I suppose I talk about roots, which is pretty much a different

11:24.440 --> 11:28.200
way of saying the same thing. If you're rooted in a place, if you're rooted in your relationship

11:28.200 --> 11:33.400
with a family, if you're rooted in your own body, if you're rooted in the environment around you,

11:33.400 --> 11:38.600
then you have something which, as Mary says, you can't actually commodify. You can't commodify that

11:38.600 --> 11:46.360
sense of being. Well, you can, and they do. But in the real sense of what it actually means to be

11:46.360 --> 11:50.280
human, it's not measurable. But everything has to be measurable in the age of the machine. It has to

11:50.280 --> 11:55.800
be measurable. It has to be commodifiable. It has to be profitable. Because that's the only way we

11:55.800 --> 11:59.640
can measure whether we're progressing. And of course, we must always progress towards something

11:59.640 --> 12:05.320
better by enclosing and by uprooting and by turning everything into a standing reserve. And that

12:05.320 --> 12:10.600
actually breaks the business of being human in the world. It breaks, I mean, you talk a lot about

12:10.600 --> 12:15.400
sense making, David, and you can't sense make it. If you can't make sense of any of these

12:15.400 --> 12:20.760
relationships, if they've been broken, and I do think that so much of the kind of madness in the

12:20.760 --> 12:25.240
culture at the moment, apart from being driven by social media, is also just actually being driven

12:25.240 --> 12:29.640
by the destruction of things which, for millennia, we've thought were completely normal, including

12:29.640 --> 12:33.320
what motherhood is and what fatherhood is and what families are and what it means to be in a place.

12:34.040 --> 12:38.600
All of this kind of stuff that nobody had to question much. Now suddenly, everything has to

12:38.600 --> 12:42.120
be questioned. And there aren't really answers, because it doesn't make sense.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.600
Yeah, I want to, it's a good question. And I wonder whether this is going to help make more

12:48.600 --> 12:55.800
sense or less sense, bringing in the sort of metaphysical dimension, because you both talk

12:55.800 --> 13:01.800
about this. And the concept that people may or may not be familiar with the kind of

13:01.800 --> 13:07.240
Gnosticism, the idea that this is a very deep-rooted pattern of thinking where the real world is

13:07.240 --> 13:13.960
somehow fake, is somehow kind of an illusion, and actually, there's a sort of inner essence that

13:13.960 --> 13:18.440
is real, is sort of very much mimicked. I think both of you have referred to this in your writings,

13:18.440 --> 13:23.800
is kind of mimicked in the way that our attitude to the world now seems to be. And so I wonder,

13:23.800 --> 13:27.720
do you think that kind of, I'd love to hear about the sort of the metaphysical frame that you

13:27.800 --> 13:32.200
are both bringing, and also whether you think that that kind of makes things more intelligible or

13:32.200 --> 13:39.400
less? I've used the phrase fully automated luxury Gnosticism. With a slightly flippantly,

13:39.400 --> 13:45.480
I've borrowed it from Aaron Bastani's book, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, where he imagines that

13:45.480 --> 13:50.600
actually left wing utopia is going to be attained by the automation of everything, presumably the

13:50.600 --> 13:54.120
liquefaction translation of everything into standing reserve, which is just going to bring

13:54.120 --> 14:00.440
about a world of eternal abundance for everyone somehow. With apologies to Bastani, I've not

14:00.440 --> 14:05.400
actually read the book, but I gather that that's the gist of it, Fully Automated Luxury Communism,

14:05.400 --> 14:13.240
so I borrowed that for Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, which is, well, I don't believe it's

14:13.240 --> 14:21.080
coming, but I think it's an aspiration which is being sold to us, of which the reality is perhaps

14:21.080 --> 14:26.680
less appealing. If you like, it's Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism is this kind of high sounding

14:26.680 --> 14:31.400
promise that we're all going to be able to escape the constraints of our body into something

14:32.360 --> 14:36.680
into a miraculous world where really we can do anything, whether that's the metaverse and

14:37.320 --> 14:41.960
with a haptic interface that means somehow we can see and feel and touch and taste

14:41.960 --> 14:47.560
things in this imaginary digitally constructed world, and we'll never actually need to have any

14:47.560 --> 14:52.360
kind of reference back to what's happening in our physical, in the physical plane at all.

14:52.920 --> 14:59.480
Or, you know, any number of other sort of techno fixes for the problems of materiality and the

14:59.480 --> 15:03.880
problems of embodiment. I suppose it's one of those things where I sort of mean first and ask

15:03.880 --> 15:10.360
questions later or decide what it is I mean by it later. Well, I mean, you often end up, I mean,

15:10.360 --> 15:14.040
I started, I did that with reactionary feminism as well, and it's completely turned into a thing.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.600
So sometimes, sometimes it's just good to go, it's good to walk backwards for a bit and see

15:18.600 --> 15:24.920
where you end up. So yeah, I mean, but Paul, Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, you know,

15:24.920 --> 15:29.400
can we, can we fully automate it? How luxurious would it be? You know, how Gnostic is it?

15:31.960 --> 15:36.440
It is interesting that there's the notion of Gnosticism is floating around a bit at the moment.

15:36.440 --> 15:43.320
So historically, the Gnostic movement was a sort of very loose collection of beliefs that were

15:43.320 --> 15:47.480
around in the early centuries of the Christian church. And the Christian church declared them

15:47.480 --> 15:53.800
heretical because effectively Gnosticism says, as you suggest, David, that this world is either,

15:53.800 --> 15:58.440
is either fake or it's something to be transcended. So what you do with, I mean, Gnosis literally means

15:58.440 --> 16:04.200
knowledge. It means a kind of secret knowledge. So the Gnostic movement is, is promoted and still

16:04.200 --> 16:08.440
promotes actually the idea that you can escape the body and the physical realm if you have the

16:08.440 --> 16:13.400
right kind of secret knowledge. And the Christians said and say that this is a heresy because

16:13.400 --> 16:19.080
Christianity is embodied, just as Christ was a kind of melding of the human and the divine.

16:19.080 --> 16:26.440
That's what we are. And so Christianity is not the Christian claim is not that we're going to

16:26.440 --> 16:30.600
escape from physical reality and float off to somewhere better. It's that physical reality

16:30.600 --> 16:35.720
can be transformed. Whereas the Gnostic say, no, this is basically a hell. And the Gnostic tradition

16:35.720 --> 16:42.200
also has the has this great notion of the demiurge. There's an evil being who thinks he's God,

16:42.200 --> 16:46.840
and he is the one who has created matter. And so matter is inherently evil. And so the human

16:46.840 --> 16:52.440
spirit is a divine spark trapped in matter and we want to escape from it back to the back to the

16:52.440 --> 16:56.920
place where we belong. So it's not much of a leap from that to Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.840
It's not much of a leap from that to what Silicon Valley is doing. I mean, openly doing and openly

17:00.840 --> 17:06.680
talking about which is attempting to transcend the messy horribleness of physical reality so

17:06.680 --> 17:11.240
that we don't have to die so that we don't have to give birth so that we don't have to be the sex

17:11.240 --> 17:17.560
that we were born so that we don't have to be anything that's actually relational and anything

17:17.560 --> 17:24.120
that limits what we imagine our free will is. This is my daughter visiting the podcast there

17:25.080 --> 17:30.760
because it's so interesting. Yeah, so that's I mean, and it is exactly that that's the Gnostic

17:30.760 --> 17:37.480
promise today. And it's it's the notion that the physical reality of stuff is escapable. But this

17:37.480 --> 17:41.000
time we're not doing it through secret Gnostic religious knowledge, we're doing it through

17:41.000 --> 17:46.200
technology, which is our equivalent of that. And it's no joke to say that this is exactly where

17:46.200 --> 17:49.720
the project is headed. You only have to listen to Ray Kurzweil speaking or any of these other

17:49.720 --> 17:53.560
guys in Silicon Valley, Elon Musk or any of them, they're very open about this. It's the

17:54.600 --> 17:57.720
great dream of where we're supposed to end up. And I think Mary's right, we're not going to get

17:57.720 --> 18:01.240
there because of all sorts of actual physical realities that are going to get in the way.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.800
But I think we're going to do a lot of damage as we attempt to. And I also think it's an elite

18:05.800 --> 18:10.040
project, you know, it's not something that's available to the majority of humanity. This is,

18:10.040 --> 18:12.840
you know, this is something you do in your New Zealand bunker, primarily.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.600
Well, there are some there are deep photographs doing the rounds of people where, you know,

18:18.600 --> 18:24.120
homeless guys with metaverse golfers on. And actually, that's good. It's egalitarian at least.

18:25.160 --> 18:30.120
Right. Right. Right. Also an incredibly bleak advert for the metaverse itself,

18:31.080 --> 18:37.480
which I think accidentally says the quiet part out loud, where some washed up old dog who used

18:37.480 --> 18:41.800
to have a great life being the life and soul of the party or, you know, loved and surrounded by

18:41.800 --> 18:47.480
friends and is now lonely and, you know, doesn't live on his own and miserable and, you know,

18:47.480 --> 18:53.240
but basically has a crap life and comes into the metaverse and just makes it all come back again,

18:53.240 --> 18:58.600
but fictionally and digitally created. And that's a happy ending to the story.

19:00.040 --> 19:04.040
Well, in fact, what the advert is saying very clearly is if you have a shit life,

19:04.040 --> 19:07.240
come and sit in the metaverse and you can pretend it's not so shit.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.840
You know what it always strikes good news apparently.

19:11.400 --> 19:16.360
Yeah, I mean, this is like the matrix written from the point of view of a script in which

19:16.360 --> 19:22.040
Agent Smith is the good guy, isn't it? This is where we are. We've been 20 years on,

19:22.040 --> 19:26.840
we're 20 years on and we've just we're telling the same story, but now it's good news. Yeah.

19:28.840 --> 19:34.040
And as you said, I don't actually think we're going to get there because it's somebody still

19:34.040 --> 19:38.680
has to take the bins out, bluntly. I mean, this again is the feminist point. You know,

19:38.680 --> 19:42.200
somebody still has to do the dishes. And even if it's a machine does the dishes,

19:42.200 --> 19:48.280
someone still has to unload the dishwasher. You know, so it is eventually titles all the way

19:48.280 --> 19:54.600
down. Somebody still has to grow the food. And all of and even if you build robots to grow the food,

19:54.600 --> 19:58.920
somebody's got to service the robots. And then somebody's got to do the dishes for them somewhere

19:58.920 --> 20:03.560
at the bottom is somebody doing the dishes. And they're probably not in the metaverse while they're

20:03.560 --> 20:09.320
doing the dishes. So yeah, it's an elite project at the end of the day. And someone somewhere

20:09.320 --> 20:11.960
is cleaning up the rubbish that's left behind after the big party.

20:14.840 --> 20:21.160
Yeah, and you had a really interesting insight as well that there's a kind of the memetic warfare

20:21.160 --> 20:25.720
that goes alongside of the information warfare that goes alongside it seems to be more and more

20:25.720 --> 20:37.320
about any kind of hint of fixity or reality is now called essentialism is now kind of to be

20:37.320 --> 20:42.920
attacked memetically, I guess. And that that I find a really interesting development.

20:42.920 --> 20:50.840
Not just essentialism, it's fascism. To state that limits exist and continue to exist,

20:50.840 --> 20:56.520
no matter how hard you push against them is is now is now framed straightforwardly as fascist.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.280
You know, even if you're just observing something which is there, you know,

21:00.280 --> 21:03.320
the act of noticing it is makes you crypto fascist.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.960
Yeah, it's a very, very interesting one. There's this whole notion of essentialism,

21:08.760 --> 21:12.760
which has become such a boo word on the left. And as Mary says, very quickly becomes an accusation

21:12.760 --> 21:18.920
of fascism. Apart from being a stupid representation of actually what fascism is, it's just very,

21:18.920 --> 21:25.960
it's very telling that the people who use that language who always self titled progressives

21:27.080 --> 21:32.120
believe that as you say, any any kind of limits, any kind of actual roots in the natural world

21:32.840 --> 21:38.200
is is not only evil, but it's somehow associated with like the worst political project in human

21:38.200 --> 21:43.400
history. And it's, you know, it's not it's not just it's not even just a smear, it's like there's

21:43.400 --> 21:48.680
a real belief in this, you know, there's there's a real sense that if you are talking about limits

21:48.680 --> 21:54.840
being either even real or beneficial, or having to live within say your own body or live with the

21:54.840 --> 22:01.720
natural world as it is or whatever it is, then you are somehow pushing at the door of some kind of

22:01.720 --> 22:08.120
yeah, vicious ethnocentric racial warfare or whatever it is. And it's like it's almost like

22:08.120 --> 22:12.280
people have had their minds bent by the machine to believe that if you actually have to live within

22:12.280 --> 22:18.200
the God given limits of nature, or if you use a phrase like that, then, you know, you're such a

22:18.200 --> 22:22.200
troubling person that you have to be removed. So who's left? The only people who are left are

22:22.200 --> 22:27.960
people who believe there are no limits at all. And in this kind of merger of, I suppose, progressive

22:27.960 --> 22:33.880
left ideology and machine Gnosticism, it's very weird. And it's happening very quickly as well.

22:33.880 --> 22:39.480
And it's almost impossible in some cases to have conversations, you know, about this without, as

22:39.480 --> 22:46.600
Mary says, having the having the F word thrown at you, which is, yeah, again, I think in other

22:46.600 --> 22:50.440
in other maybe more sane parts of the world and in other more sane times, these conversations

22:50.440 --> 22:53.640
are possible, they were possible five years ago, 10 years ago, you know, you could sit around talking

22:53.640 --> 22:58.760
about all this Huxley. And there would be no problem. But suddenly, it's accelerated into a

22:58.760 --> 23:03.800
very strange place. I mean, it does. It depends a little bit where you stand and who you're

23:03.800 --> 23:08.760
speaking to. I think just a very immediate example, my very good friend, Louise Perry,

23:08.760 --> 23:13.320
who's recently written a book about the case against the sexual revolution,

23:13.320 --> 23:17.480
when which she argues from her background is as a broadly left liberal feminist,

23:18.440 --> 23:23.960
who's sort of but but working, but worked in a rape shelter and left her questioning a lot of

23:23.960 --> 23:28.440
a lot of what she had internalized about what the sexual revolution meant, who it was for,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.320
and what it was actually doing. And so she's written a whole book about her perspective on

23:33.320 --> 23:37.320
this with chapter titles that I would think sort of would have been, as you say, five years ago,

23:37.320 --> 23:41.560
very difficult to argue with, like loveless sex is not empowering, people are not commodities,

23:41.560 --> 23:44.920
you know, listen to your mother, all sort of fairly, fairly sensible, you would think

23:45.000 --> 23:51.560
straightforward statements to make. And somebody, somebody of, you know, within within the academy

23:53.400 --> 24:00.520
posted the screenshot of her chapter headings today, saying this is a real mask off moment,

24:00.520 --> 24:04.120
you know, look at this, look at the horrors which are which are coming forth from, you know,

24:04.120 --> 24:10.200
the various other sort of imputations of the F word. And I mean, but the and was then then

24:10.200 --> 24:15.160
received quite a lot of replies to the effect of which bit of people are not commodities,

24:15.160 --> 24:20.360
are you objecting to them? And really, really, the response was, though, there is nothing here

24:20.360 --> 24:23.960
that any of us disagree with, you know, this is actually not really this is this is this all

24:23.960 --> 24:29.960
sounds very sensible, which which indeed it does, you know, loveless sex really is not empowering,

24:29.960 --> 24:35.480
certainly not to women anyway. But there are, I suppose what I'm trying to say is there are a

24:35.480 --> 24:41.560
lot of people out there who see this stuff, and feel endlessly wordlessly frustrated with this

24:41.560 --> 24:48.920
stuff. And, and don't just just aren't really sure how to mobilize against this stuff, because

24:48.920 --> 24:54.120
it's because the the the sort of integrated message messaging apparatus, which is transmitting,

24:54.120 --> 25:01.000
it seems, seems very well articulated and very, very sort of all encompassing. But actually,

25:01.000 --> 25:06.360
it isn't actually, it isn't creeped through the cracks, people still have eyes and functioning

25:06.360 --> 25:11.080
brains. Because because this would be a sort of pushback, sorry to interrupt, this would be a sort

25:11.080 --> 25:15.640
of pushback, I think, saying, Well, maybe there are, because with social media, especially, it's

25:15.640 --> 25:19.880
very easy to make any kind of case and say, Well, everyone thinks this one, actually, maybe it's

25:19.880 --> 25:24.280
just a few people, because the pushback would be, okay, maybe there's a few people who are kind of

25:24.280 --> 25:28.280
saying that this person's a fascist for for asserting that there are kind of gender roles or

25:28.280 --> 25:35.800
whatever. But is this not is this not kind of nut picking, kind of extreme examples, rather than

25:35.800 --> 25:42.600
kind of a wider mood or a wider kind of feeling? Well, I think the sort of I would say there's

25:42.600 --> 25:47.480
two ways of looking at that. It's very difficult to discern what public opinion actually is now,

25:47.480 --> 25:54.600
because Twitter both is and is not the real world. And you know. And also, you know, there are,

25:54.600 --> 26:00.440
I think you can you can argue about how how impactful a silent majority actually is compared

26:00.440 --> 26:06.760
to the concerted efforts of a very small group of extremely committed zealots, which, you know,

26:06.760 --> 26:11.160
I think if you look at history, it tend to be more effective than any amount of silent majority.

26:11.720 --> 26:16.280
So, so from that perspective, you know, the cards are the cards are stacked in favor of the fully

26:16.280 --> 26:20.360
automated luxury Nostics, because they have the mic and they really, really, really believe this

26:20.360 --> 26:28.600
stuff. But I don't know, I think there are, I think that I really think there are hard limits

26:28.600 --> 26:35.320
to it. You know, there are hard limits to how how much women, as has been very abundantly evident

26:35.320 --> 26:39.320
in Britain recently, and increasingly so in America, too, there are limits to how much women

26:39.320 --> 26:46.120
will tolerate being told that a woman is anybody who says they're a woman, for example, you know,

26:46.120 --> 26:52.840
which is which is the most egregious and the most in your face, battlefront in the in the

26:52.840 --> 26:59.320
push for no limits whatsoever on in turn, in individual self actualization on any terms whatsoever.

26:59.320 --> 27:06.600
That's the most sort of that that's the most egregious front in that particular. I mean,

27:06.600 --> 27:11.880
there are there are many others. But it's also it's also the one which is mobilizing the most

27:11.880 --> 27:16.360
sort of cross party resistance. Because I mean, if you've grown, if you've grown a new human

27:16.360 --> 27:21.000
inside your literal uterus, you know what a woman is. And it's also notable how many of the people

27:21.000 --> 27:25.640
how many of the men who pay lip service to this idea that a woman is anybody who says they're

27:25.640 --> 27:30.280
already immediately knows what a woman is the moment they want to render uterus. You know, there

27:30.280 --> 27:35.560
are these all this stuff is very it's it's full of slippages and it's full of bad faith and it's

27:35.560 --> 27:40.360
full of inconsistency and everybody knows that to be the case. Because at the end of the day,

27:40.360 --> 27:45.320
you know, the the liquefaction of everything, I've just been writing a chapter about this

27:45.320 --> 27:49.480
actually, you know, is that the this the the liquefaction of everything doesn't actually work

27:49.480 --> 27:53.160
because because it's premised on the idea that there's no such thing as nature and no such

27:53.160 --> 27:58.680
thing as human nature. And that's not actually true. So what it does in the end is it it successfully

27:58.680 --> 28:04.840
liquefies all of the norms or all of these established structures. But because because

28:04.840 --> 28:09.800
human nature continues to exist, it then it simply reframes that as a set of supply and demand

28:09.800 --> 28:16.120
problems. So instead of instead of having, you know, codes for in the instead of having courtship

28:16.120 --> 28:22.200
rituals, you have the sexual marketplace. And that's a straightforward reordering of the the

28:22.200 --> 28:27.560
sex differences between men and women, you know, which, you know, had quite elaborate social codes

28:27.560 --> 28:31.800
ordered around them, you know, in order to kind of balance the balance the interests of men and

28:31.800 --> 28:36.600
women, you know, under particular economic circumstances, you liquefy that you blow it

28:36.600 --> 28:39.400
all out of the water and say no, actually, everybody can just do what they want now.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.600
But and what what happens is not that everybody does what they want. Exactly. What have because

28:44.600 --> 28:49.960
people still people still have urges which are not rational. And some of those are connected to

28:49.960 --> 28:55.720
reproductive roles, they just are. But but instead, but and because this stuff goes on existing,

28:55.720 --> 28:59.640
it just it just gets reabsorbed into the marketplace and it becomes a set of supply and

28:59.640 --> 29:05.240
demand problems. And the same the same is now happening with biological sex, you know, it's

29:05.240 --> 29:09.640
either being, you know, the desire to be one sex or another is being is being reimagined as a set

29:09.640 --> 29:13.640
of supply and demand problems. You know, there are already medical papers out there, we are talking

29:13.640 --> 29:18.920
about, you know, uterus transplants into men who men who identify as women. I don't know where they're

29:18.920 --> 29:24.520
going to get the uterus is from, but presumably from from women who identify as men or who knows,

29:24.520 --> 29:29.000
who knows anyway, there's this is being imagined as you know, a set of Lego parts that could just

29:29.000 --> 29:32.680
be swapped so that they're in the right place, presumably through some sort of marketplace.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.960
And the same goes again for babies, you know, women are still the only people who can just

29:35.960 --> 29:42.600
date new humans. So so here again, because we were we're in the process of liquefying all of the

29:42.600 --> 29:47.960
norms. But but we haven't in the process successfully managed to abolish the underlying

29:47.960 --> 29:54.120
material facts, you know, on which those norms are built. We just end up we end up reimagining

29:54.120 --> 29:57.720
them as a set of supply and demand problems. So now if you need a uterus, you just go and rent one.

29:58.680 --> 30:05.400
And but the point is the liquefaction doesn't work. And so the and my sense is there's a

30:05.960 --> 30:10.920
there's a kind of frustration there among the automated luxury nostics, because every time

30:10.920 --> 30:14.520
they try and every time they try and get to the bottom, to the point where actually we really

30:14.520 --> 30:19.960
have just attained full grey goo Satanism. It just it never quite works because it's because

30:19.960 --> 30:24.280
there's always there's always another level of materiality, which has its patterns and continues

30:24.280 --> 30:31.960
to be what it is. And I, it's a very depressing, very pessimistic sort of a hope. But I do, I

30:31.960 --> 30:37.960
have some, you know, if I have hope, it's in the fact that that that persists. It just is. And

30:37.960 --> 30:42.600
it doesn't matter how many times you try and liquefy, it continues. Yeah, and I think that's

30:42.600 --> 30:46.920
really, that's a great summary of it all. I mean, this is, I've written quite a few times in these

30:46.920 --> 30:52.840
essays and doing at the moment about the how revolutions effectively, especially progressive

30:52.920 --> 30:56.920
revolutions always clear the ground for the machine. They think they're creating a utopia.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.360
And what actually happens from the French Revolution onwards, is you destroy all the

31:00.360 --> 31:05.160
customary structures, you destroy the traditions, you destroy the structures from families to

31:05.160 --> 31:10.040
community level structures up to church level, you literally you, you know, you burn down the

31:10.040 --> 31:14.120
churches and you try to destroy the family and you read it to be the land. And what happens then

31:14.120 --> 31:18.200
is you just create a void and into the void commerce rushes. And so as Mary says, everything

31:18.200 --> 31:23.400
becomes commodified. And so the result of your grand utopian progressive revolution is not

31:23.400 --> 31:27.480
a fairer world. It's effectively a world that is more commodified, more individualistic,

31:28.600 --> 31:32.760
and more, more prey to the machine. And that brings us to the point after about 200 years

31:32.760 --> 31:37.480
that we've got to now where everything is a commodity. But there are a lot of people who

31:37.480 --> 31:42.440
consider themselves to be progressive who have confused out with liberation. And this is really

31:42.440 --> 31:47.160
what liberation has come down to as Mary is also saying better than me is liberation from nature

31:47.160 --> 31:51.320
at all levels, liberation from the body, liberation from everything around you. And

31:51.320 --> 31:55.240
this this I think explains the kind of the people who scream about fascism and the people who are

31:55.240 --> 31:59.480
so committed to this is they genuinely think, well, effectively, they're blanks latest, right,

31:59.480 --> 32:04.680
they genuinely believe that if you can remove all of the supposed change the tires down from

32:04.680 --> 32:10.040
from the reality of biological sex to the existence of family to national culture to

32:10.040 --> 32:15.320
whatever it is that you think is getting in the way of equality in utopia. Then we're all

32:15.320 --> 32:18.680
then we're all the same. And then we can indeed all choose to have babies ought to be men ought to

32:18.680 --> 32:22.840
be women ought to live anywhere ought to be whatever we want. But that's not true because

32:22.840 --> 32:27.880
we're hefted, you know, we're hefted and we're rooted in whatever cultural or background or

32:27.880 --> 32:34.280
biology we have. And there are some things you shouldn't, you can't get away from. But also

32:34.280 --> 32:38.840
you shouldn't want to because they actually make you human. And that's the thing that there's this

32:38.840 --> 32:45.080
notion that these structures that have always in most societies and most times been customary

32:45.080 --> 32:51.240
from the family to the village to the religious institution, whatever it is, that they are

32:51.240 --> 32:56.600
bad things which which limit us as opposed to the possibility that they are actually things

32:56.600 --> 33:03.800
which enrich us and which structure our urges in useful ways. And that's that's the point where

33:03.800 --> 33:09.640
can I have to probably painfully rediscover that we we probably built these structures for a reason

33:09.640 --> 33:13.400
and we lived in certain ways for a reason. And however imperfect those ways might have been for

33:13.400 --> 33:18.600
lots of people, and they're hardly unimprovable, they still probably built on a knowledge of human

33:18.600 --> 33:23.640
nature that we're now pretending isn't there anymore. And yeah, we're getting to the point

33:23.640 --> 33:29.320
where we've deconstructed almost everything. And as Mary said, there's a kind of there's a grinning

33:29.320 --> 33:35.560
face at the bottom of it is not looking good. I've come I've come gradually to the conclusion

33:35.560 --> 33:40.920
that actually gender ideology is mostly particularly transgender children. It's

33:40.920 --> 33:46.760
are being instrumentalized, you know, there are some seriously distressed people who are for

33:46.760 --> 33:51.800
for all men or a number of range of different often quite complicated, you know, personally

33:51.800 --> 33:56.360
very painful reasons, you're deeply unhappy in their bodies and in the world as it is,

33:56.360 --> 34:01.080
you know, and I think that's that's often a rational response to finding themselves in a

34:01.080 --> 34:05.240
very in an absolutely intolerable place, you know, particularly adolescent women,

34:06.200 --> 34:09.880
who find themselves in a world so saturated with porn that actually to me it seems a

34:09.880 --> 34:14.280
completely reasonable response to take hormones that make that make you resemble a male and cut

34:14.280 --> 34:19.640
off your breasts. I mean, I would probably be tempted if I were 14 today. So, you know, from

34:19.640 --> 34:25.640
that point of view, I have no I have no beef with with people who are trying to find some relief

34:26.200 --> 34:32.440
in in a embodied condition that they find intolerable. You know, that's not who I pick

34:32.440 --> 34:39.160
a fight with. But what what I see is a subset of very distressed people who are being instrumentalized

34:39.160 --> 34:43.880
in pursuit of a much bigger project, which is the deregulation of human nature as such.

34:44.520 --> 34:48.920
If you like the deregulation of the of the human body, you know, much the same way as

34:48.920 --> 34:53.960
the financial sector was deregulated in the 1980s, the aim is to deregulate the body

34:54.680 --> 34:59.720
and deregulate the idea that we had that the body has a nature, because that opens that opens up

35:01.240 --> 35:07.640
boundless commercial sphere in which, you know, organs regenerate self regenerating organs can

35:07.640 --> 35:12.040
be synthesized in laboratories. Human animal chimeras can be developed for who knows what

35:12.040 --> 35:16.200
purposes. I mean, you know, the possibilities are endless if you're a mad scientist with no

35:16.200 --> 35:24.600
no ethics. But you have to you have to render an inexcusably low status, any sort of the

35:24.600 --> 35:30.760
currently still pervasive common conviction act with truth, in fact, not conviction truth,

35:30.760 --> 35:35.320
that humans have a nature, and that, you know, males are normatively one way and females are

35:35.320 --> 35:39.560
normatively another. And, you know, humans have a normal number of limbs and so on and so forth.

35:39.560 --> 35:44.680
You have to you have to completely denormalize destabilize and liquefy that consensus before

35:44.680 --> 35:49.320
you before you can embark on the, you know, deregulatory business opportunities that flow

35:49.320 --> 35:56.280
from that. Yeah, no, I think that's right. That's exactly what's happening. And the demonizing of

35:56.280 --> 36:01.640
the of the turfs and the fascists and everybody else is precisely part of that project, which is

36:01.880 --> 36:07.320
to silence and to provide endless new names for the people who are saying exactly that.

36:08.840 --> 36:13.480
Really interesting what you're saying about the, like, what is the sort of the

36:14.440 --> 36:18.760
question that arises? Like, what's the most fundamental driver? Because you you mentioned,

36:18.760 --> 36:25.800
Paul, that you felt like commerce was filling the gap of this sort of revolutionary moment.

36:26.520 --> 36:31.000
But are you saying that you think commerce is is actually the driver or is the driver

36:31.720 --> 36:36.040
deeper? Is the driver some kind of, I mean, you've called it the machine, but how

36:36.040 --> 36:39.880
where do you think that machine lives? Do you think it's kind of a psychological structure or a

36:41.640 --> 36:46.360
yeah, what what do you think is actually, because it's also kind of for me kind of maps onto some

36:46.360 --> 36:51.720
of the conspiracy thinking as well, where I see a lot of the time people kind of collapse around

36:52.680 --> 36:58.360
looking for an agent, a specific agent or a specific set of agents, whereas actually there

36:58.360 --> 37:04.680
is a sort of tendency towards often that seems deeper. So where where do you locate those those

37:04.680 --> 37:09.560
drivers? Yeah, well, I have a terrible feeling that the driver is metaphysical. I mean, this is not

37:09.560 --> 37:15.000
just about making money. There's a lot of interest in that. But there's I keep I always talk about

37:15.000 --> 37:19.160
this fascinating book by Kevin Kelly called What Technology Wants, which is a really good book to

37:19.240 --> 37:23.480
read. You should read it, Mary, if you haven't already, it's a few years old now, but it's

37:23.480 --> 37:27.720
Kevin Kelly is one of the Silicon Valley guys. And he's very much into the notion that

37:28.360 --> 37:32.040
something is being created, which he calls the technium, which is pretty much the same as I

37:32.040 --> 37:38.200
suppose why I'm calling the machine. And he says, look, this thing is becoming self aware. And

37:38.200 --> 37:42.760
that's the point, right? It's starting to manage itself is starting to push its own direction,

37:42.760 --> 37:48.600
starting to starting to manifest. And this is again, the attitude of a lot of the guys behind

37:48.680 --> 37:54.920
this project that they think they're creating the next, they think they're building the next

37:54.920 --> 37:58.520
level of evolutionary consciousness. You know, this is why they're so obsessed at the moment,

37:58.520 --> 38:02.920
I think with artificial intelligence, they really think they can create post humans. And they think

38:02.920 --> 38:07.720
perhaps this is Kevin Kelly's explicit notion that humanity is just a stepping stone on the

38:08.680 --> 38:12.440
way to something greater, greater consciousness that they're helping to build, but which is also

38:12.440 --> 38:17.880
weirdly manifesting through them. So it's a very quasi religious thing that is happening. I'm not

38:17.880 --> 38:22.120
saying everybody involved in it believes that there's a lot of profiteering just, and a lot of

38:22.120 --> 38:25.800
kind of mind is following the herd. But there's something going on with the creation of this

38:26.440 --> 38:36.440
post human metaverse machine, machine, machinist sort of post human, anti human, non human

38:37.640 --> 38:42.360
world in which it literally is it's a metaphysical project in which they're trying to recreate or

38:42.360 --> 38:47.640
build a heaven on earth, entirely reconstructed. I mean, you hear it a lot when people talk about

38:47.640 --> 38:51.720
how they want to go and live in, they want to terraform Mars or they want to fly off and live

38:51.720 --> 38:57.160
on moon bases. Because that's the fantasy, the explicit fantasy of how they can create an entire

38:57.160 --> 39:05.080
planet right from the dust up in their own image. So there's something in it that is very much bigger

39:05.080 --> 39:11.480
than just a kind of profit scrabble. And again, you don't need a conspiracy theory in which there

39:11.480 --> 39:16.440
are six evil people in a bunker making a plan. You just need enough people to buy into something

39:17.160 --> 39:21.160
which is moving already, which I think is where we're going. And it's kind of the inevitable

39:21.960 --> 39:26.600
result of the whole attitude, the whole worldview of modernity, I think, to come back to what we

39:26.600 --> 39:30.760
started with, with the notion of the rational individual who can detach himself from nature

39:30.760 --> 39:35.240
and build his own paradise. Now we've got the technology to do it, but we will have soon.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.200
And that's really what encompasses the whole thing, I think. So it's an ideology or even

39:40.200 --> 39:45.720
a religious worldview that drives it, I think. You said, I feel like you're sidling along the

39:45.720 --> 39:49.480
edge of implying that it's not so much that we have ideas as that ideas have us.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.560
Yeah, well, I think that's true. I suppose, yeah, that's not a bad way of putting it.

39:56.280 --> 40:00.600
We are, I mean, I think you see this really manifesting on social media. It's one reason

40:00.600 --> 40:07.000
I don't have any social media accounts. People are being entirely controlled by ideas and by

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
visions and by ideologies or whatever these things are. They're not the great, the famous

40:15.000 --> 40:20.760
I support the current thing meme is quite funny, but it also has a kind of deeper meaning to it,

40:20.760 --> 40:25.560
which is that there's, you know, you're being controlled when you're on your smartphone looking

40:25.560 --> 40:31.240
at this stuff, you can feel it. And so, yeah, ideas have us, memes have us, metaphysics have us

40:31.240 --> 40:37.960
entirely, I think. And they can almost become self-replicating in the age of the machine and they are.

40:38.840 --> 40:44.120
I would agree with that. I mean, I'm hopelessly compromised in that way, Paul,

40:45.880 --> 40:49.000
for fully cognizant of my cyborg state.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.840
Well, you're so good at meming, Mary, it would be a shame if you thought.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.120
Well, you can't be completely unplugged if you've noticed that.

40:56.760 --> 41:00.760
No, I'm not completely unplugged. No, I do pop in here and there. And one of the reasons I don't

41:00.760 --> 41:05.960
have social media is that I know very well, because I did have a Twitter account for a while

41:05.960 --> 41:09.640
years ago. I know very well that I would get tempted to start doing exactly the same thing.

41:09.640 --> 41:13.800
I'd get sucked into that really easily. It's not, it's not a puritan position so much as a

41:13.800 --> 41:16.840
practical one. I know it would rot my brain. So I keep away.

41:18.200 --> 41:23.160
Yeah, I'm very ambivalent about my own relationship to Twitter. But one, I suppose the thing I wanted

41:23.160 --> 41:28.200
to lob in here, which is it's a conversation I've had a number of times with, you know, other people

41:28.200 --> 41:38.520
who are sort of embedded in the cyborg memeplex as I am, who will cheerfully chat to you about the

41:38.520 --> 41:44.040
fact that they know perfectly well that the memeplex that you see on the internet is, you know,

41:44.040 --> 41:48.360
that the memeplex is real. But the what you, the simulacrum of it you see on the internet is not,

41:48.360 --> 41:53.960
it's not the thing. And who can see the difference very clearly. Now, I suspect that there are a

41:53.960 --> 41:58.040
lot of people who sport the current thing you can't see the difference. But there are, there are

41:58.760 --> 42:04.040
a surprising number of people out there who see what the, what the internet memeplex is a metaphor

42:04.040 --> 42:09.400
for and recognise that it actually exists and is out there. See what it's a metaphor for? What do

42:09.400 --> 42:14.040
you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Well, I mean, it's actually, what it's a metaphor for

42:14.040 --> 42:17.400
is the thing that we started off talking about, you know, when you, when you were referenced,

42:17.400 --> 42:23.800
I was talking about patterns and meanings and the relational, the relational nature of everything

42:24.360 --> 42:30.520
in, in, in human culture and the natural world. We are another person of, if we're,

42:30.520 --> 42:34.040
well, we're talking about, you know, people, shadow people who should be part of this conversation,

42:34.040 --> 42:39.960
you know, a dear friend of mine, Wendy Wheeler, who died a couple of years ago, who was a pioneer

42:39.960 --> 42:47.720
in biosemiotics, wrote a lot about her work was very, it was multidisciplinary. And it crossed,

42:47.720 --> 42:53.720
and it was based on the thesis that everything in the natural world is not, it's not based on

42:53.800 --> 42:57.960
information, it's based on meaning, everything in the natural world is a series of relational

42:57.960 --> 43:05.320
dialogues between different meaning making systems, which I found an incredibly illuminating way

43:05.320 --> 43:13.080
of thinking about how, how organisms exist in relation to one another. But I think one of

43:13.080 --> 43:17.480
the classic examples is, you know, there's a lovely video about this somewhere on the internet,

43:17.480 --> 43:23.560
what happened, what happened when they reintroduced wolves into, so into a national park in America.

43:24.120 --> 43:32.200
And through a concatenating series of impacts that reintroducing the apex predator had on various,

43:32.200 --> 43:37.400
various natural systems through the sort of, you know, concatenating interrelations of these

43:37.400 --> 43:41.000
various systems, it ended up changing the path of the rivers that ran through the,

43:41.000 --> 43:46.600
ran through the nature reserve. Because, because some wolves ate some more, some more large animals,

43:46.600 --> 43:50.200
there were, there was a different sort of vegetation and that meant smaller animals went over

43:50.200 --> 43:53.720
there instead. And that in turn meant something else and something else and something else and

43:53.720 --> 43:58.680
eventually the rivers changed course. And that's what I mean when I say that the memeplex is real.

43:59.240 --> 44:03.480
Because in a sense, the normative patterned behaviors of each of these species acting in

44:03.480 --> 44:08.440
relationship to one another, you know, acts like a series, it's metaphorically speaking, you could

44:08.440 --> 44:14.520
say it's a series of means that, that exist in dynamic dialogue with one another. And in the

44:14.520 --> 44:20.280
course of doing that, you know, they, that process, if you like, manifests in, in what we see

44:20.280 --> 44:25.240
materially in the natural world. And I suppose that's probably, that's probably the clearest

44:25.240 --> 44:30.040
articulation I can give of what I think the actual memeplex is. And that's, and that memeplex,

44:30.040 --> 44:34.840
if you like, the actual memeplex is not one in which humans exist as separate from the natural

44:34.840 --> 44:39.240
world. Because obviously, we're, we're having impacts on the natural world all the time.

44:40.200 --> 44:44.520
I suppose one of the, I keep chickens at home. They stop me if this is getting, getting too

44:44.520 --> 44:50.280
weird or too lateral for you. I keep chickens. I think a lot about chickens because I like chickens.

44:50.280 --> 44:54.520
You know, they're, they're kind of psychopathic and they're kind of miniature dinosaurs and other

44:54.520 --> 44:59.800
things. But, but they're also one of the most successful bird species on, I think they might be

44:59.800 --> 45:03.960
the most successful bird species on the planet. And they've done that by existing in a dialogue

45:03.960 --> 45:07.640
with humans. You know, they're not the only domesticated animal in that way. And obviously,

45:07.640 --> 45:11.480
a lot of them have to take one for the team. But, you know, at a species level, it's a very

45:11.480 --> 45:16.840
effective survival strategy. You know, I think there are, there are countless billions of chickens

45:16.840 --> 45:24.040
in the world. And it works from a, from a species point of view. But, you know, unless, unless you're

45:24.040 --> 45:28.120
a, you're a fully paid up member of the machine, and you want to keep, you want to keep chickens

45:28.120 --> 45:32.360
in battery farms. You know, if you're, if you're keeping, if you're keeping animals like that,

45:32.360 --> 45:36.040
you sort of, you have to, you have to do so roughly in accordance with their nature.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.640
You can, you can exist in a functional, you know, ongoing sustainable dialogue with a domestic

45:41.640 --> 45:46.600
animal. But, you know, unless you, unless you imprison them and, and doctor them in various

45:46.600 --> 45:50.600
ways to make them tolerate it, you have to, you have to keep them in conditions where they can

45:50.600 --> 45:54.120
scratch, for example, if they're chickens or if they're, if they're sheep, they need different

45:54.120 --> 45:58.840
conditions. And so, so there's a, there's a kind of ongoing dynamic relationship where, you know,

45:58.840 --> 46:03.880
the animal, animal husbandry is partly about meeting the animal where it is. And it's partly

46:03.880 --> 46:09.240
about, partly about how a domestic animal does a species level response to that, you know, and

46:09.240 --> 46:13.480
over times, you know, specialist breeds evolve. And, you know, there are, there are particular

46:13.480 --> 46:17.640
different types of, sorry, I'm probably getting very arcane with this, but it's just, you know,

46:17.640 --> 46:22.280
once you get into those, you know, the, the, the semiotics of, of human animal interactions,

46:22.280 --> 46:26.760
you know, it's just boundlessly rich terrain. You know, there are, there are, there are

46:26.760 --> 46:32.600
differences in how good at giving birth unaided, different, different breeds of sheep are,

46:32.600 --> 46:38.040
because I think it's, I think it's the herdwicks, which are, which are normally kept on very barren

46:38.040 --> 46:42.840
upland terrain in the, in the north of England. And because you just can't get up there during

46:42.840 --> 46:46.680
lambing season, basically the ones, the ones that survive are the ones who can give birth without

46:46.680 --> 46:50.840
any help. And there are other breeds of sheep, which are kept in lowland territory under much

46:50.840 --> 46:56.840
closer watch, who are, who generally need help, a lot more help with lambing because they, over

46:56.840 --> 47:01.400
time, they've just evolved that way. And you can see, you can see how that would work, you know,

47:01.400 --> 47:05.640
the herdwicks, the, the herdwicks that make it are the ones, are the offspring of, of mothers,

47:05.640 --> 47:10.120
of youths that can, that can give birth on their own. And, and just over time, they've got much

47:10.120 --> 47:14.760
better at it. And there are other breeds of sheep, which, which, which aren't. And, and these are,

47:14.760 --> 47:20.360
these are the sorts of dynamic interactions between humans and the animal kingdom or,

47:21.960 --> 47:25.960
and, and I mean, you, you can, you can point to any number of different examples. I think there's

47:25.960 --> 47:30.200
a, another one, which I really like is the North American peppered moth, which over the last

47:30.280 --> 47:36.680
hundred years has become, it's become darker as a consequence of evolving in much more

47:36.680 --> 47:40.520
polluted conditions. It used to be, it used to be mostly white. I think some of them,

47:41.240 --> 47:44.840
then they have, they have different patterns and over, over the last hundred years, they've

47:44.840 --> 47:51.080
become darker because the human influence on their environment has, has, has made for,

47:51.080 --> 47:55.080
has, has meant they need a different color of camouflage in order to survive. So, so we're

47:55.080 --> 47:59.240
constantly existing in dialogue with the natural world, you know, with this sort of memeplex.

47:59.320 --> 48:04.280
And I think the, the fundamental fantasy of the machine that we're somehow separable from it

48:04.280 --> 48:08.520
and entitled to instrumentalize it, you know, once you, if you look at it from inside the

48:08.520 --> 48:13.400
memeplex or you look at it from a perspective of thinking about us as participants in this

48:13.400 --> 48:19.880
and entangled in this enormous sort of multi species, interspecies memeplex, it's, it's,

48:19.880 --> 48:24.520
it's a sort of monstrous imposition and just a fundamental category error.

48:25.160 --> 48:29.160
Yeah. And this, this takes me right back to the point about environmentalism that we talked

48:29.160 --> 48:32.600
about right at the beginning, really, where I come in, I suppose, you know, this is a sort

48:32.600 --> 48:37.560
of a conversation about Gaia theory, really. This is a conversation about the interconnectedness of

48:37.560 --> 48:41.880
all things and the fact that there's no separation between humans of nature and that we're entirely

48:41.880 --> 48:47.800
reliant on everything else, but that living in urban interconnected societies, we can very easily

48:47.800 --> 48:53.240
pretend that that's not true until we start keeping chickens or any, any number of other things.

48:53.240 --> 48:58.920
But it is, it is exactly why it is impossible for the new metaphysics of the machine to succeed in

48:58.920 --> 49:07.320
the end, because what it's trying to do is, as I say, recreate, recreate or to create a new world

49:07.320 --> 49:11.400
on the basis that the current world is a standing reserve on the basis that the current world is

49:11.400 --> 49:17.480
just a fake or not a fake, but a pure material realm that there's nothing to it, that there's

49:17.480 --> 49:20.840
no consciousness, why doesn't the human mind that there's no real interconnections that there's

49:20.840 --> 49:26.520
nothing, that there's nothing sacred, that there's nothing higher than us, that there's nothing

49:27.480 --> 49:31.960
that may be operating outside our purview. And that's not true. And that's not a religious claim

49:31.960 --> 49:36.360
either. You can, you can read any number of scientific papers these days about the consciousness

49:36.360 --> 49:41.640
of trees and the interconnectedness of fungal mycelia and any number of interesting studies

49:41.640 --> 49:47.160
which demonstrate that things that are not human tend to be a lot more conscious and interconnected

49:47.240 --> 49:50.840
than we might assume in the modern age, which incidentally is something that most

49:50.840 --> 49:57.560
indigenous people know instinctively and traditionally. So that's real. So what we are

49:57.560 --> 50:03.880
doing precisely is trying to break apart and instrumentalize and break down into material

50:03.880 --> 50:08.280
parts, something which actually is alive that we're part of, which is the planet itself.

50:08.920 --> 50:12.920
We're playing, we're literally playing God, except God knows what he's doing and we don't.

50:13.880 --> 50:17.400
And that's why, that's why it hits the buffers and it will keep hitting the buffers.

50:17.400 --> 50:21.000
And at the micro level, you know, a human body is a real thing and you can't,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.640
you can't change it beyond a certain point. And at the macro level,

50:24.440 --> 50:28.920
there's something very big and interwoven going on with the planet itself that we don't understand

50:28.920 --> 50:33.080
and we can't, and we can't fiddle with beyond a certain point. And we're just going to learn

50:33.080 --> 50:36.760
it the hard way. That's what's going to happen. We're going to learn it the hard way because we

50:36.760 --> 50:44.280
don't want to learn it by paying attention. I wanted to throw in a concept around this

50:44.280 --> 50:48.920
question of like what's driving it. And I wonder whether you both might have seen this,

50:48.920 --> 50:54.680
but a lot of talk recently about the kind of concept of the egregore and which is a sort of

50:54.680 --> 51:03.240
idea of maybe we are all the individual human brain as connected to a smartphone, just choosing to

51:03.240 --> 51:09.640
kind of upregulate certain messages or not based on kind of ideological reasons could be seen as a

51:09.640 --> 51:15.400
kind of individual neuron in a wider sort of group consciousness that we're not, we don't know where

51:15.400 --> 51:20.680
that is going, that that's sort of almost like a, that could be, do you think that's a useful concept?

51:20.680 --> 51:29.400
And that could kind of explain sort of a kind of wider perspective of an intention that we're

51:29.400 --> 51:34.600
part of, but we don't fully understand where its destination or direction of travel is.

51:35.240 --> 51:41.160
Yeah, well, it's an occult concept, isn't it, egregores? I've seen a few people

51:41.720 --> 51:47.320
chatting about it recently. I mean, there's certainly a sense that you can come back to that

51:47.320 --> 51:51.560
notion that we're being controlled by something that's bigger than us. And I think fundamentally

51:51.560 --> 51:55.160
that is happening through the internet. I wrote quite a fun short story a few years ago called

51:55.160 --> 51:59.320
The Basilisk, which was all about this, which I quite enjoyed writing. I should just write

51:59.320 --> 52:02.360
short stories because there's a much quicker way of trying to explain all this than putting it in

52:02.360 --> 52:09.480
essays. But that was precisely about the possibility that something is controlling us through the web,

52:09.480 --> 52:13.800
whether that something is a sort of a mind force that we create in some ways, or whether it's

52:13.800 --> 52:18.280
something else. I don't know, but there's something, there's something going on which is bigger than

52:18.280 --> 52:24.680
us. The internet has manifested it. And it's part of the craziness. And it's really difficult to

52:24.680 --> 52:30.680
pin down. But it's people talking about egregores is one sort of pointer to the fact that people

52:30.680 --> 52:36.760
can again feel that there's something much bigger behind the weird on-screen interactions that no

52:36.760 --> 52:42.760
one can quite explain or put their finger on. Well, I would love to do a part two where we talk

52:42.760 --> 52:48.840
about what we're going to do, what we do now. Because if we've reached the bottom, if we've

52:48.840 --> 52:54.440
reached the bottom, and there really is nowhere further down, I mean, there might be a lot along

52:54.680 --> 53:00.200
way further down. But if we've reached the point where we've liquefied everything, what happens

53:00.200 --> 53:05.240
next, I think that's a question I would love to talk over with you. No, it's a big one. Yeah,

53:05.240 --> 53:10.040
how to live through it, how to make sense of it, how to resist it. Yeah, that would be a great chat.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.360
Awesome. So this is diagnosis, and then we have a follow up with solution.

53:16.680 --> 53:22.120
No promises, no promises. Yeah, Mary, Mary and Paul, thank you very much. Thank you.

53:24.840 --> 53:31.560
So I hope you enjoyed that. I really loved the conversation while I was part of it,

53:31.560 --> 53:35.720
and I listened to it again afterwards and something really landed. So I'm going to try

53:35.720 --> 53:39.480
and explain why I think this is significant. Maybe you can let me know what you make of

53:39.480 --> 53:45.480
this in the comments. I think what this conversation was is a moving towards a synthesis position

53:45.480 --> 53:51.000
between what you might call dissident right and dissident left. It's explaining how the extreme

53:51.080 --> 53:55.560
woke agenda is liquefying all structures, which is what the right is angry about.

53:55.560 --> 54:01.000
But Paul explains that ultimately this is in the interests of capital and it's a corporate agenda,

54:01.000 --> 54:05.800
which is what the left is upset about. And it also validates the feelings of the conspiracy

54:05.800 --> 54:10.840
minded that something coordinated is going on, but locates the source of the problem not in a

54:10.840 --> 54:17.560
shadowy cabal, but in the metaphysical, what Paul calls the machine, and Mary calls fully automated

54:17.560 --> 54:24.280
luxury Gnosticism. So I think this is inching towards a synthesis position. And what's more

54:24.280 --> 54:30.440
powerful is the way that they both deliver their message with wit, intelligence and depth.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.760
And with none of the reactivity and anger that characterizes so much of this debate.

54:35.560 --> 54:40.600
So I really do think this is a step forward. And I'm looking forward to hosting them again in

54:40.600 --> 54:45.320
dialogue, along with rebel wisdom members, which we're going to do soon. So if you want to join

54:45.320 --> 54:50.920
that conversation, check out the membership options below in the show notes and hope to see you there.
