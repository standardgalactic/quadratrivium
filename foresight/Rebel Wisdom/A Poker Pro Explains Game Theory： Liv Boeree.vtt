00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
So, this is one of the most interesting conversations I've had all year, and it's with former

00:09.600 --> 00:12.920
poker pro and scientist Liv Berea.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.720
So Liv has a YouTube channel where she makes films about game theory, complexity, physics,

00:17.720 --> 00:22.360
a lot of other really interesting topics, and we covered a lot of ground in this conversation,

00:22.360 --> 00:26.480
including what she learned about intuition and logic playing poker.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.440
Everyone in the world tells you, oh no, trust your gut when it's got a really strong feeling,

00:29.440 --> 00:31.280
it knows, it knows something that you don't.

00:31.280 --> 00:37.400
And it's like, well, this is clearly not true, because it's often wrong, and it seems to

00:37.400 --> 00:39.920
be largely, am I having a good day or a bad day?

00:39.920 --> 00:45.080
If I'm having a good day, my intuitions tend to be more optimistic, if I'm having a bad

00:45.080 --> 00:49.080
day, my intuition is pessimistic, so I can't trust it that much.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.520
We also talked about game theory and why it's such a useful tool for sense making.

00:53.520 --> 01:00.400
It's just the mathematics of these competitive situations, effectively, looking to see what

01:00.400 --> 01:06.320
optimal strategies are, suboptimal strategies, and the phenomena that arise out of them.

01:06.320 --> 01:11.760
And we delved into a concept popularized by Scott Alexander called Molok, which took the

01:11.760 --> 01:14.320
conversation in a really interesting direction.

01:14.320 --> 01:21.280
And what he really did for the first time was he related Molok to game theory, and talked

01:21.280 --> 01:25.880
about how it seems to be this sort of the force, so again, if there's this force of

01:25.880 --> 01:30.880
something that's driving the emergence and complexity, there seems to be this opposing

01:30.880 --> 01:37.080
force, which is a force of destruction that sort of uses competition for ill.

01:37.080 --> 01:43.760
Molok is the god of unhealthy competition, of negative sum gains, so competitive interactions

01:43.760 --> 01:48.120
that make the world worse off for their existence, as opposed to being neutral or better.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.920
Liv is also one of the speakers at our free state of sense making event on the 25th and

01:52.920 --> 01:57.800
26th of September, so you can sign up for that down in the show notes, and I hope you

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
enjoy the film.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.080
So Liv, welcome to Rebel Wisdom.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
Thanks for coming.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
Thanks for having me.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.240
So you're a former pro poker player, and you also have an interest in game theory, which

02:08.240 --> 02:12.360
is something that we've covered on the channel and something we're always wanting to learn

02:12.360 --> 02:13.840
a little bit more about.

02:13.840 --> 02:19.520
But the first question I wanted to ask you is, can we play our way out of all the sort

02:19.520 --> 02:26.600
of game theory traps we find ourselves in, by which I mean the broken information landscape,

02:26.600 --> 02:31.640
institutional corruption, culture wars, polarization, obviously the list goes on, or are we just

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
completely fucked?

02:32.640 --> 02:39.720
I mean, that's the quadrillion dollar question, right?

02:39.720 --> 02:43.640
I certainly don't know the answer to that.

02:43.640 --> 02:49.320
I sincerely hope that there is a way out of it.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.240
I don't see what it is, in all honesty.

02:52.240 --> 02:58.160
It's something that consumes my thoughts on pretty much a daily basis.

02:58.160 --> 03:05.160
But there's something in me, call it dumb optimism, call it the belief.

03:05.160 --> 03:12.760
If there's these sort of dangerous forces, sort of semi-entropic forces trying to break

03:12.760 --> 03:19.120
down complexity, the complexity that is civilization in one direction, it almost seems like there's

03:19.120 --> 03:27.960
some kind of force pro-complexity trying to hold everything together and keep this weird

03:27.960 --> 03:31.920
world that we're in going, keeping things interesting.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.840
So yeah, I mean, I don't know what the answer is.

03:35.840 --> 03:42.800
All I know is that we are in an unbelievably critical time of the past decade and certainly

03:42.800 --> 03:45.480
the coming decade.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.240
It's definitely, we're definitely in the most interesting time in human history.

03:49.240 --> 03:56.040
Okay, sure, I might be biased, seeing as I'm here, and we like to be the kings of our

03:56.040 --> 03:57.040
own stories.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.760
But yeah, shit's getting real.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.880
Which leads me to a question I wanted to ask you about.

04:03.880 --> 04:08.840
A lot of the people we've had on the channel, like Daniel Spaktenberger or Jamie Weill or

04:08.840 --> 04:14.320
Jordan Hall, who've talked about existential risk in particular, seem to be quite pessimistic.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.600
And then there's other people who have a kind of, there's a meme called Dumer Optimism,

04:19.600 --> 04:24.360
where there's a sense of, yes, we're screwed, but within that we have some kind of hope

04:24.360 --> 04:26.600
and a kind of optimism in spite of that.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.240
And then we have people like, there's lots of different sort of tribes, like extinction.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.800
So deep adaptation, which is a big influence on, for example, extinction rebellion, which

04:35.800 --> 04:41.200
is this sort of environmental version of, we're all screwed, it's already done.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.680
We need to go live in cabins and we need to be, it's all, I think it has kind of a religious

04:44.680 --> 04:46.200
quality to it almost.

04:46.200 --> 04:52.480
Yeah, I'm curious about how optimistic or pessimistic you are about the current state

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
of affairs.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.240
It depends what day you're asking me.

04:57.240 --> 05:05.400
Right now I'm in a more pessimistic mood simply because I read this article by Kaifuli yesterday

05:05.400 --> 05:10.680
talking about the next generation of warfare that we're entering into with these, you know,

05:10.680 --> 05:14.600
with autonomous weapons and particularly AI-driven ones.

05:14.600 --> 05:20.320
It's not inconceivable within a few years that for $1,000 you can, and a little bit

05:20.320 --> 05:26.440
of know-how basically build an entirely anonymous drone that can take out whoever you want.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.880
And it will not be able to be traced back to you.

05:29.880 --> 05:34.520
And that's just the beginning.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.880
And you read that and you're just like, I don't see how we will ever make it.

05:38.880 --> 05:44.560
So right now I'm in a pessimistic mood, but after the weekend I did a little Burning Man

05:44.560 --> 05:48.680
ceremony and just felt the magic a little bit and I was like, no, we're going to make

05:48.680 --> 05:49.680
it.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.760
And it's weird.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.440
It's like a, I mean, you could almost say, is it like a sort of left brain, right brain

05:56.440 --> 05:57.440
thing?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.560
You know, logically I don't see a way out of it, but there's like some intuition in

06:00.560 --> 06:02.200
me that feels like we're going to make it.

06:02.200 --> 06:09.720
But then sometimes my intuitions are just like, no, like also, like I don't see a solution.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.160
So I don't know.

06:14.160 --> 06:20.840
And I guess perhaps the thing to do in the face of that, you know, this constant uncertainty

06:20.840 --> 06:29.000
and this oscillation between the two extremes is to, you know, which state of mind would

06:29.000 --> 06:31.200
I rather live in more?

06:31.200 --> 06:34.720
Given that I don't know which one's the right one and I seem to be able to go into both,

06:34.720 --> 06:42.160
I might as well invest in what I can in myself to control, you know, am I more likely to

06:42.160 --> 06:44.720
wake up in an optimistic mood or a pessimistic mood?

06:44.720 --> 06:51.200
And I can control that to an extent by, by, you know, taking care of my information diet.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
What do I read?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
How much time do I spend on Twitter?

06:54.200 --> 06:58.320
You know, definitely the pessimism is correlated to the amount, you know, my, what my, my phone

06:58.320 --> 07:01.160
tells me I've been looking at Twitter, you know, how many minutes per day?

07:01.160 --> 07:08.160
You know, part of the thing I hate about, you know, you go on to Netflix or whatever

07:08.160 --> 07:16.560
right now, it's just the amount of dystopian art out there to utopian art is like a hundred

07:16.560 --> 07:17.560
to one.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
Probably worse even.

07:18.560 --> 07:26.600
There's just, there's just so little utopian programming, films, books.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.000
And part of the reason I think is because it's just much easier to imagine a dystopia.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.640
You know, one of the reasons why utopia doesn't exist is because it's incredibly hard to build.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.920
So again, if you have a more optimistic society, then it gives people the space to dream up

07:40.920 --> 07:44.360
and think of more positive things and it gets the ball rolling in the right direction.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.880
Yeah, I like that.

07:45.880 --> 07:51.600
There's a bunch of stuff in there I'd love to pick up on the choice to be optimistic.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.680
You know, I think that is a very interesting thing in the times we live in.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.880
And it doesn't surprise me that it's actually something I've written about before the fascination

07:58.880 --> 08:00.480
we have with dystopia.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.800
I think is in, I think there's lots of reasons for it, but I think in part I've described

08:05.800 --> 08:09.960
the world we're living in sort of culturally is like a noir story, like a noir detective

08:09.960 --> 08:16.160
story where you have the detective going through the often like encountering different institutions

08:16.160 --> 08:20.720
like the church and okay, it turns out the priest is in on it and corrupt and like corrupt

08:20.720 --> 08:24.720
to the core and then the judges are corrupt and the police are corrupt and everyone's

08:24.720 --> 08:32.000
corrupt except for the detective usually and plays this kind of chivalric role of the kind

08:32.040 --> 08:39.160
of broken but all like roughly altogether pure of soul somewhere in there right and

08:39.160 --> 08:42.840
they're like, but there's light in the darkness, but they're sort of like hitting the whiskey

08:42.840 --> 08:46.720
because like just to be the light in the darkness is so much and I think I think there's something

08:46.720 --> 08:53.760
in that as a kind of as an image and there are and also just kind of, you know, it we're

08:53.760 --> 09:01.880
recording this not long after the 20th anniversary of 9 11 and the the sheer shaking foundational

09:01.880 --> 09:09.040
shaking impact of things like 9 11 and the financial crash and many other things that

09:09.040 --> 09:16.240
have happened since then in terms of institutional trust. I think we we have this sense of being

09:16.240 --> 09:21.680
in or moving towards a dystopia, but I'm very interested as well in something you were

09:21.680 --> 09:27.880
just talking about in the the optimism within that right the the kind of and even so there

09:27.880 --> 09:32.360
is this kind of there is this hope so I wanted to talk a little bit about game theory because

09:32.360 --> 09:35.680
this kind of points towards a critique I have of game theory, but I thought it'd be cool

09:35.680 --> 09:42.040
to to just kind of get a bit of a definition of what game theory is before in case anyone's

09:42.040 --> 09:48.720
not really familiar with it. All game theory is is a branch of economics basically, which

09:48.720 --> 09:57.520
typically deals with competitive systems and it looks at the strategic, you know, it describes

09:57.560 --> 10:02.480
people or decision makers within it as agents typically just so that it's not human centric,

10:02.480 --> 10:11.760
you know, AIs could be decision makers or whatever, mice, rats and so on. And it's just the mathematics

10:11.760 --> 10:17.600
of these competitive situations effectively looking looking to see what optimal strategies

10:17.600 --> 10:23.200
are suboptimal strategies and the phenomena that arise out of them. You have an interesting

10:23.240 --> 10:28.440
position in this because you're a former pro poker player. And so, you know, one could argue

10:28.440 --> 10:32.440
maybe this is wrong, correct me, but is that you were sort of having to apply game theory

10:32.440 --> 10:38.440
under tremendous pressure with high stakes. But I'm curious about on the table, how much

10:38.440 --> 10:43.960
of that is game theory and how much of it is, obviously, experience and then intuition,

10:43.960 --> 10:47.480
which is another thing I'd love to talk about. But, you know, the critique of game theory

10:47.480 --> 10:53.280
is often just like with with modern economics is that it relies on on actors being rational.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.280
I know not all game theory does, but this idea of rational actors looking after their

10:57.280 --> 11:00.960
self interest, you know, it turns out we're not really rational actors, but I still think

11:00.960 --> 11:04.920
it has a lot of value. How applicable was it to to your poker career?

11:05.200 --> 11:12.400
So I think we need to step back a bit in terms of like describing what's going on at the poker

11:12.400 --> 11:18.840
table. So you will have, obviously, seven or eight other people around the table. And

11:18.840 --> 11:25.720
your job is to basically sift through all the different forms of information that you're

11:25.720 --> 11:30.640
receiving in order to figure out what the optimal decision is. And you've got multiple decision

11:30.640 --> 11:37.440
points. And there's a broad range of information that you're receiving, like from, you know,

11:37.440 --> 11:44.800
the the the amount that the person bets, the the cards that you have relating to the cards

11:44.800 --> 11:51.760
on the board on the table, the the the demeanor of the of the person, you know, like that

11:51.760 --> 11:56.320
you know about their past experience, how much they've played. But then now their face

11:56.320 --> 11:59.760
is doing something funny that you never noticed before, or they're breathing heavier or something

11:59.760 --> 12:05.280
like that, something they say. So there's this, there's a lot of qualitative and quantitative

12:05.320 --> 12:13.080
information coming in. And where game theory comes in, really, right, in this, in the case

12:13.080 --> 12:17.920
of poker, typically game theory applies to the strictly quantitative stuff. So, you know,

12:17.920 --> 12:24.720
the there will be certain probabilities with which other cards will come out. And you you

12:24.720 --> 12:28.560
know that the sort of odds that the that are being offered to you based upon your bet and so

12:28.560 --> 12:33.440
on. And what that means based upon that information, effectively in a vacuum, the map, the

12:33.920 --> 12:38.240
quantifiable information is that there will be these mathematically optimal solutions to these

12:38.240 --> 12:43.040
different situations, which are, because there's so many possible situations, they're very hard

12:43.040 --> 12:48.240
to calculate. It doesn't, it sounds like, oh, so you just need to remember the math, no. But

12:49.360 --> 12:52.800
what game theory will do is basically suggest that there are certain strategies

12:53.360 --> 12:58.800
that you will want to employ in certain situations based upon this quantified information. But then,

12:58.800 --> 13:03.760
of course, there's this, this like nebula of other stuff coming in, like, well, yeah, but they

13:03.760 --> 13:07.840
were breathing funny, which they weren't doing before. How do you quantify that and so on.

13:09.040 --> 13:14.480
And in terms of how much of that nebula sort of applies to your overall decision making,

13:15.040 --> 13:22.160
I hate to put like, try and put a percentage on it, but it's by and large, like, 90% of the

13:22.160 --> 13:27.440
quantified stuff. And then the the the like, these sort of fuzzy things around the edge will count

13:27.440 --> 13:33.840
for 10% of your decision. A lot of people, so when I first started playing poker back in 2005,

13:33.840 --> 13:37.840
no one really understood game theory, no one understood the mechanics of how the game worked.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.880
And the best players in the world were basically these like, they were typically older,

13:44.000 --> 13:50.560
kind of like hustler types, who had just spent decades in casinos, just seeing the gamut of

13:50.560 --> 13:55.600
human behavior and developing really strong intuitions about people. And so often they'd

13:55.600 --> 14:00.160
make these these these strange plays that would turn out to be correct. And they wouldn't even

14:00.160 --> 14:05.120
be able to explain to you why they did it. It was purely this sort of automatic unconscious

14:05.120 --> 14:10.000
intuitive process going on, which and their intuitions were basically better than everyone

14:10.000 --> 14:17.360
else's. But then when online poker appeared, and we started getting like, data analysis software

14:17.360 --> 14:23.680
and this kind of stuff, you now all of a sudden we had data that pros could look at and and use

14:23.760 --> 14:28.640
to analyze where they were going wrong, you know, where are the leaks in their game. And this kind

14:28.640 --> 14:33.520
of, you know, it lifted the lid lifted the veil on what's going on in poker. And now people to

14:33.520 --> 14:38.640
realize that, okay, there's mathematical solutions to this. And what it meant was that the game

14:38.640 --> 14:42.640
basically went through a sort of scientific revolution, away from this pure artistry of just

14:42.640 --> 14:47.920
feeling and having a vibe of someone to to going, Well, actually, look, this is the mathematical

14:47.920 --> 14:53.360
optimal solution. I'll stick to this until I get such strong overwhelming evidence from

14:53.760 --> 15:00.960
something else that I might override it. And in that, you know, in some ways, I hate this, but

15:01.680 --> 15:05.840
in reality, like you cannot be a top professional these days without having that mathematical

15:05.840 --> 15:12.400
foundation. You just no one's intuitions will be able to surpass knowing if you're playing as

15:12.400 --> 15:16.320
someone who's playing a game theory optimal style, even though in some ways it's kind of robotic,

15:17.040 --> 15:23.520
you just can't beat it by pure intuition alone. But of course, you know, if someone is now playing

15:23.520 --> 15:30.240
not quite perfectly, now you can have these other like these these other like fuzzy skills,

15:30.240 --> 15:34.080
you can bring in these fuzzy skills to figure out how the how to exploit their mistakes.

15:35.600 --> 15:41.920
But yeah, the very long winded way of answering basically, it's it's by and by and large a very

15:41.920 --> 15:47.520
mathematical game over 80 90%. That's really interesting. Fascinating. I really like that

15:47.520 --> 15:52.480
that kind of laying out. I got a nice image there of the various sort of data points that are

15:52.480 --> 15:56.640
happening and many of them at the same time, which is a bit like, I mean, that's, you know,

15:56.640 --> 15:59.360
trying to make sense of something online is a little bit like that as well.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.680
Yeah, and and I think it's interesting with like the particular so the game of poker, I think

16:06.560 --> 16:11.680
can we can look at also life in general through that lens in a lot of ways like we

16:12.560 --> 16:19.920
like I also have this kind of yearning for being purely intuitive, right? But I also am aware that

16:20.240 --> 16:24.320
intuition really does lead us to stray a lot of the time, right, especially when we're trying to

16:24.320 --> 16:28.640
make sense of complexity. Something John Varvakey, we've had on the channel a lot talks about in

16:28.640 --> 16:34.000
cognitive science terms, you know, how do we how do we make sure the frame that we're looking at

16:34.000 --> 16:37.840
everything through like the like he uses the example of like the glasses we're wearing,

16:37.840 --> 16:41.760
how do we know that that frame is accurate? And of course, it's never 100% accurate, but

16:42.320 --> 16:47.360
practices and techniques that help us take the frame off and go, Oh, yeah, shit, that's a crack,

16:48.080 --> 16:52.320
that's smudged that I'm seeing everything wonky, clean it a little bit, put it back on. And that

16:52.320 --> 16:58.000
process of continuously regenerating our frames, I think is kind of more important than ever.

16:59.040 --> 17:05.040
At the same time, there is something, well, I would use the term kind of like transcendent or

17:05.040 --> 17:11.920
magic about the power of intuition. And so when we're looking at something like, well,

17:11.920 --> 17:15.280
actually to rewind a bit, I mean, I see this come up in culture a lot, I'm sure, you know,

17:15.280 --> 17:20.480
this has been a real trend of people trusting their own intuition over, say, the opinion of

17:20.480 --> 17:25.520
experts. And that happens a lot now. And there is good reason why we don't necessarily trust

17:26.400 --> 17:30.880
experts. You know, I mean, I read an article recently, which was, you know, making the point

17:30.880 --> 17:35.280
about America had access to the absolute best experts in international relations,

17:35.280 --> 17:42.000
counterinsurgency, etc. For 20 years, when the and yet the pull out of Afghanistan was a

17:42.000 --> 17:47.600
complete catastrophe, right? Unlimited budget almost unlimited expert credentialed experts.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.440
A few experiments have been done where an educated so there's a caveat to this,

17:52.160 --> 17:58.160
really someone who's decently educated on a topic, trying to predict the future based on that

17:58.160 --> 18:05.200
information, it gets about the scores is roughly in line with a credentialed expert. So and I'll

18:05.200 --> 18:09.920
put in the show notes probably the article that was from actually read it this morning, I think.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.520
It raises an interesting question though, right? So we need to be able to have some

18:16.480 --> 18:22.000
way of not getting completely deluded by our feelings and our intuition, which it which it

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
tends to do. And every time I notice it's happened to myself, I'm like, Oh, that's a bit embarrassing.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.600
I really shouldn't have been so certain. But it keeps happening, obviously, because we're human.

18:29.600 --> 18:35.520
But and then at the same time, we need to know how to trust it in some way. I think so I'm curious

18:35.520 --> 18:39.680
to hear your your journey with this. I know you were kind of at one point sort of anti intuition,

18:39.680 --> 18:44.080
then you've gone kind of in a bit of a journey with it. Yeah. I mean, I started out, you know,

18:44.080 --> 18:52.800
prior to poker, my decision making process was just a delightful mix of deep overconfidence

18:53.600 --> 19:00.160
and emotionality. Just I was a highly emotional, you know, it was 20 year old girl who

19:00.480 --> 19:05.920
was the bee's knees and everything and hadn't learned about life yet. And then poker came along

19:05.920 --> 19:10.160
and didn't always you know, the great thing about poker is that it's like got these like quite tight

19:10.160 --> 19:17.920
feedback loops where well, just tight enough so that you will eventually realize that you're

19:17.920 --> 19:24.080
clearly not doing something right because you're losing money. But loose enough where you can still

19:24.080 --> 19:28.160
be deluded for a while about your relative skill level, you know, because there is this luck factor.

19:28.720 --> 19:33.760
And so you part of the hardest thing is figuring out when you know, when things are going wrong,

19:33.760 --> 19:38.240
is it because you're making bad decisions? Or is it because luck is not on your side?

19:38.240 --> 19:42.080
Because it can be both or a mixture of the two. So you know, you've got your your system one,

19:42.080 --> 19:47.680
which is like the classic like intuition, this unconscious process, and then system two, as I

19:47.680 --> 19:53.520
call it, well, Kahneman calls it, which is like this, the voice in your head, you know, what's 471

19:53.520 --> 20:01.840
plus 86, that'll be your system two at work. And so then I was like, okay, so really what poker

20:01.840 --> 20:06.880
is about is about this linear system two stuff, this this thinking things through like solving

20:06.880 --> 20:13.840
a math problem, and which it by enlarges. And, and then and I would sometimes try and you know,

20:13.840 --> 20:20.480
I'd be playing, and I would, you know, facing a big, you know, big, typical decision, someone's

20:20.480 --> 20:25.520
put me all in on the river, I'm facing my tournament life, you know, heart's pumping in my ears. And

20:26.960 --> 20:31.920
my gut will be saying, oh, a fold, fold, fold, they've got it this time. And the maths will be

20:31.920 --> 20:36.640
saying, cool, no, you've got to call you've got, you know, your hand is statistically good enough

20:36.640 --> 20:44.000
to do so. And I would, for a while, I would be like, well, my, my, no, my gut is so strong,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.880
I'm going to just listen to that. And on, well, I don't know whether it's more often than not,

20:48.880 --> 20:53.040
but on a sufficient number of occasions, my gut was completely wrong. And I was like, huh,

20:53.040 --> 20:56.880
this is interesting, because everyone's been telling me, you know, but everyone in the world

20:56.880 --> 21:00.240
tells you, oh, no, trust your gut, when it's got a really strong feeling, it knows, it knows

21:00.240 --> 21:04.480
something that you don't. And it's like, well, this is clearly not true, because it's often wrong.

21:05.280 --> 21:09.920
There's bias, and it seems to be largely by large, you know, am I having a good day or a bad day?

21:09.920 --> 21:15.280
If I'm having a good day, my, my intuitions tend to be more optimistic. If I'm having a bad day,

21:15.280 --> 21:21.840
my intuition is pessimistic. So I can't trust it that much. And, you know, that was sort of,

21:21.840 --> 21:27.520
then I did my TED Talk a few years after that where, and I still stand by the contents of it.

21:27.520 --> 21:34.640
Basically, I, I, I shit on intuition a little bit saying, you know, if you Google it, the internet

21:34.640 --> 21:40.720
tells you that it's, it's this perfect source of knowledge, you should never second guess it,

21:40.720 --> 21:44.640
always trust it, and so on. And I think that's actually very dangerous advice, because

21:45.600 --> 21:49.280
there are some things your intuition is really good for, and some things it's terrible for.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.680
And the main, without going into the details of what all those things are, the main thing is,

21:55.680 --> 21:59.440
basically, if it's something that, if it's a decision you've made many, many, many times,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.600
then your intuition is going to be pretty good. Which is why our intuitions are all from quite

22:03.600 --> 22:07.360
good around like social things, you know, you meet someone and you get like a weird vibe off them,

22:07.440 --> 22:10.960
and you don't quite know why. You know, you've met a lot of people, by the time you're in your

22:10.960 --> 22:14.720
thirties, you've met a lot of people. Chances are your intuition is fairly good, and you should

22:14.720 --> 22:20.320
listen to it. But if it's, you know, if you've started a new job, and you're solving difficult

22:20.320 --> 22:25.280
problems, that you haven't quite figured out how to do the like logic for yet, relying on your

22:25.280 --> 22:30.400
intuition isn't a good idea either, because it, ultimately, it needs some data and experience

22:30.400 --> 22:35.840
to be based off. As far as we know, it's not this purely magical thing. Might be sometimes,

22:35.840 --> 22:42.080
but we'll get to that. So yeah, so then I sort of went into this, like, deep skepticism of using

22:42.080 --> 22:46.640
intuition. Certainly, you know, and certainly was, my message was, don't overreel on it,

22:46.640 --> 22:54.240
be very careful, because it can be biased. But then, more recently, funnily enough, after a

22:54.240 --> 22:59.440
conversation with Daniel Schmaxenberger, who always manages to, like, anyone who has ever met

22:59.440 --> 23:05.680
him, he just like shakes people's brains up. One of the things he said to me, we hadn't

23:05.680 --> 23:09.440
had much of a conversation, but he pulled me aside. He's like, you need to get in touch with

23:09.440 --> 23:14.240
your feminine side a bit more. And I was like, what? What does that mean? And I was initially,

23:14.240 --> 23:19.360
like, annoyed me. Because I had, historically, sort of associated femininity a little bit with

23:19.360 --> 23:25.280
weakness. I'd always, you know, I've always kind of been attracted to typically male pursuits,

23:25.280 --> 23:31.280
you know, physics, heavy metal, poker, you know, it's all very predictable. To the point where

23:31.280 --> 23:39.200
I then started to associate feminine things with weakness, and so on. But it was just that I didn't

23:39.200 --> 23:48.880
quite understand what femininity is. And what it kind of, you know, if masculinity is kind of like

23:48.880 --> 23:56.960
this outward seeking, looking for some strict type ways of defining and viewing the world,

23:57.680 --> 24:05.760
femininity is this more sort of passive, inward facing, reflective form of thinking,

24:06.880 --> 24:10.880
a form of wisdom. It's just like another form of wisdom. And that's what I think he was getting

24:10.880 --> 24:15.200
at, basically. He's like, play around with your feminine side and it will enable you to

24:15.920 --> 24:21.120
start listening to your intuition a bit more and respecting it. And he was absolutely right.

24:21.120 --> 24:27.760
And since I started doing that, I don't know, life just became a bit easier. And

24:30.400 --> 24:36.080
just, I don't know, I just felt like more of a whole person. It's hard to describe. It sounds

24:36.080 --> 24:40.880
a bit weird, but it was kind of cool. I really like that explanation of when intuition is useful

24:40.880 --> 24:47.840
and when it isn't, right? It reminds me of, so there's something I've been quite influenced

24:47.840 --> 24:52.160
by is the work of a guy called William Duggan at Columbia Business School. And he talks about

24:52.160 --> 24:58.400
strategic intuition. And strategic intuition is basically our, so he uses it, he talks about

24:58.400 --> 25:03.040
creativity and innovation through it, but has these four different stages of how we come to new

25:03.040 --> 25:08.000
ideas and how we kind of get new insights. And the first one is examples from history. So you've

25:08.000 --> 25:12.880
done, like you said, you have lots of experience in the thing. It might not even just be in that

25:12.880 --> 25:18.160
thing, you have a whole database in your brain of, let you use the example of social interactions.

25:18.160 --> 25:22.080
So that we have all these different kind of social interactions there and are unconscious in the

25:22.080 --> 25:26.400
library of our memory. But then we also have loads of other things connected to that, loads of

25:26.400 --> 25:31.440
different frames, we have lots of different, so let's say kind of horizontal connections. So it

25:31.440 --> 25:35.680
might be, okay, I also know about this person's culture, or I also know about the cultural

25:35.680 --> 25:39.520
context of where we are, or I'm having this interaction with someone at a roller skating rink.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.720
Well, I know how people are at roller skates, so all these different things are going on.

25:42.720 --> 25:48.880
And of all that information, then unconscious, so the second stage of this innovation process is

25:48.880 --> 25:52.400
presence of mind. So you don't try and find the answer, which goes into that receptivity you're

25:52.400 --> 25:59.280
kind of talking about. It's, okay, well, I'm just going to be awake and aware and allow my unconscious

25:59.280 --> 26:03.840
to do its thing. And then the third stage is the eureka moment, which he calls a kudwi, which is a

26:03.840 --> 26:07.760
strike of the eye in French, which I don't exactly know where they got that phrase from. But it's

26:07.760 --> 26:12.000
a kind of, and we've all had that experience of something hits you like a ton of bricks,

26:12.000 --> 26:16.160
and it often happens when you're not trying to solve the problem. You were taking a shower,

26:16.160 --> 26:21.040
you're walking the dog, whatever it might be. And then the fourth stage is the resolution to carry

26:21.040 --> 26:25.680
it through. And something I used to do with companies and was on a kind of campaign to get

26:25.680 --> 26:30.480
rid of brainstorming, because brainstorming is really awful for that creative innovation process.

26:30.480 --> 26:35.760
Because what brainstorming is really good for is going, here's many ideas, let's as a group hone

26:35.760 --> 26:42.960
down the ideas to one, what is terrible for is here's a blank space, make ideas, because that's

26:42.960 --> 26:47.040
not how the process works, according to Duggan. And he goes into the kind of neuroscience of it.

26:47.680 --> 26:53.200
But one example he uses in that is of a fireman going into a burning building and having this

26:53.200 --> 26:56.960
intense feeling of get out, get everyone out. And this is a real life example. And I think

26:56.960 --> 27:02.160
there's quite a lot of them goes in doesn't know why that can't see anything in particular that's

27:02.240 --> 27:07.760
telling him this is incredibly dangerous. But has seen so many fires that somewhere is intuition

27:07.760 --> 27:11.200
is like something's off, get out, obviously get out the building, the whole thing collapses like

27:11.200 --> 27:14.800
five seconds later. That's what you're talking about. It sounds like you have the intuition.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.440
Well, well, I mean, usually when people report this kind of thing, they can't quite identify

27:19.440 --> 27:24.320
what it was. But there will be some element in the in all of the complexity of the environment

27:24.960 --> 27:29.280
that is connecting with a preexisting element, which is Oh, that time where that happened. And

27:29.280 --> 27:34.160
this I also noticed that slight offness to the smell or whatever it might be that you can't

27:34.160 --> 27:40.960
consciously notice. So in those moments that kind of screaming intuition. But if I walked into a

27:40.960 --> 27:46.880
burning building, I'd probably have that screaming intuition the whole time. Get out, get out. So

27:46.880 --> 27:50.960
yeah, I really quite like that example. So one of the aspects of game theory that we've talked

27:50.960 --> 27:55.280
about on the channel before. But I don't understand that well. So I'm going to ask you about it is

27:55.280 --> 28:00.160
multipolar traps seems very relevant to the times you live in life. So what is a multipolar trap?

28:00.160 --> 28:06.560
Yeah, a multipolar trap is is basically another word for race to the bottom type scenarios,

28:08.400 --> 28:13.920
which involve typically coordination problems. So a group of people who are in a system where

28:13.920 --> 28:20.720
there's some level of competition, you know, they're competing for thing x. And in order to get more

28:20.720 --> 28:28.080
of x, it typically means that they have to trade off some kind of values. And inevitably,

28:28.080 --> 28:31.760
that trade off will keep happening more and more because there's individual incentives on each

28:31.760 --> 28:37.200
person to do that. And it results in everyone ending up in a worse state than they they would be

28:37.200 --> 28:41.600
before. So an example that is very fresh to mind because I just made a video on it is

28:43.520 --> 28:47.840
the these new face filters that I don't know if you've seen or if you spend any time on Instagram

28:47.840 --> 28:55.120
don't. But if you do go on there, particularly for women, but men as well, there's this just these

28:55.120 --> 29:01.840
unbelievably good AI driven filters that you can, you know, you put your photo in,

29:02.480 --> 29:09.440
and you press it, and it will just make your face slightly more optimal. And it's often quite subtle.

29:09.440 --> 29:15.280
I mean, there's ones that are very clear and blatant. But the most dangerous ones are these

29:15.280 --> 29:20.400
really subtle ones where if I was to just show it to you and you hadn't really met me before,

29:20.400 --> 29:25.680
or you didn't know me, you would have no idea that it's there. But for the user, you see it,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.720
you know, you can do it before and after of what your natural face looks like. And then with this

29:28.720 --> 29:36.000
thing, it makes you absolutely hate your face. Like, like, it's astonishing. And you can apply

29:36.000 --> 29:40.080
this to like, Angelina Jolie, you name it, the most beautiful people on earth, and it will make them

29:40.080 --> 29:44.400
look like trash. By comparison, because you know, we're such relative creatures, right, we always

29:44.400 --> 29:50.240
just like, we're always comparing. And these things are super cheap, they're completely ubiquitous.

29:51.040 --> 29:55.040
And, you know, I've done all right in the looks department, and I'm like a fairly well established,

29:55.040 --> 30:00.400
you know, mentally, you know, chicken her like mid late 30s. And they're messing me up hard.

30:00.400 --> 30:04.000
Like I like to the point I now I've used them on my pictures to try it out, like I'm like,

30:04.000 --> 30:09.920
how do I ever not use this all the time. So what the hell it's doing to teenagers is just like,

30:10.000 --> 30:15.840
I can't imagine because I mean, like, they're having to compare their faces to the best, you

30:15.840 --> 30:23.040
know, like the Hollywood version of themselves. And so the way this relates to like a multipolar trap

30:23.040 --> 30:29.680
is individually, even if someone knows that this is bad for them to use this, and they know it's

30:29.680 --> 30:34.000
bad for like, their followers to, you know, to be posting these pictures, because it makes their

30:34.000 --> 30:39.520
followers feel worse about themselves. If you're trying to make it as an influencer on Instagram,

30:39.920 --> 30:43.920
how do you do that? Well, you, you, you want to post the best pictures of yourself possible,

30:43.920 --> 30:48.560
like typically beauty and sex cells, ultimately. So individually, everyone is incentivized to

30:48.560 --> 30:56.240
actually use one of these, these, these apps. And then even if, and even if people get together

30:56.240 --> 30:58.880
and say like, this is bullshit, we shouldn't, we shouldn't be doing it, you know, it's bad,

30:58.880 --> 31:04.000
it's bad for us and for everyone else. Ultimately, it's still such a competitive rat race that

31:04.000 --> 31:08.720
there's such a pressure on everyone to quietly go and use one, particularly as no one can really

31:08.720 --> 31:13.120
tell if you're using it. And then people will suspect that others are using it anyway. So then

31:13.120 --> 31:15.920
they're like, well, I might as well. And then basically everything falls back down again. So

31:15.920 --> 31:22.800
it's impossible to get like a, a reliable, you know, a, a solid pact going where no one uses

31:22.800 --> 31:28.400
these things because of these incentive pressures. So it's turning beauty, because beauty was kind

31:28.400 --> 31:32.720
of historically considered to be something that correlated with health, right? That's kind of

31:32.720 --> 31:38.560
how it originally emerged back in, you know, presumably in prehistoric times, females wanted

31:38.560 --> 31:43.680
to mate with males that showed signs of evolutionary fitness for their environment.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.400
But then there are points like, like with peacock feathers and so on where

31:49.360 --> 31:54.560
sexual selection and like what's good for your environment, you know, for your survival can

31:54.560 --> 32:00.400
like decouple and diverge. And then you stop optimizing for this like secondary trait.

32:01.600 --> 32:07.520
And, you know, so basically where beauty can get decoupled from health. And that's, to me,

32:07.520 --> 32:13.840
these, these apps are like the ultimate example of that because you're like, we know they're

32:13.840 --> 32:17.680
unhealthy for us mentally. Like there's tons of studies out there which are showing this just

32:17.680 --> 32:22.480
actually really, really bad for teenagers in particular. And yet we, because they make us

32:22.480 --> 32:27.600
look so good, we can't stop using them. So yeah, that's like a multipolar trap where you just can't

32:27.600 --> 32:33.120
get everyone to agree to not use them. Yeah, that's a great and terrifying example, isn't it? It's

32:33.120 --> 32:36.560
quite, yeah. I mean, it's a very mild example actually, you know, in the grand scheme of

32:36.560 --> 32:42.000
multipolar traps, there are much, much more dangerous ones, you know, like AI arms races

32:42.000 --> 32:46.480
and so on. But it's like a nice little example because it's, I think it's also a good example

32:46.480 --> 32:50.000
because it's something that a lot of people who aren't typically exposed to these kind of ideas

32:51.040 --> 32:56.000
can relate to. Another thing that we're kind of skirting around is the topic of complexity.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.920
And you have a background in physics as well. And the kind of complexity theory,

33:00.880 --> 33:05.440
what doesn't necessarily come from physics, but I think it's kind of the physics and yeah, I mean,

33:05.440 --> 33:11.120
they're like brothers and sisters, they're not the home of complexity theory. So why are you

33:11.120 --> 33:16.160
interested in it? What is it about complexity theory you find useful? I mean, it's just,

33:17.280 --> 33:22.080
I mean, it's kind of the study of what is, right? Because, I mean, whether or not you believe in

33:22.080 --> 33:28.320
aliens, like the earth, what's going on on earth right now is just so, from a computational

33:28.320 --> 33:32.240
standpoint, it's probably the most complex thing within our, certainly within our pocket of the

33:32.240 --> 33:39.760
universe, in my opinion, and probably the observable universe. And it's this weird,

33:41.280 --> 33:45.360
you know, it's kind of poetic in that like complexity to describe something that is hard

33:45.360 --> 33:50.080
to describe. And it's by, even by that, we struggle to even come to a definition of what

33:50.080 --> 33:55.440
complexity is. So like, that's why I just find it so fascinating, because we just, it's like

33:55.440 --> 34:00.160
really like the cutting edge. So it's very much a frontier of knowledge. You know, just like we,

34:01.840 --> 34:05.600
there's certain things in fundamental physics we haven't figured out. We really haven't, we just

34:05.600 --> 34:11.760
don't have like a solid theory of complexity yet as a civilization. We're getting there.

34:13.040 --> 34:20.400
And it, I think will be, again, this is an intuition, but it, I feel like understanding

34:20.480 --> 34:26.800
complexity is kind of essential, or at least having a firm grasp on it is essential for us to

34:28.560 --> 34:34.480
make it through. You know, we are in a more complex stage of civilization than ever before,

34:35.040 --> 34:40.080
and it's only getting more complex. And to an extent, we want it to get more complex, because,

34:41.360 --> 34:48.640
you know, if we do blow ourselves up, that's a permanent reduction and curtailment of complexity

34:48.640 --> 34:56.160
in the universe, which, as I mentioned to you before, I think is very bad. And so, yeah, I just

34:56.160 --> 34:59.600
think it's, I just think it's an absolutely fascinating topic. And every time I speak to

34:59.600 --> 35:04.000
someone about it, I always learn something new. That's the interesting thing as well. You speak to,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.920
not even necessarily experts, just asking people to define it. It's like, wow, I didn't think of

35:07.920 --> 35:12.960
that before, which is usually a sign that it's a really important topic. Yeah. And what are some

35:12.960 --> 35:17.680
of the elements, I mean, maybe useful if we talk a little bit about the elements of a complex system

35:17.680 --> 35:24.080
compared to, well, one useful way as well is the difference between complex and complicated.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.360
Yes. So maybe we could start there, and then we can talk a little bit about what happens in

35:27.360 --> 35:34.880
complex systems. So a nice definition of complex versus complicated. Complicated is the opposite

35:34.880 --> 35:40.000
of simple. So something that has, you know, many, many different bits and so on, and is, you know,

35:40.880 --> 35:47.680
many, many sort of constituent parts. Whereas complex is the opposite of independent.

35:49.360 --> 35:55.280
So the, the, the, so the main way a complex system differs from a complicated one is a

35:55.280 --> 36:00.720
complex one is sort of, it has this, this level of sort of self, self-referentialism,

36:01.440 --> 36:07.280
and it has these feedback loops and so on. And also it evolves over time. So a complicated system

36:07.280 --> 36:14.640
has lots of different parts, but is otherwise static in time by and large. And so it's, you know,

36:14.640 --> 36:18.240
if you were trying to simulate it, you could actually simulate it quite easily and also explain

36:18.240 --> 36:23.440
it. Whereas a complex system, because there's sort of so many more like levels of dimensionality to

36:23.440 --> 36:28.240
it, which are like changing and feeding back into one another. And it's sort of like these

36:28.240 --> 36:34.400
sweet spots between all these different dimensions of things. It's very, very hard to describe

36:35.360 --> 36:40.480
and also predict, which is sort of relates to this idea of emergence as well, because

36:42.080 --> 36:48.400
a complex system is basically something that has emerged from something of lower complexity.

36:49.680 --> 36:55.120
And this process of emergence is often like kind of a black box. We don't understand how and why

36:55.120 --> 37:01.760
it happens. You know, like no one could have predicted the internet, even in like, probably

37:01.760 --> 37:07.840
like 1890, which, you know, in the grand scheme of the timeline of humanity is nothing. But it was

37:07.840 --> 37:13.280
this unbelievably complex thing that came out of an already complex system, and yet it would have

37:13.280 --> 37:20.640
been impossible to predict. And so, yeah, that's the main difference to me. Yeah, that's a great

37:20.640 --> 37:26.480
explanation. I haven't heard that one before. The image that came to me was a complicated system.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.640
It's like a grandfather clock, right? And a complex system is the Amazon rainforest. Yes.

37:30.640 --> 37:35.200
Yeah. And I just got this image of a grandfather clock sitting in the Amazon rainforest, as this

37:35.200 --> 37:41.200
kind of juxtaposition, but just how incredibly different they are. You know, it's really recent

37:41.200 --> 37:45.760
that I've become more interested in complexity. And part of it, part of what's really exciting

37:45.760 --> 37:50.800
me about it, as I'm on this kind of, what I feel like will be a very long journey of understanding,

37:50.800 --> 37:56.320
is that the sort of enlightenment project that began perhaps in the 1700s, all the way up until

37:56.320 --> 38:02.880
now, I would argue, was we can look at the world and figure out how it's like a grandfather clock,

38:03.440 --> 38:10.320
given enough time. And then as scientists progress, we've been like, okay, actually, maybe our model

38:10.320 --> 38:15.680
was wrong. Maybe maybe the universe isn't like a grandfather clock. Maybe it's a complex system,

38:15.680 --> 38:20.720
which I think is pretty much the truth that we've kind of arrived at. But what I'm seeing as I kind

38:20.800 --> 38:26.400
of delve into this is just how important complexity is as a framing for so many different things.

38:26.400 --> 38:30.080
So many of the things we've talked about on Rebel Wisdom as well, like, you know, trying to make

38:30.080 --> 38:34.320
sense of the information landscape, trying to look at the culture wars and figure out, okay, how the

38:34.320 --> 38:40.720
hell do we come into some sense of coherence with one another? How do we revive the common so we

38:40.720 --> 38:45.440
can actually have new type of conversation? All of those are complex problems, because they're all

38:45.440 --> 38:50.480
feeding back on each other. And then there's this hope of emergence, because we don't know,

38:50.480 --> 38:54.720
like you said, we don't know what's going to emerge from the interaction of all those different parts.

38:55.520 --> 39:02.480
My sense is there's something like a new religion of sorts could emerge, which would completely

39:02.480 --> 39:08.960
flip would be the next thing that completely flips our entire way of working and communicating with

39:08.960 --> 39:13.600
each other because we cannot coordinate right now. And the thing that has helped us coordinate has

39:13.600 --> 39:20.480
been that in the past, right? So I mean, yeah, a really appealing meme. Exactly. Something that is,

39:20.480 --> 39:23.680
and I think we have no, I don't think it would look anything like the religions that have come

39:23.680 --> 39:29.840
before. And I've argued that it's sort of brewing as we speak online, and then breaching, I've called

39:29.840 --> 39:33.920
it the age of breach, because things are brewing online, and then breaching into consensus reality.

39:33.920 --> 39:38.720
And so far, it's been quite nascent, like the like GameStop, or the capital riots, where it's like,

39:38.720 --> 39:41.520
oh, God, that looks like a new thing. And then it's like, well, it all collapsed, but

39:42.400 --> 39:49.040
who knows? Yes, there's like a boundary between this like this, this whatever is underneath

39:49.040 --> 39:52.240
there, and then what's in our world, and that boundary is becoming more and more

39:53.040 --> 39:57.040
looped in some way. Definitely. That's what you describe it. It's like a larger surface area or

39:57.040 --> 40:02.640
something. And, you know, things will pop through. And then, yeah, no, I mean, I mean, the religion

40:02.640 --> 40:11.600
topic is a whole other thing. I, I by and large agree that not only will we likely see some kind

40:11.600 --> 40:17.680
of new religion, and it's almost seems like people want to need that. But I think we should have

40:17.680 --> 40:24.000
something. And my main problem I've had with all the past religions is just they've been,

40:24.000 --> 40:29.440
they're just really unfun. They just buy not all of them, but by and large, they're about

40:30.320 --> 40:36.160
no sex, no drinking or whatever, like just they're the antithesis of partying.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.480
And again, like, there are some good pockets within some of them. And I think those are the

40:40.480 --> 40:46.720
ones that, you know, have flourished for a while and so on. But clearly, it seems to be some part

40:46.720 --> 40:52.640
of the human spirit we want to worship. We want to think of something bigger than us. That to me

40:52.640 --> 40:58.640
is some evidence that there might be something bigger than us. And but regardless, like, why,

40:58.640 --> 41:05.760
you know, why not play into that? Why not use that? But at least, I mean, I've been thinking

41:05.760 --> 41:10.240
about this for a little while, I think there's, there's value in actually brainstorming,

41:10.960 --> 41:14.240
collectively, what would we want if we were to design a religion, what would it look like?

41:15.360 --> 41:20.560
I think it's worth certainly the viewers of rebel wisdom and people thinking about like,

41:20.560 --> 41:24.240
just spending some time to write down five things that they would like about religion or

41:24.240 --> 41:27.440
something like that. And then we hive mind it and see what comes.

41:27.520 --> 41:32.480
Yeah, I'll join right now. Straight up. Before it even gets developed. Yeah. Yeah,

41:32.480 --> 41:36.080
that it's a very it's an interesting one. It touches on something we've talked about as well,

41:36.080 --> 41:41.840
which is this sort of this strange relationship we now have with with rationality and reason and

41:41.840 --> 41:48.560
our understanding of of what that is. And our conception of ourselves as rational actors when

41:48.560 --> 41:54.480
we're we're sort of anything but and yet we do have this capacity to take a step back and be

41:54.480 --> 42:00.480
reasonable. I'm fascinated by that dynamic in particular and how it's how it's showing up

42:00.480 --> 42:05.360
culturally, you know, this sense of on every side of the political, let's say every tribe

42:05.360 --> 42:10.240
in the political spectrum, there seems to be this sense of, I feel like this, therefore,

42:10.240 --> 42:17.920
this is truth, whether it's in sort of successor ideology of progressives right now, or whether

42:17.920 --> 42:24.960
it's in the the kind of rabid certainty of, you know, some people on the right about their

42:24.960 --> 42:32.160
their own views. There's a sense of feeling an emotion overtaking our sensemaking. And I think

42:32.160 --> 42:39.520
often religion has been the necessary place to pour that energy with other people as well.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.760
Yeah. And so I think without it, we're, I mean, we've talked about this a lot, we're totally

42:43.840 --> 42:49.520
adrift in a hurricane. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'm I'm curious. And I think it'll be weird as hell,

42:49.520 --> 42:55.200
whatever, whatever emerges will be weird. Yeah. Yeah. So you actually, when we were talking before

42:55.200 --> 42:58.880
before this discussion, you actually introduced me to a concept I hadn't heard of before,

42:58.880 --> 43:04.800
which comes from, well, Scott Alexander popularized it, but it comes from an Allen Ginsburg poem

43:04.800 --> 43:10.480
originally. And before that is it, I think a believer Sumerian God, Canaanite God called

43:10.480 --> 43:16.000
Moloch, right? Yes. And I got quite excited when I came across this, and I'll talk about why in a

43:16.000 --> 43:20.480
bit first we should talk about what exactly it is it relates to complexity. And there's this

43:20.480 --> 43:25.200
other concept called Moloch. And yeah, what is it? Yes, I mean, you summarized where it's where it

43:25.200 --> 43:30.400
came from quite well, it was originally the, it's either the Canaanites or the Coffinogens,

43:30.400 --> 43:38.080
I don't know, but it was a God of war, that they supposedly sacrificed their children to

43:38.080 --> 43:42.560
by putting them into an oven and burning them so that Moloch would be happy and they'd win their

43:42.560 --> 43:49.600
wars. So really, that was dark as it gets. And then it became more popular when, when Allen

43:49.600 --> 43:55.600
Ginsburg wrote this amazing poem called, it's actually called Howl, talking about this thing

43:55.600 --> 44:01.520
that sounds sort of analogous to capitalism, making people mad. And then Scott Alexander

44:02.480 --> 44:08.800
really nailed it. But he wrote this unbelievable blog called Meditations on Moloch, which was

44:08.800 --> 44:12.640
the first time I've seen, basically, he's trying to analyze what Allen Ginsburg is talking about,

44:12.640 --> 44:18.080
this this sort of mechanistic thing. And what he really did for the first time was he related

44:18.080 --> 44:25.760
Moloch to game theory, and talked about how it seems to be this sort of the force. So again,

44:25.760 --> 44:30.960
if there's this force of something that's driving the, you know, emergence and complexity,

44:30.960 --> 44:37.760
there seems to be this opposing force, which is a force of destruction that sort of uses competition

44:37.760 --> 44:44.560
for ill. And, you know, the way the way I'm terming it, I'm doing a video series on this,

44:44.560 --> 44:51.040
and I'm terming it as basically Moloch is the God of unhealthy competition of negative sum games.

44:51.040 --> 44:55.920
So competitive interactions that make the world worse off for their existence, as opposed to

44:55.920 --> 45:02.160
being neutral or better, because games can be good or bad, you know. And, and so Moloch is kind

45:02.160 --> 45:08.160
of like this personification of that. But in reality, what it is is just this diet, there's

45:08.160 --> 45:14.480
like dumb blind force of like, evolution and economics, where basically you'll have these

45:16.640 --> 45:22.000
systems where individuals are incentivized to do sort of the selfish thing, kind of like a prisoner's

45:22.080 --> 45:28.640
dilemma, like a multi-person prisoner's dilemma, where they, everyone is individually incentivized

45:28.640 --> 45:35.120
to do the thing that will give them a short term gain. But if everyone does that, then everyone

45:35.120 --> 45:40.000
overall ends up worse off. So from, basically, from a God's eye view, everyone should do the

45:40.000 --> 45:44.560
cooperative thing. But in reality, because it's so hard to get so many people to coordinate,

45:45.600 --> 45:50.000
there's no way of enforcing it, then everyone ends up in a bad place. And that's, you know,

45:50.000 --> 45:56.080
it's called a multipolar trap, or a Moloch trap, as I like to call it. So yeah, that's kind of,

45:56.080 --> 46:01.520
it's kind of an abstract concept. But for simplicity, think of it as like the God of unhealthy,

46:01.520 --> 46:07.200
when competition goes wrong. Very cool. Yeah, that's a really cool explanation. And I like in

46:07.200 --> 46:12.480
that essay that he points out, it just takes one person to be a dickhead for in many of those

46:12.480 --> 46:17.200
multipolar traps, everyone's cooperating except for one person, and that can then... In the really

46:17.200 --> 46:22.800
bad ones, in the worst designed ones, like a good example would be like, you're at a stadium

46:24.560 --> 46:29.760
at a football game, and you're in a block, and everyone's sitting down at the start of the game.

46:31.040 --> 46:36.560
But then the team comes on, and someone at the very front gets excited and just wants a slightly,

46:36.560 --> 46:39.840
slightly better angle so they stand up, and then makes the person behind them stand up,

46:39.840 --> 46:45.840
and then the next person ends on. And everyone has to stand up now. And they're just stuck there,

46:46.480 --> 46:52.400
basically the system has fallen into this lower state where, yes, sure, you could quit the game

46:52.400 --> 46:56.240
by being like, I refuse to stand, I'm going to sit down, but now you don't get to see. So

46:56.800 --> 47:02.720
either way, you don't have a better strategy than the current one, which is now standing up.

47:02.720 --> 47:07.200
But if you could poll everybody, they would much rather everyone be sitting and have the

47:07.200 --> 47:14.480
same view, effectively. So yeah, that's just one example of where a poorly designed system,

47:15.120 --> 47:19.360
due to competitive dynamics, can have this like cascading effect where everyone ends up

47:19.360 --> 47:21.760
in this annoying situation where they'd rather not be.

47:22.560 --> 47:26.400
Yeah, and I think what's, I really love the concept, because I think one of the things that's

47:26.400 --> 47:33.600
useful about it is that in the various circles who are interested in changing the world in some way,

47:34.240 --> 47:39.920
changing the system, finding ways to create a better system, which is something I really also kind

47:40.000 --> 47:46.160
of identify with and I really care about a lot, there is often very little, it's often very meta,

47:46.160 --> 47:53.120
it's often like, it gets very zoomed out, and doesn't necessarily look at the forces acting

47:53.120 --> 47:57.520
again. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, right? And there's something about the concept.

47:57.520 --> 48:01.040
So I got really excited when you, sorry, when you introduced me to the concept, because I looked at

48:01.040 --> 48:06.880
the, you described it a bit, I read the Scott Alexander essay, and then I, for me, there was a

48:06.880 --> 48:10.960
lot of crossover with the model I'm really familiar with from, from mysticism, from the

48:10.960 --> 48:16.880
Gnostic Gospels. So the early Christians, well, arguably they weren't really that Christian, but

48:16.880 --> 48:20.640
some of them were a little bit more of kind of Hellenistic mystery tradition. So we're talking

48:20.640 --> 48:30.000
kind of maybe the third century, you know, second and third century. And they had this incredibly

48:30.000 --> 48:35.920
sophisticated model of, I would say a model of human psychology, of the human psyche. And they had a

48:36.000 --> 48:44.480
creation myth in which the earth is a living goddess, and the god of the Old Testament, Yahweh,

48:44.480 --> 48:50.160
is this kind of, this false god, which is just pure ego, right? And he kind of, he gets created

48:50.880 --> 48:55.840
by mistake by her. It's kind of complex why, but he's, they describe him as like an abortion,

48:55.840 --> 49:02.160
like he's, so she is a goddess and has the all the kind of divine creativity of a goddess, right?

49:02.160 --> 49:06.960
She's tapped into the sort of universal source of emergence, let's call it. And he comes along

49:06.960 --> 49:10.720
and he says, well, I'm the god of everything there is. And she's like, well, no, you're not,

49:10.720 --> 49:14.640
because you're not, you're not, you're almost like a cracked reflection. You're not even real,

49:14.640 --> 49:19.280
really. And it's interesting because the neuroscience of our egos has been argued that

49:20.000 --> 49:28.080
the, the narrating eye, our egos looking out for our own ends is a kind of conglomeration of many

49:28.080 --> 49:34.160
different aspects of our brain. And we kind of cobbled together a self from our essence. And so

49:34.160 --> 49:40.880
in a way, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that's exactly a lower complexity self. And in a way,

49:40.880 --> 49:45.040
it's real, but it's not real at the same time. So you have this dynamic there.

49:45.920 --> 49:52.240
And then they argued that when we, so human beings have that divine intentionality and

49:52.240 --> 49:58.960
that divine creativity. And also, though, we are very easily diluted by Yahweh and very easily

49:58.960 --> 50:05.040
diluted by the Archons, his sort of weird, mech, super weird cosmology they had, but like this

50:05.040 --> 50:10.800
kind of mechanistic self replicating almost like machine angels, right, really out there.

50:11.760 --> 50:17.600
So, so for the Gnostics, their argument was like, look, we see Yahweh or we say see Moloch and,

50:17.600 --> 50:21.920
you know, it's very similar in the systems that we're part of, we see it in the Romans,

50:21.920 --> 50:26.960
we see it in the tax collectors, we see it in the way that people replace the kind of

50:26.960 --> 50:31.440
hierarchies of nature, the natural hierarchies with fake human made hierarchies of society.

50:32.480 --> 50:36.560
And so they were sort of outsiders. And their argument was you have to tap into

50:37.280 --> 50:43.520
the deeper spiritual wisdom inside yourself, the Gnosis, in order to kind of liberate, they were

50:43.520 --> 50:47.760
like quite, you know, into like liberating yourself kind of quite psychedelic as well.

50:47.840 --> 50:53.280
And Carl Jung was a huge, like fan of the Gnostics, right? The two of the codices are called the

50:53.280 --> 50:57.680
Jung codices, because he bought them basically, he found them after they were discovered, the

50:57.680 --> 51:01.600
scrolls were discovered in a cave in the 1950s by two Egyptian farmers. It's crazy.

51:01.600 --> 51:06.160
This is amazing. That's a crazy cool story, yeah. And then the final bit of it, for me the

51:06.160 --> 51:12.960
synchronicity was that there's a book on Jung by Peter Kingsley, he's a classical scholar called,

51:13.040 --> 51:18.320
it's kind of, he's also kind of a mystic, which is called Katafalk. And he talks a lot in that

51:18.320 --> 51:24.480
book about this biblical, this kind of mystical tradition that he argues Jung was very familiar

51:24.480 --> 51:31.680
with, which is about prophecy. And the prophecy, a part of knowing who the prophet was was that

51:31.680 --> 51:36.240
they howled, right, which is the name of the Ginsburg poem. So I was like, oh, very cool.

51:36.240 --> 51:40.640
There's a lot, I know, right? There's a lot of, there's a lot of crossovers like everywhere.

51:40.640 --> 51:47.360
Yeah. And what I love about that is like, for me, I look at it like, I think they were, and Jung

51:47.360 --> 51:52.720
thought they were incredibly sophisticated, mappers of the conscious of human consciousness.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.640
But there's also some aspect to it, which can't be quite explained for me, which is that

51:57.360 --> 52:04.800
there is this, it does seem there is this entropic force that humans create that we create

52:04.800 --> 52:09.360
from our own, I don't know what your take on it is, is it do we create it from our own

52:09.360 --> 52:14.240
bad incentives that are built into us or? I don't think humans in particular create it.

52:14.240 --> 52:21.440
I think it's just, I mean, again, depending on sort of the mood of the day, like it almost

52:21.440 --> 52:28.240
feels like it's just like there are these two opposing types of forces going on within the

52:28.240 --> 52:35.360
universe, like deeply metaphysical forces, where, you know, it's not that it is entropy,

52:36.000 --> 52:40.800
but it's like it uses entropy to its advantage. It's basically a thing trying to,

52:43.440 --> 52:47.440
I don't know, but like, Mike is like, the way, the way I envision it, it's just like, you know,

52:47.440 --> 52:52.480
that feeling where you are playing something and you want to win so badly. And I know this,

52:52.480 --> 52:57.840
because I had this like pathologic, I was pathologically competitive as a kid. And it's

52:57.840 --> 53:04.160
like eyes on the prize, but to this like all consuming extent, and you can't see anything

53:04.160 --> 53:09.280
else, you can't see the externalities of what you do. And all you care about is this like,

53:10.080 --> 53:18.720
optimizing for this one narrow reward. And the byproduct of that is that if you play that out

53:18.720 --> 53:22.720
to its logical conclusion, it means that you will turn basically the everything into the

53:22.720 --> 53:26.400
universe into this one thing. So the ultimate instantiation of that is actually like the

53:26.400 --> 53:30.000
paperclip maximizer, right? Which is why when you mentioned the Gnostics talking about this

53:30.000 --> 53:32.720
like mechanization of all these many, many things of like the same thing.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.920
Could you describe what that is in case that someone isn't familiar with it?

53:35.920 --> 53:40.880
Yeah. So the paperclip maximizer is this, this thought experiment, I think by Eliezer Yudkowski

53:40.880 --> 53:47.760
of like, a way in a super intelligent AI could go wrong, whereby it's super intelligent in that

53:47.760 --> 53:55.200
it's unbelievably good at getting whatever it wants done done. But it's stupid into the extent that

53:55.200 --> 53:59.200
it was basically programmed to do this one narrow thing, which in this instance, you wanted to

53:59.280 --> 54:03.520
make paperclips. I just wanted my AI to make some more paperclips better than what I can

54:03.520 --> 54:08.880
currently do. I'm a paperclip maker. But because it's so unbelievably good, it turns everything

54:08.880 --> 54:13.760
from, you know, the factory it's in, it figures out how to pull the constituent parts of the

54:13.760 --> 54:18.960
atoms, the blood, you know, the hemoglobin in your blood, the iron extracts it and, you know,

54:18.960 --> 54:22.960
dismantles everything until it can tie all the entire universe, anything it can in the universe

54:22.960 --> 54:30.160
into paperclips. Why? Because basically, it was so laser focused eyes on the prize, winning

54:30.160 --> 54:35.120
the goal of making as many paperclips, that you end up dismantling the universe into this

54:35.680 --> 54:42.880
very low complexity state. So it's effectively like kind of a, it's analogous a little bit to,

54:42.880 --> 54:47.440
you know, the heat death of the universe. Because what is that? It's actually a very low complexity

54:47.440 --> 54:52.720
state. Where basically, it's just like, how would you describe it? Well, it's just homogenous

54:52.720 --> 54:58.320
gray soup. You know, that's all it is. The universe started out very low complexity in that it was

54:58.320 --> 55:04.000
kind of like this singularity of matter and energy. But you know, if we're talking in terms of

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
Korma-Garov complexity, which is like basically how many, how many bits of code do you need to

55:10.000 --> 55:16.880
describe a thing? It started at the universe, started out pretty simple. And then time started

55:17.280 --> 55:21.280
and things started unfolding. And suddenly we, you know, we've started seeing hydrogen and

55:21.280 --> 55:26.560
then helium. And that would coalesce into stars, which created greater, heavier elements. And all

55:26.560 --> 55:31.440
this beautiful complexity started emerging, patternicity. There's like dance between order and

55:31.440 --> 55:36.960
disorder, you know, with like a bit of hierarchy, but a bit of anarchy and so on that creates this

55:36.960 --> 55:44.480
like highly complex dynamic system that's very hard to describe. Like to write the piece of code,

55:44.560 --> 55:49.840
to describe the universe, you basically have to just create the universe. That's what a highly

55:49.840 --> 55:57.360
complex system is. And, but at some point, the stars will die out and so on, all this sort of

55:57.360 --> 56:01.920
free energy that is used to create all this complexity will start dissipating. And then it'll

56:01.920 --> 56:08.560
slowly, as far as we know, turn into this gray soup, which is low complexity. So it'll do this,

56:09.120 --> 56:20.000
entropy will do this over time. And so, yeah, so this like this gray soup is kind of analogous to,

56:20.000 --> 56:25.280
in my opinion, like what a paperclip maximizer would would do. It's not a very, basically,

56:25.280 --> 56:30.160
it's permanently curtailing, you know, there's no more complexity to to arise. The universe has

56:30.160 --> 56:38.160
reached this steady state. And that is, you know, it seems like a tragedy on enormous potential

56:38.240 --> 56:43.040
because at least up until now, it seems like the universe is trying to emerge into greater and

56:43.040 --> 56:47.760
greater states of complexity. So I hate to boil it down to like good and evil terms. But

56:48.960 --> 56:56.000
to me, good is that which creates, you know, allows for greater emergence and complexity

56:56.000 --> 57:01.600
to appear and thereby utility, you know, useful information that we can process and do and make

57:01.600 --> 57:07.840
wonderful things with. And evil is that which does the opposite. In other words, like turns

57:07.840 --> 57:14.640
things into this like low diversity, low, like high, you know, like very basic situation,

57:14.640 --> 57:19.440
whether it's, you know, a cloud of hydrogen, which in the mountain, the, the, the howl poem he

57:20.320 --> 57:26.720
and Ginsberg describes Moloch as Moloch, who is a cloud of sex as hydrogen. So it's like this,

57:26.720 --> 57:30.400
yeah, it's like this kind of a force of entropy, but slightly different because entropy is actually

57:30.400 --> 57:36.000
just kind of neutral. Entropy is just like time effectively. Whereas Moloch is a thing that turns

57:36.000 --> 57:41.680
everything into this like one mono focus of sacrificing everything in order to win this one

57:41.680 --> 57:47.520
thing. Hence the like child sacrifice. Brilliant. Yeah. It's so I think it's a really, really

57:48.320 --> 57:52.480
excited to introduce this model into kind of, you know, into the channel and like our thinking

57:52.480 --> 57:57.280
in general, because I think there's, there's something I don't quite know what, and I think

57:57.280 --> 58:00.560
this is the journey you're on, right? Like there's something in it, right? There's something in it.

58:00.560 --> 58:05.120
Well, so the current thing I'm trying to figure out right now. And I mean, a lot of this again is

58:05.120 --> 58:10.000
like a sort of an offshoot from conversations with Daniel Schmacktenberger, Forest Landry as well.

58:10.960 --> 58:19.440
But I don't think so like Moloch is tied to the competition, right? But competition gone wrong.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.800
But competition can also be an enormous force for good. Because actually, like,

58:26.080 --> 58:30.560
you know, the capitalistic model has risen the world to what it is right now. Like we would not

58:30.560 --> 58:36.880
be living the cushy life with our, you know, nice cameras in this cool room and so on without the,

58:37.760 --> 58:43.840
a lot of the luxuries that capitalism has provided. And in its best form, capitalism is,

58:43.840 --> 58:48.000
you know, it's like a positive sum game. It's using competition in order to like

58:48.000 --> 58:54.080
drive progress faster than it would without and creating these novel things that arguably wouldn't

58:54.080 --> 59:00.720
exist without it. So it seems to be that there's like some kind of optimal

59:02.000 --> 59:07.920
amount of competition, like zero sum type competition that we would want within the

59:07.920 --> 59:12.480
universe, but kind of just like encapsulated in little pockets, you know, constrained in certain

59:12.480 --> 59:18.720
ways, whereby Moloch can't get his dirty claws into it and like turn it, turn the whole, you know,

59:18.720 --> 59:25.280
twist it into something bad. And again, like we, because a lot of, you know, a lot of people

59:25.280 --> 59:30.400
are like, no, we just need pure, pure cooperation. Pure cooperation is all we ever want. No competition

59:30.400 --> 59:36.320
whatsoever. But that's a lower complexity state than a universe that has mostly competition,

59:36.320 --> 59:40.480
as I mostly cooperation, with little pockets of competition driving, driving it forward,

59:40.480 --> 59:47.120
but in just like delicately constrained ways. So I'm trying to, it is very much just a working,

59:47.120 --> 59:51.840
you know, a thing I'm just playing with, but there seems like there's something to that.

59:52.640 --> 59:59.680
It's like a higher order level of complexity where you're using games in a beneficial way

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.840
without letting them get too out of control. Yeah, it's very interesting. I mean, what comes up

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:11.680
for me is something around intention and values, right, on the individual level, because so to

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:22.160
to use that Gnostic model again, another aspect of it was that the the issue is the ego disconnected

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.320
from the self in Jungian terms. So we all have an ego, we need one. That's great. I consider myself

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:36.800
very competitive, like, but there's also a question of priorities. And would I be competitive at the

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.280
expense of, say someone else's well being, or would I decide to be competitive instead of

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.000
loving my wife, right, if it was the trade off, which one of those priority, which one of those

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.400
are hiring my value system. So there's something about that going on, I think, which then applies

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.360
right back to the game theory examples, because in Scott Alexander's essay, you know, he ends each

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.560
of those examples with like, but from a God's eye view, if we all cooperated, better outcomes for

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.480
everyone. And what I find interesting about, yeah, so that Gnostic model saw saw the ego

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.880
disconnected from the self as unable to create anything truly novel, because all it can do

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:21.680
is replicate. And what it does, so we have that God and we have Mother Earth Gaia, or Sophia,

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.360
they called her. So that's kind of divine creativity that each human has. But when the ego

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.000
is disconnected from the self, it can't do anything except mimic that divine creativity. So and what

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.480
it ends up doing is creating like a Disneyland reality that looks real, but isn't real. Nothing's

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.280
authentic. Everything is skin deep. Think of kind of reality TV, for example, there's so many aspects

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.800
of our culture. I read a great essay, which I'll put in the show, it's about solar punk and the

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.160
author talked talked about, we've run out of authentic things to frack from our cultures, and

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.480
now we're fracking our own future, you know, fracking our idea of the future just to get some

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:06.160
that extractive thing. And then I guess it also goes to the idea of sociopathy and psychopathy

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.280
and Machiavellianism, which is this kind of dark triad in psychology. And, you know, I've

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.560
heard Daniel Schmackenberg and many others in this space talking about that being a major problem

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.080
when you're trying to create cohesion and cooperation is like the sociopath problem,

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.960
because a sociopath or a narcissist looks like they care about other people, but they do not

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.360
care at all. They don't have empathy, but they're mimicking empathy. And it is insanely destructive

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.440
because how do we cooperate when that's in the mix? I don't even know if it's that they don't

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.360
have empathy. I think often psychopaths do have empathy, because empathy is just being able to

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.520
put yourself and like, you know, like feel what someone else is feeling. And a truly powerful

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.360
psychopath is someone who would be able to actually really feel what you're feeling, but then just

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.760
not actually give a shit about what happens to you. And like, they're doing something that will

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:04.400
be ultimately self-serving at the expense of you. But yeah, that's probably a good distinction to make.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.560
And an unsolved problem, I think, in terms of, okay, we want to find new ways to cooperate,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.520
we want to find new ways to kind of build a sustainable future. How do we deal with that

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.160
problem? I mean, it's a really, on the game theory level, it's fascinating. I'm just on the kind of

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.280
like being a human being level. It's such a big question. I mean, yeah, it's about building robust

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.640
systems whereby a few defectors, you know, of people playing this multi-person prisoner's

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.440
dilemma, where the system can sustain, you know, having a few people do it, because I think it's

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.200
going to be next to impossible to ever have everyone working purely cooperatively, purely like,

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.600
and I'm speaking from really a personal level here, because I was on a game show, which was the

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.840
prisoner's dilemma to an extent. And it was, you know, it was a one time one. And I did the,

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.400
you know, I defected. I did the selfish thing by, you know, doing the clearly dominant strategy

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.760
in terms of winning money, which was my goal on the thing. I went in and I was like, I need to win

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:05.200
money. So I did the selfish thing. But man, like, I'm still getting hate messages from that today,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.400
like 14 years later. What was the game show? It's called Golden Balls. It's on YouTube. I hate it.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:20.000
And you're worth watching. Did you win? I won. Yeah. I mean, I played it. I played the game

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.040
perfectly from a, if you're optimizing for the value of winning money. But that's again,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.840
it's this bigger question of like, what are the externalities to this? Overall, you know, I was

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.280
doing the sort of the, yeah, I was doing the strategically, I picked the game theory optimal

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.760
solution within the definitions of the game. But outside of that, there's other externalities

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.280
about the value of cooperation, the value of not looking someone in the eye and saying,

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.800
yeah, I'm going to split this with you. And then actually stealing it, you know, and

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.040
and it taught me like a really important lesson of thinking about the externalities of whatever

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.320
it is we do. And so, but what we need really is to build a system that is robust enough,

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:07.760
complex enough, but in the right way, where it minimized where the amount of externalities

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:13.280
any one individual can do, negative externalities, any one individual can do are contained and

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.200
constrained. And I don't know how we do that, but we have to find a way. Yeah, so it's a really

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:25.040
good point. I think an example I've used before is the, how the US Constitution was made, because

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.040
they did a quite good job. Obviously, not perfect, but quite good job of thinking. Yeah,

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.360
really credit at the time of creating an antifragile system with that in mind, because they were

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.320
focused on how do you prevent tyranny. And the process whereby they went through it was,

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.760
you know, in part the federalist papers, we're just writing to each other constantly being like,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.760
well, what if someone does this, like, oh, shit, yeah, what if someone does that? Yeah,

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.080
stress testing constantly. And I think, I mean, that's probably a good place for us all to start

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.560
is just to kind of, yeah, start having that conversation, which I think a lot of people

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.720
already having and start to kind of stress testing. And now we have the luxury of being

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.120
able to actually make models and play them out. Like, we can, you know, there's like,

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:09.120
I think, you know, game designers, et cetera, a lot of people out there who can go, okay, well,

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.600
let's let's put it in a simulation and see what happens, you know, that's really exciting to me.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:19.360
Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, that's exactly as they're, the blessing and curse of technology is that

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:26.480
technology is particularly exponential ones are making Moloch's life much easier to,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.400
to destroy the universe. But at the same time, we're also building technologies that

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.400
enable cooperation better coordinate, you know, the ability to coordinate with one another.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.200
You know, like a simple internet forum, it's just such a valuable thing that like just never

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.720
existed before. You know, it's not only because it's a way of sharing information across multiple

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.920
minds, across time, not just in the moment, but also storing it so that new people can come in

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.400
and retroactively go back and learn and then like, and now add something new and so on.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.560
So when we were prepping this interview, you mentioned like quite a few different things

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.560
you're doing, which sound very exciting. And I think our viewers will be quite interested in.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.000
So, and you also have a YouTube channel, which I think is where they're going to be coming.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.720
Yes. And as a reminder, you're appearing and our state of sense making free event at the end of

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.880
September. So people can check you out there. But we'll put your YouTube info below in the

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.080
show notes and maybe you could tell us a little bit about like what's coming up, like what you're

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.880
working on. Yeah. I've been down the rabbit hole on this like Molek concept and to an extent complexity.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:33.920
So yeah, making a series, trying to pick apart what Molek is and also bring it to life. I do

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.280
some acting in it for the first time, which is weird. I dress up. It's a whole thing. But

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.000
a lot of it relates very tightly to what we've talked about today. So yeah, people enjoyed

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.600
this, then they should check it out. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. So yeah, subscribe

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:55.280
to live. We'll put the your different social handles down the show notes and thank you so much

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.840
for coming on. Thanks for having me. This is awesome. Our ability to make sense of the world

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.280
is breaking down. We're making more and more consequential choices with worse and worse sense

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:12.000
making to inform those choices, which is kind of running increasingly fast through the woods

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.280
increasingly blind. Over the last two years, Rebel Wisdom has interviewed some of the world's top

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:24.480
thinkers. Now we've brought them together for an eight week online course, Sense Making 101,

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:32.720
with Daniel Schmacktenberger, Diane Mushow-Hamilton, John Vivecchi, and more. Improve your sense making,

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:40.960
develop your sovereignty, and join a wider community looking to do the same.
