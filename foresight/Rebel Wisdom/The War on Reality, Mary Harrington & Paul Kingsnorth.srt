1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,760
This is the first ever conversation between two of my favourite cultural commentators,

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,720
the writers Paul Kingsnorth and Mary Harrington, and it's all about the overlaps between their

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,200
thought and their analysis of what we're calling the war on reality.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,520
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine, all the time in the writing I'm doing at the

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,600
moment. It's not my word, I've stolen from writers like D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,560
and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years. And

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm really talking about this giant techno industrial monstrosity that is in our heads

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,520
and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,280
project of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,960
God and consequently we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,880
within that. I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of what you call the

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,200
machine, Paul, wants to turn everything into standing reserve. It wants to enclose everything.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,520
It started with the commons and then it started patenting things and now it's moving on to

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,560
patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences. I invited them to dialogue because I had an

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,360
intuition they'd be able to go deep together. And this went even better than I expected.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,600
I think it's a really important development in the cultural conversation and I'll come back

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:38,280
and explain why at the end. So, hope you enjoy it. Paul Kings North, Mary Harrington, welcome.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,480
Thanks for having me. Good to be here. So, this is, I believe, the first time that you

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,640
both have been in dialogue with each other. You've both written for Unheard. So, you've been

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,680
in the same online magazine and there's a lot of overlaps between your thinking. So,

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm really looking forward to this conversation. And as I thought maybe it'd be good to start maybe

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,120
with asking you each, because I know you've both been looking forward to being in dialogue with

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,320
each other, what it is that you are looking forward to talking about and what you find

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,200
interesting in each other's thought before we dive into some of the topics we prepared.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,800
I like Paul's conception of the machine. I'd be happy to talk about that for an hour and a half.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,560
Yeah, I mean, I think we're coming at the same thing from a different perspective actually. I

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,240
really like, I love the notion of reactionary feminism actually. Apart from being a great catch

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,960
phrase, it actually really opens up a lot of really necessary questions about and not just about

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,200
women's issues either, but just broadly about limits and the body and nature.

30
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, you get it. You get it, you see.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,320
I do get it because you're coming from a feminist perspective at the same sort of stuff I think

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm writing about from whatever perspective I write. The moment you start thinking about reactionary

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,640
feminism, you realise it's reactionary eco-feminism and then you're away.

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,840
Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose what I would say I'm coming from, I suppose, is my background as

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,400
a former environmental activist, somebody who writes and thinks about the natural world a lot,

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,520
and you don't have to do that for very long before you realise that obviously we're

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,600
intimately a part of it. And the whole thing is a question of limits and whether or not we can

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,160
break them. And then the questions about the body and the questions about women's and men's bodies

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,000
and the questions about the reality of being human and the questions about rainforests and

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,520
climate change turn out to be the same questions, which is how we live within limits.

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
Good, well, that's it. We've dealt with everything.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,520
So that's good. Thanks, David.

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
Great. Mary and Paul, thank you very much.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,520
Yeah, that's it. That's the tweet. That's what it says.

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,080
Yeah, that's a really great introduction. And as you said, Paul, that the idea is

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,280
that somehow the modern world seems to be in conflict with itself, or at least with the

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,920
natural world. And this is something you've touched on in your writing, and Mary, you've touched on

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,480
as well. Could we start by framing that? How do you see that from the sort of biggest picture?

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine all the time in the writing I'm doing

50
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,360
at the moment. It's not my word. I've stolen from writers like D. H. Lawrence and George Orwell

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,040
and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years.

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,120
And I'm really talking about this giant techno-industrial monstrosity that is in our heads

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,600
and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the project

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,560
of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on God. And consequently,

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,680
we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place within that.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,360
And we've decided that through the use of technology, science and reason, we can effectively

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,440
build a new world which doesn't seem to limit us in any way. And we've decided that any limits at

58
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,520
all, whether they're the limits that our body provides or the limits that the natural world

59
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,800
provides us with or even the limits of our behaviour towards each other, are disgraceful

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,720
chains that prevent us from being free and rational in the individuals. And so I think it's a big,

61
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,000
it's just a very big, very old way of seeing that is manifesting itself in silicon and plastic

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,600
all around us. And as I say, coming at that from the perspective of an environmentalist or a former

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,720
one, what I saw was the green movement being entirely sucked into this way of seeing. And I

64
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,160
became, I became a greener years ago because I was entranced by the smallest beautiful model that

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,960
the Greens used to believe in in the 70s. When I was a little boy, you know, the world of EF Schumacher

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,760
and Leopold Korr and Gandhi and Tolstoy and everyone else who told us to live within natural

67
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,120
limits in a way that would actually be nourishing to us. And the green movement instead brought

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,160
into this machine thinking in which it saw climate change and other issues as technological

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,520
problems to be solved with more technology, all of which sucks us into the same project of busting

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,160
down limits. So now environmentalism has become a question of how many wind farms you can get up

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,520
and whether you should use nuclear power and GM crops, whether you should do X, Y and Z to effectively

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,320
create a quote, sustainable limitless machine world. All paths kind of lead back to this

73
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,600
modern way of seeing almost every question. I mean, Mary comes at this from, from, from as far as I

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,920
can see from the angle of, you know, from the feminist angle, but as she says, it's, it's the

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,160
same question, actually, you can just approach it in from all of your different sort of personal

76
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,960
perspectives. And it all leads you back to this attitude we have to nature and human nature.

77
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Yeah, I agree. I suppose I sort of come, I found myself coming at it from the perspective

78
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,000
of the things that you can't say from within that model, and rather direct experience, particularly

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,400
of what it is about being a mother that you can't put into words from within the model.

80
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,600
And I've theorized, I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of, you know,

81
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,040
what you call the machine pool. See, it wants to turn everything into standing reserve, you know,

82
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,840
it wants to, it wants to enclose everything, you know, it started with the commons and then it

83
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,960
started patenting things and now it's moving on to patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences

84
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,280
and you know, but it wants to, it wants to move things from being naturally occurring to biosemiotic,

85
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,360
you know, relationships with one another to being inert resources that can be instrumentalized

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,680
and ideally commodified and turned into, turned into something that can be used for something

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,320
and sort of unmoored from its relational context. That's the basic movement, unmoor something from

88
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,320
its relational context and then turn it into things which can be traded back and forth in a

89
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,360
sort of liquid and limitless way. So if that's the basic model, the problem with that from the

90
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,760
perspective of a feminist and a mother is that everything that matters, everything that's important

91
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,800
about being a mother is impossible, you can't, is not visible within that model. Because all

92
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,200
of mothering is about pattern and all of mothering is about repetition, you know, it's about, it's

93
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,600
about showing up for your baby every day in all the little ways that are important because the

94
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,080
baby's completely dependent on you and all the, all the things which are nice about it are impossible

95
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,320
to frame in those, in terms of the machine because they can't be commodified. I mean, you know, it's

96
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,880
easy to sort of wax sentimental about your baby's first laugh. But yeah, I think a lot of mothers

97
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,200
will relate to the experience of getting to the end of the day and having had actually a lovely day,

98
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,960
but then somebody asks them, oh, what did you do today? And you, you, you can't say,

99
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,520
you just can't sum it up because you did stuff and you were there and it was in the moment and

100
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,760
just the, the day went by and bits of it were probably really boring. But if you try and explain

101
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,240
it to somebody from, from the perspective that's outside the relationship and that sort of dynamic

102
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,400
business of kind of sustaining a tiny dependent person, if you like, with the, with the energy and

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,520
with your own body and your own way of being in the world. And you try and explain that sort of

104
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,240
dynamic activity to somebody who isn't part of it and who isn't within those relationships with you,

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,080
they'll just be like, well, that sounds pretty dull and repetitive. And it kind of is, you know,

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,680
I mean, if you have a, if you have a functioning brain and an education, it does get boring after

107
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,320
a bit, but it's also really important and it's also really lovely. And I mean, this is, you know,

108
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,320
as somebody with a functioning brain and an education and also a deep, deep love of my

109
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,960
daughter, these are all things which I've kind of wrestled with and found myself theorizing as

110
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,720
well as doing. And I've, and I've come to realize that it's, it's another, it's another angle on

111
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,280
the same problem that I think Paul is wrestling with, which is about how the things, the things

112
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,600
which matter and the things which sustain us and the things which are meaning making and the

113
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,680
things which are genuinely sustainable and create sustainable life in relation to other life are

114
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,240
all pattern based. Then none of them are, none of them are information based, they're all meaning

115
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,280
based. And information, if you like, is blind to meaning, because meaning, meaning in here's in

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,160
pattern and repetition and the everyday and the ordinary and the relational. And the moment you

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,960
turn it into standing reserve, the moment you enclose it, instrumentalize it and send it out

118
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,720
as inert stuff to be liquefied in one sort of a market or another, it becomes information and it

119
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,600
stops being meaningful. The moment you commodify a child that, I mean, you understand, you understand

120
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,320
where I'm going. Yeah, and we are there, aren't we? We are pretty much commodifying children

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,120
already. We are literally commodifying children as a whole. There are rows and rows of cots in

122
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,000
bombshells as in Ukraine, where children which were commissioned by parents elsewhere in a rented

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,520
uterus are waiting for their commissioning parents to come and collect them. I say parents in the

124
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,480
loosest possible sense. This is not, this is not a form of parenthood, which I recognize as such.

125
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,160
But yes, we are commodifying children at this point.

126
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,800
We're commodifying everything and I think that the notion of enclosure is really important. I

127
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,680
keep coming back to this one as well, again and again and again. I mean, you could argue that

128
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,280
this whole process begins literally with the enclosures, land enclosures in Britain from, say,

129
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,160
the 15th century onwards. And, you know, global capitalism, if you like, global industrialism

130
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,160
is a process of enclosing everything. So you start off with the land, then you go on to the workers,

131
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,720
then you go on to the human body, you go on to the natural world. Everything's enclosed.

132
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,880
And it's also a process of making everybody rootless and making everything rootless. It's about,

133
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,440
if Mary talks about relationships, I suppose I talk about roots, which is pretty much a different

134
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,200
way of saying the same thing. If you're rooted in a place, if you're rooted in your relationship

135
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,400
with a family, if you're rooted in your own body, if you're rooted in the environment around you,

136
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,600
then you have something which, as Mary says, you can't actually commodify. You can't commodify that

137
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:46,360
sense of being. Well, you can, and they do. But in the real sense of what it actually means to be

138
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,280
human, it's not measurable. But everything has to be measurable in the age of the machine. It has to

139
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,800
be measurable. It has to be commodifiable. It has to be profitable. Because that's the only way we

140
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,640
can measure whether we're progressing. And of course, we must always progress towards something

141
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,320
better by enclosing and by uprooting and by turning everything into a standing reserve. And that

142
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,600
actually breaks the business of being human in the world. It breaks, I mean, you talk a lot about

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,400
sense making, David, and you can't sense make it. If you can't make sense of any of these

144
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,760
relationships, if they've been broken, and I do think that so much of the kind of madness in the

145
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,240
culture at the moment, apart from being driven by social media, is also just actually being driven

146
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,640
by the destruction of things which, for millennia, we've thought were completely normal, including

147
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,320
what motherhood is and what fatherhood is and what families are and what it means to be in a place.

148
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,600
All of this kind of stuff that nobody had to question much. Now suddenly, everything has to

149
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,120
be questioned. And there aren't really answers, because it doesn't make sense.

150
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah, I want to, it's a good question. And I wonder whether this is going to help make more

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,800
sense or less sense, bringing in the sort of metaphysical dimension, because you both talk

152
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,800
about this. And the concept that people may or may not be familiar with the kind of

153
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,240
Gnosticism, the idea that this is a very deep-rooted pattern of thinking where the real world is

154
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,960
somehow fake, is somehow kind of an illusion, and actually, there's a sort of inner essence that

155
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,440
is real, is sort of very much mimicked. I think both of you have referred to this in your writings,

156
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,800
is kind of mimicked in the way that our attitude to the world now seems to be. And so I wonder,

157
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,720
do you think that kind of, I'd love to hear about the sort of the metaphysical frame that you

158
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,200
are both bringing, and also whether you think that that kind of makes things more intelligible or

159
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,400
less? I've used the phrase fully automated luxury Gnosticism. With a slightly flippantly,

160
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,480
I've borrowed it from Aaron Bastani's book, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, where he imagines that

161
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,600
actually left wing utopia is going to be attained by the automation of everything, presumably the

162
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,120
liquefaction translation of everything into standing reserve, which is just going to bring

163
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,440
about a world of eternal abundance for everyone somehow. With apologies to Bastani, I've not

164
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,400
actually read the book, but I gather that that's the gist of it, Fully Automated Luxury Communism,

165
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:13,240
so I borrowed that for Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, which is, well, I don't believe it's

166
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:21,080
coming, but I think it's an aspiration which is being sold to us, of which the reality is perhaps

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,680
less appealing. If you like, it's Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism is this kind of high sounding

168
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,400
promise that we're all going to be able to escape the constraints of our body into something

169
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,680
into a miraculous world where really we can do anything, whether that's the metaverse and

170
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,960
with a haptic interface that means somehow we can see and feel and touch and taste

171
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,560
things in this imaginary digitally constructed world, and we'll never actually need to have any

172
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,360
kind of reference back to what's happening in our physical, in the physical plane at all.

173
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,480
Or, you know, any number of other sort of techno fixes for the problems of materiality and the

174
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,880
problems of embodiment. I suppose it's one of those things where I sort of mean first and ask

175
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,360
questions later or decide what it is I mean by it later. Well, I mean, you often end up, I mean,

176
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,040
I started, I did that with reactionary feminism as well, and it's completely turned into a thing.

177
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,600
So sometimes, sometimes it's just good to go, it's good to walk backwards for a bit and see

178
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,920
where you end up. So yeah, I mean, but Paul, Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, you know,

179
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,400
can we, can we fully automate it? How luxurious would it be? You know, how Gnostic is it?

180
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,440
It is interesting that there's the notion of Gnosticism is floating around a bit at the moment.

181
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,320
So historically, the Gnostic movement was a sort of very loose collection of beliefs that were

182
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,480
around in the early centuries of the Christian church. And the Christian church declared them

183
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,800
heretical because effectively Gnosticism says, as you suggest, David, that this world is either,

184
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,440
is either fake or it's something to be transcended. So what you do with, I mean, Gnosis literally means

185
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,200
knowledge. It means a kind of secret knowledge. So the Gnostic movement is, is promoted and still

186
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,440
promotes actually the idea that you can escape the body and the physical realm if you have the

187
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,400
right kind of secret knowledge. And the Christians said and say that this is a heresy because

188
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,080
Christianity is embodied, just as Christ was a kind of melding of the human and the divine.

189
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,440
That's what we are. And so Christianity is not the Christian claim is not that we're going to

190
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,600
escape from physical reality and float off to somewhere better. It's that physical reality

191
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,720
can be transformed. Whereas the Gnostic say, no, this is basically a hell. And the Gnostic tradition

192
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,200
also has the has this great notion of the demiurge. There's an evil being who thinks he's God,

193
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,840
and he is the one who has created matter. And so matter is inherently evil. And so the human

194
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,440
spirit is a divine spark trapped in matter and we want to escape from it back to the back to the

195
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,920
place where we belong. So it's not much of a leap from that to Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse.

196
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,840
It's not much of a leap from that to what Silicon Valley is doing. I mean, openly doing and openly

197
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,680
talking about which is attempting to transcend the messy horribleness of physical reality so

198
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,240
that we don't have to die so that we don't have to give birth so that we don't have to be the sex

199
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,560
that we were born so that we don't have to be anything that's actually relational and anything

200
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,120
that limits what we imagine our free will is. This is my daughter visiting the podcast there

201
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,760
because it's so interesting. Yeah, so that's I mean, and it is exactly that that's the Gnostic

202
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,480
promise today. And it's it's the notion that the physical reality of stuff is escapable. But this

203
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,000
time we're not doing it through secret Gnostic religious knowledge, we're doing it through

204
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,200
technology, which is our equivalent of that. And it's no joke to say that this is exactly where

205
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,720
the project is headed. You only have to listen to Ray Kurzweil speaking or any of these other

206
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,560
guys in Silicon Valley, Elon Musk or any of them, they're very open about this. It's the

207
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,720
great dream of where we're supposed to end up. And I think Mary's right, we're not going to get

208
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,240
there because of all sorts of actual physical realities that are going to get in the way.

209
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,800
But I think we're going to do a lot of damage as we attempt to. And I also think it's an elite

210
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,040
project, you know, it's not something that's available to the majority of humanity. This is,

211
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,840
you know, this is something you do in your New Zealand bunker, primarily.

212
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,600
Well, there are some there are deep photographs doing the rounds of people where, you know,

213
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,120
homeless guys with metaverse golfers on. And actually, that's good. It's egalitarian at least.

214
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,120
Right. Right. Right. Also an incredibly bleak advert for the metaverse itself,

215
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,480
which I think accidentally says the quiet part out loud, where some washed up old dog who used

216
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,800
to have a great life being the life and soul of the party or, you know, loved and surrounded by

217
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,480
friends and is now lonely and, you know, doesn't live on his own and miserable and, you know,

218
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,240
but basically has a crap life and comes into the metaverse and just makes it all come back again,

219
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,600
but fictionally and digitally created. And that's a happy ending to the story.

220
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Well, in fact, what the advert is saying very clearly is if you have a shit life,

221
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,240
come and sit in the metaverse and you can pretend it's not so shit.

222
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,840
You know what it always strikes good news apparently.

223
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,360
Yeah, I mean, this is like the matrix written from the point of view of a script in which

224
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,040
Agent Smith is the good guy, isn't it? This is where we are. We've been 20 years on,

225
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,840
we're 20 years on and we've just we're telling the same story, but now it's good news. Yeah.

226
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,040
And as you said, I don't actually think we're going to get there because it's somebody still

227
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,680
has to take the bins out, bluntly. I mean, this again is the feminist point. You know,

228
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,200
somebody still has to do the dishes. And even if it's a machine does the dishes,

229
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,280
someone still has to unload the dishwasher. You know, so it is eventually titles all the way

230
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,600
down. Somebody still has to grow the food. And all of and even if you build robots to grow the food,

231
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,920
somebody's got to service the robots. And then somebody's got to do the dishes for them somewhere

232
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,560
at the bottom is somebody doing the dishes. And they're probably not in the metaverse while they're

233
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,320
doing the dishes. So yeah, it's an elite project at the end of the day. And someone somewhere

234
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,960
is cleaning up the rubbish that's left behind after the big party.

235
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,160
Yeah, and you had a really interesting insight as well that there's a kind of the memetic warfare

236
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,720
that goes alongside of the information warfare that goes alongside it seems to be more and more

237
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:37,320
about any kind of hint of fixity or reality is now called essentialism is now kind of to be

238
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,920
attacked memetically, I guess. And that that I find a really interesting development.

239
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,840
Not just essentialism, it's fascism. To state that limits exist and continue to exist,

240
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,520
no matter how hard you push against them is is now is now framed straightforwardly as fascist.

241
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,280
You know, even if you're just observing something which is there, you know,

242
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,320
the act of noticing it is makes you crypto fascist.

243
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,960
Yeah, it's a very, very interesting one. There's this whole notion of essentialism,

244
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,760
which has become such a boo word on the left. And as Mary says, very quickly becomes an accusation

245
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,920
of fascism. Apart from being a stupid representation of actually what fascism is, it's just very,

246
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,960
it's very telling that the people who use that language who always self titled progressives

247
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,120
believe that as you say, any any kind of limits, any kind of actual roots in the natural world

248
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,200
is is not only evil, but it's somehow associated with like the worst political project in human

249
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,400
history. And it's, you know, it's not it's not just it's not even just a smear, it's like there's

250
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,680
a real belief in this, you know, there's there's a real sense that if you are talking about limits

251
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,840
being either even real or beneficial, or having to live within say your own body or live with the

252
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,720
natural world as it is or whatever it is, then you are somehow pushing at the door of some kind of

253
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,120
yeah, vicious ethnocentric racial warfare or whatever it is. And it's like it's almost like

254
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,280
people have had their minds bent by the machine to believe that if you actually have to live within

255
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,200
the God given limits of nature, or if you use a phrase like that, then, you know, you're such a

256
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
troubling person that you have to be removed. So who's left? The only people who are left are

257
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,960
people who believe there are no limits at all. And in this kind of merger of, I suppose, progressive

258
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,880
left ideology and machine Gnosticism, it's very weird. And it's happening very quickly as well.

259
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,480
And it's almost impossible in some cases to have conversations, you know, about this without, as

260
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:46,600
Mary says, having the having the F word thrown at you, which is, yeah, again, I think in other

261
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,440
in other maybe more sane parts of the world and in other more sane times, these conversations

262
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,640
are possible, they were possible five years ago, 10 years ago, you know, you could sit around talking

263
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,760
about all this Huxley. And there would be no problem. But suddenly, it's accelerated into a

264
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,800
very strange place. I mean, it does. It depends a little bit where you stand and who you're

265
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,760
speaking to. I think just a very immediate example, my very good friend, Louise Perry,

266
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,320
who's recently written a book about the case against the sexual revolution,

267
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,480
when which she argues from her background is as a broadly left liberal feminist,

268
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,960
who's sort of but but working, but worked in a rape shelter and left her questioning a lot of

269
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,440
a lot of what she had internalized about what the sexual revolution meant, who it was for,

270
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,320
and what it was actually doing. And so she's written a whole book about her perspective on

271
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,320
this with chapter titles that I would think sort of would have been, as you say, five years ago,

272
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,560
very difficult to argue with, like loveless sex is not empowering, people are not commodities,

273
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,920
you know, listen to your mother, all sort of fairly, fairly sensible, you would think

274
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,560
straightforward statements to make. And somebody, somebody of, you know, within within the academy

275
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,520
posted the screenshot of her chapter headings today, saying this is a real mask off moment,

276
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,120
you know, look at this, look at the horrors which are which are coming forth from, you know,

277
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,200
the various other sort of imputations of the F word. And I mean, but the and was then then

278
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,160
received quite a lot of replies to the effect of which bit of people are not commodities,

279
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,360
are you objecting to them? And really, really, the response was, though, there is nothing here

280
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,960
that any of us disagree with, you know, this is actually not really this is this is this all

281
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,960
sounds very sensible, which which indeed it does, you know, loveless sex really is not empowering,

282
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,480
certainly not to women anyway. But there are, I suppose what I'm trying to say is there are a

283
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,560
lot of people out there who see this stuff, and feel endlessly wordlessly frustrated with this

284
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:48,920
stuff. And, and don't just just aren't really sure how to mobilize against this stuff, because

285
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,120
it's because the the the sort of integrated message messaging apparatus, which is transmitting,

286
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,000
it seems, seems very well articulated and very, very sort of all encompassing. But actually,

287
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,360
it isn't actually, it isn't creeped through the cracks, people still have eyes and functioning

288
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,080
brains. Because because this would be a sort of pushback, sorry to interrupt, this would be a sort

289
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,640
of pushback, I think, saying, Well, maybe there are, because with social media, especially, it's

290
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,880
very easy to make any kind of case and say, Well, everyone thinks this one, actually, maybe it's

291
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,280
just a few people, because the pushback would be, okay, maybe there's a few people who are kind of

292
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,280
saying that this person's a fascist for for asserting that there are kind of gender roles or

293
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:35,800
whatever. But is this not is this not kind of nut picking, kind of extreme examples, rather than

294
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,600
kind of a wider mood or a wider kind of feeling? Well, I think the sort of I would say there's

295
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,480
two ways of looking at that. It's very difficult to discern what public opinion actually is now,

296
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,600
because Twitter both is and is not the real world. And you know. And also, you know, there are,

297
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,440
I think you can you can argue about how how impactful a silent majority actually is compared

298
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,760
to the concerted efforts of a very small group of extremely committed zealots, which, you know,

299
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,160
I think if you look at history, it tend to be more effective than any amount of silent majority.

300
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,280
So, so from that perspective, you know, the cards are the cards are stacked in favor of the fully

301
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,360
automated luxury Nostics, because they have the mic and they really, really, really believe this

302
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:28,600
stuff. But I don't know, I think there are, I think that I really think there are hard limits

303
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,320
to it. You know, there are hard limits to how how much women, as has been very abundantly evident

304
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,320
in Britain recently, and increasingly so in America, too, there are limits to how much women

305
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,120
will tolerate being told that a woman is anybody who says they're a woman, for example, you know,

306
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,840
which is which is the most egregious and the most in your face, battlefront in the in the

307
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,320
push for no limits whatsoever on in turn, in individual self actualization on any terms whatsoever.

308
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:06,600
That's the most sort of that that's the most egregious front in that particular. I mean,

309
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,880
there are there are many others. But it's also it's also the one which is mobilizing the most

310
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,360
sort of cross party resistance. Because I mean, if you've grown, if you've grown a new human

311
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,000
inside your literal uterus, you know what a woman is. And it's also notable how many of the people

312
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,640
how many of the men who pay lip service to this idea that a woman is anybody who says they're

313
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,280
already immediately knows what a woman is the moment they want to render uterus. You know, there

314
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,560
are these all this stuff is very it's it's full of slippages and it's full of bad faith and it's

315
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,360
full of inconsistency and everybody knows that to be the case. Because at the end of the day,

316
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,320
you know, the the liquefaction of everything, I've just been writing a chapter about this

317
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,480
actually, you know, is that the this the the liquefaction of everything doesn't actually work

318
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,160
because because it's premised on the idea that there's no such thing as nature and no such

319
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,680
thing as human nature. And that's not actually true. So what it does in the end is it it successfully

320
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,840
liquefies all of the norms or all of these established structures. But because because

321
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,800
human nature continues to exist, it then it simply reframes that as a set of supply and demand

322
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,120
problems. So instead of instead of having, you know, codes for in the instead of having courtship

323
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,200
rituals, you have the sexual marketplace. And that's a straightforward reordering of the the

324
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,560
sex differences between men and women, you know, which, you know, had quite elaborate social codes

325
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,800
ordered around them, you know, in order to kind of balance the balance the interests of men and

326
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,600
women, you know, under particular economic circumstances, you liquefy that you blow it

327
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,400
all out of the water and say no, actually, everybody can just do what they want now.

328
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,600
But and what what happens is not that everybody does what they want. Exactly. What have because

329
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,960
people still people still have urges which are not rational. And some of those are connected to

330
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,720
reproductive roles, they just are. But but instead, but and because this stuff goes on existing,

331
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,640
it just it just gets reabsorbed into the marketplace and it becomes a set of supply and

332
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,240
demand problems. And the same the same is now happening with biological sex, you know, it's

333
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,640
either being, you know, the desire to be one sex or another is being is being reimagined as a set

334
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,640
of supply and demand problems. You know, there are already medical papers out there, we are talking

335
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,920
about, you know, uterus transplants into men who men who identify as women. I don't know where they're

336
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,520
going to get the uterus is from, but presumably from from women who identify as men or who knows,

337
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,000
who knows anyway, there's this is being imagined as you know, a set of Lego parts that could just

338
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,680
be swapped so that they're in the right place, presumably through some sort of marketplace.

339
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,960
And the same goes again for babies, you know, women are still the only people who can just

340
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,600
date new humans. So so here again, because we were we're in the process of liquefying all of the

341
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,960
norms. But but we haven't in the process successfully managed to abolish the underlying

342
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,120
material facts, you know, on which those norms are built. We just end up we end up reimagining

343
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,720
them as a set of supply and demand problems. So now if you need a uterus, you just go and rent one.

344
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:05,400
And but the point is the liquefaction doesn't work. And so the and my sense is there's a

345
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,920
there's a kind of frustration there among the automated luxury nostics, because every time

346
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,520
they try and every time they try and get to the bottom, to the point where actually we really

347
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,960
have just attained full grey goo Satanism. It just it never quite works because it's because

348
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,280
there's always there's always another level of materiality, which has its patterns and continues

349
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:31,960
to be what it is. And I, it's a very depressing, very pessimistic sort of a hope. But I do, I

350
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,960
have some, you know, if I have hope, it's in the fact that that that persists. It just is. And

351
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,600
it doesn't matter how many times you try and liquefy, it continues. Yeah, and I think that's

352
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,920
really, that's a great summary of it all. I mean, this is, I've written quite a few times in these

353
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,840
essays and doing at the moment about the how revolutions effectively, especially progressive

354
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,920
revolutions always clear the ground for the machine. They think they're creating a utopia.

355
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,360
And what actually happens from the French Revolution onwards, is you destroy all the

356
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,160
customary structures, you destroy the traditions, you destroy the structures from families to

357
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,040
community level structures up to church level, you literally you, you know, you burn down the

358
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,120
churches and you try to destroy the family and you read it to be the land. And what happens then

359
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,200
is you just create a void and into the void commerce rushes. And so as Mary says, everything

360
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,400
becomes commodified. And so the result of your grand utopian progressive revolution is not

361
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,480
a fairer world. It's effectively a world that is more commodified, more individualistic,

362
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,760
and more, more prey to the machine. And that brings us to the point after about 200 years

363
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,480
that we've got to now where everything is a commodity. But there are a lot of people who

364
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,440
consider themselves to be progressive who have confused out with liberation. And this is really

365
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,160
what liberation has come down to as Mary is also saying better than me is liberation from nature

366
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,320
at all levels, liberation from the body, liberation from everything around you. And

367
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,240
this this I think explains the kind of the people who scream about fascism and the people who are

368
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,480
so committed to this is they genuinely think, well, effectively, they're blanks latest, right,

369
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,680
they genuinely believe that if you can remove all of the supposed change the tires down from

370
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,040
from the reality of biological sex to the existence of family to national culture to

371
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,320
whatever it is that you think is getting in the way of equality in utopia. Then we're all

372
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,680
then we're all the same. And then we can indeed all choose to have babies ought to be men ought to

373
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,840
be women ought to live anywhere ought to be whatever we want. But that's not true because

374
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,880
we're hefted, you know, we're hefted and we're rooted in whatever cultural or background or

375
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,280
biology we have. And there are some things you shouldn't, you can't get away from. But also

376
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,840
you shouldn't want to because they actually make you human. And that's the thing that there's this

377
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,080
notion that these structures that have always in most societies and most times been customary

378
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,240
from the family to the village to the religious institution, whatever it is, that they are

379
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,600
bad things which which limit us as opposed to the possibility that they are actually things

380
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:03,800
which enrich us and which structure our urges in useful ways. And that's that's the point where

381
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,640
can I have to probably painfully rediscover that we we probably built these structures for a reason

382
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,400
and we lived in certain ways for a reason. And however imperfect those ways might have been for

383
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,600
lots of people, and they're hardly unimprovable, they still probably built on a knowledge of human

384
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,640
nature that we're now pretending isn't there anymore. And yeah, we're getting to the point

385
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,320
where we've deconstructed almost everything. And as Mary said, there's a kind of there's a grinning

386
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,560
face at the bottom of it is not looking good. I've come I've come gradually to the conclusion

387
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,920
that actually gender ideology is mostly particularly transgender children. It's

388
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,760
are being instrumentalized, you know, there are some seriously distressed people who are for

389
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,800
for all men or a number of range of different often quite complicated, you know, personally

390
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,360
very painful reasons, you're deeply unhappy in their bodies and in the world as it is,

391
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,080
you know, and I think that's that's often a rational response to finding themselves in a

392
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,240
very in an absolutely intolerable place, you know, particularly adolescent women,

393
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,880
who find themselves in a world so saturated with porn that actually to me it seems a

394
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,280
completely reasonable response to take hormones that make that make you resemble a male and cut

395
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,640
off your breasts. I mean, I would probably be tempted if I were 14 today. So, you know, from

396
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,640
that point of view, I have no I have no beef with with people who are trying to find some relief

397
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,440
in in a embodied condition that they find intolerable. You know, that's not who I pick

398
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,160
a fight with. But what what I see is a subset of very distressed people who are being instrumentalized

399
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,880
in pursuit of a much bigger project, which is the deregulation of human nature as such.

400
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,920
If you like the deregulation of the of the human body, you know, much the same way as

401
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,960
the financial sector was deregulated in the 1980s, the aim is to deregulate the body

402
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,720
and deregulate the idea that we had that the body has a nature, because that opens that opens up

403
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,640
boundless commercial sphere in which, you know, organs regenerate self regenerating organs can

404
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,040
be synthesized in laboratories. Human animal chimeras can be developed for who knows what

405
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,200
purposes. I mean, you know, the possibilities are endless if you're a mad scientist with no

406
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:24,600
no ethics. But you have to you have to render an inexcusably low status, any sort of the

407
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,760
currently still pervasive common conviction act with truth, in fact, not conviction truth,

408
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,320
that humans have a nature, and that, you know, males are normatively one way and females are

409
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,560
normatively another. And, you know, humans have a normal number of limbs and so on and so forth.

410
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,680
You have to you have to completely denormalize destabilize and liquefy that consensus before

411
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,320
you before you can embark on the, you know, deregulatory business opportunities that flow

412
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:56,280
from that. Yeah, no, I think that's right. That's exactly what's happening. And the demonizing of

413
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,640
the of the turfs and the fascists and everybody else is precisely part of that project, which is

414
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,320
to silence and to provide endless new names for the people who are saying exactly that.

415
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,480
Really interesting what you're saying about the, like, what is the sort of the

416
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,760
question that arises? Like, what's the most fundamental driver? Because you you mentioned,

417
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,800
Paul, that you felt like commerce was filling the gap of this sort of revolutionary moment.

418
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,000
But are you saying that you think commerce is is actually the driver or is the driver

419
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,040
deeper? Is the driver some kind of, I mean, you've called it the machine, but how

420
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,880
where do you think that machine lives? Do you think it's kind of a psychological structure or a

421
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,360
yeah, what what do you think is actually, because it's also kind of for me kind of maps onto some

422
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,720
of the conspiracy thinking as well, where I see a lot of the time people kind of collapse around

423
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,360
looking for an agent, a specific agent or a specific set of agents, whereas actually there

424
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,680
is a sort of tendency towards often that seems deeper. So where where do you locate those those

425
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,560
drivers? Yeah, well, I have a terrible feeling that the driver is metaphysical. I mean, this is not

426
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,000
just about making money. There's a lot of interest in that. But there's I keep I always talk about

427
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,160
this fascinating book by Kevin Kelly called What Technology Wants, which is a really good book to

428
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,480
read. You should read it, Mary, if you haven't already, it's a few years old now, but it's

429
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,720
Kevin Kelly is one of the Silicon Valley guys. And he's very much into the notion that

430
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,040
something is being created, which he calls the technium, which is pretty much the same as I

431
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,200
suppose why I'm calling the machine. And he says, look, this thing is becoming self aware. And

432
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,760
that's the point, right? It's starting to manage itself is starting to push its own direction,

433
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,600
starting to starting to manifest. And this is again, the attitude of a lot of the guys behind

434
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,920
this project that they think they're creating the next, they think they're building the next

435
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,520
level of evolutionary consciousness. You know, this is why they're so obsessed at the moment,

436
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,920
I think with artificial intelligence, they really think they can create post humans. And they think

437
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,720
perhaps this is Kevin Kelly's explicit notion that humanity is just a stepping stone on the

438
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,440
way to something greater, greater consciousness that they're helping to build, but which is also

439
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,880
weirdly manifesting through them. So it's a very quasi religious thing that is happening. I'm not

440
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,120
saying everybody involved in it believes that there's a lot of profiteering just, and a lot of

441
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,800
kind of mind is following the herd. But there's something going on with the creation of this

442
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:36,440
post human metaverse machine, machine, machinist sort of post human, anti human, non human

443
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,360
world in which it literally is it's a metaphysical project in which they're trying to recreate or

444
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,640
build a heaven on earth, entirely reconstructed. I mean, you hear it a lot when people talk about

445
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,720
how they want to go and live in, they want to terraform Mars or they want to fly off and live

446
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,160
on moon bases. Because that's the fantasy, the explicit fantasy of how they can create an entire

447
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:05,080
planet right from the dust up in their own image. So there's something in it that is very much bigger

448
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,480
than just a kind of profit scrabble. And again, you don't need a conspiracy theory in which there

449
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,440
are six evil people in a bunker making a plan. You just need enough people to buy into something

450
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,160
which is moving already, which I think is where we're going. And it's kind of the inevitable

451
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,600
result of the whole attitude, the whole worldview of modernity, I think, to come back to what we

452
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,760
started with, with the notion of the rational individual who can detach himself from nature

453
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,240
and build his own paradise. Now we've got the technology to do it, but we will have soon.

454
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,200
And that's really what encompasses the whole thing, I think. So it's an ideology or even

455
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,720
a religious worldview that drives it, I think. You said, I feel like you're sidling along the

456
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,480
edge of implying that it's not so much that we have ideas as that ideas have us.

457
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Yeah, well, I think that's true. I suppose, yeah, that's not a bad way of putting it.

458
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,600
We are, I mean, I think you see this really manifesting on social media. It's one reason

459
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't have any social media accounts. People are being entirely controlled by ideas and by

460
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
visions and by ideologies or whatever these things are. They're not the great, the famous

461
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,760
I support the current thing meme is quite funny, but it also has a kind of deeper meaning to it,

462
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,560
which is that there's, you know, you're being controlled when you're on your smartphone looking

463
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,240
at this stuff, you can feel it. And so, yeah, ideas have us, memes have us, metaphysics have us

464
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,960
entirely, I think. And they can almost become self-replicating in the age of the machine and they are.

465
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,120
I would agree with that. I mean, I'm hopelessly compromised in that way, Paul,

466
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,000
for fully cognizant of my cyborg state.

467
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Well, you're so good at meming, Mary, it would be a shame if you thought.

468
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,120
Well, you can't be completely unplugged if you've noticed that.

469
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,760
No, I'm not completely unplugged. No, I do pop in here and there. And one of the reasons I don't

470
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,960
have social media is that I know very well, because I did have a Twitter account for a while

471
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,640
years ago. I know very well that I would get tempted to start doing exactly the same thing.

472
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,800
I'd get sucked into that really easily. It's not, it's not a puritan position so much as a

473
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,840
practical one. I know it would rot my brain. So I keep away.

474
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,160
Yeah, I'm very ambivalent about my own relationship to Twitter. But one, I suppose the thing I wanted

475
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,200
to lob in here, which is it's a conversation I've had a number of times with, you know, other people

476
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:38,520
who are sort of embedded in the cyborg memeplex as I am, who will cheerfully chat to you about the

477
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,040
fact that they know perfectly well that the memeplex that you see on the internet is, you know,

478
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,360
that the memeplex is real. But the what you, the simulacrum of it you see on the internet is not,

479
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,960
it's not the thing. And who can see the difference very clearly. Now, I suspect that there are a

480
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,040
lot of people who sport the current thing you can't see the difference. But there are, there are

481
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,040
a surprising number of people out there who see what the, what the internet memeplex is a metaphor

482
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,400
for and recognise that it actually exists and is out there. See what it's a metaphor for? What do

483
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,040
you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Well, I mean, it's actually, what it's a metaphor for

484
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,400
is the thing that we started off talking about, you know, when you, when you were referenced,

485
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,800
I was talking about patterns and meanings and the relational, the relational nature of everything

486
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,520
in, in, in human culture and the natural world. We are another person of, if we're,

487
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,040
well, we're talking about, you know, people, shadow people who should be part of this conversation,

488
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,960
you know, a dear friend of mine, Wendy Wheeler, who died a couple of years ago, who was a pioneer

489
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,720
in biosemiotics, wrote a lot about her work was very, it was multidisciplinary. And it crossed,

490
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,720
and it was based on the thesis that everything in the natural world is not, it's not based on

491
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,960
information, it's based on meaning, everything in the natural world is a series of relational

492
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:05,320
dialogues between different meaning making systems, which I found an incredibly illuminating way

493
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:13,080
of thinking about how, how organisms exist in relation to one another. But I think one of

494
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,480
the classic examples is, you know, there's a lovely video about this somewhere on the internet,

495
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,560
what happened, what happened when they reintroduced wolves into, so into a national park in America.

496
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:32,200
And through a concatenating series of impacts that reintroducing the apex predator had on various,

497
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,400
various natural systems through the sort of, you know, concatenating interrelations of these

498
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,000
various systems, it ended up changing the path of the rivers that ran through the,

499
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,600
ran through the nature reserve. Because, because some wolves ate some more, some more large animals,

500
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,200
there were, there was a different sort of vegetation and that meant smaller animals went over

501
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,720
there instead. And that in turn meant something else and something else and something else and

502
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,680
eventually the rivers changed course. And that's what I mean when I say that the memeplex is real.

503
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,480
Because in a sense, the normative patterned behaviors of each of these species acting in

504
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,440
relationship to one another, you know, acts like a series, it's metaphorically speaking, you could

505
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,520
say it's a series of means that, that exist in dynamic dialogue with one another. And in the

506
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,280
course of doing that, you know, they, that process, if you like, manifests in, in what we see

507
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,240
materially in the natural world. And I suppose that's probably, that's probably the clearest

508
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,040
articulation I can give of what I think the actual memeplex is. And that's, and that memeplex,

509
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,840
if you like, the actual memeplex is not one in which humans exist as separate from the natural

510
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,240
world. Because obviously, we're, we're having impacts on the natural world all the time.

511
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,520
I suppose one of the, I keep chickens at home. They stop me if this is getting, getting too

512
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,280
weird or too lateral for you. I keep chickens. I think a lot about chickens because I like chickens.

513
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,520
You know, they're, they're kind of psychopathic and they're kind of miniature dinosaurs and other

514
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,800
things. But, but they're also one of the most successful bird species on, I think they might be

515
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,960
the most successful bird species on the planet. And they've done that by existing in a dialogue

516
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,640
with humans. You know, they're not the only domesticated animal in that way. And obviously,

517
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,480
a lot of them have to take one for the team. But, you know, at a species level, it's a very

518
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,840
effective survival strategy. You know, I think there are, there are countless billions of chickens

519
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,040
in the world. And it works from a, from a species point of view. But, you know, unless, unless you're

520
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,120
a, you're a fully paid up member of the machine, and you want to keep, you want to keep chickens

521
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,360
in battery farms. You know, if you're, if you're keeping, if you're keeping animals like that,

522
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,040
you sort of, you have to, you have to do so roughly in accordance with their nature.

523
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,640
You can, you can exist in a functional, you know, ongoing sustainable dialogue with a domestic

524
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,600
animal. But, you know, unless you, unless you imprison them and, and doctor them in various

525
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,600
ways to make them tolerate it, you have to, you have to keep them in conditions where they can

526
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,120
scratch, for example, if they're chickens or if they're, if they're sheep, they need different

527
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,840
conditions. And so, so there's a, there's a kind of ongoing dynamic relationship where, you know,

528
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,880
the animal, animal husbandry is partly about meeting the animal where it is. And it's partly

529
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,240
about, partly about how a domestic animal does a species level response to that, you know, and

530
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,480
over times, you know, specialist breeds evolve. And, you know, there are, there are particular

531
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,640
different types of, sorry, I'm probably getting very arcane with this, but it's just, you know,

532
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,280
once you get into those, you know, the, the, the semiotics of, of human animal interactions,

533
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,760
you know, it's just boundlessly rich terrain. You know, there are, there are, there are

534
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,600
differences in how good at giving birth unaided, different, different breeds of sheep are,

535
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:38,040
because I think it's, I think it's the herdwicks, which are, which are normally kept on very barren

536
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,840
upland terrain in the, in the north of England. And because you just can't get up there during

537
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,680
lambing season, basically the ones, the ones that survive are the ones who can give birth without

538
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,840
any help. And there are other breeds of sheep, which are kept in lowland territory under much

539
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,840
closer watch, who are, who generally need help, a lot more help with lambing because they, over

540
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,400
time, they've just evolved that way. And you can see, you can see how that would work, you know,

541
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,640
the herdwicks, the, the herdwicks that make it are the ones, are the offspring of, of mothers,

542
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,120
of youths that can, that can give birth on their own. And, and just over time, they've got much

543
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,760
better at it. And there are other breeds of sheep, which, which, which aren't. And, and these are,

544
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,360
these are the sorts of dynamic interactions between humans and the animal kingdom or,

545
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,960
and, and I mean, you, you can, you can point to any number of different examples. I think there's

546
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,200
a, another one, which I really like is the North American peppered moth, which over the last

547
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,680
hundred years has become, it's become darker as a consequence of evolving in much more

548
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,520
polluted conditions. It used to be, it used to be mostly white. I think some of them,

549
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,840
then they have, they have different patterns and over, over the last hundred years, they've

550
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:51,080
become darker because the human influence on their environment has, has, has made for,

551
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,080
has, has meant they need a different color of camouflage in order to survive. So, so we're

552
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,240
constantly existing in dialogue with the natural world, you know, with this sort of memeplex.

553
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,280
And I think the, the fundamental fantasy of the machine that we're somehow separable from it

554
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,520
and entitled to instrumentalize it, you know, once you, if you look at it from inside the

555
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,400
memeplex or you look at it from a perspective of thinking about us as participants in this

556
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,880
and entangled in this enormous sort of multi species, interspecies memeplex, it's, it's,

557
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,520
it's a sort of monstrous imposition and just a fundamental category error.

558
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,160
Yeah. And this, this takes me right back to the point about environmentalism that we talked

559
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,600
about right at the beginning, really, where I come in, I suppose, you know, this is a sort

560
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,560
of a conversation about Gaia theory, really. This is a conversation about the interconnectedness of

561
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,880
all things and the fact that there's no separation between humans of nature and that we're entirely

562
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,800
reliant on everything else, but that living in urban interconnected societies, we can very easily

563
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,240
pretend that that's not true until we start keeping chickens or any, any number of other things.

564
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,920
But it is, it is exactly why it is impossible for the new metaphysics of the machine to succeed in

565
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:07,320
the end, because what it's trying to do is, as I say, recreate, recreate or to create a new world

566
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,400
on the basis that the current world is a standing reserve on the basis that the current world is

567
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,480
just a fake or not a fake, but a pure material realm that there's nothing to it, that there's

568
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,840
no consciousness, why doesn't the human mind that there's no real interconnections that there's

569
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,520
nothing, that there's nothing sacred, that there's nothing higher than us, that there's nothing

570
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,960
that may be operating outside our purview. And that's not true. And that's not a religious claim

571
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,360
either. You can, you can read any number of scientific papers these days about the consciousness

572
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,640
of trees and the interconnectedness of fungal mycelia and any number of interesting studies

573
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,160
which demonstrate that things that are not human tend to be a lot more conscious and interconnected

574
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,840
than we might assume in the modern age, which incidentally is something that most

575
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:57,560
indigenous people know instinctively and traditionally. So that's real. So what we are

576
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,880
doing precisely is trying to break apart and instrumentalize and break down into material

577
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,280
parts, something which actually is alive that we're part of, which is the planet itself.

578
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,920
We're playing, we're literally playing God, except God knows what he's doing and we don't.

579
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,400
And that's why, that's why it hits the buffers and it will keep hitting the buffers.

580
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,000
And at the micro level, you know, a human body is a real thing and you can't,

581
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,640
you can't change it beyond a certain point. And at the macro level,

582
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,920
there's something very big and interwoven going on with the planet itself that we don't understand

583
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,080
and we can't, and we can't fiddle with beyond a certain point. And we're just going to learn

584
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,760
it the hard way. That's what's going to happen. We're going to learn it the hard way because we

585
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:44,280
don't want to learn it by paying attention. I wanted to throw in a concept around this

586
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,920
question of like what's driving it. And I wonder whether you both might have seen this,

587
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,680
but a lot of talk recently about the kind of concept of the egregore and which is a sort of

588
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:03,240
idea of maybe we are all the individual human brain as connected to a smartphone, just choosing to

589
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,640
kind of upregulate certain messages or not based on kind of ideological reasons could be seen as a

590
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,400
kind of individual neuron in a wider sort of group consciousness that we're not, we don't know where

591
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,680
that is going, that that's sort of almost like a, that could be, do you think that's a useful concept?

592
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:29,400
And that could kind of explain sort of a kind of wider perspective of an intention that we're

593
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,600
part of, but we don't fully understand where its destination or direction of travel is.

594
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,160
Yeah, well, it's an occult concept, isn't it, egregores? I've seen a few people

595
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,320
chatting about it recently. I mean, there's certainly a sense that you can come back to that

596
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,560
notion that we're being controlled by something that's bigger than us. And I think fundamentally

597
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,160
that is happening through the internet. I wrote quite a fun short story a few years ago called

598
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,320
The Basilisk, which was all about this, which I quite enjoyed writing. I should just write

599
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,360
short stories because there's a much quicker way of trying to explain all this than putting it in

600
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:09,480
essays. But that was precisely about the possibility that something is controlling us through the web,

601
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,800
whether that something is a sort of a mind force that we create in some ways, or whether it's

602
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,280
something else. I don't know, but there's something, there's something going on which is bigger than

603
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,680
us. The internet has manifested it. And it's part of the craziness. And it's really difficult to

604
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,680
pin down. But it's people talking about egregores is one sort of pointer to the fact that people

605
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,760
can again feel that there's something much bigger behind the weird on-screen interactions that no

606
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:42,760
one can quite explain or put their finger on. Well, I would love to do a part two where we talk

607
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,840
about what we're going to do, what we do now. Because if we've reached the bottom, if we've

608
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,440
reached the bottom, and there really is nowhere further down, I mean, there might be a lot along

609
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:00,200
way further down. But if we've reached the point where we've liquefied everything, what happens

610
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,240
next, I think that's a question I would love to talk over with you. No, it's a big one. Yeah,

611
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:10,040
how to live through it, how to make sense of it, how to resist it. Yeah, that would be a great chat.

612
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,360
Awesome. So this is diagnosis, and then we have a follow up with solution.

613
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,120
No promises, no promises. Yeah, Mary, Mary and Paul, thank you very much. Thank you.

614
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:31,560
So I hope you enjoyed that. I really loved the conversation while I was part of it,

615
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,720
and I listened to it again afterwards and something really landed. So I'm going to try

616
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,480
and explain why I think this is significant. Maybe you can let me know what you make of

617
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,480
this in the comments. I think what this conversation was is a moving towards a synthesis position

618
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,000
between what you might call dissident right and dissident left. It's explaining how the extreme

619
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,560
woke agenda is liquefying all structures, which is what the right is angry about.

620
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,000
But Paul explains that ultimately this is in the interests of capital and it's a corporate agenda,

621
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,800
which is what the left is upset about. And it also validates the feelings of the conspiracy

622
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,840
minded that something coordinated is going on, but locates the source of the problem not in a

623
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:17,560
shadowy cabal, but in the metaphysical, what Paul calls the machine, and Mary calls fully automated

624
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:24,280
luxury Gnosticism. So I think this is inching towards a synthesis position. And what's more

625
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:30,440
powerful is the way that they both deliver their message with wit, intelligence and depth.

626
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,760
And with none of the reactivity and anger that characterizes so much of this debate.

627
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,600
So I really do think this is a step forward. And I'm looking forward to hosting them again in

628
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,320
dialogue, along with rebel wisdom members, which we're going to do soon. So if you want to join

629
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,920
that conversation, check out the membership options below in the show notes and hope to see you there.
