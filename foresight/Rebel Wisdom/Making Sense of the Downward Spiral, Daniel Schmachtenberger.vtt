WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
So in the last few days as we see what started in Minneapolis and then went to Atlanta and

00:08.720 --> 00:13.880
Seattle and then everywhere in the US, it's interesting how consuming a new cycle can

00:13.880 --> 00:20.360
make the most concerning issue of three days ago almost completely absent in people's minds

00:20.360 --> 00:25.120
and attention, but you also lose almost all perspective if that happens.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.480
So it's important to kind of pay attention to the sequence of things and the narrative

00:29.480 --> 00:34.640
arc and the things that are not forefront in the attention cycle.

00:34.640 --> 00:41.640
So right before the racial violence became forefront, we were seeing in the US an escalation

00:41.640 --> 00:48.280
towards violence that was very left-right oriented between red state, blue state, having different

00:48.280 --> 00:52.560
focus around how they were going to open and it was kind of showing up as the mass squares

00:52.560 --> 01:03.280
versus the non-mass squares and we saw armed people going to Capitol buildings in protest

01:03.280 --> 01:07.360
of quarantine and shutdown.

01:07.360 --> 01:13.560
We also started to see an increase in racial focus in the news over the week leading up

01:13.560 --> 01:18.960
to the case in Minneapolis that set it all off.

01:18.960 --> 01:29.160
And I'm not going to say like a single narrative of some central command and control function

01:29.160 --> 01:32.400
that I think is orchestrating everything, but I'm going to mention anomalies that I

01:32.400 --> 01:36.520
think you should be paying attention to.

01:36.520 --> 01:43.760
So we see the case of the man who was jogging and the retired cop and his son shot him.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.400
That was like a week before.

01:46.400 --> 01:54.280
And then we see increased news of white supremacy and a lot more images of white guys with guns

01:54.280 --> 01:56.480
at Capitol buildings.

01:56.480 --> 02:05.400
Then we see in relationship to the guy who was running and got shot and there were protests,

02:05.400 --> 02:10.880
black open carry of weapons associated with the protests and then also black open carry

02:10.880 --> 02:23.240
of weapons escorting a black lawmaker to the courthouse or some state building.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.040
And then we see Joe Biden's comments about you ain't black and like just a whole bunch

02:28.040 --> 02:36.440
of increase in race attention in primary news cycles.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.600
And then we see the case with George Floyd.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.800
So there's a big question for me of like, did we just have a particular and unusually

02:44.800 --> 02:47.760
racist week?

02:47.760 --> 02:54.840
Or does the news cycle not actually reflect the background rate of things for other reasons?

02:54.840 --> 03:02.840
And for for every situation like we see with George Floyd, the number of those that aren't

03:02.840 --> 03:10.040
caught like it's just it's just a much less rare phenomena than I think most people think

03:10.040 --> 03:11.040
it is.

03:11.040 --> 03:19.640
Sadly, I think most black people in inner cities know it's not as rare a phenomenon.

03:19.640 --> 03:26.240
So then we see the video circulating that the we see this guy with a hammer and black

03:26.240 --> 03:31.640
tactical gear breaking the windows of the auto zone right in Minneapolis.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.640
And we see people jumping to thinking, assessing that he's a cop as an agent provocateur, or

03:38.640 --> 03:44.200
that he is a Antifa guy or a white supremacist or a Soros agent.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.960
There's a lot of different hypotheses, but a lot of images are surfacing of the buildings

03:48.960 --> 03:55.520
being set on fire and the windows being broken by white people at the black protest rallies

03:55.520 --> 04:02.600
that were not breaking like the initial movement to property destruction and violence was not

04:02.600 --> 04:04.040
actually them.

04:04.040 --> 04:10.000
And broken windows theory is very clear that once like once the first Molotov cocktails

04:10.000 --> 04:16.240
thrown, and it becomes much easier to engage in throwing Molotov cocktails once the first

04:16.240 --> 04:22.360
windows are broken, because there's like a threshold to move past that that has already

04:22.360 --> 04:23.800
been broken.

04:23.800 --> 04:33.640
And so the idea that police officers or people with other agendas infiltrate a protest group

04:33.640 --> 04:39.400
that is otherwise peaceful and throw the first rock to justify use of police force on the

04:39.400 --> 04:42.000
other side, like that's a very well known phenomena.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.080
But right now we can hypothesize a lot of groups that would have a motive to do it for

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
a lot of reasons.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.400
So some people either are buying the standard narrative or they're too quickly jumping to

04:51.400 --> 04:55.880
the alternate narrative of it was the cop for this reason or it was the white supremacists

04:55.880 --> 05:03.680
trying to blame the black guys or it was the deep state Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden supporting

05:03.680 --> 05:09.000
liberals that are trying to create insight more reason to have people stay at home than

05:09.000 --> 05:13.080
the quarantine already was to move towards their goal to steal an election.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.920
There's like a gazillion hypotheses.

05:15.920 --> 05:23.440
I think the problem is the people who aren't buying the mainstream media narrative are buying

05:23.440 --> 05:29.040
the first alternate narrative that appeals to their sense making desire to not have uncertainty

05:29.040 --> 05:33.800
and put the pieces together before there's adequate evidence that that alternate narrative

05:33.800 --> 05:37.040
is actually much better.

05:37.040 --> 05:44.200
So the guy who broke the windows was definitely not a normal part of the protest, but I don't

05:44.200 --> 05:52.720
know who he was an agent for or what the motive was because the data that suggests any of

05:52.720 --> 05:55.880
the 10 different hypotheses are not solid yet.

05:55.880 --> 06:02.880
So one of the things I'm wanting to encourage is don't let your attention cycle be controlled

06:02.880 --> 06:07.320
by the attention cycle of your social media feed or your mainstream news.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.960
That's one thing.

06:08.960 --> 06:15.560
The other thing is be very careful about how easy it is to get induced into being on one

06:15.560 --> 06:18.360
side of group think and conflict theory.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.960
Let's talk about conflict theory for a moment.

06:22.960 --> 06:29.520
There's a few types of natural cleavings or easy cleavings, if not natural, where it's

06:29.520 --> 06:33.160
very easy to drive conflict between people.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.920
Political left right is a very easy one.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.120
You can do red state, blue state stuff.

06:37.120 --> 06:44.120
You can do they have a make America great again hat versus a rainbow gay flag.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.360
They're literally wearing flags of different kinds to symbolize red shirt, blue shirt,

06:49.360 --> 06:54.080
like the type of team they're in, and then you can drive conflict between them, which

06:54.080 --> 06:58.920
both creates a sense of clear sense making of I know who my team is.

06:58.920 --> 07:06.440
I know what the group think of the narrative on my side is.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.880
The red, blue is very easy.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.640
People versus the cops is very easy.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.240
Race issues are very easy.

07:13.240 --> 07:22.880
Race is maybe the easiest because it's where the flag is biologically built in.

07:22.880 --> 07:29.080
If everybody here has not studied conflict theory, you're going to have a hard time making

07:29.080 --> 07:33.960
sense of the world without a good model of how conflict arises between people, how it

07:33.960 --> 07:37.480
gets intentionally stirred up, how people resolve it.

07:37.480 --> 07:44.000
There's a lot of different schools of conflict theory that are worth studying, but at minimum

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
everybody should know Rene Girard's work.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.680
I'm not saying that I agree with Girard.

07:54.680 --> 08:00.840
There are things that he said that were extremely insightful.

08:00.960 --> 08:08.440
Specifically, his idea is that the fundamental nature of conflict comes from the fact that

08:08.440 --> 08:16.160
desire is memetic, meaning that we learn to want stuff the same way we learn language

08:16.160 --> 08:22.040
by watching other people, and that I don't know Mandarin and I don't know Swahili and

08:22.040 --> 08:24.480
I don't know Dutch because I didn't watch people speaking those.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.120
I watched people speak in English, so I got conditioned to think in a worldview through

08:29.160 --> 08:35.520
aesthetic frames, through it's very deep how much my whole identity and everything was

08:35.520 --> 08:37.640
conditioned by what I watched.

08:37.640 --> 08:44.960
His argument is that much of what we want is also conditioned by watching people.

08:44.960 --> 08:50.800
We end up innately wanting what other people have, which means that desire inexorably drives

08:50.800 --> 08:51.800
conflict.

08:51.800 --> 08:57.520
Somebody, people have stuff, you want that thing or similar kinds of things, then as

08:57.560 --> 09:01.880
more people are wanting the same things and conflicting over it, the conflict itself becomes

09:01.880 --> 09:02.880
memetic.

09:02.880 --> 09:08.840
People learn through mimesis to identify with the Zionist or the anti-Zionist side based

09:08.840 --> 09:13.680
on which side of the wall they grew up on or whatever the conflict they happen to have

09:13.680 --> 09:15.400
been born into.

09:15.400 --> 09:21.320
Then in Girard's model, the conflict continues to increase until there's so much embodied

09:21.320 --> 09:26.160
energy that you're going to get something like a war and the least violent way to deal

09:26.200 --> 09:32.440
with it is to have a scapegoat, a sacrificial, rather than a all against all war, be able

09:32.440 --> 09:39.520
to have some sacrificial person that is able to be effectively blamed for the whole scenario

09:39.520 --> 09:44.800
and then we're able to take them out and decrease the embodied conflict energy for a while and

09:44.800 --> 09:51.320
then the cycle has to repeat.

09:51.480 --> 09:59.280
Girard's work really says that historically has been no way out of that and the role of

09:59.280 --> 10:05.160
various religions was to figure out how to do scapegoating well and that that's what

10:05.160 --> 10:10.960
all of the sacrifices of various religious traditions were about, that Christianity was

10:10.960 --> 10:15.240
actually trying to get rid of scapegoating by showing that the person they scapegoated

10:15.240 --> 10:20.760
was actually innocent and not only innocent but the highest kind of innocent so that the

10:20.760 --> 10:26.320
way people would get out of his answer actually of how you get out of scapegoating was everyone

10:26.320 --> 10:30.680
developed Christ-like virtues.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.920
But specifically as critique said that by getting rid of religion and this is relevant

10:34.920 --> 10:39.080
to the goals of this group that is trying to re-invoke some of the things religion did

10:39.080 --> 10:47.200
like the development of human virtue, by getting rid of religion we got rid of the way of

10:47.280 --> 10:55.320
dealing with the memetic conflict while simultaneously getting much much larger weapons of destruction

10:55.320 --> 11:00.880
so that rather than have things heat up in Europe and kill a Jew sacrificially it had

11:00.880 --> 11:09.360
to be this massive kind of killing of all of these Jews and so okay so why am I bringing

11:09.360 --> 11:16.880
that up?

11:16.960 --> 11:25.440
I think it's very easy to, I think there are lots of reasons to want to drive conflict

11:25.440 --> 11:31.640
and to want to keep groups of people having attention focused in different ways.

11:31.640 --> 11:37.480
Maybe this is actually the way I'll talk about it.

11:37.480 --> 11:42.040
Power pretty much translates to power over other people.

11:42.080 --> 11:47.040
To have power over their behaviors whether I want people to vote for me in a particular

11:47.040 --> 11:52.440
way or I want them to buy my stuff or I want them to publicly support my ideas I need to

11:52.440 --> 11:58.160
control other people's behavior to control their behavior I need to control their minds.

11:58.160 --> 12:07.200
And so warfare is main mainly not fought with bullets like the kinetic warfare that we think

12:07.200 --> 12:12.360
of as warfare that's fought with weapons is maybe one percent of warfare.

12:12.360 --> 12:17.520
Ninety-nine percent of warfare is diplomatic warfare, political warfare, economic warfare,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.120
narrative warfare, information warfare.

12:20.120 --> 12:25.400
All of this comes together to what we call hybrid warfare or really just politics or

12:25.400 --> 12:30.000
game theory or the game of power.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.400
But think of it as a hybrid or population-centric warfare.

12:37.400 --> 12:44.840
So in this war the treasure being fought over is people's minds and the battleground

12:44.840 --> 12:48.440
is people's minds.

12:48.440 --> 12:58.960
The primary weapons are tools of narrative influence and emotional evocation and control

12:58.960 --> 13:03.520
of the information flows.

13:03.520 --> 13:08.240
And in these wars they're asymmetric wars because you have some actors that have access

13:08.240 --> 13:18.440
to billion or trillion-dollar level information technologies, AI-empowered micro-targeting.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.880
And then you have other people that are just trying to figure shit out on their own and

13:20.880 --> 13:23.480
they don't even know they're in a war.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.160
And they don't even know that their own mind is the battleground of the war and they think

13:27.160 --> 13:30.000
they believe the shit they believe and they think they came to it on their own.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.200
They think they're doing a good job sense-making and they don't realize that as they're researching

13:36.200 --> 13:40.800
of the trillions of pages of shit they could see, the ones that they will ever even be

13:40.800 --> 13:45.760
able to see based on what shows up in their YouTube feed or their Google search or manipulated

13:45.760 --> 13:50.840
by algorithms that have agendas behind them.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.840
As well as the original source material of whoever put it out for which reasons.

13:55.840 --> 14:03.120
Okay, so zooming out from the current violence for a moment, we have an election coming up

14:03.120 --> 14:12.280
in the US that will be radically consequential for the world, either way.

14:12.280 --> 14:18.480
No matter who wins currently, whether the election is illegally tampered with and stolen

14:18.480 --> 14:23.800
or not, half of the population will think it was.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.120
This is a real problem, right?

14:26.120 --> 14:30.400
Because what happens when a third to a half of the population no matter which way it goes

14:30.400 --> 14:34.080
thinks that it was stolen and thinks it was radically consequential?

14:34.080 --> 14:43.360
Well, like one of two really bad things happens, either the people get violent, much more so

14:43.360 --> 14:47.440
than we currently have.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.480
And that sets off one whole cascade of scenarios where they don't get violent and the people

14:51.480 --> 14:57.800
who want to steal elections get even clearer that they just can with impunity.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.480
So we're like, fuck, what do we do with this moving forward?

15:02.480 --> 15:05.760
Now, mail-in ballots.

15:05.760 --> 15:12.720
Are mail-in ballots easier to corrupt than in-person voting?

15:12.720 --> 15:15.800
Yep, totally.

15:15.800 --> 15:21.080
And COVID, as one reason, violence could be another, but COVID is one reason to have

15:21.080 --> 15:26.040
mail-in ballots like, might there be reasons associated with that?

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Yeah.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.240
Now, might there be reasons that people who really want Trump out of office would want

15:31.240 --> 15:36.280
to initiate things that make Trump look worse and that say, look at all the bad shit that's

15:36.280 --> 15:38.840
happening during Trump?

15:38.840 --> 15:45.040
We could also talk about what motives the Trump campaign would have to be engaged in

15:45.040 --> 15:48.760
something where you wouldn't want transfer of power to occur.

15:48.760 --> 16:00.080
So there's a version of this that is easy to buy for either political leaning.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.520
I don't find that most successful politicians that I have encountered near the top of the

16:04.520 --> 16:08.880
power actually believe red versus blue ideology.

16:08.880 --> 16:13.360
They just believe in the game of power and they signal red versus blue ideology as part

16:13.360 --> 16:18.480
of their memetic warfare to control the people that are going to vote for them.

16:18.480 --> 16:26.640
Just like I don't think most of the people that end up engaging religions and holy wars

16:26.640 --> 16:32.320
at the most strategic level really even are religious.

16:32.320 --> 16:36.200
I think they know that these are ways to get people to do things for reasons that are mostly

16:36.200 --> 16:40.120
strategic.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.840
As we look at war a little bit more and we look at the tension heating up on the India-China

16:43.840 --> 16:51.160
border is such a big deal like what's happening there and the India-China-Pakistan interaction

16:51.160 --> 16:56.000
and the India-China-Russia interaction.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.520
And as we look at it with COVID related stuff, obviously what happens to the spread of the

17:01.520 --> 17:11.320
virus with all of the protests that are definitely not social distancing, well we'll find out.

17:11.320 --> 17:18.440
What happens when like with Germany and South Korea and China who started to get second

17:18.440 --> 17:24.200
waves of infection after reopening, what happens when we start to get second waves here and

17:24.200 --> 17:32.480
the political tension is so heated around the idea of closing again.

17:32.480 --> 17:42.920
And then we also start to see things like because of the COVID shutdown of transportation

17:42.920 --> 17:46.000
the food supply system got radically damaged, right?

17:46.000 --> 17:50.680
Give or take the food supply for two billion people got damaged.

17:50.680 --> 17:57.480
And so Nigeria has a 25 million person insecure food population that all went from food insecure

17:57.480 --> 17:59.920
to actually don't have food.

17:59.920 --> 18:07.000
And now violence has been raising on the ground both insurgencies, local crime and Boko Haram.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.480
That's probably going to trigger an exodus and a massive refugee situation.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.440
But after Syria it's like where do the refugees go?

18:16.440 --> 18:19.680
So then what comes from that conflict why so?

18:19.680 --> 18:22.280
We're definitely at a unique moment in the world.

18:22.280 --> 18:27.880
We're at a moment where because of the connectedness of supply chains because of the ability for

18:27.880 --> 18:32.960
viruses in airplanes to move around the world so fast because of the ability of news cycles

18:32.960 --> 18:33.960
to move so fast.

18:33.960 --> 18:41.480
So we go from an event in Minneapolis to in every city because of those things the interconnection

18:41.480 --> 18:45.880
for the cascade of events from anywhere to everywhere and from one sector to other sectors

18:45.880 --> 18:57.120
is so high on top of systemic fragility on top of very high embodied emotional energy.

18:57.120 --> 19:08.760
This next phase of time is going to see a continuance of a cascade of very serious problems.

19:08.760 --> 19:15.840
How do we make sense of the world given all of these dynamics and how do we respond?

19:15.840 --> 19:21.040
I always feel stuck when someone asks me that how do we for some very large audience if

19:21.040 --> 19:25.320
we respond because it's going to be very different based on people's skills and capacities

19:25.320 --> 19:26.320
and interests.

19:26.320 --> 19:31.520
It's not like a very good generalized answer to that.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.080
Like David, how are you responding?

19:34.080 --> 19:41.880
Well you're trying to both put out information that helps people and share frames that help

19:41.880 --> 19:46.040
people process information and maybe that helps them get less emotionally hijacked so

19:46.040 --> 19:47.940
they can have some more clarity.

19:47.940 --> 19:53.920
Like those seem like within your bailiwick of things to do that you can do super important

19:53.920 --> 19:58.160
things that need done.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.760
There's going to be an equivalent of that in totally different ways that everyone on

20:02.760 --> 20:06.800
here has as a possibility.

20:06.800 --> 20:19.660
So I think people recognizing that they actually have some choice in where they put their attention

20:19.660 --> 20:22.280
and some choice in the meaning they make.

20:22.280 --> 20:29.080
So both where they focus and actually they have choice in where they put their attention.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.200
They have choice in the process of coming to belief.

20:32.200 --> 20:37.160
Are they just kind of letting themselves by the conclusions put in front or are they really

20:37.160 --> 20:38.840
asking that am I sure of this?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.320
How would I be sure of this?

20:41.320 --> 20:46.720
Because there's going to be a response to their own sense of certainty or uncertainty.

20:46.720 --> 20:50.440
And they also have some choice in the meaning they make around the things and all of this

20:50.440 --> 20:51.920
is going to affect their state.

20:51.920 --> 21:01.120
So that means that overwhelm is something someone really has a choice to indulge or not.

21:01.520 --> 21:06.040
So sometimes I'll notice that there's so much coming in and I'm like what the fuck do I do

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
about this?

21:07.040 --> 21:08.760
And there's a beginning impulse of overwhelm.

21:08.760 --> 21:15.640
And I know I'm not trying to pretend or repress it but I also know that going into an overwhelmed

21:15.640 --> 21:21.120
spiral is not useful and I have a kind of deep commitment to be useful.

21:21.120 --> 21:25.320
So I have a deep commitment to want to think about things in a way that allows me to continue

21:25.320 --> 21:27.440
to respond.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.000
So I'll be like okay well let's just step back and actually write down what are all the things

21:31.000 --> 21:32.080
that I see going on.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.840
Let's make a situational assessment map.

21:35.840 --> 21:40.400
So rather than just start to spiral into something like let me start to identify what are the

21:40.400 --> 21:43.840
knowns, what are the unknowns, what are the things I might be able to do something about

21:43.840 --> 21:47.320
where I want to put more of my sense making into that area because I might actually have

21:47.320 --> 21:51.840
some agency in that area.

21:51.840 --> 21:57.440
So some people on here that what is theirs to do will be largely around serving their

21:57.440 --> 22:11.320
local communities but you know other people might have might work in the finance sector

22:11.320 --> 22:15.440
and have specific things that they can do that are particularly meaningful to be able

22:15.440 --> 22:27.040
to get the right types of projects funded or yeah I don't know.

22:27.040 --> 22:35.200
What I can say not to do right is definitely make sure okay here's an important one I'll

22:35.200 --> 22:39.360
say one thing to do.

22:39.360 --> 22:44.440
Understand the basics of strategy if you're going to try and do anything so that you don't

22:44.440 --> 22:48.760
just make shit worse or be totally useless.

22:48.760 --> 22:57.840
So strategy 101 every response everything that you do if you're effective some people

22:57.840 --> 23:03.360
will not like and it will evoke a counter response.

23:03.360 --> 23:10.840
Factor the counter response in what you're doing and see if it's still a good idea.

23:10.840 --> 23:15.840
If you are not factoring counter responses you are not doing strategy you are just being

23:15.840 --> 23:17.480
reactive.

23:17.480 --> 23:25.160
Now you might be super righteous in your reactivity but that does mean that you are actually upon

23:25.160 --> 23:31.320
that is being manipulated by forces that are doing strategy you aren't actually doing strategy

23:31.320 --> 23:37.200
and so if you're wanting to do something to make sure Trump doesn't get reelected or to

23:37.200 --> 23:46.760
make sure that systemic racism gets addressed or whatever it is you just have to think in

23:46.760 --> 23:53.840
this particular action who that will feel threatened by this will counter respond in

23:53.840 --> 24:00.680
what ways and what resources are available to them and if I'm escalating the game right

24:00.680 --> 24:06.920
if I'm increasing the war on one side driving an arms race of escalation am I driving it

24:06.920 --> 24:10.360
in the right direction.

24:10.360 --> 24:17.120
Do that if you aren't doing that then you're most likely escalating things in the wrong

24:17.120 --> 24:18.880
direction with whatever you're doing.

24:18.880 --> 24:26.000
I guess listening to you I mean we've done quite a lot of conversations around I think

24:26.000 --> 24:30.760
phase shift for humanity was the first one where you talked about the self terminating

24:30.760 --> 24:37.800
nature of the current dynamic and I guess it's one thing to talk about that and to

24:37.800 --> 24:41.960
have seen it as a possibility it's another one when you feel it on a kind of visceral

24:41.960 --> 24:47.840
level and I wonder I just wonder whether you because you talk I mean you use some beautiful

24:47.840 --> 24:54.800
metaphors about the caterpillar and the butterfly and I'd say for talking about kind of phase

24:54.800 --> 25:01.240
shift and self terminating systems you actually sketch out quite a sort of positive vision

25:01.240 --> 25:06.320
as well has that changed or are you still.

25:07.320 --> 25:13.400
That hasn't changed.

25:13.400 --> 25:18.640
I think that everything that's happening right now.

25:18.640 --> 25:24.360
Was going to happen some version of it there's a lot of path dependencies it it didn't have

25:24.360 --> 25:28.680
to have COVID as a path and it could have been a different pandemic or it could have

25:28.680 --> 25:33.560
been grid collapse or it could have been climate change driving refugees driving a war there's

25:33.560 --> 25:47.000
a gazillion things that could have started the the systemic cascades but it was inevitable

25:47.000 --> 25:51.840
which is why like that's mostly what I've talked about for the last six or seven years

25:51.840 --> 25:58.000
was trying to help people see that was inevitable let's see what we can do to do anticipatory

25:58.000 --> 26:00.600
good good things.

26:00.600 --> 26:07.120
If you identify every area that there is a risk.

26:07.120 --> 26:13.000
There is also a meaningful upside and this is a way to think about what might be yours

26:13.000 --> 26:18.120
to do when an environmental niche gets disturbed it's much easier to have new things come in

26:18.120 --> 26:24.160
and change the process.

26:24.160 --> 26:29.800
So if we go through and look at all of the areas where there are major problems and where

26:29.800 --> 26:35.080
there are major risks and say what is the system that's actually breaking down and what

26:35.080 --> 26:39.440
would a better version of that system be and what could we do to implement those better

26:39.440 --> 26:44.000
versions of the system rather than try to reinstate the security of the old ones that

26:44.000 --> 26:48.080
would be a beginning of thinking about the opportunity space.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.480
And we could talk about that with global finance we could talk about it with infrastructure

26:51.480 --> 26:56.120
we could talk about it with the health care system on and on right the judicial reform

26:56.120 --> 26:59.360
all those things.

26:59.920 --> 27:06.280
Someone just posted this in the chat I think it's really true so far it seems the pandemic

27:06.280 --> 27:11.760
and the crisis is accelerating all of the we're not in a shift into a new system it

27:11.760 --> 27:17.120
seems to be just accelerating and compounding all of the worst aspects of the old one.

27:17.120 --> 27:26.840
Do you have a sense of how that process might play out and where is the sort of hope in

27:26.840 --> 27:34.640
that if there is any.

27:34.640 --> 27:45.560
Most people who care about things widely care about the global commons long term suck at

27:45.560 --> 27:54.320
doing things like they suck at doing things at scale because most anyone who's good at

27:54.360 --> 27:58.480
doing things at scale one at the game of power.

27:58.480 --> 28:04.520
Because to do things at scale means to be able to influence things in a way that will

28:04.520 --> 28:10.040
beat out competitors and go against people who want things to go otherwise.

28:10.040 --> 28:14.760
So right now there's a lot of people like during the covid time there's a lot of people

28:14.760 --> 28:18.440
feeling like they have more free time than ever.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.640
But the most powerful people in the world have been busier than ever during this time

28:22.640 --> 28:30.240
they have been consolidating the market and buying up distressed assets and massively

28:30.240 --> 28:36.560
increasing opportunism during this time.

28:36.560 --> 28:45.680
So one of the things I would say is necessary for it to be other than you just said David

28:45.680 --> 28:54.720
is that the people who actually are committed to the well being of humanity and the earth

28:54.720 --> 29:02.920
and civilization long term must learn to be how must learn how to be effective at actually

29:02.920 --> 29:04.880
making things happen at a global level.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.680
Do you like to ask your question Robin.

29:07.680 --> 29:16.440
Yes what do you have to say about yes the the resource of cross generational mentoring

29:16.440 --> 29:23.120
and networking in the situation we're in.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.240
It's complex.

29:26.240 --> 29:35.040
It's easy to say cross generational collaboration is good like it's easy to say that diverse

29:35.040 --> 29:40.240
perspectives of any kind being in conversation will enrich everyone who is there.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.840
That's true.

29:44.840 --> 29:51.160
The current situation that we're facing the last times we face situations that were relevantly

29:51.160 --> 29:57.680
analogous none of those people are still alive in terms of the generations that actually

29:57.680 --> 30:01.920
know anything about it like the people who were in World War two aren't still here the

30:01.920 --> 30:05.640
people who are in the Great Depression aren't still here the people who are in the 1918 plague

30:05.640 --> 30:07.000
aren't still here.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.480
And this is like if you study generational theory like Strauss how for you study Baudrillard

30:13.480 --> 30:18.200
typically things repeat on the cycle that once the people who had the hard one knowledge

30:18.200 --> 30:23.120
are dead we repeat the thing because they're gone right.

30:23.120 --> 30:29.280
So part of the generational connection I want people to do is study the work of the people

30:29.280 --> 30:33.680
who really understood the last relevant issues who happened to be dead might have been alive

30:33.680 --> 30:36.880
a little while ago.

30:36.880 --> 30:45.200
Now there are still people who are involved in in Vietnam and the counterculture movement

30:45.200 --> 30:55.440
and who are involved in different times that are relevant and to discuss.

30:55.440 --> 31:04.200
So like I have a friend Mark Stallman he was involved during that generation but he

31:04.200 --> 31:13.440
was doing intelligence work and like he was working with Freeman Dyson directly regarding

31:13.440 --> 31:20.400
what was brought to JFK to do with Coruse Chaff that was a big part of what's led to

31:20.400 --> 31:21.960
things broke down there.

31:21.960 --> 31:28.200
So there's knowledge that he has firsthand that's super directly relevant.

31:28.200 --> 31:37.200
But like when I look at the counterculture movement as a whole and I look at the Green

31:37.200 --> 31:45.040
Revolution and the sexual revolution and the civil rights process and the women's rights

31:45.040 --> 31:48.000
all the various things.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.720
The deeper story that I see most of the activists who are there don't know.

31:53.720 --> 32:00.640
The deeper story I see is like actually understanding co Intel Pro and how the FBI CIA and other

32:00.640 --> 32:09.940
intelligence agencies actually infiltrated the the progressive movements to very specifically

32:09.940 --> 32:15.600
derail them and get them focused on shit that would be ineffective that is that we're

32:15.600 --> 32:17.640
still doing today.

32:17.640 --> 32:23.920
So I happen to believe that there was intentional up regulation by those power structures of

32:23.920 --> 32:31.720
postmodernism as a structure of thought because if the people who studied social science only

32:31.720 --> 32:36.000
studied how to critique the game of power without actually knowing how to effectively

32:36.000 --> 32:40.880
organize then it would make sure that they never could actually really do anything.

32:40.880 --> 32:46.200
So if every time someone's organizing well you call it imperialism you won't end up

32:46.200 --> 32:53.240
organizing well and becoming an imperialist so you'll just be noise and that's fine.

32:53.240 --> 33:02.120
And the social sciences that are like actually studying the history of military theory and

33:02.120 --> 33:09.320
political theory and and strategy itself got very down regulated in exchange for something

33:09.320 --> 33:16.080
that would make people feel more righteous while being less effective.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.960
And so I want to make sure that we're learning the right lessons from the right periods of

33:21.960 --> 33:27.560
history.

33:27.560 --> 33:32.080
So what I would say is that when I think about generations and I take all the generations

33:32.080 --> 33:39.240
that are alive now I would say that ninety nine percent of the people in all those generations

33:39.240 --> 33:44.320
have been the victims of intentional disinformation in a mostly just all confused so we can have

33:44.320 --> 33:50.320
intergenerational sharing of some confused generations with others.

33:50.320 --> 33:58.000
It's still nice to have different perspectives but I would mostly like for people to have

33:58.000 --> 34:03.240
more clear and incisive insight at all and across a longer time period than their own

34:03.240 --> 34:06.400
experience a deeper study of history and like that.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.120
So I was just wondering what you know where you feel stuck and you feel like you're kind

34:10.120 --> 34:14.200
of in a hopeless situation making space for grief.

34:14.200 --> 34:21.400
So emotions of all kind can influence our sense making they can also influence our choice

34:21.400 --> 34:23.600
making.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.480
I want.

34:27.480 --> 34:33.160
We all know what it's like to have emotions that are not being clearly processed influence

34:33.160 --> 34:44.640
our choice making in damaging ways right reacting out of anger or whatever.

34:44.640 --> 34:50.080
But then we can also say OK so I don't want to be reactive emotionally so I'm going to

34:50.080 --> 34:57.720
suppress emotions and pretend to do like do a bad version of stoicism and just numb down

34:57.720 --> 35:06.960
emotional intelligence in which case I'm taking one whole type of information one whole way

35:06.960 --> 35:14.160
of sense making and turning it off and you could call emotion.

35:14.160 --> 35:18.320
This is reductive but I'm just saying one lens you could call emotion a way of being

35:18.320 --> 35:24.360
able to read warm data.

35:24.360 --> 35:29.120
Partly our emotion is responding to the situation partly our emotion is responding to the narrative

35:29.120 --> 35:31.280
we make of the situation.

35:31.280 --> 35:35.560
So in terms of the narrative we make that's where we want to do CBT or DBT or Byron Katie's

35:35.560 --> 35:39.640
the work or Krishna Murthy's inquiry to see where did I make up some meaning that fucked

35:39.640 --> 35:41.200
me up.

35:41.200 --> 35:47.560
But then there are sometimes where it's like if I see a cop kneeling on someone's neck

35:47.560 --> 35:54.320
and killing them and I don't feel angry something is wrong with me like that's not about meaning

35:54.320 --> 35:59.800
making I to actually try and say no I'm only upset because of meaning making means I have

35:59.800 --> 36:04.520
to instantiate a metaphysics where nothing matters and then say well I meaning made well

36:04.520 --> 36:08.960
yes I have a metaphysics where things matter and in a metaphysics where anything matters

36:08.960 --> 36:15.360
then if the sacred is being harmed I can feel pissed off I can feel sad I can feel scared

36:15.360 --> 36:26.320
right so you know I'm kind of inundated in data about catastrophic risk so the most fucked

36:26.320 --> 36:31.400
up things all the time and so it doesn't have the same emotional response immediately that

36:31.400 --> 36:37.800
it did the first time that I was exposed to it but I still will just sit back put my computer

36:37.800 --> 36:43.000
down and just cry when I think about what's fucking happening in Nigeria or when I think

36:43.000 --> 36:48.760
about what's about to happen or because if I don't I will actually have to dead in something

36:48.760 --> 36:52.800
and then I become less sensitive which means my sensing decreases and the wholeness of

36:52.800 --> 37:00.760
self decreases so yeah you neither want to let you neither want to repress the emotions

37:00.760 --> 37:05.000
and not listen to them and learn from them nor do you want to just unconsciously act

37:05.000 --> 37:12.040
on them you want to incorporate that into a way that you're connecting to and making

37:12.040 --> 37:18.320
sense of reality this was one of the talks from the rebel wisdom festival a dozen more

37:18.320 --> 37:24.040
