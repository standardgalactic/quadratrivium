the same thing again. It's very difficult to let go of this mentality that gives you,

03:20.580 --> 03:26.580
I'll have that, I'll take that. And it's a very selfish kind of way of thinking, not

03:26.580 --> 03:31.860
a communitarian way of thinking, it's not a broad picture, it's a very narrow picture,

03:31.860 --> 03:37.260
it sees the short term, not the long term. And it's perfectly successful in its own terms,

03:37.260 --> 03:41.220
but what it doesn't see is it's leading into a blind alley.

03:41.380 --> 03:44.980
One of the criticisms of your work I've seen, and I think you actually addressed it at the

03:44.980 --> 03:50.660
beginning of the RSA animation, that there was a very simplistic understanding of right brain,

03:50.660 --> 03:56.900
left brain in the past, maybe the 60s and 70s. And a lot of people say, well that's been discredited,

03:56.900 --> 04:02.020
the whole idea of these two parts of the brain doing different things has been completely discredited.

04:02.020 --> 04:08.180
Yes, well that was one of the hurdles I had to get over. And probably if I'd had a regular career

04:08.260 --> 04:14.740
where I had to just churn my way through an academic career, bringing out papers every

04:14.740 --> 04:20.740
few months, I'd never have had the leisure and time. Well it wasn't leisure, it was time stolen

04:20.740 --> 04:25.700
from my clinical work. But actually I spent 20 years looking at the literature and there's no

04:25.700 --> 04:31.220
question. I mean it would be absurd to suggest there's no difference. For a start, the most

04:31.220 --> 04:35.700
primitive creatures that we know about going back 700 million years, the very first ones

04:35.780 --> 04:41.300
that have a neural network already have an asymmetrical neural network. And that has simply

04:41.300 --> 04:51.300
become more, if you like, more pronounced as we go up the evolutionary tree. So the two halves

04:51.300 --> 04:55.380
of the brain are just clearly different, they're different sizes, different weights, different

04:55.380 --> 05:00.740
shapes, they have different cell called gyro patterns, that's the convolutions in the surface of the

05:01.460 --> 05:06.180
brain. They have different preponderances of grey and white matter, different preponderances

05:06.180 --> 05:12.180
of neurotransmitters, they react differently to hormones, they're just different. And it's no

05:12.180 --> 05:16.820
good saying there isn't a difference. Also psychologically they're clearly different because

05:16.820 --> 05:22.100
we know that the left hemisphere, for example, is the one that speaks, it's the one that does

05:22.100 --> 05:27.940
certain aspects of language. And the right hemisphere we know has other faculties that I

05:27.940 --> 05:36.100
spend the book explaining. So it's just that people latched onto a very simple minded model and

05:36.100 --> 05:40.420
that model was that of a machine. Now the question you ask of a machine is what does it do?

05:41.140 --> 05:44.980
And if you ask the question what does the left hemisphere do and what does the right hemisphere

05:44.980 --> 05:51.140
do, the answers that came out of pop psychology in the 70s and 80s, the left hemisphere does reason

05:51.140 --> 05:56.420
and language and the right hemisphere does emotion and visual spatial things is not true.

05:56.420 --> 06:01.700
They're both involved in everything, but they're involved in different ways, in reliably different

06:01.700 --> 06:09.380
ways. So it's not the what of the brain, it's the how. And that's a very important question,

06:09.380 --> 06:14.580
but it's not one that scientists are so readily going to ask because they're mainly interested

06:14.580 --> 06:20.900
in mechanism. But actually it's as plain as the nose on your face when you come to look at it,

06:20.900 --> 06:27.940
that there are these vast differences in the disposition of these two neural networks towards

06:27.940 --> 06:34.180
the world. They pay attention in completely different ways and when you pay attention to the world

06:34.180 --> 06:41.780
you see different things in it. And so if they do that they're going to construct two different

06:41.780 --> 06:47.460
versions of the world. We talk a lot on this channel about the meta conversation, the idea that

06:47.460 --> 06:53.940
what we need is a conversation that opens up to the not knowing, to what needs to emerge beyond

06:53.940 --> 06:58.740
and what it feels like is happening now increasingly with social media, is people are getting stuck

06:58.740 --> 07:04.660
more and more in certainty and in what they do know. Is that a right brain, left brain phenomena?

07:04.660 --> 07:10.420
Well it can be looked at in that way in that one of the features of the left hemisphere is that it

07:10.980 --> 07:17.140
prefers what it's already familiar with and it finds it very difficult to shift set. So once

07:17.140 --> 07:22.900
it's stuck into something it keeps on repeating it. Whereas the right hemisphere Rhamachandran,

07:22.900 --> 07:28.740
BS Rhamachandran, well-known neuroscientist, calls it the devil's advocate because it's able to see

07:28.740 --> 07:36.420
other things and it's saying yes but, yes but is a Zen saying that I very much like. So you can

07:36.420 --> 07:42.340
see it that way. The right hemisphere is much more able to be flexible and also very importantly

07:42.980 --> 07:48.420
although or not although but just because the two hemispheres have different takes on the

07:48.420 --> 07:53.940
one they have different takes on their own relationship. So the left hemisphere's take is

07:53.940 --> 08:02.100
an exclusive one either this is right or that is right and therefore what I know excludes what you

08:02.100 --> 08:08.340
know. Whereas the right hemisphere's take is a both and take that there's a room for what the left

08:08.340 --> 08:15.140
hemisphere does. There's a point in analysis but there's also a point in synthesis and imagination

08:15.780 --> 08:23.300
and what we are desperately lacking is that overall synthesis. It seems to me that at the moment

08:23.940 --> 08:29.860
we officially pride ourselves on being a very free thinking people. I'm going to sound like a

08:29.860 --> 08:39.380
terrible funny daddy but I think the intellectual world was far more open in the 60s and 70s when

08:39.380 --> 08:45.780
I grew up than it is today. It's closed down to a number of dogmas and the internet which is a

08:45.780 --> 08:50.820
wonderful thing hasn't helped because it's possible for people to get trapped in bubbles

08:50.820 --> 08:55.860
where they reinforce the things they believe without really hearing other points of view.

08:56.660 --> 09:02.180
I'm a keen proponent that in education one of the most important things one must do

09:02.820 --> 09:08.340
is teach people always to invert everything they believe and see the value in it. In fact

09:08.340 --> 09:13.860
I believe there should be in government a department of inverse policy so whatever the

09:13.860 --> 09:19.700
government is proposing there should be a department that is dedicated to seeing what would happen if

09:19.700 --> 09:25.460
we did the precise opposite and it should be you know centrally funded and I think it would

09:25.460 --> 09:30.580
be a very useful exercise but really it's an intellectual exercise that we all need to do.

09:30.580 --> 09:35.940
If we start being too certain about anything it means we've missed something else. This brings us

09:35.940 --> 09:42.740
to a very important metaphysical point which is that a thing and its opposite according to the

09:42.740 --> 09:47.700
left hemisphere are simply as far apart as they can be and we move always in a linear way to what

09:47.700 --> 09:55.300
we identify as good. Everything I know tells me that in fact opposites are connected and if you pretend

09:55.300 --> 10:02.820
that you are only having one you don't notice the dark side and this is terribly true in psychiatry.

10:02.820 --> 10:10.980
It's almost an attuism to say that a lot of the work one does as a psychiatrist is helping people

10:10.980 --> 10:17.140
to see that there is a good side to what it is that they fear and dislike in themselves but there

10:17.140 --> 10:22.180
is also a dark side to the bits that they pride themselves on and that you cannot get rid of

10:22.260 --> 10:28.740
the dark side you accept it and work with moving it towards something creative and all creativity

10:28.740 --> 10:34.100
and all life is creative our mental world is creative our daily reality is creative partly

10:34.100 --> 10:39.780
by us not out of nowhere but it's grounded in something else but we help creative. That process

10:39.780 --> 10:45.940
depends on opposition it depends on a degree of resistance actually and as soon as you've decided

10:46.020 --> 10:52.340
that X, Y and Z are good and their opposites are bad and we must have more and more and more and more

10:52.340 --> 10:58.500
of the thing we've decided is good you end up reaping a whirlwind because the things you didn't

10:58.500 --> 11:05.540
take note of come back and bite you in the bum and I think that what we are now seeing in the very

11:05.540 --> 11:14.820
destructive and damaging and regrettable moves of you know Brexit and Trump and so on are entirely

11:14.820 --> 11:22.260
understandable reactions which I can perfectly well forgive from people who have just been told

11:22.260 --> 11:28.340
that their opinions are no good because these are things we don't talk about these are things that

11:28.340 --> 11:33.540
you know a liberal person knows that liberty equality and fraternity is all it's about and the

11:33.540 --> 11:39.140
opposites don't matter so I think we're we're enduring now a backlash that we could have avoided

11:39.220 --> 11:45.060
by having a mature conversation yes this is good but also we've got to take into account that

11:45.940 --> 11:50.900
this is what we've talked about quite a lot on the channel and our perspective is that we're seeing

11:50.900 --> 11:56.260
the shadow of liberalism that Trump and Brexit are both the shadow of liberalism I didn't know

11:56.260 --> 12:02.180
that that was what you said but it's exactly what I believe yeah I mean you mentioned a lot of different

12:02.180 --> 12:07.060
psychological things because I mean Jung's idea of the shadow is a perfect one and at some sense it

12:07.060 --> 12:12.660
feels to us that this is the time of the integration of the shadow that what we're seeing

12:12.660 --> 12:16.660
through the democratisation of different forms of media is all the things and the cracks between

12:16.660 --> 12:21.220
things that we thought we'd got rid of are now rising up and are going to have to be dealt with

12:21.220 --> 12:28.660
again have to be integrated yes how do we do that well of course there is no you're not expecting

12:28.660 --> 12:34.420
me to have some simple answer and one of the difficulties is that we have accelerated the

12:34.420 --> 12:42.180
pace of change so fast that the kind of changes that we require not only sort of won't but simply

12:42.180 --> 12:52.740
cannot be made to happen that fast um we're in a crisis which requires something to happen

12:52.740 --> 13:01.460
very quickly really because accelerating technological advance has put machine guns

13:01.460 --> 13:07.220
in the hands of toddlers we have not increased in wisdom in fact I believe we have lost wisdom

13:07.220 --> 13:14.660
in the west and yet we have gained enormously and are gaining very fast in power inevitably if

13:14.660 --> 13:20.820
you put power in the hands of people who have no wisdom this is a formula for disaster and we see

13:20.820 --> 13:26.900
it in the current environmental disaster we're facing we see it in the destruction of species

13:26.900 --> 13:34.260
we see it in the destruction of the lives of indigenous people we see it in the mind control

13:34.260 --> 13:42.420
that is already being put into effect in china with enormously sophisticated ai that tracks the

13:42.420 --> 13:48.900
faces the movements the everything the thoughts of all its citizens and we believe oh well that's

13:48.900 --> 13:56.020
china but that could never happen here but that is very naive democracy our kind of democracy

13:56.020 --> 14:01.780
is fragile it's not the norm it's something very precious and it can easily be destroyed

14:01.780 --> 14:06.900
especially in an atmosphere where we don't know who or what to believe which is becoming more and

14:06.900 --> 14:12.660
more a problem so we have got ourselves into a very difficult situation and i'm not suggesting

14:12.660 --> 14:19.620
there is an easy fix to it but there are things that we could do um to try and get away from this

14:19.620 --> 14:25.140
I mean one they're going to have to involve radical changes we can't expect to go on living

14:25.780 --> 14:30.340
the kind of lives we do with the demands on the world there's just not sustainable they're not

14:30.340 --> 14:38.580
sustainable even for us and now that um 10 times as many people will want to claim these rights to

14:38.580 --> 14:45.220
extraordinary privilege the world simply cannot sustain it so we've been living on on fool's gold

14:45.220 --> 14:50.740
if you like so what are the practical things that can be done if if your diagnosis is correct

14:50.820 --> 14:54.820
and that we're looking at a world that's ever more sort of narrow and rational

14:56.020 --> 15:06.020
how do we get out of that yes easier said than done um and there are patients that you cannot help

15:06.020 --> 15:12.740
which is one of the first things you have to know in my trade um but I believe one of the things I

15:12.740 --> 15:18.260
can do I can't do much but one thing I can do is raise awareness and I think that's happening

15:18.260 --> 15:25.380
so people are becoming much more aware of in a way I've opened people's minds to things they already

15:25.380 --> 15:32.900
knew one of the communist things people say is I had this feeling of sudden recognition that all

15:32.900 --> 15:40.740
my life I kind of felt all this but had no way of articulating it so I think that that is one thing

15:40.740 --> 15:47.700
so of course it's just a start in terms of practical things I mean we've got to begin my completely

15:48.260 --> 15:54.260
rethinking education at the moment it's about shoveling information into people not training

15:54.260 --> 16:03.860
them to think critically to think imaginatively uh I was lucky in that in my education I was taught

16:03.860 --> 16:09.380
to to think of all sides of the question as soon as I believe something passionately I would be

16:09.380 --> 16:14.020
asked to defend the exact opposite position which is a very important exercise that I think no

16:14.020 --> 16:19.860
one should leave school without doing you know this is what you believe speak about it now speak

16:19.860 --> 16:24.980
about and defend the opposite position and we will score you on how well you do that exercise

16:25.780 --> 16:32.900
that is good but it's also about imagination I mean education is drawing out faculties within

16:32.900 --> 16:40.500
people it's not shoveling facts into people that is the reverse of education so I think the emphasis on

16:41.300 --> 16:51.060
you know a cliched caricature would be but it's not unfortunately that far from the truth

16:51.060 --> 16:56.820
you're doing English A level there are six points you must make about Jane Austen you know

16:56.820 --> 17:04.340
to me that is the death of English literature and so is conforming it to current preoccupations

17:04.340 --> 17:10.740
with whatever brilliant we think they are filtering it through isms of you know political

17:10.740 --> 17:17.140
correctness instead of putting all that to the side and simply opening oneself to the incredible gift

17:17.140 --> 17:21.140
of something that somebody created which can work on you in all kinds of ways

17:21.140 --> 17:26.420
that you don't now conceive the more you approach things with preconceptions the worse it is this

17:26.420 --> 17:32.340
this was really interesting watching the documentary you sent over you mentioned identity

17:32.340 --> 17:38.820
politics as a left brain phenomena that it's effectively it's a it's another certainty or it

17:38.820 --> 17:43.860
can become another certainty because what we're doing through that is for example you're taking a

17:43.860 --> 17:48.900
work of literature and you're critiquing it not in the way that it kind of reflects the grandeur of

17:48.900 --> 17:54.180
the human spirit or the developmental journey of the individual it's it's it's about okay how does it

17:54.820 --> 18:00.420
it which immediately diminishes it from that to that yes and can you talk about that and there's

18:00.500 --> 18:05.540
nothing new in it as a left brain as a left brain phenomena i can but i'd also first like to

18:06.500 --> 18:11.140
just gloss your remark because it's interesting i didn't actually mention identity politics anywhere

18:11.140 --> 18:16.420
in the film but what happened you say political correctness or was there some no what happened

18:16.420 --> 18:22.420
was and i didn't know this that in the film as you know roan williams is interviewed and the way

18:22.420 --> 18:27.140
the film was made was i would go and meet somebody we would be filmed talking together and then there

18:27.140 --> 18:31.540
was always a bit where i went out and they just talked to that person because then they were free

18:31.540 --> 18:37.220
to say whatever they wanted to say and a bit that i had never seen until the film was completed

18:37.220 --> 18:46.180
was where roan williams chose for some reason to talk about um the angry black and white views

18:46.180 --> 18:51.540
of people who just know what is right and won't listen to other people and want it legislated

18:51.540 --> 18:58.420
and he just said you you cannot create a better society by legislating this kind of thing we need

18:58.420 --> 19:03.780
to develop a society in which people can have we can listen to one another and have reasonable

19:03.780 --> 19:09.300
conversations and he actually made the point that by trying to stamp out certain things you don't

19:09.300 --> 19:15.620
diminish the anxiety behind it you ramp it up which is exactly what we're seeing which is another

19:15.620 --> 19:22.100
psychological truth of repression yes i mean one of the there are many problems here the one is

19:22.100 --> 19:29.540
the left hand this is far too certain that it knows what's what it's far too clear that things are

19:29.540 --> 19:36.100
unipola that there are just goods whereas you know once you see something that is much clearer

19:36.100 --> 19:41.540
and oriental tradition that everything has comes inevitably with its opposite you don't think

19:41.540 --> 19:47.780
like that anymore it doesn't see things contextually it doesn't see individuals it's not

19:47.780 --> 19:54.340
prepared to listen to another point of view it's just saying this guy i have heard on twitter has

19:54.340 --> 20:00.100
said something you know which is now a sound bite you don't hear all all the rest that went around it

20:00.100 --> 20:05.620
you don't see this as part of somebody's journey that it might be worth listening to you just dismiss

20:06.340 --> 20:14.660
now i believe very strongly once again that it it's not the what it's the how if i've said that

20:14.660 --> 20:20.580
before i'm going to say it again and again in life it is not the what it is the how it's the

20:20.580 --> 20:25.940
disposition you have now i believe it is possible to say anything and i don't think there should be

20:25.940 --> 20:32.660
things that nobody can say i think we should have a system where anyone can say anything but they

20:32.660 --> 20:41.140
must say it in a way that is not inflammatory and that is open to reason and discussion so that

20:41.140 --> 20:46.420
applies to both sides of a political argument and in that same section of the film it made an

20:46.420 --> 20:53.460
interesting point that anger lateralizes to the left brain so that so that if we're in our

20:53.460 --> 20:58.740
sort of left brain certainty anger is the result anger and aggression you know people think the

20:58.740 --> 21:04.420
left hemisphere i mean the old view was when it might be a bit dull but it's terribly reliable

21:04.420 --> 21:10.820
and it's down to earth and it doesn't get emotional well number one it is not down to earth it's

21:10.820 --> 21:18.180
in a fantasy world number two it is not reliable um there's good work coming out of gazaniga's lab

21:18.180 --> 21:23.140
showing you know he was the man who said the right hemisphere has about as much intelligence as a

21:23.220 --> 21:29.540
chimpanzee i mean that was 30 40 years ago but still his lab is now producing wonderful data

21:29.540 --> 21:34.500
showing that the right hemisphere is far more sophisticated at making judgments much more

21:34.500 --> 21:40.660
reliable the left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions is open to bias and in terms of

21:40.660 --> 21:47.060
emotion the left hemisphere is far from devoid of emotion the most lateralizer of all emotions is

21:47.060 --> 21:54.980
anger and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere lateralizes just means what it means that when

21:54.980 --> 22:03.220
people are experiencing anger there is a great increase in activity in the left hemisphere and

22:03.220 --> 22:07.380
you know the chapter and verse for that it's somebody called harm and jones has done a lot of

22:08.660 --> 22:13.380
research into that but the chapter and verse will be in in the master and is in the master

22:13.380 --> 22:20.500
there was a really interesting example with birds and i don't maybe you want to kind of explain

22:20.500 --> 22:25.460
very simply how because that that for me really illustrates the difference between the two the two

22:25.460 --> 22:31.540
ways of of interacting with the world yes well well the um you know human neurosciences were busy

22:31.540 --> 22:37.860
dismissing it the um animal scientists were simply getting on with what science scientists

22:37.860 --> 22:43.700
are supposed to do which was observing and taking note and they noticed that birds and animals

22:43.700 --> 22:51.860
use their two hemispheres for different purposes it's easy to observe in a bird because in most

22:51.860 --> 22:57.780
birds the input from the right eye goes straight to the left hemisphere and the input from the left

22:57.780 --> 23:03.140
eye goes straight to the right hemisphere it's not true of humans it's more complicated but at least

23:03.140 --> 23:07.540
in birds and quite a lot of animals that have eyes on the side of the head you can tell which

23:07.540 --> 23:12.980
hemisphere is engaged by just looking at which eye is being used for this particular moment

23:13.700 --> 23:21.780
and what they noticed was that birds and animals reliably seem to use their left hemisphere for

23:21.780 --> 23:28.180
latching on to a small detail like i need to pick up that piece of seed on the background of grid

23:29.780 --> 23:36.660
and they use their right hemisphere the left eye for everything else for who others are around

23:36.740 --> 23:42.500
is there a predator um is my mate nearby because i would like to share this all that contextual

23:42.500 --> 23:49.140
information is the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere is literally seeing a tiny piece of

23:49.140 --> 23:58.660
reality now that was in itself an aha moment i could see that this if this was in any way true

23:58.660 --> 24:06.020
about humans it would have colossal implications because i have a background in philosophy and i

24:06.020 --> 24:11.700
know that attention changes the world so if there's a big difference in attention one is

24:12.260 --> 24:17.620
fragmentary piecemeal narrow the other is broad sustained and vigilant they're going to

24:18.820 --> 24:24.820
see two different realities and so that got me into then looking at the human history and lo and

24:24.820 --> 24:31.220
behold this difference is very marked in human beings so if people have a right hemisphere stroke

24:31.220 --> 24:36.740
they can have this pathological narrowing of the window of attention like looking the wrong way

24:36.740 --> 24:43.140
down the telescope and you're the sort of the grand theory as well is that we are in a world that

24:43.140 --> 24:48.740
has concentrated more and more and more on this narrow atomistic mechanical way of looking at the

24:48.740 --> 24:57.380
world and neglecting the more holistic the more um relational aspects well it seems to me and that's

24:57.380 --> 25:02.260
the subject of a book i'm now writing that actually we don't start from things and then have to

25:02.260 --> 25:07.460
work out how they relate and how this thing this billiard ball hits that one and so on but in fact

25:07.460 --> 25:18.420
that there are very broad patterns and flows in the world and that what we call things are the

25:18.420 --> 25:25.220
sort of bits that stand out to our attention their little nexuses if you like that go oh i

25:25.220 --> 25:30.580
recognise that little familiar thing that i'm going to call that a but actually everything is

25:30.580 --> 25:36.580
part of a larger picture and the trouble with focusing on detail is not only do you miss the

25:36.580 --> 25:45.060
overall meaning the overall purpose the overall connection the way in which this has ramifications

25:45.060 --> 25:51.060
the bits that are not explicit the thing that is not in the spotlight which is everything else

25:51.060 --> 25:56.180
but you also think that you can understand the world by taking one thing and putting it

25:56.180 --> 26:01.940
with another and building it up as you'd build a meccano set or you know mend the bike in the

26:01.940 --> 26:12.260
garage but the world is not like that i wrote down from the rsa animation left abstraction power

26:12.260 --> 26:18.420
to manipulate the already known fixed static isolated decontextualised explicit ultimately

26:18.500 --> 26:24.900
lifeless right individual changing evolved interconnected implicit incarnate living

26:24.900 --> 26:31.140
never entirely known and that reminded me very much of what martin buber talked about that we

26:31.140 --> 26:36.020
have the i it relationships of the i thou relationships which i found very profound i

26:36.020 --> 26:40.740
also studied philosophy when i was when i was at university and that that really stuck with me that

26:40.740 --> 26:45.620
there are two different types of relationships we can have in the world one the i thou is essentially

26:46.260 --> 26:50.980
there is an unknown ability about that relationship is that something do you think that maps on

26:50.980 --> 26:58.340
absolutely and there is also a reciprocity in the i thou relationship whereas in the i it relationship

26:58.340 --> 27:04.260
it's a unidirectional one which is about power and influence whereas the other one is about

27:04.260 --> 27:11.540
a reverberative responsive coming into being of something so that is a very important distinction

27:11.620 --> 27:17.780
and i relate the i thou and the i it to the evolution of language we won't have time to because

27:17.780 --> 27:23.700
it's a long story but it's in the book but in brief i believe that language emerged from

27:24.660 --> 27:30.340
what you might call music in other words the music of speech the sounds and that

27:31.380 --> 27:38.660
denotative language is a kind of special set of a much more richly embedded embodied

27:38.740 --> 27:46.260
connotative way of communicating and that it became necessary when we were no longer in groups

27:46.260 --> 27:54.020
where you were largely just talking i to thou but we're talking about a third party or something

27:54.020 --> 28:01.060
else we had designs on and so that is how where language becomes very important i've seen your work

28:01.060 --> 28:06.660
reference in many many different places particularly by people who are talking about the

28:06.660 --> 28:12.500
more spiritual the more even an author called gary lackman i don't know if you're aware of him

28:12.500 --> 28:19.940
so he he's written a series of books about the the hidden occult history of western thought

28:19.940 --> 28:24.660
and he uses your work as a way of saying as a way of kind of maybe giving it scientific

28:24.660 --> 28:29.700
respectability or at least explaining this could be a process that we're going through these

28:29.700 --> 28:36.340
these more holistic ways of knowing have never been part of the western kind of mainstream

28:36.340 --> 28:42.740
traddition and maybe that's because of the right brain left brain split do you do you agree with that

28:43.220 --> 28:46.980
well i think there is not true that they've not been present in the tradition

28:50.100 --> 28:56.260
i know what he's talking about but they're very much present in pre-socratic philosophy

28:57.300 --> 29:03.220
as we know something very important and i think very damaging happened to western philosophy

29:03.220 --> 29:13.060
with Plato and Aristotle and particularly with Plato um but these other aspects in the west

29:13.060 --> 29:19.540
have been more expressed in our extremely powerful music uh one thing you can say about western

29:19.540 --> 29:26.980
civilization it in many ways it's it lacks the wisdom of oriental civilization but it has produced

29:27.060 --> 29:36.100
colossally rich music and so it also produced you know Shakespeare so i would say our art

29:37.540 --> 29:44.420
is where it has been expressed but when we start doing philosophy we're like well we've got to make

29:44.420 --> 29:49.860
this consistent and i see that and it goes in there and this bit leads to that and whereas

29:50.740 --> 29:54.900
you're you're therefore as as i say sort of building things up from little certainties

29:55.460 --> 29:59.300
well the first thing is there are no certainties to start from they're intuitive

29:59.300 --> 30:05.140
you have to start from axioms reason is based on intuition and it ends in intuition

30:07.060 --> 30:11.540
um so i think there are those elements of there but they have been

30:12.580 --> 30:19.380
sidelined and neglected the key thing one must remember about the left hemisphere

30:19.380 --> 30:25.540
is that it's it's bright enough but not very bright it doesn't really see that there are things

30:25.540 --> 30:33.780
that it doesn't know um it's so hermetic its world is so self contained and consistent and

30:33.780 --> 30:38.420
self referential that it doesn't feel the need of anything else because it's not sensing that there's

30:38.420 --> 30:46.500
something bigger the right hemisphere sees what is implicit what is going on not just in the foreground

30:46.580 --> 30:52.900
but in the in the background in the context in all these things that are everything that we really

30:52.900 --> 31:04.500
value love and art and we used to value spiritual truths these things are only approachable in an

31:04.500 --> 31:10.260
indirect implicit way and as soon as you start to say well we need to pin this down and make it

31:10.260 --> 31:18.420
certain you're already on the wrong track so i think that's gary's right to point to that

31:18.980 --> 31:23.700
it's just that i think there's more to the story and you you talked about um that

31:24.740 --> 31:30.100
rationality begins in intuition so well yes it has to i mean in fact it begins in intuition

31:30.100 --> 31:36.580
in two ways one is that um we we can't rationally prove why reason is a helpful tool

31:36.580 --> 31:43.220
we intuit that it is a useful tool but secondly when we begin reasoning we have to begin from

31:43.220 --> 31:50.340
quite a host of assumptions science officially claims to make no assumptions in fact makes

31:50.340 --> 31:56.660
quite a few assumptions before it gets started it has to that's not a criticism the system can't

31:56.660 --> 32:03.060
work without somewhere to start because nothing can be supported on nothing it has to be on something

32:03.060 --> 32:11.140
before it can get started so that's what i mean and it also ends in intuition because the results

32:11.140 --> 32:17.940
of reasoning have to be reintegrated into a broader picture so it's an intermediary tool

32:18.740 --> 32:25.300
reason and indeed the left hemisphere is an intermediary tool one way of thinking of it

32:25.300 --> 32:31.700
is it's like this when you learn a musical instrument you're first attracted to a piece of

32:31.700 --> 32:37.620
music in a broad sort of way then you start trying to play it and you realise you have to go

32:37.620 --> 32:42.900
over and over the fingering in bar 18 and you know there's a return to the dominant at bar 32

32:42.900 --> 32:48.580
or whatever it is but then when you've done all that that's not time wasted but when you come to

32:48.580 --> 32:53.860
perform it if you're still thinking like that you can't perform the relationship with the hemispheres

32:53.860 --> 32:58.740
is a bit like that the immediate grasp of something that the overall take on it is right

32:58.820 --> 33:03.860
hemisphere the left hemisphere then gets to work and does procedural matters but then it's the

33:03.860 --> 33:08.740
right hemisphere that must reintegrate that information that is not lost that process was

33:08.740 --> 33:14.340
valuable but it mustn't stop there in a nutshell i think in our society we stop with the light

33:14.340 --> 33:20.020
left hemisphere we don't allow it to be reintegrated into a much bigger richer picture which is in

33:20.020 --> 33:25.860
touch with all the stuff that the left hemisphere doesn't know it doesn't know this reminds me quite

33:25.860 --> 33:34.020
a lot of richard tarnas who yes who i'm afraid i haven't read yeah no i i he his book had a huge

33:34.020 --> 33:40.340
impact on me when i was when i was at university but but effectively he said that he told the story

33:40.340 --> 33:45.700
of western philosophy and said that it had become more and more isolating more and more a prison of

33:45.700 --> 33:51.620
the intellect and that the way out would be to re-embrace intuition re-embrace direct knowledge

33:51.620 --> 33:57.940
and that we couldn't get out until we did um so it just it seems that it maps on very very clearly

33:57.940 --> 34:05.300
to to the picture that you're you're painting yes um the that's right and the other thing one ought

34:05.300 --> 34:13.620
to say is that philosophy has made strides in the last couple of hundred years and i think that

34:13.620 --> 34:24.660
um there's been a redressing of that particularly in early on in in hegel and in the the german idealist

34:24.660 --> 34:34.020
victor shelling and so forth uh to an extent in nature who's a mad genius um but mainly in the

34:34.020 --> 34:44.980
traddition of two uh two groups one is the american pragmatists uh cspers uh william james

34:44.980 --> 34:54.500
and john jewell and the other is the um phenomenological tradition in europe uh heiligur uh

34:54.500 --> 35:03.540
melaponte sheila hustle to a degree uh so i think and the later vittgenstein would fit with that

35:03.540 --> 35:10.980
the earlier vittgenstein uh not you there was a comment on the rsa video from a physicist

35:11.620 --> 35:18.580
who said that he found it very useful in looking at why they were so far away from coming up with

35:18.580 --> 35:23.140
a theory of everything because his sense was that they're looking at the individual details and

35:23.140 --> 35:29.700
not looking at the whole does that make sense it certainly does and i hadn't seen that um comment

35:29.700 --> 35:36.340
but um well one of the gratifying things has been the number of physicists who have written

35:36.340 --> 35:42.820
to me saying uh there are enormous resonances between your work and what we are doing in physics

35:43.940 --> 35:50.820
i'm um far too unskilled to to recognise those although i have an idea of the shape of what

35:50.820 --> 35:55.780
they're talking about and recently i've been trying to equate myself with quantum field theory

35:55.780 --> 36:03.940
which is actually a very interesting development out of quantum mechanics um and i will try to write a bit

36:03.940 --> 36:10.100
about that in my current book but only after running it by some very kind physicist friends

36:11.060 --> 36:19.700
but i think what is um important is that what i'm saying if it is true will apply to everything

36:19.700 --> 36:24.420
because it's about the nature of reality and the people who are at the cold face of reality

36:24.420 --> 36:31.060
are poets and physicists and you know they have written to me saying uh how how much they feel

36:31.060 --> 36:38.260
a resonance but what has struck me is that people that i didn't expect like lawyers and people in the

36:38.260 --> 36:45.300
world of finance and economists you know are some of my most um frequent correspondents because

36:45.300 --> 36:52.340
they say what you're describing is exactly the problems in our realm so i'm delighted because

36:52.340 --> 36:59.620
i've never had the slightest belief or hope that this could happen but that what i'm saying has

36:59.620 --> 37:12.500
been picked up by people in all walks of life

37:22.340 --> 37:23.700
you
