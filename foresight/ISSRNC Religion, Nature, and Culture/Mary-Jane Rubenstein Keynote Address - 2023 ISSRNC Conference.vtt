00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
Dr. Mary Jane Rubinstein is a professor of religion and science in society at Wesleyan

00:06.280 --> 00:11.520
University and is affiliated with the philosophy department and the feminist gender and sexuality

00:11.520 --> 00:12.920
studies program there.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.920
She holds a BA from Williams College, an M. Phil from Cambridge University, and a PhD

00:17.920 --> 00:20.800
from Columbia University.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.900
Her research unearths the philosophies and histories of religion and science, especially

00:24.900 --> 00:29.000
in relation to cosmology, ecology, and space travel.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.640
She is the author of Astro Topia, The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race, which

00:33.640 --> 00:39.760
you'll be hearing, I think, some material from that book more or less this afternoon.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.600
That book just came out from University of Chicago in 2022, and I highly recommend it.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.920
I think it's one of the first works of yours that seems to me to make a more explicit connection

00:49.920 --> 00:56.880
between thinking about space, cosmology, astronomy, and actually, I would say, ethics, but at

00:56.880 --> 01:00.840
least the environment in a much more explicit way.

01:00.840 --> 01:08.220
Pantheologies, excuse me, God's Worlds and Monsters, Columbia University Press 2018,

01:08.220 --> 01:12.200
Worlds Without End, the lives, many lives of the universe, I'm sorry, the multiverse,

01:12.200 --> 01:17.480
which is the book that just received the Iris Award this afternoon, if you missed that.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.280
Congratulations.

01:19.280 --> 01:25.580
And Strange Wonder, the closure of metaphysics in the opening of all Columbia University

01:25.580 --> 01:31.140
Press 2009, which, for me, was a book that I came across when I also became very interested

01:31.140 --> 01:34.940
in wonder and started writing about wonder, and then I came across, I think, first, an

01:34.940 --> 01:38.860
article of yours, and then your book, and I thought, sure, you said like everything

01:38.860 --> 01:43.940
that I wanted to say, which keeps happening, keeps happening with everything that I'm interested

01:43.940 --> 01:48.340
in, I think, ah, well, Ruben Steiner, you did it.

01:48.340 --> 01:55.380
She's also, and of course, she just won the 2022 Iris Award for her book that I mentioned

01:55.380 --> 02:00.780
earlier from 2014, Worlds Without End, the many lives of the multiverse, so.

02:00.780 --> 02:06.880
And she's also involved currently in a project called Sacred Space, Religion, and Cosmic

02:06.880 --> 02:12.260
Exploration, which is a series, or involves a series of webinars with Lance Garabi, and

02:12.260 --> 02:17.420
this is through the Interplanetary Initiative here at Arizona State University.

02:17.420 --> 02:22.660
So please join me in welcoming our keynote speaker, Dr. Mary Jane Rubenstein, and we'll

02:22.660 --> 02:27.380
have some time for questions and comments afterwards, but we will have to also clear

02:27.380 --> 02:30.740
out of this room quickly to prepare for our evening festivities.

02:30.740 --> 02:40.100
So welcome, Dr. Rubenstein.

02:40.100 --> 02:46.700
Thank you so much, Lisa, and thank you to Lisa and to Amanda Nichols and to Evan Berry for

02:46.700 --> 02:52.180
getting together this just beautiful gathering of lovely people.

02:52.180 --> 02:58.180
I have never been to the ISS RNC, this is my first time here, and I am just taken by

02:58.180 --> 03:03.100
the collegiality and warmth and generosity of everybody here, so I'm so grateful for

03:03.100 --> 03:07.140
the community here and for the welcome that you've given me.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.140
Thank you all so much.

03:09.140 --> 03:16.460
Quick zero item, Jacob Boss and I seem to be wearing the same dress, our slides are,

03:16.460 --> 03:22.500
have the same background, because what else, but so anyway, great slides look alike.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.580
I'm sorry, Jacob, that I, that, you know, I hope that that's okay with you.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.620
Okay, I'm going to start with a tune up.

03:29.620 --> 03:37.300
I'd like to open by considering the title of our joint endeavor this weekend, After

03:37.300 --> 03:38.820
Earth.

03:38.820 --> 03:43.980
Each of us could endlessly turn this little stone of a prepositional phrase and reveal

03:44.020 --> 03:50.460
in it all manner of meanings, but to me there are three that most readily announce themselves.

03:50.460 --> 03:55.340
The first is the sense of after Earth as straightforwardly temporal.

03:55.340 --> 04:00.540
There has been Earth and there either will or won't be something after it.

04:00.540 --> 04:06.140
So I'll be talking today about plans to move some portion of humanity and human productions

04:06.140 --> 04:12.060
off this planet and onto another, plans that will allegedly allow the species to embark

04:12.140 --> 04:14.900
on an eternal cosmic future.

04:14.900 --> 04:20.780
These are instances of after Earth in its most proddingly sequential sense.

04:20.780 --> 04:26.420
It's the kind of thinking we find in the post-apocalyptic Will and Jaden Smith film that shares a title

04:26.420 --> 04:32.940
with our conference or in Interstellar with its somber, destinal tagline, mankind was

04:32.940 --> 04:37.700
born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.

04:37.700 --> 04:43.740
The second sense of after Earth as it resounds in my particular ears is ontological, taking

04:43.740 --> 04:49.980
its lead from Bill McKibbin's suggestion that what we are living on and as is no longer

04:49.980 --> 04:57.940
Earth, rather than a self-regulating, broadly homeostatic, Gyanic symbiont, the planet has

04:57.940 --> 05:05.180
become a convulsing set of mutually destabilizing systems that McKibbin calls Earth as if the

05:05.180 --> 05:09.620
planet itself were groaning and wailing at us.

05:09.620 --> 05:14.980
And third, you knew I'd do this, you can't be a continental dweeb and not do this, third

05:14.980 --> 05:18.900
is the sense of being in pursuit of Earth.

05:18.900 --> 05:23.500
And it's this sense I'd ultimately like to consider as a possible horizon.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.180
Here's some hildegard to help us.

05:26.180 --> 05:31.860
What if we thought of Earth as what we're after, as what we want, what we desire, what

05:31.860 --> 05:33.820
we're trying for?

05:33.820 --> 05:39.140
Thackeray uses the preposition in this sense when he speaks of an abiding tenderness in

05:39.140 --> 05:45.220
the newcomer's most worthy titular kernel with that fidelity which was an instinct of

05:45.220 --> 05:47.260
his nature, writes Thackeray.

05:47.260 --> 05:53.100
The brave young man thought ever of his absent child and longed after him.

05:53.100 --> 05:59.540
What if Earth were what we long after, what we care about as in she asked after the health

05:59.540 --> 06:00.980
of my mother?

06:00.980 --> 06:07.580
What if it's not speed or comfort or even love that we're after, but Earth itself?

06:07.580 --> 06:13.420
In the human condition, Hannah Arendt reminds us that the word human is etymologically inextricable

06:13.420 --> 06:14.860
from humus.

06:14.860 --> 06:19.020
To be human is to be earthly, earthish, earthen.

06:19.020 --> 06:25.260
In this particular sense, then, it's actually incoherent to speak of humans living in space.

06:25.260 --> 06:30.260
Once we figure out how to build communities elsewhere, we will be post-human, post-humus

06:30.540 --> 06:36.020
or rendered more optimistically by my colleague Lance Garave, astro sapien.

06:36.020 --> 06:42.260
If we ever actually move to the moon or Mars, we will, along this interpretation, be a different

06:42.260 --> 06:43.260
species.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.980
We will no longer be human.

06:44.980 --> 06:50.460
And in fact, Elena Roche argued earlier this afternoon that we're already no longer human.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.620
We're already something else.

06:52.620 --> 06:58.260
Then again, to cite Eleanor Craig's riff on Sylvia Winter, we have in an important sense

06:58.260 --> 07:00.460
never been human.

07:00.460 --> 07:07.060
After all, the imperial culture that has defined humanity in its own image has been so ruthlessly

07:07.060 --> 07:12.500
inhumane that the concept collapses under its own colonial freight.

07:12.500 --> 07:18.660
Ben again again, as Winter herself insists, the dehumanized have always invented new ways

07:18.660 --> 07:23.180
of being human that transform the terms of that term.

07:23.180 --> 07:28.460
In particular, by refusing humanity's frenetic self-distinction from the animal-vegetable

07:28.460 --> 07:34.960
mineral world, along with the frenetic Abrahamic distinction between this world and divinity.

07:34.960 --> 07:40.060
In this sense, we might think of being after the human and being after Earth as entangled

07:40.060 --> 07:45.740
projects, and here I'm indebted to Carol Wayne White, for whom becoming human would

07:45.740 --> 07:52.020
also mean becoming more than human, which is to say both earthen and sacred, and as such

07:52.020 --> 07:57.140
totally bound up with the more than human world that constitutes us, and that we in

07:57.140 --> 08:00.580
turn both create and destroy.

08:00.580 --> 08:06.020
All of these senses of after Earth can be found uncannily composted in the funeral

08:06.020 --> 08:11.420
litany of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, whose familiar ashes-to-ashes dust-to-dust

08:11.420 --> 08:17.940
is preceded by the phrase Earth to Earth, a rare orthodox admission that the Earth is

08:17.940 --> 08:19.860
our Alpha and Omega.

08:19.860 --> 08:27.260
We come both from it and to it, which is to say we're both after it and after it.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.940
This afternoon evening I'll be focusing on the first temporal, arguably least interesting

08:32.940 --> 08:38.600
sense I have just sketched of after Earth, in the hopes of opening onto the last aspirational

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
sense of it.

08:39.600 --> 08:45.060
I'll spend most of my time unveiling the new workings of what Amber Lowe theorized yesterday

08:45.060 --> 08:52.220
as the master's clock, that is the unrelenting teleology of settler colonialism that's now

08:52.220 --> 08:56.280
urging us to go grab new land and exploit after Earth.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.260
It's a shocking instance, I'll use this term again of what Alfred North Whitehead called

09:01.260 --> 09:07.620
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, namely the notion that living after Earth means abandoning

09:07.620 --> 09:13.420
it by boarding rocket ships and building new homes in underground Martian bunkers and

09:13.420 --> 09:16.100
orbital space colonies.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.620
Especially for the theatrically inclined, it's a fascinating story.

09:19.620 --> 09:24.180
Honestly, if I were feeling more playful, I'd suggest we turn the whole thing into a comedy

09:24.180 --> 09:29.740
of errors, call it the fallacy of misplaced concrete, and run it in a Gilbert and Sullivan

09:29.740 --> 09:30.740
theater.

09:30.740 --> 09:36.660
The problem is, I can't find this particular story funny for too long, because regardless

09:36.660 --> 09:43.060
of whether Elon Musk ever makes it to Mars, or Jeff Bezos actually builds a paradise between

09:43.060 --> 09:49.380
the moon and New York City, they and their astroprenerial cohort can do a monstrous amount

09:49.380 --> 09:54.180
of ecological damage to and beyond the Earth in the meantime.

09:54.180 --> 10:00.820
The key then, will be to expose the temporal fallacy of the messianic edge of new space,

10:00.820 --> 10:08.340
and to turn the sequential otherworldly after Earth into a passionate thisworldly one.

10:08.340 --> 10:15.460
And let me apologize for Sarah McFarland-Taylor and my spending this much energy on Elon

10:15.460 --> 10:17.420
Musk today.

10:17.420 --> 10:23.660
As you will see, our papers start from very similar places, diverge along totally different

10:23.660 --> 10:24.660
sources.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.540
Sarah's sources are just stunning, and thank you so much for them, and arrive at the same

10:28.540 --> 10:29.540
conclusion.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.460
So this only means to me that we must be right.

10:32.460 --> 10:38.380
So thank you again, Sarah, for your beautiful meticulous and fun paper this morning.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.700
Part one.

10:40.700 --> 10:47.460
On October 23rd, 2020, one day after the final presidential debate, and seven months into

10:47.460 --> 10:53.540
an epidemiological nightmare that had closed schools, crippled local businesses, killed

10:53.540 --> 11:00.500
hundreds of thousands of Americans, and made most parents into psychopaths, the GOP tweeted

11:00.500 --> 11:04.020
a final distillation of its campaign platform.

11:04.020 --> 11:07.740
Prez Trump is fighting for you, it exclaimed.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.380
Here are some of his priorities for a second term.

11:10.380 --> 11:14.060
First, establish permanent manned presence on the moon.

11:14.060 --> 11:18.140
Second, send the first manned mission to Mars.

11:18.140 --> 11:22.900
After the moon and Mars came infrastructure and Wi-Fi.

11:22.900 --> 11:30.460
And then, in a follow-up tweet, the GOP promised a COVID vaccine, medical supplies, and pharmaceuticals.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.100
But they clearly wanted the moon and Mars out front.

11:34.100 --> 11:38.380
Who wants to worry about respirators when you can dream about rockets?

11:38.380 --> 11:44.020
You might recall that during his first hundred days in office, President Biden signed 60

11:44.020 --> 11:50.420
executive orders, almost half of which were direct reversals of Trump-era policies.

11:50.420 --> 11:56.380
This administration disagrees with that one on almost everything except outer space.

11:56.380 --> 12:03.500
In fact, the only major Trump-era objectives the Biden administration has retained are first,

12:03.500 --> 12:08.980
the creation of a space force to wage orbital warfare, and second, the plan to settle the

12:08.980 --> 12:13.700
moon and Mars through a new mission they're calling Artemis, after the Greek goddess of

12:13.700 --> 12:17.100
the moon, the twin sister of Apollo.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.780
Why do we need to settle the moon and Mars?

12:19.780 --> 12:26.200
In Biden's non-referential words, because America can do big things, we can see possibilities

12:26.200 --> 12:27.720
no one has seen before.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.080
We can go places no one has ever gone before.

12:31.080 --> 12:36.200
The message was, frankly, clearer in the Trump administration, which insisted that it is America's

12:36.200 --> 12:40.040
duty to spread its influence throughout the universe.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.680
As Trump declared in his last State of the Union address, in reaffirming our heritage

12:44.680 --> 12:50.240
as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.

12:50.240 --> 12:56.080
Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars.

12:56.120 --> 13:01.480
Most of us are numb at this point to the extension of frontier language into space, but like

13:01.480 --> 13:06.320
any dead metaphor, this one conceals far more than it reveals.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.800
We're all indebted to Catherine Newell for having tracked the metaphor of space, the

13:10.800 --> 13:12.520
final frontier.

13:12.520 --> 13:19.400
To the 1952 special issue of Collier's magazine, entitled Man Will Conquer Space Soon, the

13:19.400 --> 13:25.360
lead article written by former Nazi rocket scientist Verne von Braun was called Crossing

13:25.360 --> 13:27.640
the Last Frontier.

13:27.640 --> 13:34.400
In the short years following his amnesty through the CIA's then-secret Operation Paper Clip,

13:34.400 --> 13:40.320
von Braun had become convinced it was America's destiny to extend human civilization into

13:40.320 --> 13:46.880
outer space for the sake of freedom, democracy, and get this eternal salvation.

13:46.880 --> 13:52.560
A little known detail that Catherine reveals about von Braun is that during his denazification

13:52.640 --> 13:59.240
on American soil, he became a born-again Christian, who believed it was incumbent upon American

13:59.240 --> 14:05.080
earthlings to spread the gospel to what he called man's oldest and last frontier, the

14:05.080 --> 14:07.440
heavens themselves.

14:07.440 --> 14:13.200
Space travel, as von Braun saw it and as Trump recently reaffirmed, is a vertical extension

14:13.200 --> 14:19.680
of manifest destiny, just as God allegedly endorsed and even demanded the westward expansion

14:19.680 --> 14:25.000
of mainly white-skinned European-descended Americans in the 19th century.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.680
God is calling Americans in the 20th and 21st centuries to conquer a new frontier, an infinite

14:30.680 --> 14:33.120
frontier in outer space.

14:33.120 --> 14:38.960
Okay, so in February of 2020, Trump says we're going back to the moon and then to Mars because

14:38.960 --> 14:43.520
space is the next frontier and America's manifest destiny is in the stars.

14:43.520 --> 14:48.840
Of course, the language of divinely authorized conquest is nothing new in the American space

14:48.920 --> 14:50.000
program.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.920
The only thing that's unprecedented in this contemporary space race is the extent to

14:54.920 --> 14:59.560
which private industry is involved in this godly conquest.

14:59.560 --> 15:05.560
And for this development, we must thank not Donald Trump, but his ordinarily more palatable

15:05.560 --> 15:08.520
predecessor, Barack Obama.

15:08.520 --> 15:15.240
The key date here is February 1, 2010, when the Obama administration released the 2011

15:15.240 --> 15:21.120
budget for NASA that ended the space shuttle program and reallocated funds to the so-called

15:21.120 --> 15:23.400
new space industries.

15:23.400 --> 15:29.480
It's time, Obama's advisors had written, to consider turning this transport service over

15:29.480 --> 15:31.200
to the commercial sector.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.560
You know, to make rocket ships as mass produced as cars and buses and speedboats and airplanes,

15:36.560 --> 15:38.520
the problem, of course, was funding.

15:38.520 --> 15:43.400
Who would invest in a company dedicated to flying supplies up to the International Space

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
Station?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.880
What would be in it for the shareholders?

15:46.880 --> 15:53.640
The situation for the cosmic prospector seemed grim until November of 2015, when Congress

15:53.640 --> 15:59.560
passed a startlingly bipartisan bill called the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness

15:59.560 --> 16:07.040
Act, which promises, among other things, that any U.S. citizen who recovers a rock or mineral

16:07.040 --> 16:12.280
or quantum of water in space is allowed to own, use, and sell it.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.240
Huzzah, said the investors.

16:14.240 --> 16:19.200
We're saved, said the space mining firms that seem to spring out of a thousand simultaneous

16:19.200 --> 16:20.360
know-heres.

16:20.360 --> 16:27.280
After all, if a corporation is a person, a citizen, even, in U.S. law, then its hypothetical

16:27.280 --> 16:32.240
extractions and uses and sales will be protected under this law.

16:32.240 --> 16:39.600
Elated, the CEO of Moon Express, a lunar mining outfit that collaborates closely with NASA,

16:39.600 --> 16:46.800
went so far as to call the CSLCA the aeronautic equivalent of the Homestead Act.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
Space.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.680
Finally, another frontier for restless white folks.

16:52.680 --> 16:58.880
This economically giddy corporate proliferation has brought us into the era known as new space.

16:58.880 --> 17:04.240
To an already dense field of political, military, technological, and religious reasons to get

17:04.240 --> 17:09.720
America back to space as soon as possible, new space adds the speed and intensity of

17:09.720 --> 17:12.560
unregulated capitalist economics.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.920
And the excitement over this new gold rush in space transcends party lines, unable to

17:17.920 --> 17:20.520
agree on literally anything else.

17:20.520 --> 17:25.200
Our elected officials on the left, center, right, and alt-right snuggle in together to

17:25.200 --> 17:32.280
hand outer space over to these cosmic conquistadors, these astropreneurs whom I've come to think

17:32.280 --> 17:36.320
of as particularly toxic techno-messiahs.

17:36.320 --> 17:43.480
And so Sarah was sketching the three roles of the saint and the messiah and the ... help

17:43.480 --> 17:44.480
me?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.480
The what?

17:45.480 --> 17:46.480
Yes.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Thank you.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.080
And I'm going down the messianic route right here.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.600
To be sure, the astropreneurs don't seem particularly religious.

17:56.600 --> 18:01.800
They lack the rousing scriptural appeals of Mike Pence, who assured us that God was

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
calling America to conquer the heavens.

18:03.800 --> 18:09.440
They can't even muster the civil religiousness of Trump's manifest destiny or Biden's vague

18:09.440 --> 18:11.280
spirit of America.

18:11.280 --> 18:17.080
What they offer instead are promises to make life fun again, to cleanse us of the guilt

18:17.080 --> 18:23.120
of fossil fuels, and above all, to save humanity from eternal death.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.960
How will they accomplish such lofty goals?

18:25.960 --> 18:31.240
By converting the cosmos itself into capital and building a new Jerusalem on the infinite

18:31.240 --> 18:33.520
frontier of outer space.

18:33.520 --> 18:38.160
The world is coming to an end, the messiah cries, but trust in me and I'll bring you

18:38.160 --> 18:41.480
to a new world where you'll finally be free.

18:41.480 --> 18:46.280
Free from death, free from earth, free from guilt and gravity, at least most of it, and

18:46.280 --> 18:49.880
free above all from earthly regulation.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.320
In the meantime, China's got a rover on Mars, a satellite on the far side of the moon, and

18:55.320 --> 18:58.360
a brand new space station in low earth orbit.

18:58.360 --> 19:04.920
Richard Branson is selling 200,000 dollar tourist tickets on his notoriously unreliable

19:04.920 --> 19:06.440
space plane.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.720
Space mining firms have collected billions of dollars before they've even got their

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
probes on an asteroid.

19:12.720 --> 19:18.000
A failed Israeli mission has dumped dehydrated tardigrades on the lunar surface.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.040
Rwanda has bought the rights to launch 300,000 satellites of its own.

19:23.040 --> 19:28.480
The U.S. has created a new branch of the military to pulverize its enemies from the heavens,

19:28.480 --> 19:34.160
and some astronautic startup says it's going to build a ferris wheel-shaped space hotel

19:34.160 --> 19:39.040
in orbit and name it after, wait for it, Werner von Braun.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.800
How did we get here?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.360
What is going on?

19:42.360 --> 19:46.720
And is there anything, you will stay at the von Braun space hotel, like that is the last

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
plate?

19:47.720 --> 19:51.480
Is there anything anyone can do about it?

19:51.480 --> 19:56.640
I first realized something was up when Elon Musk launched a car into orbit.

19:56.640 --> 20:02.840
It was January of 2018, and SpaceX was looking to test its Falcon heavy rocket, woo the U.S.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.720
military, and make sure everybody was watching.

20:05.720 --> 20:11.640
So rather than display the rocket's carrying capacity with, say, slabs of concrete or steel,

20:11.640 --> 20:15.760
Musk decided to strap a blazing red Tesla Roadster to its back.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.840
You will recognize this slide from Sarah's presentation.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.440
A perfectly good, even exquisite car.

20:23.440 --> 20:31.240
$100,000 worth of chrome, leather, steel, glass, state-of-the-art navigation software,

20:31.240 --> 20:38.120
green technology, and human labor hurled uselessly into orbit, not around the Earth, but around

20:38.120 --> 20:39.480
the sun.

20:39.480 --> 20:45.360
It was an act of immense bravado, extraordinary waste, and literally cosmic presumptuousness

20:45.440 --> 20:50.400
Now along with eight planets and some dwarves, moons, and asteroids, there is a tricked-out

20:50.400 --> 20:56.760
convertible circling our solar orb, driven to the end of days by a mannequin in a spacesuit

20:56.760 --> 21:00.760
called Starman.

21:00.760 --> 21:07.120
Musk named his Sisyphean Astro Bot after the alien messiah of David Bowie's 1972 Ziggy

21:07.120 --> 21:09.120
Stardust album.

21:09.120 --> 21:13.760
Bowie's song, Life on Mars, accompanied the rocket launch that flung the Roadster toward

21:13.760 --> 21:21.760
the stars, and his space oddity still loops endlessly on the car's solar-powered JVC speakers.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.800
Starman's glove compartment is stuffed with multimedia versions of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's

21:26.800 --> 21:32.800
Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy, and the Falcon-heavy rocket itself

21:32.800 --> 21:36.000
is named after the millennium Falcon of Star Wars.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.480
Musk, you might say, is a geek's geek.

21:38.560 --> 21:44.000
His aesthetic, composed by a nostalgia for the future of his teenage past, complete with

21:44.000 --> 21:49.680
rockets, spacesuits, Martian colonies, glam rock, and a free-market promise of infinite

21:49.680 --> 21:51.280
possibility.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.880
Musk is also an inveterate showman.

21:53.880 --> 21:59.680
Back in 2003, he was having a hard time getting NASA to take SpaceX and its newly fabricated

21:59.680 --> 22:01.760
Falcon 1 seriously.

22:01.840 --> 22:09.600
He drove the seven-story rocket on an enormous flatbed truck from Boca Chica, Texas, to Washington,

22:09.600 --> 22:15.200
D.C., and parked it on the street outside the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.360
In the two decades since then, Musk has continued to manufacture all manner of mind-blowing

22:21.360 --> 22:27.360
spectacles, Twitter-storm launches, dramatic explosions, tickets sold to billionaires for

22:27.360 --> 22:33.440
trips on unbuilt ships, and a manifesto about his intention to save humanity by getting the

22:33.440 --> 22:35.520
hell off this doomed planet Earth.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.040
Meanwhile, on the other side of Texas, Jeff Bezos has been making a lot less noise.

22:41.600 --> 22:47.200
In the early 2000s, while Musk was dragging NASA, the Air Force, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin

22:47.200 --> 22:52.640
into high-profile antitrust suits, Bezos was quietly buying up ranches.

22:53.280 --> 23:00.560
Under the auspices of improvised corporations, Bezos cobbled together over 300,000 acres of

23:00.560 --> 23:04.560
West Texan land so he could test his rockets without anybody noticing.

23:05.200 --> 23:09.840
Musk had bought the land, too, but he makes so much noise that the Rangers at Mother Neff

23:09.840 --> 23:14.080
State Park now warn their visitors that if something sounds like the end of the world,

23:14.080 --> 23:16.400
it's probably not. At least not yet.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.800
The men are both magicians, but of really different sorts.

23:21.360 --> 23:25.840
Musk pulls rabbits out of hats while Bezos makes the coin disappear behind your ear.

23:26.400 --> 23:32.960
While Musk is shouting, look mom! Wait, that's not it! Bezos hides in his room to perfect the trick.

23:33.520 --> 23:38.480
Both billionaires are building reusable, affordable, state-of-the-art rockets,

23:38.480 --> 23:42.640
but Musk raced to the launches while Bezos worked on the landings.

23:42.720 --> 23:48.320
Elon's had us looking up at the exploding skies while Jeff has kept us staring at our own damn

23:48.320 --> 23:54.560
laps, one clicking the lint rollers and cake pans and dog sweaters that finance his more cosmic

23:54.560 --> 23:58.880
endeavors. As Bezos finally explained a couple of years ago, quote,

23:58.880 --> 24:03.840
every time you buy shoes on Amazon, you're helping Blue Origin. I appreciate it very much,

24:04.480 --> 24:11.200
and suddenly I hate my shoes. Bezos himself articulated the methodological distinction

24:11.200 --> 24:18.240
between Blue Origin and SpaceX in a 2004 letter to his then-tiny aerospace staff.

24:18.240 --> 24:23.280
Be the tortoise, he told them, and not the hare. His motto for the company is

24:23.280 --> 24:32.720
gradatim ferociter, or step-by-step ferociously, a grittier Latinate rendition of slow and steady

24:32.720 --> 24:38.640
wins the race. The phrase is inscribed on banners beneath the company's coat of arms.

24:38.640 --> 24:46.240
It's got a coat of arms, which features two turtles standing on top of a globe reaching

24:46.240 --> 24:52.400
from North America to a gilded solar system. Crowning the image is a cruciform sun.

24:53.120 --> 24:58.480
Anchoring it is a winged hourglass with all the sands run out, and the whole thing looks kind

24:58.480 --> 25:02.720
of like a 15th century cosmographed walked into a Harry Potter fanzine.

25:02.720 --> 25:10.720
More nerd than geek, Bezos reads everything in print, considers even the most outlandish

25:10.720 --> 25:15.520
alternatives before making up his mind, and demands that ideas be pitched to him in full

25:15.520 --> 25:21.840
paragraph form. As we all know, he's a book's guy. In addition to ESOP, his references include

25:21.840 --> 25:26.880
JR, Tolkien, Isaac, Asimov, Jules Verne, E&M Banks, Neil Stevenson, and William Gibson.

25:27.440 --> 25:32.960
Now and then he even mentions a wrinkle in time, the only work by a woman to make the

25:32.960 --> 25:39.200
astropreneurial canon. But when it comes to space, Bezos' biggest influence is Star Trek.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.080
While Musk is off actualizing George Lucas with his exploding falcons and epic soundtracks,

25:46.080 --> 25:52.640
Bezos is cultivating the more genteel gestalt of the star ship Enterprise. As the Atlantic's

25:52.720 --> 25:59.680
Franklin Feuer reports, Bezos initially wanted to call Amazon MakeItSo.com as an homage to Captain

25:59.680 --> 26:09.680
Jean-Luc Picard, whom he now uncannily resembles. Bezos named his dog Kamala in honor of the

26:09.680 --> 26:14.800
empathic metamorph you may remember from Krio's Prime. And as you may have heard about a year

26:14.800 --> 26:20.480
ago, he boldly took William Shatner, where no 90-year-old actor had gone before. Shatner came

26:20.480 --> 26:26.560
back terrified. Let's talk about that later. The question you might be asking is why? What are

26:26.560 --> 26:34.400
these billionaires up to in space? It is old news to you by now. Elon Musk wants us to go to Mars.

26:34.400 --> 26:42.000
In fact, he explained in a 2016 manifesto, it's been his goal all along making humans a

26:42.000 --> 26:48.080
multi-planetary species by setting up a self-sustaining city on the red planet.

26:48.160 --> 26:53.360
To anyone who will listen, Musk explains that Earth is a ticking time bomb. Sooner or later,

26:53.360 --> 26:59.680
something will destroy humanity, whether it be an asteroid, nuclear war, or AI robots gone rogue.

26:59.680 --> 27:04.400
Sooner or later, we're going to have to find somewhere else to live. And given the literally

27:04.400 --> 27:09.600
infernal conditions of Venus, it's like 900 degrees Fahrenheit there, Mars is our best chance.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.000
Catherine explained this morning, the roots of this logic, this coming disaster logic,

27:14.000 --> 27:19.360
are also in Werner von Braun. Of course, five billion years from now,

27:19.360 --> 27:24.240
the sun will explode into a red giant and engulf Earth and Mars in a fiery apocalypse.

27:24.240 --> 27:29.680
So if we want humanity to endure forever, we're eventually going to have to make it to another

27:29.680 --> 27:35.200
solar system. But we'll never be able to live anywhere else unless we start close to home

27:35.200 --> 27:40.480
and soon before a giant asteroid or Alexa 5.0 wipes out the whole species.

27:41.440 --> 27:46.880
At times, Musk seems to realize how much he sounds like that guy on the street with a cardboard

27:46.880 --> 27:52.880
sign for tending the end of the world. Both disavowing and adopting the role of lunatic

27:52.880 --> 27:59.520
prophet, Musk writes, I do not have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but eventually there will be

27:59.520 --> 28:06.320
some doomsday event. With apocalypse on the horizon, our first option is to just let disaster

28:06.400 --> 28:11.600
extinguish us as it did the dinosaurs. An option Musk finds so intolerable,

28:11.600 --> 28:18.000
he never even entertains it. The alternative, he says, is to become a space-bearing civilization

28:18.000 --> 28:23.600
and a multi-planetary species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go. So Mars it is.

28:24.320 --> 28:31.200
The challenge will be making the enterprise affordable-ish. At the moment, Musk shows by

28:31.200 --> 28:38.000
means of a perfectly bizarre Venn diagram, the price to Mars is infinite, leaving the set of

28:38.000 --> 28:43.600
people who want to go to Mars completely distinct from the set of people who can afford to go to Mars.

28:45.040 --> 28:50.400
Using conventional technology, Musk estimates that the price for a round-trip ticket to the

28:50.400 --> 28:58.560
red planet could drop from infinity to $10 billion a person. But once his rockets attain full

28:58.560 --> 29:04.800
reusability and efficiency, Musk predicts he'll be able to lower the cost to $200,000,

29:04.800 --> 29:12.080
the median cost of a house in the United States. At that price, in his words, almost anyone could go

29:12.080 --> 29:18.880
to Mars. All they need to do is save up a bit, sell their house, and pack a very small bag.

29:19.680 --> 29:25.360
Anyone who doesn't have a house to sell can always get sponsored by an employer and pay it off with a

29:25.360 --> 29:33.040
few years of labor as an indentured servant, I swear to the gods he has said this. When it comes

29:33.040 --> 29:39.040
to advertising his new colony, Musk alternates between appealing to aspirational homesteaders

29:39.040 --> 29:45.760
and revving up post-adolescent pub crawlers. On the one hand, he admits Mars is going to be seriously

29:45.760 --> 29:52.080
hard work. Under current conditions, it's impossible to breathe or even just be on the planet without

29:52.080 --> 29:58.080
a spacesuit. Since Mars has so little atmosphere, it would turn all the water in the human body to

29:58.080 --> 30:05.120
steam and kill it instantaneously. Even with a spacesuit, there's so much radiation on Mars

30:05.120 --> 30:11.120
that it will likely cause the colonists severe health problems. So as Musk concedes from time to

30:11.120 --> 30:19.280
time, Mars will be like the Orhan Trail on a really bad day. There's a good chance you'll die, he says.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.720
It's going to be tough going.

30:23.840 --> 30:27.040
On the other hand, and this is the part Musk tends to dwell on,

30:27.040 --> 30:33.760
the Martian Trail is going to be pretty cool. The trip itself will be like an astronaut club med.

30:33.760 --> 30:42.320
A hundred people aboard one 400 foot BFR or big effing rocket for a seven month trip that Musk

30:42.320 --> 30:49.200
insists will never feel cramped or boring. There will be zero gravity games Musk is really into

30:49.200 --> 30:54.800
bouncing around. Plus movies, lecture halls, cabins, and our restaurant. It will be really fun to go,

30:54.800 --> 31:00.560
Musk enthusiasts. You're going to have a great time. Nowhere in these descriptions does Musk explain

31:00.560 --> 31:06.640
who will be staffing the restaurants, cleaning the cabins, or wiping the space vomit off the

31:06.640 --> 31:13.600
gleaming walls of the BFR. Nor does he say who will be giving the lectures. Will it be you?

31:14.320 --> 31:20.240
Will it be me? Extolling the virtues of Sylvia Winter and Robin Wall Kimmerer on a six month

31:20.240 --> 31:28.160
rocket to Mars? As for the planet itself, Musk promises that it would be quite fun to be on Mars

31:28.160 --> 31:32.560
because you would have gravity that's about 37% of that of Earth. So you would be able to lift

31:32.640 --> 31:39.600
many things and bound around. Sure, the air is primarily carbon dioxide, but the same stuff that's

31:39.600 --> 31:45.680
so toxic to humans will make it easy to grow plants, quote, just by compressing the atmosphere,

31:45.680 --> 31:52.000
unquote. Faced with the problem of what he calls the radiation thing, Musk says inexplicably that

31:52.000 --> 31:57.520
it's not too big of a deal. And although he understands that Mars is a little cold, the

31:57.520 --> 32:03.280
average temperature is negative 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is to say over 100 degrees

32:03.280 --> 32:12.000
below freezing. He assures his future colonists that we can warm it up. How exactly do you warm

32:12.000 --> 32:17.840
up a frozen planet? You stick it in the microwave, hit the airspace above the ice caps with some

32:17.840 --> 32:22.720
hydrogen bombs, and you'll jumpstart the global warming process, liberate tons of water and move

32:22.720 --> 32:29.280
the Martian colony that much closer to autonomy. To be sure, most scientists think this is an

32:29.280 --> 32:35.680
absolutely ridiculous plan. The director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos has estimated

32:35.680 --> 32:44.160
it would take more than 10,000 missiles to carry out the nuke Mars. 10,000 Musk's response on Twitter,

32:44.720 --> 32:53.120
no problem. If you're furrowing your brow at this fantasy of planetary hacking,

32:53.120 --> 32:59.040
you're not alone. As astrobiologist Lucienne Walkowitz reminds us, we don't have a great

32:59.040 --> 33:05.200
track record of controlling geological processes on the planet we've already got. How can we hope to

33:05.200 --> 33:11.680
make a habitat out of Mars when we can't even preserve the habitability of Earth? It would seem

33:11.680 --> 33:17.920
that recalibrating the biosystems of an already oxygenated, temperate, blue-green orb would be

33:17.920 --> 33:25.920
a far easier task than bringing a planetary dust storm to life. When asked why he is choosing to

33:25.920 --> 33:31.840
save humanity by sending us to Mars rather than by addressing injustice, poverty, and climate

33:31.840 --> 33:38.480
change on Earth, Musk will often laugh and say, please forgive the direct quotation, fuck Earth.

33:38.560 --> 33:45.760
Earth is done. Earth is history. Earth is so last eon. Considering the coral reefs, wet lands,

33:45.760 --> 33:51.840
and clean skies that SpaceX has polluted and destroyed, and considering Musk's own advancement

33:51.840 --> 33:58.080
of artificial intelligence, one could even accuse him of worsening the disaster to intensify the

33:58.080 --> 34:04.480
need for salvation, of making the planet genuinely uninhabitable so that we will indeed need to leave

34:04.480 --> 34:12.800
it for an after-Earth Martian utopia. Unlike the more classic utopians, Plato, Moore, Marx, and Engels,

34:13.440 --> 34:18.560
Musk doesn't give us a clear idea of what his ideal society looks like. What he offers instead are

34:18.560 --> 34:24.160
abstract promises of freedom from Earth, from international regulation, from gravity, and even

34:24.160 --> 34:29.200
from death, at least at the level of the species. He hasn't hammered out the details because the

34:29.200 --> 34:37.280
details would destroy the perfection, but it's going to be awesome on Mars. Part four. Jeff Bezos

34:37.280 --> 34:44.480
isn't so sure. To my friends who want to move to Mars one day, Bezos reports, I say, why don't you go

34:44.480 --> 34:49.280
live in Antarctica first for three years and then see what you think? Because Antarctica is a garden

34:49.280 --> 34:55.760
paradise compared to Mars. We have sent probes to every planet in the solar system, says Bezos,

34:55.760 --> 35:00.720
and believe me, Earth is the best one. There are waterfalls and beaches and palm trees and

35:00.720 --> 35:05.360
fantastic cities and restaurants, and you're not going to get that anywhere but Earth for a really,

35:05.360 --> 35:12.880
really long time. So if Musk is happy to leave Earth in the dust, Bezos is set on saving it.

35:12.880 --> 35:18.960
If Musk named his SpaceX after the place he'd like to go, Bezos named Blue Origin after the

35:18.960 --> 35:25.920
place he'll always be from, this gem of a planet called Earth. How then will Bezos restore and

35:25.920 --> 35:32.960
preserve the blueness of our origin, the beauty of our Earth, by getting us off the planet? The

35:32.960 --> 35:38.720
problem for Bezos is energy. We're using too much of it. Given an expanding and modernizing human

35:38.720 --> 35:44.800
population, global industrial humanity will reach some absolute limits within the next century.

35:44.800 --> 35:49.920
There's simply not enough fuel, whether from the ground, the wind, or even the sun as it's

35:49.920 --> 35:55.520
accessible on Earth, to power a whole planet's worth of first-rate hospitals, bleeding-edge

35:55.520 --> 36:02.320
electronics, megachurches, superstores, slaughterhouses, and industrial farms. We need more energy,

36:02.320 --> 36:08.640
so we've got to go to space. So the old Marxist adage is true. It's easier to imagine the end

36:08.640 --> 36:13.840
of the world than the end of capitalism, rather than proposing an alternative to the extraction

36:13.920 --> 36:19.680
of resources, the relentless pursuit of profit, and the wasteful cruelty of factory farming.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.920
Rather than use the funds he calls his Amazon winnings to win back the actual Amazon,

36:26.560 --> 36:32.240
Bezos is spending all that money and time exporting the whole ecosystem into space.

36:32.800 --> 36:38.480
Here's the way it'll work. Rather than checking out all the way to Mars, which is too far,

36:38.480 --> 36:45.600
Bezos proposes we construct a series of bases on the Moon. We install solar panels on every base,

36:45.600 --> 36:50.720
gaining access to far more solar energy than we could ever harness on Earth. We mine the Moon

36:50.720 --> 36:56.400
for water, whose elements can be split and recombined into rocket fuel. Using far less energy than we

36:56.400 --> 37:02.560
need at Cape Canaveral, we power many missions to mine asteroids for heavy and rare Earth metals,

37:02.560 --> 37:08.480
at which point we begin to construct miles-long, free-floating habitations between the Earth

37:08.480 --> 37:15.040
and the Moon. Yes, you've heard that right, giant space pods. The idea comes from Gerard O'Neill,

37:15.760 --> 37:21.280
the Princeton physicist who began proposing in the mid-19th century that all heavy industry

37:21.280 --> 37:27.680
and much of the human population be moved into space. Mines and factories would occupy asteroids

37:27.680 --> 37:33.440
and the Moon, while residents, recreation and commerce would take place in giant cylindrical

37:33.440 --> 37:40.800
tubes rotating to simulate gravity and positioned at Lagrange points to maintain a steady orbit.

37:41.840 --> 37:46.480
Having attended O'Neill's lectures in college, Bezos remains a devotee.

37:46.480 --> 37:52.560
This is Maui on its best day all year long, he says. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.

37:53.120 --> 37:57.680
In our climate-controlled Edens, we'd have everything we love on Earth, like air,

37:57.680 --> 38:02.560
tree, birds and beaches, but nothing we hate. O'Neill, infamously promised,

38:02.560 --> 38:08.240
we'd finally be free of mosquitoes. And in the meantime, Mother Earth would get a long overdue nap.

38:09.040 --> 38:13.520
With all heavy industry and a good deal of humanity relocated off-planet,

38:13.520 --> 38:18.880
the Earth could be zoned for light industry, some residents and recreation. In short, Earth

38:18.880 --> 38:23.360
would become a planetary park, a great vacation spot, a lovely place to go to college.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.560
Meanwhile, out in space, humans would get to play as many video games, have as many kids,

38:28.560 --> 38:34.800
and eat as much red meat as they want, powered by limitless energy. According to Bezos' calculations,

38:34.800 --> 38:41.360
an O'Neill-hacked solar system could in principle support one trillion human beings.

38:41.360 --> 38:47.120
That's a thousand Mozart's, he marvels. A thousand Einstein's. What a cool civilization that would be.

38:47.920 --> 38:52.560
It seems a cheap but necessary shot to point out that by this dopey logic,

38:52.560 --> 38:57.360
we would also gain a thousand Hitler's and a thousand Stalin's. But Bezos is leaving it

38:57.360 --> 39:01.920
to the next generation to work out the details. How are we going to build O'Neill colonies,

39:01.920 --> 39:07.440
out of what materials, under what sort of political systems? Bezos has no idea. He's here to build

39:07.440 --> 39:12.080
the infrastructure so that the big thinkers of the future can hammer out the details.

39:13.040 --> 39:19.280
In short, Bezos will establish the extraterrestrial roads and bridges so that the future dreamers

39:19.280 --> 39:25.920
can figure out what to do with them. Bezos will pave the way for future Bezos' and Zuckerberg's,

39:25.920 --> 39:30.960
and even future Musk's, once they've had enough of those radioactive dust storms on Mars.

39:32.800 --> 39:40.080
So these are our two post-terrestrial utopias. Fuck Earth and Occupy Mars versus Save Earth

39:40.080 --> 39:45.840
by drilling the universe. Of course, both of these visions are a long way off.

39:45.840 --> 39:51.440
So far, no one's been to Mars. No one's mined an asteroid or built a rotating space cylinder,

39:51.440 --> 39:56.320
and it's been half a century since anybody walked on the moon. But in the meantime,

39:56.320 --> 40:02.320
the new space nicks are already making a total mess. Musk has filled his allotted altitude in

40:02.320 --> 40:08.080
low Earth orbit with so many Starlink satellites that he's edging into the territory allocated

40:08.160 --> 40:14.000
to Amazon. Astronomers and space ecologists keep warning that between dead satellites,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.960
live satellites, paint chips, lost tools, shrapnel, old cameras, and the International

40:18.960 --> 40:25.120
Space Station, there's just too much stuff up there. At speeds of 18,000 miles per hour,

40:25.120 --> 40:30.480
the collision of anything with anything else is disastrous, and despite our steady ability to

40:30.480 --> 40:37.120
produce this deadly litter, we have absolutely no way to clean it up. The most promising idea so far,

40:37.120 --> 40:42.160
which failed spectacularly the one time it was tested, is that we might be able to snag some

40:42.160 --> 40:51.920
passing garbage with a harpoon. A harpoon. It's like wailing, technology. The scene in space is

40:51.920 --> 40:58.880
total chaos, and yet Bezos, Musk, and a growing cadre of smaller-time astropreneurs continue

40:58.880 --> 41:04.960
unfazed, promising thousands more satellites, suborbital tourism, orbital tourism, private

41:04.960 --> 41:11.280
space stations, space hotels, and gazillion-dollar asteroids, all as multifarious means to our

41:11.280 --> 41:17.440
beautiful future in space. The road to Utopia is paved this time with careening space junk and

41:17.440 --> 41:22.560
towering egos, swearing till they're blue in the face that they're doing it for all humanity.

41:23.760 --> 41:27.200
Part five. There are six parts, by the way. You're like, how many damn parts are in there?

41:27.920 --> 41:35.440
Part five. It's a logic as familiar as Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. One small step for a man

41:35.440 --> 41:40.800
is supposed to have amounted to one giant leap for mankind. But the Apollo missions ended up

41:40.800 --> 41:46.160
doing very little for poor black indigenous and immigrant people in Armstrong's own country,

41:46.720 --> 41:53.360
not to mention the entirety of mankind. Similarly, the escalating pursuit of profit in space

41:53.440 --> 41:58.480
will leave non-investors even farther behind than they already are. As the New Republic's

41:58.480 --> 42:03.760
Clive Thompson predicts, the big winners in space will likely be the big winners on Earth.

42:04.480 --> 42:09.600
After all, a corporation's chief obligations are to its wealthy shareholders,

42:09.600 --> 42:15.840
not to its workers or even its clients, let alone the whole species. And yet the corporations keep

42:15.840 --> 42:21.680
feeding us these mystifying promises to benefit humanity, assuring us in the words of science

42:21.680 --> 42:25.920
writer Martin Robbins that when we go into space, we will all magically become nice.

42:27.360 --> 42:32.080
Under these conditions, though, it's just so unlikely. Do we really expect that the

42:32.080 --> 42:37.280
billionaires who can't find any cause worth supporting on Earth will finally redistribute

42:37.280 --> 42:43.280
their wealth once they get deeper into the final frontier? Do we really expect that the notoriously

42:43.280 --> 42:48.960
inhumane industries of mining, manufacturing, and global retail will suddenly establish

42:48.960 --> 42:54.000
decent working conditions on literally uninhabitable planets and asteroids,

42:54.000 --> 42:59.440
where a person's employer controls her access not only to healthcare and food now, but to air?

43:00.240 --> 43:04.560
And what about all the ecological damage these companies are doing in the meantime on Earth?

43:05.200 --> 43:10.640
What happens to our environment when a single rocket scorches the land it leaves behind,

43:10.640 --> 43:16.320
drops its boosters in low Earth orbit or dumps them in the sea, and deposits millions of pounds

43:16.320 --> 43:22.320
of rocket fuel into the atmosphere? What happens to the residents of Boca Chica, Texas,

43:22.320 --> 43:27.520
whom SpaceX has displaced from their suddenly toxic homes, including the humans,

43:27.520 --> 43:31.360
who now can't afford to live anywhere else because nobody wants to buy their houses,

43:31.360 --> 43:36.960
and the wildlife that has increasingly nowhere to go? In what sense is this space adventure

43:36.960 --> 43:42.800
benefiting all humanity? If these galactic messiahs kill off most of us in the process,

43:42.880 --> 43:47.920
along with the only biosphere that allows us actually to be, then what exactly are they saving?

43:49.440 --> 43:54.960
The operative fallacy here, to which Jacob introduced us yesterday, is known as long-termism.

43:55.680 --> 43:59.360
Popular among Silicon Valley types, the long-termer conviction

43:59.360 --> 44:05.440
is that the galactic immortality of the species is more important than the current well-being

44:05.440 --> 44:09.440
of any given community. Hunger, poverty, racism, warfare,

44:09.440 --> 44:15.600
hurricanes, floods, pandemics, genocides, and extinctions might seem like enormous concerns,

44:15.600 --> 44:19.760
but ultimately they're just the ups and downs of the evolution of the species.

44:20.400 --> 44:26.240
As techno-philosopher Nick Bostrom assures us, from the perspective of humanity as a whole,

44:26.960 --> 44:31.680
even the worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the great sea of life.

44:32.320 --> 44:38.720
So the key is to rise above the everyday struggles of particular humans and focus instead on the

44:38.720 --> 44:44.640
long-term existence of the species. I'll give away the punchline and say that in addition to

44:44.640 --> 44:51.360
being a dreadful reading of Hegel, long-termism is a high-tech version of what Malcolm X called

44:51.360 --> 44:57.440
pie and the sky and heaven and the hereafter. Sick of the suffering black Americans continued

44:57.440 --> 45:03.600
to undergo for the sake of an unjust law and order, Malcolm blamed America's racist social

45:03.600 --> 45:08.320
system on the Christian teaching that earthly suffering would be rewarded in the afterlife.

45:08.320 --> 45:12.960
To his mind, the doctrine of heaven maintained an even glorified oppression,

45:12.960 --> 45:18.480
convincing black Americans that it was useless or even ungodly to overthrow their oppressors.

45:18.480 --> 45:23.360
From the perspective of eternal bliss, poverty, racism, and even enslavement would seem like

45:23.360 --> 45:29.280
nothing at all mere ripples on the great sea of life. Similarly, the space-hungry billionaires

45:29.280 --> 45:35.200
tell the poor, the refugees, the sick imprisoned, endangered, and extinct to hold out for heaven

45:35.200 --> 45:41.760
on the asteroid belt. There is a murderous numerology at work here, which sets the 8 billion

45:41.760 --> 45:48.880
people currently on the planet, 700 million of whom live in extreme poverty, against, say, the 10

45:48.880 --> 45:54.880
to the 23rd people who might exist if we manage to someday to colonize the Virgo supercluster.

45:54.880 --> 46:02.480
You see, 10 to the 23 is numerically more, a whole lot more than 8 billion or 700 million.

46:02.480 --> 46:08.000
Therefore, the long-termers insist that our energies be directed toward the hypothetical humans

46:08.000 --> 46:13.760
rather than the actual ones. In fact, they caution, actual humans might not actually be

46:13.760 --> 46:20.400
actual at all. They could be computer simulations. I'm not making it up. The idea, as you know,

46:20.400 --> 46:25.200
has been around in one form or another since Descartes' meditations, but it came raging back

46:25.200 --> 46:32.000
in 1999 with a matrix and in the Gamergeek philosophy of Bostrom, who argues that if it

46:32.000 --> 46:38.320
is possible, even in principle, to create a conscious simulation, then we are almost certainly

46:38.320 --> 46:44.640
living in such a simulation. In the meantime, the futurist economist Robin Hansen reasons

46:44.640 --> 46:49.920
that if we are living in a simulation, we should behave as brashly and boldly as possible so that

46:49.920 --> 46:55.120
our simulators remain sufficiently entertained to keep us plugged in. Assuming that we are living

46:55.120 --> 47:01.120
in a simulation should have the overall effect, says Hansen, of making us more present-oriented

47:01.120 --> 47:06.640
and more selfish than we might otherwise be. Your motivation to save for retirement, he reasons,

47:06.640 --> 47:11.520
or to help the poor in Ethiopia might be muted by realizing that in your simulation,

47:11.520 --> 47:17.760
you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia. I won't drive you mad with the details of these

47:17.760 --> 47:23.600
scenarios, which are mind-boggling at best and diabolical at worst. I bring them up only as a

47:23.600 --> 47:29.680
means of filling out the intellectual biography of our most energetic space utopian, whose deep

47:29.680 --> 47:35.600
dive into long-termism has produced in him a conviction that we are most likely living in

47:35.600 --> 47:41.840
a computer simulation. Our consciousness is probably the creation of super-intelligent beings

47:41.840 --> 47:47.120
running a super-advanced version of Minecraft and the rest of the universe is just a virtual

47:47.120 --> 47:53.040
backdrop to our trivial pursuits. Or it's always possible that we're not so much simulated as

47:53.040 --> 47:58.240
manufactured. If it's not a simulation, Musk speculates, then maybe we're in a lab and there's

47:58.240 --> 48:03.440
some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop out of curiosity like

48:03.440 --> 48:10.000
mold in a Petri dish. But whether we're mold spores or Mario and Luigi, the quest is clear,

48:10.000 --> 48:15.760
to stay alive by going forth, increasing and multiplying. And here's saying, if the world

48:15.760 --> 48:21.680
around us is just a quantum computation or an alien Petri dish, then who cares about coral

48:21.680 --> 48:26.960
reefs and wetlands? If they're really important, the simulators will make more. And if they don't

48:26.960 --> 48:32.320
make more, then the herons and the frogs and sea turtles will have been a necessary trade-off to get

48:32.320 --> 48:38.240
humanity up to the next virtual level on Mars. It's at this point that the desperate among us

48:38.240 --> 48:43.600
might seek out those poets and prophets who can see through the absurdities of our current situation.

48:44.240 --> 48:49.840
Those poets and prophets who, rather than giving us the same world on another planet,

48:49.840 --> 48:55.680
can actually imagine other ways of being. Part six and part the last.

48:57.360 --> 49:03.040
In the ones who walk away from Omelas, science fiction author Ursula Le Guin describes a

49:03.040 --> 49:10.080
gleaming utopian city. The streets are bright and colorful, the parks are healthy and plentiful,

49:10.080 --> 49:16.240
the people marry the music gay, the animals well cared for, the sun and rain in perfect balance,

49:16.240 --> 49:21.920
and the technology sufficient to everyone's comfort within the bounds of mutual care. For

49:21.920 --> 49:27.360
example, there are very fast little trains, she says, and double-decked trams, but no cars or

49:27.360 --> 49:34.560
helicopters. The only hitch is that the joy of this city is sustained by the unrelenting suffering

49:34.560 --> 49:41.920
of a single child, naked, sporadically fed and locked in a basement with old mops and dirt floors.

49:42.960 --> 49:48.800
They all know it is there, the narrator explains, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come

49:48.800 --> 49:54.320
to see it, others are content merely to know it's there. They all know that it has to be there,

49:54.320 --> 49:58.080
that their friendships, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships,

49:58.080 --> 50:02.640
the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers,

50:02.640 --> 50:07.760
even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies depend wholly

50:07.760 --> 50:12.800
on this child's abominable misery. In a brief preface to the story,

50:12.800 --> 50:18.320
Le Guin traces its central conceit back to the American psychologist William James,

50:18.320 --> 50:24.080
who offered it as a thought experiment. What if millions of people could be kept permanently

50:24.080 --> 50:30.080
happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far off edge of things should

50:30.080 --> 50:37.840
lead a life of lonely torment? James finds this prospect unbearable. None of us, he insists,

50:37.840 --> 50:42.800
would accept such a bargain. In fact, the very knowledge of the torment of that one soul would

50:42.800 --> 50:48.800
ruin the happiness of all of our millions, wouldn't it? Dear old William James says, or so Le Guin,

50:49.680 --> 50:56.480
so mild, so naively gentlemanly, look how he says us, she marvels, assuming all his readers are as

50:56.480 --> 51:02.400
decent as himself. But of course we're not. What Le Guin's narration allows us to realize

51:02.400 --> 51:08.320
is not only that some people are happy to balance their happiness on the suffering of others,

51:08.320 --> 51:14.720
like the omelons and their sacrificial child, but that most of us in the overdeveloped world are

51:14.720 --> 51:21.520
as well. Most of the wealthy residents of these overdeveloped nations are delighted to find bargain

51:21.520 --> 51:27.360
clothes made by children in basement sweatshops. Most of us are happy to travel to resort towns,

51:27.360 --> 51:32.640
whose residents are denied access to their own beaches. Most of us love fresh fruit even though

51:32.640 --> 51:38.560
it's been grown and picked under unbearable conditions, flown on jets that pollute the airways,

51:38.560 --> 51:43.520
driven on trucks that kill whatever tries to cross the road, and carefully stacked by people who

51:43.520 --> 51:49.200
can't afford to buy it. This is the way capitalism works. The happiness of some is sustained by the

51:49.200 --> 51:54.640
suffering of everyone else. The only difference between us and the omelons is that we don't really

51:54.640 --> 52:00.640
want to know any of this, and of course that the suffering children on whom we rely are horrifically

52:00.640 --> 52:07.600
more numerous than one. Le Guin's story ends with a tribute to the ones who walk away. Those few

52:07.600 --> 52:13.120
omelons who realize that their happiness is not worth the suffering of even one child and who walk

52:13.120 --> 52:19.040
alone into the darkness. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than

52:19.040 --> 52:24.480
the city of happiness, the narrator confesses. I cannot describe it at all. It's possible that

52:24.480 --> 52:29.760
it does not exist, but they seem to know where they're going, the ones who walk away from omelons.

52:30.480 --> 52:34.080
And Le Guin's implied question is whether you, the reader, are able to see it too.

52:34.960 --> 52:40.480
Can you imagine a society that doesn't depend on the misery of others, a kingdom of God that's at

52:40.480 --> 52:46.480
hand rather than hovering in some cosmic hellscape? Can you see it clearly enough to believe it,

52:46.480 --> 52:51.600
and can you believe it enough to start walking there? Can you walk away from this hatred of the

52:51.600 --> 52:58.960
earth and its creatures? Can I? But where would we go? You might ask. Given the global and now

52:58.960 --> 53:05.120
outer spatial reach of corporate capital, there is no away left, at least not one to which any of

53:05.120 --> 53:10.640
us has physical access. Where could we possibly go to live otherwise? And even if we could find

53:10.640 --> 53:16.800
such an elsewhere, what about that poor, naked, suffering child? How would our walking away

53:16.800 --> 53:22.400
from omelons do anything to change omelons? Couldn't we be accused, like the rich guys,

53:22.400 --> 53:28.160
of blasting away from our world rather than caring enough to fix it? These are perhaps some of the

53:28.160 --> 53:34.800
questions Afrofuturist sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin had in mind when she wrote her narrative response

53:34.800 --> 53:42.240
to Le Guin, entitled The Ones Who Stay and Fight. In the resplendent city of Amhelat, the people

53:42.240 --> 53:47.120
are well fed, healthy, and even enjoy us. They hail from diverse backgrounds, speak multiple

53:47.120 --> 53:53.520
languages, and enact laws that ensure the safety and comfort of all citizens. And so this is Amhelat,

53:53.520 --> 54:00.000
the narrator explains, a city whose inhabitants simply care for one another. Throughout the story,

54:00.000 --> 54:05.440
the narrator pauses to address our likely skepticism. How could a society possibly be this

54:05.440 --> 54:11.920
functional, this communally minded, this joyous? Surely there's a hitch. Of course there's a hitch.

54:12.480 --> 54:19.440
And much like Le Guin's omelas, the hitch of Jemisin's Amhelat involves a child, a single child,

54:19.440 --> 54:25.760
whose father has discovered transmissions from the benighted hellscape of the reader's own world,

54:25.760 --> 54:32.400
our earth, and who has begun to learn from earthly media and to spread the idea so commonplace here

54:32.960 --> 54:39.040
that some people are less important than others. This poison threatens the society of Amhelat

54:39.040 --> 54:45.120
so fundamentally that a panel of reluctant social workers finds the child's father, kills him,

54:45.120 --> 54:51.280
and then turns to face his enraged, grieving, ideologically ruined daughter. And just as the

54:51.840 --> 54:58.240
reader braces for more violence, one of the social workers, quote, crouches and takes the child's

54:58.240 --> 55:05.200
hand. What, the narrator exclaims, what surprises you? Did you think this would end with the cold

55:05.200 --> 55:11.680
eyed slaughter of a child? There are other options. And this is Amhelat, friend, where even a pitiful

55:11.680 --> 55:18.160
disease child matters. There are other options, not somewhere out there, but in the middle of the

55:18.240 --> 55:23.440
mess we're in. Finding them and living them out would be the work of the ones who stay and fight.

55:24.080 --> 55:28.960
In other words, the ones who stay are actually the makers of other worlds.

55:28.960 --> 55:33.920
Meanwhile, the escape artists refuse to see that the world might be otherwise. It's the ones who

55:33.920 --> 55:39.120
stay who end up making other worlds, while the ones who blast away preserve the very world they're

55:39.120 --> 55:45.520
escaping by refusing to see other options. I point out this ironic alignment, not in order to raise

55:45.520 --> 55:50.960
objections to Le Guin, to whom I am desperately indebted, but to point out the deeply conservative

55:50.960 --> 55:56.560
nature of the Astro Topians. The rocket men want to leave the earth because they want to keep the

55:56.560 --> 56:02.640
world the way it is. So they seek more land and resources to plunder in space. Meanwhile, the

56:02.640 --> 56:09.200
hungry, colonized, black, indigenous working class, earth loving and peace seeking among us, are filled

56:09.200 --> 56:15.440
with what Afrofuturist jazz genius Sun Ra called the burning need for something else. Not the same

56:15.680 --> 56:20.720
system in some cosmic future, but a radically different system right now and right here.

56:20.720 --> 56:25.520
As the Americanist Jane of Brown writes in Black Utopias, we must jump into the break,

56:25.520 --> 56:31.920
the cut, into an entirely different paradigm. Le Guin herself issued a similar imperative

56:31.920 --> 56:38.160
when she received the 2014 National Book Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American

56:38.160 --> 56:44.160
letters. Hard times are coming, Le Guin said, two years before the election of Donald Trump.

56:44.160 --> 56:48.560
When we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now.

56:49.200 --> 56:53.760
According to Le Guin, it is authors of speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy

56:53.760 --> 57:00.640
who can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being

57:00.640 --> 57:06.320
and even imagine real grounds for hope. Other ways of being as in Jemisin's Amhalat,

57:06.320 --> 57:12.960
whose residents can all have homes if they want them. A city where every soul matters. A city whose

57:12.960 --> 57:18.880
inhabitants simply care for one another. It's that sort of world she imagines and it's that sort of

57:18.880 --> 57:28.800
earth that I'm after. Thanks.

57:28.800 --> 57:44.720
Thank you.

57:45.440 --> 57:53.040
We have until 5.45 for some Q and A. So hold your hand up if you would like to ask a question or

57:53.040 --> 58:04.960
make a comment and Amanda will bring you a mic.

58:05.520 --> 58:11.600
I once had a, of all your thinking, I uh usually at the beginning of class you know to warm things

58:11.600 --> 58:15.680
up I'll ask is the students have any announcements are there any things you want us to come support

58:15.680 --> 58:20.400
are you you know are you gonna go hit bats and balls are you gonna sing are you gonna whatever

58:20.400 --> 58:24.240
what can we come give announcements and they they had they had no announcements and they

58:24.240 --> 58:27.040
looked totally miserable so I knew I couldn't just start class you know that look when you

58:27.040 --> 58:29.760
look out at your students you're like damn what am I gonna do with these kids like they're just

58:29.760 --> 58:33.760
they're miserable today and so it's like does anybody want to dance and one of my students

58:33.760 --> 58:40.240
god bless Wesleyan University was like I'll dance really he's like yeah what you got and I was like

58:41.760 --> 58:48.720
he asked me to put on A Day in the Life by the Beatles this this baby who was born in like 2014

58:50.400 --> 58:55.280
I put on a day in the life and that kid stands up and just dances for five straight minutes

58:55.280 --> 59:01.680
and then the song ends and he sits down and the class is like yeah like what nobody got up to dance

59:01.680 --> 59:05.600
with the poor guy but like they were all really into it they were really into somebody else dancing

59:08.000 --> 59:12.240
okay hi that's another question you're gonna you're gonna dance Alexis

59:13.600 --> 59:19.760
so I'm curious to the extent to which you think that it's uh these these like Elon Musk and people

59:19.760 --> 59:24.720
who have these kind of plans to go to Mars and things the extent to which they're trying to

59:24.720 --> 59:28.800
save themselves or what or they actually believe this or whether they're trying to get us to believe

59:28.800 --> 59:34.240
it right because the idea is that if if it's if it's something they're actually trying to do it

59:34.240 --> 59:37.280
seems like it's philanthropy right because it's something they're not going to be able to see

59:37.280 --> 59:42.560
because it's so often the future even if they do do work and so the question becomes is it just

59:42.560 --> 59:47.520
something like that we will stop being concerned about about the way in which our planet is being

59:47.520 --> 59:52.880
destroyed and we're all being harmed because we're because now we we trust Elon Musk will help us

59:52.880 --> 59:56.400
something like that in the end and he doesn't really believe that he can do this but that he's

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.000
trying to get so do you think that's what's going on or do you think that I mean it's hard to say

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.960
with motivation or that there's that they actually legitimately or convince themselves that this is

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.600
possible or what do you think's going with their motivation okay so for what it's worth I think

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:15.440
they're both earnest I think that I think they both believe what they say it may not be true it

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.080
may be that they're you know like truly diabolical geniuses be like I'm gonna say this but I'm really

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.360
just gonna make a lot of money like I think that they both think that this is the way to ensure the

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.240
long-term survival of the human species all this having been said I think that their visions are

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.680
different their motivations are different and this question of selfishness versus selflessness is a

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:42.160
little bit different um Jeff Bezos talks about um wanting he says you know look we could stop using

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.840
so much energy but that would be really boring and I want my great great grandchildren to be using

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.040
more energy than I do and the only way my great grandchildren can use more energy than me is if

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.080
we go into outer space so he's concerned for his lineage he's not necessarily concerned for himself

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.760
I don't he doesn't think he's going to survive this but he's concerned for his lineage and for the

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.200
kinds of people he he wants there to be more guys like him him and Mark Zuckerberg he there those

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.160
are those are the big you know and his and his grandchildren right and the way to do this is

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.120
to ensure that they can have as much energy as they want to in outer space but he's he's not

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.160
going to get there so in that sense yeah he's like um I don't know he's like Vanderbilt and the rail

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.160
roads or something like that like he's building the infrastructure and he's like go be a great nation

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:32.960
without me um Musk is a little more complicated um he's he think he says he wants to die on Mars

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.920
I don't know if he really thinks he'll actually get to Mars but whether or not he can he's so

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:46.560
taken by this Bostrom simulation argument that we need to get to Mars in order again to assure the

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:52.000
long-term survival of the species in order to keep us going long enough to figure out a way

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.160
ourselves to simulate consciousness right whether we're already simulated or we're not already

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.560
simulated we need to figure out a way to do it ourselves because once we can do it

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.520
then we can bring back Elon Musk after he's dead um so he's obsessed with bringing back the great

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.920
men of the past and he wants to be one of those who can be just like downloaded into any piece of

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.240
body um in the in the Virgo supercluster or something like that so there does seem to be a

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.560
little more but but either way I don't think we gain a lot by saying that they're not um they're

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.320
not being honest with us or something I think I think that they are and then the question is

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.920
whether and just like you know we those of us who again teach religion we teach about charismatic

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.640
profits all the time and I think most of them are fully convinced in the truth of what they're

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.600
saying that doesn't mean it's a good religious movement right that doesn't mean you want to

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:48.080
move to that particular commune but yeah thank you that was absolutely fabulous thanks so I

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.320
want to ask you a question about Peter Isherwell he's the fictional uh billionaire guru in the

01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:00.960
movie don't look up are you familiar I started watching it so uh I will ask the question in

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.520
such a way that you do not need to have seen the film thank you right the this figure in the film

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:16.320
stands in as a sort of doppelganger for Musk or uh Bezos or to a lesser degree Steve Jobs right

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:23.360
sort of obsessed with their own impact on the grand arc of human history so in that movie it

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.480
the the character shows up as sort of an obvious critique so maybe I'm a bit of a naive is this

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.040
the one who's like is it bad to make a lot of money should we not be really rich is that guy

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.960
that's one of the acolytes who's persuaded by this character's uh race to mine asteroids right so

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.920
the question is sort of like why don't we see through these persons right why don't we recognize

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:55.760
Musk as a Barnum and Bailey circus actor and that's a perhaps a naive question for a scholar of

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.560
religion to ask right why don't we see false prophets for what they are but really the question

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:12.000
is what kinds of counter narratives do you see I think Citing Le Guin and Jemisin here at the end

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.600
is a great way to do that but I'd love to hear you sort of think out loud about sort of like what

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:22.720
kinds of opposing narratives help uh call into question the the kinds of power and influence

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.800
these individuals have yeah great thank you um okay so why don't we see these false prophets for

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.640
who they will clearly some people do like the folks who made don't look up because it's clear

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.000
what the tone of movie is even though I haven't seen the whole thing right um and clearly some

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.520
people don't write the folks Sarah was introducing us to who are like the hardcore muskvites or

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.800
musketeers or muskowitz's or whatever right they they um they are they they want this vision

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:55.440
they're excited by this vision I think in park space is really cool um I open this this book um

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:01.360
this astrotopia book by thinking about my own fascination with space right I'm I'm in the middle

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:07.040
of you know we're thinking about this critique of all of these these figures trying to colonize the

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.720
cosmos um and and I look around my my five year old's bedroom and I realize that like all of his

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.640
stuff has like little stars and cosmos on them and little galaxies and I'm like oh wow I'm obsessed

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.320
with space like what do I want from space right um space is really cool the idea of you know living

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.800
in a new society elsewhere is um is is is attractive has been attractive since the doctrine of

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.960
terranilias that Whitney bowman exposes so beautifully as the product of a particularly

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.400
bad reading of genesis right um so you know I understand why they're so excited they're excited

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.600
because musk says at some point like there has to be good news at some point like we got we gotta

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.880
give kids something to believe in people like some there has to be a future for them and so this is a

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.320
promise of a future like you you want a future if you're a person and so that's you know that's

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.880
possible and and it's and it's cool um my own students for what it's worth when we study this

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:06.480
material together hate first of all they hate Jeff Bezos even more than they hate Elon musk

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.240
which is really interesting to me I have a little soft spot for Bezos because he's such a nerd

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.040
you know like he's always citing things got footnotes things like that but um they absolutely

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.360
load Jeff Bezos um they increasingly dislike Elon musk since the twitter business um that not

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:32.080
withstanding they um they dislike them but they think they they can't see around the logic they're

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.560
like yeah I I don't know what else we're gonna do I guess I'm gonna go live in an orbital space colony

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.240
there's a there's another jemisin short story in this uh how long until black future month

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.440
the same volume called cloud dragon skies and in this it's it's every um there's a there's a major

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.080
apocalyptic event and everybody on earth is given the option either to move to the asteroid belt on

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.360
some kind of rotating space colony and have as much stuff as they want they can have energy they can

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.720
have you know I don't know like veggie burgers whatever like you you don't you have all that's

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.520
all the stuff that we have on the asteroid belt or she says uh you could have earth and nothing

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.320
I mean just no technology no power no and at that point she says the people who stayed

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.680
all of the rabbis and the llamas and the teachers came forward to remind people how actually to

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.640
live on the earth and how to sustain themselves and you know the folks who wanted to be more

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:35.680
comfortable move to the asteroid belt so ask my students all right where do you go right do you

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.480
what do you want do you want the asteroid belt not like a rotating shopping mall but with like

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:46.480
everything you have um or do you want the earth and nothing and with the exception of one student

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:52.080
they were all like shit I gotta move to the asteroid belt and they didn't feel good about it

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.240
right they weren't like yes Elon they're not that kind of my students at least they're not that kind

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.640
they're not and they hate Jeff but they're just like I I can't so and it was at that point that I

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.400
was like it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism how is it easier

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.880
to imagine living without air than without your phone like how is that but I see it I see it I'm

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.640
not making fun of this logic I understand what they mean they're like you could never convince

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.680
people to give up their stuff so you're gonna have to take them off the earth so I think that that's

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.480
there yeah there's a convincing that the logic is convincing I think in a lot of ways that the

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:32.880
the messiahs themselves are not counter narratives okay um so right this branch of feminist afro

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.240
futurist indigenous futurist there's a great indigenous future futurist volume by grace Dillon

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.000
that sort of coins the genre of indigenous futurism it's 2012 it's called walking the clouds

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:52.640
and indigenous futurism is an explicit um conversation with afro futurism and uh there

01:08:52.640 --> 01:09:00.080
there you know gives ways of deploying traditional ecological knowledges um particularly from native

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.720
american and native australian and original australian communities um to imagine different

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.280
ways of being in the future and the thing is like we so so the human community has already done this

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.840
right the human human community all over the place has ways of living on the earth as the earth

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.920
without destroying the earth right um it just it's just not this one like not this particular one

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.120
that I grew up in that right um so um certainly indigenous and afro futurist futurist literatures

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:33.760
I think are hugely helpful here um but also like Pope Francis has like a different kind of story

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.120
about how we're supposed to live in relation to the earth and calling all of the creatures around

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.000
us brother and sister and caring for them and abolishing capitalism in order to care for the

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.400
poor and this intertwining of um you know the the disaster of poverty and the disaster of warfare

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:58.240
and the disaster of ecocide um so I think that these teachers are all around us um even in you

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.320
know even at the head of the the the christian body that colonized the whole earth like at this

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.240
point he's like yeah this isn't a good way of living um so they're there and I think the question

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.160
is just how we how we listen to them and how we how we do things otherwise but it's not like we

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.920
don't have the imagination for it

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:31.840
hi I was wondering if you had any guidelines for distinguishing between um genuine other

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.360
wisest genuine other ways of being and the fantasies that sustain the ways that we live now

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.440
as it strikes me that people who go to the resorts towns are wanting something other than the corporate

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.200
world that they're living in and so the imagination of this other world this resort town is part of

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:51.520
what sustains the system that lets them continuing to work and there's a lot of times really subtle

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.640
ways that's still functioning even within our attempt to imagine and otherwise we're sometimes

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.880
sustaining what we already have so are there guidelines for distinguishing between those

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:07.520
two can they be distinguished um thank you so much for that um I think I don't know that these are

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.600
universe these are not universal guidelines these are my guidelines for the way that I went so things

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:19.040
that I I will call efforts to think of genuine other wisest versus um efforts just to you know

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.480
continue as we are and you're absolutely right that the um you know resort culture of white lotus

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.480
for example is like an escape from the crazy rat race that sustains the rat race this is victor

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.880
turner this is liminality this is your two-day weekend in order to keep working as hard as you

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.760
can on the five-day so that's the same system um the question is whether there's a different system

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:48.400
and the thing that I tend to be looking out for um is uh societies that care for its and this

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.960
societies that care for its inhabitants it's just very straightforward like all of them

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.880
like all of them um especially the ones who are poor especially the ones who don't have access to

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:08.800
the people who have resources I was um uh I how do I frame this um I live in a town in Connecticut

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.040
it's a central Connecticut town that's like kind of it's not on a rail line it's kind of nowhere

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.760
in particular it was terribly planned there's a highway along the river like it's a sad um

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:25.120
post urban town that is trying so hard to bring itself out of the economic ruin of the 1970s

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.240
when all the factories pulled out and all that right you know you know the New England story

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:37.120
um and uh there is uh there are a lot of different kinds of folks who live there

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.880
people of all sorts of different economic backgrounds all sorts of mental health

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.800
abilities and capacities um and I I was in a position of having to be in conversation with

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.840
a police officer in the town who said you know there are a lot of crazy people here in Middletown

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.920
because the problem is that whenever anybody's picked up anywhere between Hartford and New Haven

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.960
this we're talking about like a 50 mile radius he's like the cops always say to them go to Middletown

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.040
because you'll get taken care of there um because there's a community health center where people

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.040
can get free health care there's food there's a soup kitchen there's an actively working right um

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.360
and he was sort of disgusted by it he's like so therefore our town is a mess and my first thought

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.120
was like holy crap that's like the first thing I've heard in a really long time that sounds like

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.720
like a gesture toward this kind of society there's a place where you can go if you don't have a home

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.480
and you can get health care like really there's a town and I live in it and people make fun of

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.120
this town because it's so weird and like badly planned but um so I think that's that's the kind

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.760
of thing that I'm looking for I'm looking for a a society whose inhabitants care for one another

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.400
um and and this includes of course the the more than human world um Catherine where is Catherine

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:52.080
Catherine because this beautiful um uh uh exegesis of another Le Guin story Newton's sleep in Destin

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.000
for the stars um and I'm indebted to you forever for pointing out this amazing story of these um

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.440
of this millenarian movement that uh goes to live basically in an O'Neill cylinder um and they

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.760
they take the the best and brightest among them and they take the the ones who like passed all

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:15.760
the tests and they end up with an almost entirely white crew um almost entirely able-bodied all

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.080
of the women have to be under 40 so that they're you know decently fertile and all right um so

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.520
there's this you know eugenics project built into the um and what happens is well I don't want to

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.000
give it away but they've left the rest of the created world behind right like even Noah took one

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.960
two of every animal um these imagine that when we imagine these space colonies we're not we don't

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.400
even think about like taking two elephants with us and taking two giraffes and making sure that we

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:47.280
have this kind of um like biodiverse species so um so this this would also include a deep attention

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.560
to the way that we're totally constituted by um vegetables and animals and you know not just the

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.640
not just ourselves so anyway those are things I'm looking for but it's not a good it's not a good

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.720
heuristic I understand that it's just like this is what rings my bell I'm looking for justice or

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:07.360
something like that yeah hi hi yes this is maybe a little tricky tricky maybe a little sensitive

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.760
so we'll just see if it goes anywhere that's fine but um it's it's interesting to me you've

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.600
honed in on some of the identities of these kind of billionaire um space profits as it as it were

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.920
mainly that they're they're rich white men and it also occurs to me that Elon Musk is autistic

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.080
and a connection that I will draw is that Oliver Sacks who I'm sure you wrote wrote a book called

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.000
an anthropologist on Mars and that comment was literally in reference to a spouse I believe

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:42.400
living in the in the context of an autistic spouse and felt like an anthropologist on Mars

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:48.240
in relating to this person and so maybe that's just an interesting coincidence but I wonder if

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:54.560
you care to speculate if or how or if it matters at all how that might relate to some of Musk's

01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.320
visions and and sort of relationships with earth and space just a thought gosh I wish I knew how

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:07.920
to answer this question I don't but I um this this produced um I can just tell a story um which is

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.320
in um in my classroom the first time I taught this um this particular question produced um the

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.240
one of the hardest classroom situations I've ever been in um because a a student who was about to

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:27.840
graduate to go work for Elon Musk and SpaceX um got very upset um about the students in the class

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.600
who were criticizing Musk um he started um sort of tearing up and he said you know it's not fair

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.280
of you to accuse him of being in all these privileged positions after all he's autistic and

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.200
you know he's so he is he is disabled and he's um and we need to be you know kinder to him and more

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:56.800
understanding um and uh and it took the students a while to recover um and another of them said

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.160
yeah but but look at the damage that he's doing um to all these sorts of beings and all these

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:09.920
and he his SpaceX had just been um audited for um sexism and for abuses like labor abuses and all

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:21.040
the time um so I don't know how to um I certainly don't know how to connect um his uh his autism

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.760
to his sort of seeing the world differently um I think it's really cool to think about um Greta

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.440
Thunberg the um the ecological activist who talks herself about who gives an account herself and

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:38.000
says look I my autism allows me not to force me not to close myself off from the world and makes

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.440
me open up to it such that like the destruction of our earth is hurting me physically um I would

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.320
need to hear him talk about that to know how he experiences that um but I certainly don't think

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.680
and I don't think this is where you were going but I certainly don't think um that it's a that um

01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:02.080
that his having you know neurodiversity is a is a reason to um sort of allow him to escape critique

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.480
or or anything like that um so because there there are all sorts of things you can do with

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.280
neurodiversity you can do good things or you can do bad things um but anyway I would like yeah I

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.960
don't I haven't I haven't I don't know if you've heard of him sort of account for his kind of

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.080
cosmic vision and his neurological situation but have you have you heard anything like that

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.040
but yeah yeah thank you so much yeah

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:40.960
he has self perpetuated the the narrative that he is has Asperger's um but there is no

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:49.760
definitive diagnosis and in the videos you see of him being very gregarious very he cultivates

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:57.120
this after a period of time and so there's a lot of debate as to how much of this is him performing

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:06.000
this identity of the brilliant genius uh Asperger's and how much of it is actually real thanks so we

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.360
actually have a question from online from Kadas who is live streaming from Toronto we live in the

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:21.360
future now it's amazing hi hello kagdas and tio anyway um he's he's written in he says if you

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.800
can ask really quick for me here it is is there a difference between musk and those folks and all

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:34.800
those data scientists that are now part of nerd theology and aren't those people replaceable

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.000
while nerd theology is not oh my gosh can anybody in this room or can can we get more I don't know

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.040
what nerd theology is kagdas kagdas I thought all theology was nerd theology

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.000
why did I get into this line of work um I am so sorry would you my friend please be

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.600
in contact with me by email and I'd love to talk more about this um you can find me very easily

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.960
just throw me an email and let's talk about it thank you so much for the question I'm so sorry

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.720
not to know um what that what that is but I want to know more thanks

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:14.000
hi thank you so much um this is brilliant and um thought provoking in so many ways um

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:24.800
and I get my question is um I hadn't occurred to me that um where musk has kind of multiple reasons

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:33.280
for needing to leave earth and contrast with bezos who condenses it down to one thing

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:41.040
and namely energy um out of all the multiple things that human beings need um do you have

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:48.000
a sense for why why he what what's his logic maybe two questions what is what is the reason

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:56.720
that he gives for narrowing it down to just the energy issue and what sense do you maybe make

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:03.840
of it like you know do you have a sense for why he would narrow that okay um so let me ask the

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:09.840
question behind it to answer the question that's behind it too which is um musk never talks about

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:16.240
dependence on energy on fossil fuels on polluting the skies um he doesn't talk about ecology at all

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:22.160
ecological collapse is not one of his coming disasters it's an asteroid or it's robots

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:27.360
or it's like so he just never addresses climate change bezos absolutely addresses climate change

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.200
and he but he wants to have a single a single problem so that it that one problem can be addressed

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.120
so it's not a multifarious problem because then that's gonna so he has to consolidate it into one

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.360
problem one could imagine his consolidating in it into um the relentless pursuit of profit for

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.400
example which necessitates extractivism which necessitates overproduction which necessitates

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:57.040
it necessitates inequality and you know he doesn't want to do that because that's precisely the

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:04.240
system that he wants us to perpetuate um so he he goes for a problem that has in his eyes a very

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:09.040
clear solution which is the energy problem he's also relying on the work of oniel who's working

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:15.440
in the 70s who's responding to an energy crisis and so for oniel the energy crisis was the crisis

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:20.800
this was this this sort of coalesced all of our other problems under the reliance on energy so

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.920
i think these are some some of the reasons he goes for that thanks

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:32.480
hello hi um i'd like to invite you to expand more on the note on which you close the presentation

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.680
which is the word care and what you mean by care if i can invite that word to travel we began with

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:44.000
the absence of care we arrive at care in the book you name some figures who can keep the care and

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.840
mlk the barricades dorthy day as opposed to others who don't keep the care some people have it they

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.760
had it yesterday they have it today they might have it in the future but what is it great

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:04.320
um i'm trying to decide there's always that moment where you're like do i go for heidegger

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.720
or do i not go for heidegger um because going for heidegger can be so helpful but then you've

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.200
got heidegger and then you have to deal with him and then you're like why is heidegger here um

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.400
but there's a sense there's a sense from heidegger um with whom i have a very tortured relationship

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.560
and whom i'm sure will make it up to all of us in the afterlife his idiocy um in the face of his

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:36.720
extreme brilliance um that for heidegger um care is uh dwelling with that's how he defines it like a

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.200
commitment to dwelling with to remaining with so what i make of uh mk jemisin's community is this

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.520
is a city in which the inhabitants that that what the care which is marked for her by things like

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.560
everybody can have a house if they want to if they'd rather sleep outside you don't put spikes on

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:58.960
benches so that they can't sleep you make sure that the bridges are swept so that people if they

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:06.320
want to sleep there can sleep there right um everybody has money everybody has enough food

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.520
everybody like these are the sort of markers of care um but it seems to me that you only get to

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.840
those markers if you are committed to living with like living together not living in a different

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.840
place not living in a wealthier enclave not living with a um so i would i would i would say

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:31.840
that um and again this is like this is like my my my my little caredar um starts beeping

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.440
when i see um practices that um are put into place when people are committed to dwelling

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:45.520
with one another living with one another and treating one another um as though everybody is

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:56.000
just as important as anybody else is that do we're gonna take one final question from over here

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.320
okay um hi hi thank you for your brilliant and horrifying presentation and especially for uh

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:11.200
helping the pill go down easier with your great sense of humor um it seems to me that most religions

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.440
have to do with the promise of divine rescue from this world this one has a new twist especially with

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.040
musk that we're going to somehow go off to some other galaxy and these folks pretend to be really

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.360
sciency right but uh what we know is that the universe is expanding and i've never heard a credible

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.960
scientist suggest that anything like these folks are suggesting is anything but fanciful

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:45.440
do they ever get pushed and um by uh scientists who say you're you're literally not on planet earth

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:53.280
intellectually on this stuff and here's the problem with obama and oh and first of all let me let me

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.080
go back to the um religion and other worldliness and i'm totally indebted to your work on green

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:04.080
religions and earthy religions and um jz smith has this distinction between what he calls utopian

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.880
religions and lockative religions that utopian religions tell us that our real home is somewhere

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.720
else and lockative religions say this is where we come from this is where our ancestors are this is

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:18.560
and these are of course the traditions that you're interested in right um so this in my in my um

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:24.960
sort of informal catalog is a is an extreme and again a sort of plotting version of a utopian

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:33.520
religion just in this very sort of concrete bad white heady in form um okay uh now i've lost track

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.400
of the other of the big question the big question was about remind me oh the scientist science yes

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.880
what does science say okay so here's the thing this is what scientists say scientists say this guy is

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.240
nuts this man is is absolutely off his rocker we can't newt mars we can't

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:01.280
but i'm not gonna get i i a geologist i'm a planetary scientist i love mars and i want to

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.320
know about rocks on mars and i want to understand what they are and where they came from and what

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:12.800
it says about is there like some little bayata hiding in a rock somewhere on mars that means i

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:18.800
need missions to mars and nasa isn't funding those freaking missions and i know if i'm a

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.800
planetary scientist because this is what my planetary scientists friends say that if they

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.760
ever get to mars it's gonna be on one of elan musk's rockets right if they even just get like a

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:35.680
robotic lander on mars right so increasingly science our scientists are epistemologically

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:41.600
dependent upon the corporate sector of the space race and as one of my friends said she was like i

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:46.320
hate this guy but if he can get me to mars okay like how else am i nasa hasn't done it

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.640
like what have they been doing for so this is the problem it doesn't matter that he's intellectually

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:56.160
debunked he's getting the stuff in the sky right and then and then this is the same issue and then

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.520
depending on your political orientation um whether you care about the moon or mars you might debunk

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.040
him scientifically but you're like yeah but we got to get to the moon because it's because china

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.960
and that's all it ever is there's there's no indication of like what it's just

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.320
because china um and so therefore no matter what you we know we can we can dismiss his long-term

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:19.840
visions but like he's he's gonna make a lander that lands on the moon and he's gonna help us make

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.960
the gateway that allows us to rotate anywhere we want on the moon to navigate anywhere we want

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.240
on the moon we were not going to be able to get a decent military position without this kind of

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.760
reusable affordable space technology he's the one who's giving it to us who cares that he's a crazy

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:43.520
who cares that he's a crazy person we need we need him yeah and on that note please join me once

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:55.280
more in thanking mary jane
