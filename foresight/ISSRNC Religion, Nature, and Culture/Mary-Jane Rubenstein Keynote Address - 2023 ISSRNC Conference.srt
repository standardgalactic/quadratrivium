1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Dr. Mary Jane Rubinstein is a professor of religion and science in society at Wesleyan

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,520
University and is affiliated with the philosophy department and the feminist gender and sexuality

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,920
studies program there.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,920
She holds a BA from Williams College, an M. Phil from Cambridge University, and a PhD

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
from Columbia University.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Her research unearths the philosophies and histories of religion and science, especially

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,000
in relation to cosmology, ecology, and space travel.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,640
She is the author of Astro Topia, The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race, which

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,760
you'll be hearing, I think, some material from that book more or less this afternoon.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,600
That book just came out from University of Chicago in 2022, and I highly recommend it.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,920
I think it's one of the first works of yours that seems to me to make a more explicit connection

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,880
between thinking about space, cosmology, astronomy, and actually, I would say, ethics, but at

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
least the environment in a much more explicit way.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,220
Pantheologies, excuse me, God's Worlds and Monsters, Columbia University Press 2018,

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,200
Worlds Without End, the lives, many lives of the universe, I'm sorry, the multiverse,

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,480
which is the book that just received the Iris Award this afternoon, if you missed that.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Congratulations.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,580
And Strange Wonder, the closure of metaphysics in the opening of all Columbia University

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,140
Press 2009, which, for me, was a book that I came across when I also became very interested

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,940
in wonder and started writing about wonder, and then I came across, I think, first, an

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,860
article of yours, and then your book, and I thought, sure, you said like everything

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,940
that I wanted to say, which keeps happening, keeps happening with everything that I'm interested

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,340
in, I think, ah, well, Ruben Steiner, you did it.

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,380
She's also, and of course, she just won the 2022 Iris Award for her book that I mentioned

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,780
earlier from 2014, Worlds Without End, the many lives of the multiverse, so.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,880
And she's also involved currently in a project called Sacred Space, Religion, and Cosmic

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,260
Exploration, which is a series, or involves a series of webinars with Lance Garabi, and

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,420
this is through the Interplanetary Initiative here at Arizona State University.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,660
So please join me in welcoming our keynote speaker, Dr. Mary Jane Rubenstein, and we'll

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,380
have some time for questions and comments afterwards, but we will have to also clear

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,740
out of this room quickly to prepare for our evening festivities.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:40,100
So welcome, Dr. Rubenstein.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,700
Thank you so much, Lisa, and thank you to Lisa and to Amanda Nichols and to Evan Berry for

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,180
getting together this just beautiful gathering of lovely people.

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,180
I have never been to the ISS RNC, this is my first time here, and I am just taken by

36
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,100
the collegiality and warmth and generosity of everybody here, so I'm so grateful for

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,140
the community here and for the welcome that you've given me.

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
Thank you all so much.

39
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:16,460
Quick zero item, Jacob Boss and I seem to be wearing the same dress, our slides are,

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,500
have the same background, because what else, but so anyway, great slides look alike.

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm sorry, Jacob, that I, that, you know, I hope that that's okay with you.

42
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,620
Okay, I'm going to start with a tune up.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,300
I'd like to open by considering the title of our joint endeavor this weekend, After

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,820
Earth.

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,980
Each of us could endlessly turn this little stone of a prepositional phrase and reveal

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,460
in it all manner of meanings, but to me there are three that most readily announce themselves.

47
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,340
The first is the sense of after Earth as straightforwardly temporal.

48
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,540
There has been Earth and there either will or won't be something after it.

49
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,140
So I'll be talking today about plans to move some portion of humanity and human productions

50
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,060
off this planet and onto another, plans that will allegedly allow the species to embark

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,900
on an eternal cosmic future.

52
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,780
These are instances of after Earth in its most proddingly sequential sense.

53
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,420
It's the kind of thinking we find in the post-apocalyptic Will and Jaden Smith film that shares a title

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,940
with our conference or in Interstellar with its somber, destinal tagline, mankind was

55
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,700
born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.

56
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,740
The second sense of after Earth as it resounds in my particular ears is ontological, taking

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,980
its lead from Bill McKibbin's suggestion that what we are living on and as is no longer

58
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,940
Earth, rather than a self-regulating, broadly homeostatic, Gyanic symbiont, the planet has

59
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,180
become a convulsing set of mutually destabilizing systems that McKibbin calls Earth as if the

60
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,620
planet itself were groaning and wailing at us.

61
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,980
And third, you knew I'd do this, you can't be a continental dweeb and not do this, third

62
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,900
is the sense of being in pursuit of Earth.

63
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,500
And it's this sense I'd ultimately like to consider as a possible horizon.

64
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,180
Here's some hildegard to help us.

65
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,860
What if we thought of Earth as what we're after, as what we want, what we desire, what

66
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,820
we're trying for?

67
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,140
Thackeray uses the preposition in this sense when he speaks of an abiding tenderness in

68
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,220
the newcomer's most worthy titular kernel with that fidelity which was an instinct of

69
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,260
his nature, writes Thackeray.

70
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,100
The brave young man thought ever of his absent child and longed after him.

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,540
What if Earth were what we long after, what we care about as in she asked after the health

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,980
of my mother?

73
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,580
What if it's not speed or comfort or even love that we're after, but Earth itself?

74
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,420
In the human condition, Hannah Arendt reminds us that the word human is etymologically inextricable

75
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,860
from humus.

76
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,020
To be human is to be earthly, earthish, earthen.

77
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,260
In this particular sense, then, it's actually incoherent to speak of humans living in space.

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Once we figure out how to build communities elsewhere, we will be post-human, post-humus

79
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,020
or rendered more optimistically by my colleague Lance Garave, astro sapien.

80
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,260
If we ever actually move to the moon or Mars, we will, along this interpretation, be a different

81
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
species.

82
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,980
We will no longer be human.

83
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,460
And in fact, Elena Roche argued earlier this afternoon that we're already no longer human.

84
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,620
We're already something else.

85
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,260
Then again, to cite Eleanor Craig's riff on Sylvia Winter, we have in an important sense

86
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,460
never been human.

87
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,060
After all, the imperial culture that has defined humanity in its own image has been so ruthlessly

88
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,500
inhumane that the concept collapses under its own colonial freight.

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,660
Ben again again, as Winter herself insists, the dehumanized have always invented new ways

90
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,180
of being human that transform the terms of that term.

91
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,460
In particular, by refusing humanity's frenetic self-distinction from the animal-vegetable

92
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,960
mineral world, along with the frenetic Abrahamic distinction between this world and divinity.

93
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,060
In this sense, we might think of being after the human and being after Earth as entangled

94
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,740
projects, and here I'm indebted to Carol Wayne White, for whom becoming human would

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,020
also mean becoming more than human, which is to say both earthen and sacred, and as such

96
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,140
totally bound up with the more than human world that constitutes us, and that we in

97
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,580
turn both create and destroy.

98
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,020
All of these senses of after Earth can be found uncannily composted in the funeral

99
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,420
litany of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, whose familiar ashes-to-ashes dust-to-dust

100
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,940
is preceded by the phrase Earth to Earth, a rare orthodox admission that the Earth is

101
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,860
our Alpha and Omega.

102
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:27,260
We come both from it and to it, which is to say we're both after it and after it.

103
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,940
This afternoon evening I'll be focusing on the first temporal, arguably least interesting

104
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,600
sense I have just sketched of after Earth, in the hopes of opening onto the last aspirational

105
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
sense of it.

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,060
I'll spend most of my time unveiling the new workings of what Amber Lowe theorized yesterday

107
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,220
as the master's clock, that is the unrelenting teleology of settler colonialism that's now

108
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,280
urging us to go grab new land and exploit after Earth.

109
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,260
It's a shocking instance, I'll use this term again of what Alfred North Whitehead called

110
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,620
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, namely the notion that living after Earth means abandoning

111
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,420
it by boarding rocket ships and building new homes in underground Martian bunkers and

112
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,100
orbital space colonies.

113
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,620
Especially for the theatrically inclined, it's a fascinating story.

114
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,180
Honestly, if I were feeling more playful, I'd suggest we turn the whole thing into a comedy

115
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,740
of errors, call it the fallacy of misplaced concrete, and run it in a Gilbert and Sullivan

116
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
theater.

117
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,660
The problem is, I can't find this particular story funny for too long, because regardless

118
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,060
of whether Elon Musk ever makes it to Mars, or Jeff Bezos actually builds a paradise between

119
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,380
the moon and New York City, they and their astroprenerial cohort can do a monstrous amount

120
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,180
of ecological damage to and beyond the Earth in the meantime.

121
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,820
The key then, will be to expose the temporal fallacy of the messianic edge of new space,

122
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,340
and to turn the sequential otherworldly after Earth into a passionate thisworldly one.

123
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,460
And let me apologize for Sarah McFarland-Taylor and my spending this much energy on Elon

124
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,420
Musk today.

125
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,660
As you will see, our papers start from very similar places, diverge along totally different

126
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
sources.

127
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,540
Sarah's sources are just stunning, and thank you so much for them, and arrive at the same

128
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
conclusion.

129
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,460
So this only means to me that we must be right.

130
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,380
So thank you again, Sarah, for your beautiful meticulous and fun paper this morning.

131
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,700
Part one.

132
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:47,460
On October 23rd, 2020, one day after the final presidential debate, and seven months into

133
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,540
an epidemiological nightmare that had closed schools, crippled local businesses, killed

134
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,500
hundreds of thousands of Americans, and made most parents into psychopaths, the GOP tweeted

135
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,020
a final distillation of its campaign platform.

136
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,740
Prez Trump is fighting for you, it exclaimed.

137
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,380
Here are some of his priorities for a second term.

138
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,060
First, establish permanent manned presence on the moon.

139
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,140
Second, send the first manned mission to Mars.

140
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,900
After the moon and Mars came infrastructure and Wi-Fi.

141
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:30,460
And then, in a follow-up tweet, the GOP promised a COVID vaccine, medical supplies, and pharmaceuticals.

142
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,100
But they clearly wanted the moon and Mars out front.

143
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,380
Who wants to worry about respirators when you can dream about rockets?

144
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,020
You might recall that during his first hundred days in office, President Biden signed 60

145
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:50,420
executive orders, almost half of which were direct reversals of Trump-era policies.

146
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,380
This administration disagrees with that one on almost everything except outer space.

147
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:03,500
In fact, the only major Trump-era objectives the Biden administration has retained are first,

148
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,980
the creation of a space force to wage orbital warfare, and second, the plan to settle the

149
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,700
moon and Mars through a new mission they're calling Artemis, after the Greek goddess of

150
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,100
the moon, the twin sister of Apollo.

151
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,780
Why do we need to settle the moon and Mars?

152
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:26,200
In Biden's non-referential words, because America can do big things, we can see possibilities

153
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
no one has seen before.

154
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,080
We can go places no one has ever gone before.

155
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,200
The message was, frankly, clearer in the Trump administration, which insisted that it is America's

156
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,040
duty to spread its influence throughout the universe.

157
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,680
As Trump declared in his last State of the Union address, in reaffirming our heritage

158
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,240
as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.

159
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,080
Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars.

160
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,480
Most of us are numb at this point to the extension of frontier language into space, but like

161
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,320
any dead metaphor, this one conceals far more than it reveals.

162
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
We're all indebted to Catherine Newell for having tracked the metaphor of space, the

163
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,520
final frontier.

164
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,400
To the 1952 special issue of Collier's magazine, entitled Man Will Conquer Space Soon, the

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,360
lead article written by former Nazi rocket scientist Verne von Braun was called Crossing

166
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,640
the Last Frontier.

167
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,400
In the short years following his amnesty through the CIA's then-secret Operation Paper Clip,

168
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,320
von Braun had become convinced it was America's destiny to extend human civilization into

169
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,880
outer space for the sake of freedom, democracy, and get this eternal salvation.

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,560
A little known detail that Catherine reveals about von Braun is that during his denazification

171
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,240
on American soil, he became a born-again Christian, who believed it was incumbent upon American

172
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,080
earthlings to spread the gospel to what he called man's oldest and last frontier, the

173
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,440
heavens themselves.

174
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Space travel, as von Braun saw it and as Trump recently reaffirmed, is a vertical extension

175
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,680
of manifest destiny, just as God allegedly endorsed and even demanded the westward expansion

176
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,000
of mainly white-skinned European-descended Americans in the 19th century.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,680
God is calling Americans in the 20th and 21st centuries to conquer a new frontier, an infinite

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,120
frontier in outer space.

179
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,960
Okay, so in February of 2020, Trump says we're going back to the moon and then to Mars because

180
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,520
space is the next frontier and America's manifest destiny is in the stars.

181
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,840
Of course, the language of divinely authorized conquest is nothing new in the American space

182
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,000
program.

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,920
The only thing that's unprecedented in this contemporary space race is the extent to

184
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,560
which private industry is involved in this godly conquest.

185
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,560
And for this development, we must thank not Donald Trump, but his ordinarily more palatable

186
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,520
predecessor, Barack Obama.

187
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:15,240
The key date here is February 1, 2010, when the Obama administration released the 2011

188
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,120
budget for NASA that ended the space shuttle program and reallocated funds to the so-called

189
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,400
new space industries.

190
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,480
It's time, Obama's advisors had written, to consider turning this transport service over

191
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,200
to the commercial sector.

192
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,560
You know, to make rocket ships as mass produced as cars and buses and speedboats and airplanes,

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,520
the problem, of course, was funding.

194
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,400
Who would invest in a company dedicated to flying supplies up to the International Space

195
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Station?

196
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,880
What would be in it for the shareholders?

197
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,640
The situation for the cosmic prospector seemed grim until November of 2015, when Congress

198
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,560
passed a startlingly bipartisan bill called the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness

199
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,040
Act, which promises, among other things, that any U.S. citizen who recovers a rock or mineral

200
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,280
or quantum of water in space is allowed to own, use, and sell it.

201
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Huzzah, said the investors.

202
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,200
We're saved, said the space mining firms that seem to spring out of a thousand simultaneous

203
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,360
know-heres.

204
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,280
After all, if a corporation is a person, a citizen, even, in U.S. law, then its hypothetical

205
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,240
extractions and uses and sales will be protected under this law.

206
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,600
Elated, the CEO of Moon Express, a lunar mining outfit that collaborates closely with NASA,

207
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,800
went so far as to call the CSLCA the aeronautic equivalent of the Homestead Act.

208
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Space.

209
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,680
Finally, another frontier for restless white folks.

210
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,880
This economically giddy corporate proliferation has brought us into the era known as new space.

211
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,240
To an already dense field of political, military, technological, and religious reasons to get

212
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,720
America back to space as soon as possible, new space adds the speed and intensity of

213
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,560
unregulated capitalist economics.

214
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,920
And the excitement over this new gold rush in space transcends party lines, unable to

215
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,520
agree on literally anything else.

216
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Our elected officials on the left, center, right, and alt-right snuggle in together to

217
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,280
hand outer space over to these cosmic conquistadors, these astropreneurs whom I've come to think

218
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,320
of as particularly toxic techno-messiahs.

219
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,480
And so Sarah was sketching the three roles of the saint and the messiah and the ... help

220
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
me?

221
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
The what?

222
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Yes.

223
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Thank you.

224
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,080
And I'm going down the messianic route right here.

225
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,600
To be sure, the astropreneurs don't seem particularly religious.

226
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,800
They lack the rousing scriptural appeals of Mike Pence, who assured us that God was

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
calling America to conquer the heavens.

228
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,440
They can't even muster the civil religiousness of Trump's manifest destiny or Biden's vague

229
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
spirit of America.

230
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,080
What they offer instead are promises to make life fun again, to cleanse us of the guilt

231
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,120
of fossil fuels, and above all, to save humanity from eternal death.

232
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,960
How will they accomplish such lofty goals?

233
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
By converting the cosmos itself into capital and building a new Jerusalem on the infinite

234
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,520
frontier of outer space.

235
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,160
The world is coming to an end, the messiah cries, but trust in me and I'll bring you

236
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,480
to a new world where you'll finally be free.

237
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,280
Free from death, free from earth, free from guilt and gravity, at least most of it, and

238
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,880
free above all from earthly regulation.

239
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,320
In the meantime, China's got a rover on Mars, a satellite on the far side of the moon, and

240
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,360
a brand new space station in low earth orbit.

241
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,920
Richard Branson is selling 200,000 dollar tourist tickets on his notoriously unreliable

242
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,440
space plane.

243
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,720
Space mining firms have collected billions of dollars before they've even got their

244
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
probes on an asteroid.

245
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,000
A failed Israeli mission has dumped dehydrated tardigrades on the lunar surface.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,040
Rwanda has bought the rights to launch 300,000 satellites of its own.

247
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,480
The U.S. has created a new branch of the military to pulverize its enemies from the heavens,

248
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,160
and some astronautic startup says it's going to build a ferris wheel-shaped space hotel

249
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,040
in orbit and name it after, wait for it, Werner von Braun.

250
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,800
How did we get here?

251
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,360
What is going on?

252
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,720
And is there anything, you will stay at the von Braun space hotel, like that is the last

253
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
plate?

254
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,480
Is there anything anyone can do about it?

255
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,640
I first realized something was up when Elon Musk launched a car into orbit.

256
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,840
It was January of 2018, and SpaceX was looking to test its Falcon heavy rocket, woo the U.S.

257
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,720
military, and make sure everybody was watching.

258
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,640
So rather than display the rocket's carrying capacity with, say, slabs of concrete or steel,

259
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,760
Musk decided to strap a blazing red Tesla Roadster to its back.

260
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,840
You will recognize this slide from Sarah's presentation.

261
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,440
A perfectly good, even exquisite car.

262
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:31,240
$100,000 worth of chrome, leather, steel, glass, state-of-the-art navigation software,

263
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,120
green technology, and human labor hurled uselessly into orbit, not around the Earth, but around

264
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,480
the sun.

265
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,360
It was an act of immense bravado, extraordinary waste, and literally cosmic presumptuousness

266
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,400
Now along with eight planets and some dwarves, moons, and asteroids, there is a tricked-out

267
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,760
convertible circling our solar orb, driven to the end of days by a mannequin in a spacesuit

268
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
called Starman.

269
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,120
Musk named his Sisyphean Astro Bot after the alien messiah of David Bowie's 1972 Ziggy

270
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Stardust album.

271
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,760
Bowie's song, Life on Mars, accompanied the rocket launch that flung the Roadster toward

272
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,760
the stars, and his space oddity still loops endlessly on the car's solar-powered JVC speakers.

273
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,800
Starman's glove compartment is stuffed with multimedia versions of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy, and the Falcon-heavy rocket itself

275
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,000
is named after the millennium Falcon of Star Wars.

276
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,480
Musk, you might say, is a geek's geek.

277
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,000
His aesthetic, composed by a nostalgia for the future of his teenage past, complete with

278
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,680
rockets, spacesuits, Martian colonies, glam rock, and a free-market promise of infinite

279
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,280
possibility.

280
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,880
Musk is also an inveterate showman.

281
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,680
Back in 2003, he was having a hard time getting NASA to take SpaceX and its newly fabricated

282
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,760
Falcon 1 seriously.

283
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,600
He drove the seven-story rocket on an enormous flatbed truck from Boca Chica, Texas, to Washington,

284
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,200
D.C., and parked it on the street outside the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration.

285
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,360
In the two decades since then, Musk has continued to manufacture all manner of mind-blowing

286
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,360
spectacles, Twitter-storm launches, dramatic explosions, tickets sold to billionaires for

287
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,440
trips on unbuilt ships, and a manifesto about his intention to save humanity by getting the

288
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,520
hell off this doomed planet Earth.

289
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,040
Meanwhile, on the other side of Texas, Jeff Bezos has been making a lot less noise.

290
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,200
In the early 2000s, while Musk was dragging NASA, the Air Force, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin

291
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,640
into high-profile antitrust suits, Bezos was quietly buying up ranches.

292
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,560
Under the auspices of improvised corporations, Bezos cobbled together over 300,000 acres of

293
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,560
West Texan land so he could test his rockets without anybody noticing.

294
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,840
Musk had bought the land, too, but he makes so much noise that the Rangers at Mother Neff

295
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,080
State Park now warn their visitors that if something sounds like the end of the world,

296
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
it's probably not. At least not yet.

297
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,800
The men are both magicians, but of really different sorts.

298
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,840
Musk pulls rabbits out of hats while Bezos makes the coin disappear behind your ear.

299
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,960
While Musk is shouting, look mom! Wait, that's not it! Bezos hides in his room to perfect the trick.

300
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,480
Both billionaires are building reusable, affordable, state-of-the-art rockets,

301
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,640
but Musk raced to the launches while Bezos worked on the landings.

302
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,320
Elon's had us looking up at the exploding skies while Jeff has kept us staring at our own damn

303
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,560
laps, one clicking the lint rollers and cake pans and dog sweaters that finance his more cosmic

304
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,880
endeavors. As Bezos finally explained a couple of years ago, quote,

305
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,840
every time you buy shoes on Amazon, you're helping Blue Origin. I appreciate it very much,

306
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,200
and suddenly I hate my shoes. Bezos himself articulated the methodological distinction

307
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,240
between Blue Origin and SpaceX in a 2004 letter to his then-tiny aerospace staff.

308
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,280
Be the tortoise, he told them, and not the hare. His motto for the company is

309
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:32,720
gradatim ferociter, or step-by-step ferociously, a grittier Latinate rendition of slow and steady

310
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,640
wins the race. The phrase is inscribed on banners beneath the company's coat of arms.

311
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,240
It's got a coat of arms, which features two turtles standing on top of a globe reaching

312
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,400
from North America to a gilded solar system. Crowning the image is a cruciform sun.

313
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,480
Anchoring it is a winged hourglass with all the sands run out, and the whole thing looks kind

314
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
of like a 15th century cosmographed walked into a Harry Potter fanzine.

315
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,720
More nerd than geek, Bezos reads everything in print, considers even the most outlandish

316
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,520
alternatives before making up his mind, and demands that ideas be pitched to him in full

317
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,840
paragraph form. As we all know, he's a book's guy. In addition to ESOP, his references include

318
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,880
JR, Tolkien, Isaac, Asimov, Jules Verne, E&M Banks, Neil Stevenson, and William Gibson.

319
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,960
Now and then he even mentions a wrinkle in time, the only work by a woman to make the

320
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,200
astropreneurial canon. But when it comes to space, Bezos' biggest influence is Star Trek.

321
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,080
While Musk is off actualizing George Lucas with his exploding falcons and epic soundtracks,

322
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,640
Bezos is cultivating the more genteel gestalt of the star ship Enterprise. As the Atlantic's

323
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,680
Franklin Feuer reports, Bezos initially wanted to call Amazon MakeItSo.com as an homage to Captain

324
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Jean-Luc Picard, whom he now uncannily resembles. Bezos named his dog Kamala in honor of the

325
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,800
empathic metamorph you may remember from Krio's Prime. And as you may have heard about a year

326
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,480
ago, he boldly took William Shatner, where no 90-year-old actor had gone before. Shatner came

327
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,560
back terrified. Let's talk about that later. The question you might be asking is why? What are

328
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:34,400
these billionaires up to in space? It is old news to you by now. Elon Musk wants us to go to Mars.

329
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,000
In fact, he explained in a 2016 manifesto, it's been his goal all along making humans a

330
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,080
multi-planetary species by setting up a self-sustaining city on the red planet.

331
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,360
To anyone who will listen, Musk explains that Earth is a ticking time bomb. Sooner or later,

332
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,680
something will destroy humanity, whether it be an asteroid, nuclear war, or AI robots gone rogue.

333
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,400
Sooner or later, we're going to have to find somewhere else to live. And given the literally

334
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,600
infernal conditions of Venus, it's like 900 degrees Fahrenheit there, Mars is our best chance.

335
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
Catherine explained this morning, the roots of this logic, this coming disaster logic,

336
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,360
are also in Werner von Braun. Of course, five billion years from now,

337
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,240
the sun will explode into a red giant and engulf Earth and Mars in a fiery apocalypse.

338
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,680
So if we want humanity to endure forever, we're eventually going to have to make it to another

339
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,200
solar system. But we'll never be able to live anywhere else unless we start close to home

340
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,480
and soon before a giant asteroid or Alexa 5.0 wipes out the whole species.

341
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,880
At times, Musk seems to realize how much he sounds like that guy on the street with a cardboard

342
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,880
sign for tending the end of the world. Both disavowing and adopting the role of lunatic

343
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,520
prophet, Musk writes, I do not have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but eventually there will be

344
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,320
some doomsday event. With apocalypse on the horizon, our first option is to just let disaster

345
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,600
extinguish us as it did the dinosaurs. An option Musk finds so intolerable,

346
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,000
he never even entertains it. The alternative, he says, is to become a space-bearing civilization

347
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,600
and a multi-planetary species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go. So Mars it is.

348
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,200
The challenge will be making the enterprise affordable-ish. At the moment, Musk shows by

349
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,000
means of a perfectly bizarre Venn diagram, the price to Mars is infinite, leaving the set of

350
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,600
people who want to go to Mars completely distinct from the set of people who can afford to go to Mars.

351
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,400
Using conventional technology, Musk estimates that the price for a round-trip ticket to the

352
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:58,560
red planet could drop from infinity to $10 billion a person. But once his rockets attain full

353
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,800
reusability and efficiency, Musk predicts he'll be able to lower the cost to $200,000,

354
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:12,080
the median cost of a house in the United States. At that price, in his words, almost anyone could go

355
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,880
to Mars. All they need to do is save up a bit, sell their house, and pack a very small bag.

356
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,360
Anyone who doesn't have a house to sell can always get sponsored by an employer and pay it off with a

357
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:33,040
few years of labor as an indentured servant, I swear to the gods he has said this. When it comes

358
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,040
to advertising his new colony, Musk alternates between appealing to aspirational homesteaders

359
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,760
and revving up post-adolescent pub crawlers. On the one hand, he admits Mars is going to be seriously

360
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,080
hard work. Under current conditions, it's impossible to breathe or even just be on the planet without

361
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,080
a spacesuit. Since Mars has so little atmosphere, it would turn all the water in the human body to

362
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,120
steam and kill it instantaneously. Even with a spacesuit, there's so much radiation on Mars

363
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,120
that it will likely cause the colonists severe health problems. So as Musk concedes from time to

364
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:19,280
time, Mars will be like the Orhan Trail on a really bad day. There's a good chance you'll die, he says.

365
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,720
It's going to be tough going.

366
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,040
On the other hand, and this is the part Musk tends to dwell on,

367
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,760
the Martian Trail is going to be pretty cool. The trip itself will be like an astronaut club med.

368
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:42,320
A hundred people aboard one 400 foot BFR or big effing rocket for a seven month trip that Musk

369
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,200
insists will never feel cramped or boring. There will be zero gravity games Musk is really into

370
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,800
bouncing around. Plus movies, lecture halls, cabins, and our restaurant. It will be really fun to go,

371
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,560
Musk enthusiasts. You're going to have a great time. Nowhere in these descriptions does Musk explain

372
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,640
who will be staffing the restaurants, cleaning the cabins, or wiping the space vomit off the

373
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,600
gleaming walls of the BFR. Nor does he say who will be giving the lectures. Will it be you?

374
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,240
Will it be me? Extolling the virtues of Sylvia Winter and Robin Wall Kimmerer on a six month

375
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,160
rocket to Mars? As for the planet itself, Musk promises that it would be quite fun to be on Mars

376
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,560
because you would have gravity that's about 37% of that of Earth. So you would be able to lift

377
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,600
many things and bound around. Sure, the air is primarily carbon dioxide, but the same stuff that's

378
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,680
so toxic to humans will make it easy to grow plants, quote, just by compressing the atmosphere,

379
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,000
unquote. Faced with the problem of what he calls the radiation thing, Musk says inexplicably that

380
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,520
it's not too big of a deal. And although he understands that Mars is a little cold, the

381
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,280
average temperature is negative 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is to say over 100 degrees

382
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:12,000
below freezing. He assures his future colonists that we can warm it up. How exactly do you warm

383
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,840
up a frozen planet? You stick it in the microwave, hit the airspace above the ice caps with some

384
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,720
hydrogen bombs, and you'll jumpstart the global warming process, liberate tons of water and move

385
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,280
the Martian colony that much closer to autonomy. To be sure, most scientists think this is an

386
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,680
absolutely ridiculous plan. The director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos has estimated

387
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:44,160
it would take more than 10,000 missiles to carry out the nuke Mars. 10,000 Musk's response on Twitter,

388
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:53,120
no problem. If you're furrowing your brow at this fantasy of planetary hacking,

389
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,040
you're not alone. As astrobiologist Lucienne Walkowitz reminds us, we don't have a great

390
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,200
track record of controlling geological processes on the planet we've already got. How can we hope to

391
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,680
make a habitat out of Mars when we can't even preserve the habitability of Earth? It would seem

392
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,920
that recalibrating the biosystems of an already oxygenated, temperate, blue-green orb would be

393
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:25,920
a far easier task than bringing a planetary dust storm to life. When asked why he is choosing to

394
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,840
save humanity by sending us to Mars rather than by addressing injustice, poverty, and climate

395
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,480
change on Earth, Musk will often laugh and say, please forgive the direct quotation, fuck Earth.

396
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,760
Earth is done. Earth is history. Earth is so last eon. Considering the coral reefs, wet lands,

397
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,840
and clean skies that SpaceX has polluted and destroyed, and considering Musk's own advancement

398
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,080
of artificial intelligence, one could even accuse him of worsening the disaster to intensify the

399
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,480
need for salvation, of making the planet genuinely uninhabitable so that we will indeed need to leave

400
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,800
it for an after-Earth Martian utopia. Unlike the more classic utopians, Plato, Moore, Marx, and Engels,

401
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,560
Musk doesn't give us a clear idea of what his ideal society looks like. What he offers instead are

402
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,160
abstract promises of freedom from Earth, from international regulation, from gravity, and even

403
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,200
from death, at least at the level of the species. He hasn't hammered out the details because the

404
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:37,280
details would destroy the perfection, but it's going to be awesome on Mars. Part four. Jeff Bezos

405
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,480
isn't so sure. To my friends who want to move to Mars one day, Bezos reports, I say, why don't you go

406
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,280
live in Antarctica first for three years and then see what you think? Because Antarctica is a garden

407
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,760
paradise compared to Mars. We have sent probes to every planet in the solar system, says Bezos,

408
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,720
and believe me, Earth is the best one. There are waterfalls and beaches and palm trees and

409
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,360
fantastic cities and restaurants, and you're not going to get that anywhere but Earth for a really,

410
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,880
really long time. So if Musk is happy to leave Earth in the dust, Bezos is set on saving it.

411
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,960
If Musk named his SpaceX after the place he'd like to go, Bezos named Blue Origin after the

412
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,920
place he'll always be from, this gem of a planet called Earth. How then will Bezos restore and

413
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,960
preserve the blueness of our origin, the beauty of our Earth, by getting us off the planet? The

414
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,720
problem for Bezos is energy. We're using too much of it. Given an expanding and modernizing human

415
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,800
population, global industrial humanity will reach some absolute limits within the next century.

416
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,920
There's simply not enough fuel, whether from the ground, the wind, or even the sun as it's

417
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,520
accessible on Earth, to power a whole planet's worth of first-rate hospitals, bleeding-edge

418
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,320
electronics, megachurches, superstores, slaughterhouses, and industrial farms. We need more energy,

419
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,640
so we've got to go to space. So the old Marxist adage is true. It's easier to imagine the end

420
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,840
of the world than the end of capitalism, rather than proposing an alternative to the extraction

421
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,680
of resources, the relentless pursuit of profit, and the wasteful cruelty of factory farming.

422
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,920
Rather than use the funds he calls his Amazon winnings to win back the actual Amazon,

423
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,240
Bezos is spending all that money and time exporting the whole ecosystem into space.

424
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,480
Here's the way it'll work. Rather than checking out all the way to Mars, which is too far,

425
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,600
Bezos proposes we construct a series of bases on the Moon. We install solar panels on every base,

426
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,720
gaining access to far more solar energy than we could ever harness on Earth. We mine the Moon

427
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,400
for water, whose elements can be split and recombined into rocket fuel. Using far less energy than we

428
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,560
need at Cape Canaveral, we power many missions to mine asteroids for heavy and rare Earth metals,

429
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,480
at which point we begin to construct miles-long, free-floating habitations between the Earth

430
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,040
and the Moon. Yes, you've heard that right, giant space pods. The idea comes from Gerard O'Neill,

431
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,280
the Princeton physicist who began proposing in the mid-19th century that all heavy industry

432
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,680
and much of the human population be moved into space. Mines and factories would occupy asteroids

433
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,440
and the Moon, while residents, recreation and commerce would take place in giant cylindrical

434
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,800
tubes rotating to simulate gravity and positioned at Lagrange points to maintain a steady orbit.

435
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,480
Having attended O'Neill's lectures in college, Bezos remains a devotee.

436
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,560
This is Maui on its best day all year long, he says. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.

437
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,680
In our climate-controlled Edens, we'd have everything we love on Earth, like air,

438
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,560
tree, birds and beaches, but nothing we hate. O'Neill, infamously promised,

439
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,240
we'd finally be free of mosquitoes. And in the meantime, Mother Earth would get a long overdue nap.

440
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,520
With all heavy industry and a good deal of humanity relocated off-planet,

441
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,880
the Earth could be zoned for light industry, some residents and recreation. In short, Earth

442
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,360
would become a planetary park, a great vacation spot, a lovely place to go to college.

443
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Meanwhile, out in space, humans would get to play as many video games, have as many kids,

444
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,800
and eat as much red meat as they want, powered by limitless energy. According to Bezos' calculations,

445
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,360
an O'Neill-hacked solar system could in principle support one trillion human beings.

446
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,120
That's a thousand Mozart's, he marvels. A thousand Einstein's. What a cool civilization that would be.

447
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,560
It seems a cheap but necessary shot to point out that by this dopey logic,

448
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,360
we would also gain a thousand Hitler's and a thousand Stalin's. But Bezos is leaving it

449
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,920
to the next generation to work out the details. How are we going to build O'Neill colonies,

450
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,440
out of what materials, under what sort of political systems? Bezos has no idea. He's here to build

451
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,080
the infrastructure so that the big thinkers of the future can hammer out the details.

452
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,280
In short, Bezos will establish the extraterrestrial roads and bridges so that the future dreamers

453
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,920
can figure out what to do with them. Bezos will pave the way for future Bezos' and Zuckerberg's,

454
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,960
and even future Musk's, once they've had enough of those radioactive dust storms on Mars.

455
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,080
So these are our two post-terrestrial utopias. Fuck Earth and Occupy Mars versus Save Earth

456
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,840
by drilling the universe. Of course, both of these visions are a long way off.

457
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,440
So far, no one's been to Mars. No one's mined an asteroid or built a rotating space cylinder,

458
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,320
and it's been half a century since anybody walked on the moon. But in the meantime,

459
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,320
the new space nicks are already making a total mess. Musk has filled his allotted altitude in

460
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,080
low Earth orbit with so many Starlink satellites that he's edging into the territory allocated

461
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,000
to Amazon. Astronomers and space ecologists keep warning that between dead satellites,

462
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,960
live satellites, paint chips, lost tools, shrapnel, old cameras, and the International

463
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,120
Space Station, there's just too much stuff up there. At speeds of 18,000 miles per hour,

464
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,480
the collision of anything with anything else is disastrous, and despite our steady ability to

465
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,120
produce this deadly litter, we have absolutely no way to clean it up. The most promising idea so far,

466
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,160
which failed spectacularly the one time it was tested, is that we might be able to snag some

467
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:51,920
passing garbage with a harpoon. A harpoon. It's like wailing, technology. The scene in space is

468
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,880
total chaos, and yet Bezos, Musk, and a growing cadre of smaller-time astropreneurs continue

469
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,960
unfazed, promising thousands more satellites, suborbital tourism, orbital tourism, private

470
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,280
space stations, space hotels, and gazillion-dollar asteroids, all as multifarious means to our

471
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,440
beautiful future in space. The road to Utopia is paved this time with careening space junk and

472
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,560
towering egos, swearing till they're blue in the face that they're doing it for all humanity.

473
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,200
Part five. There are six parts, by the way. You're like, how many damn parts are in there?

474
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,440
Part five. It's a logic as familiar as Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. One small step for a man

475
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,800
is supposed to have amounted to one giant leap for mankind. But the Apollo missions ended up

476
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,160
doing very little for poor black indigenous and immigrant people in Armstrong's own country,

477
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:53,360
not to mention the entirety of mankind. Similarly, the escalating pursuit of profit in space

478
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,480
will leave non-investors even farther behind than they already are. As the New Republic's

479
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,760
Clive Thompson predicts, the big winners in space will likely be the big winners on Earth.

480
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,600
After all, a corporation's chief obligations are to its wealthy shareholders,

481
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,840
not to its workers or even its clients, let alone the whole species. And yet the corporations keep

482
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,680
feeding us these mystifying promises to benefit humanity, assuring us in the words of science

483
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,920
writer Martin Robbins that when we go into space, we will all magically become nice.

484
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,080
Under these conditions, though, it's just so unlikely. Do we really expect that the

485
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,280
billionaires who can't find any cause worth supporting on Earth will finally redistribute

486
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,280
their wealth once they get deeper into the final frontier? Do we really expect that the notoriously

487
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,960
inhumane industries of mining, manufacturing, and global retail will suddenly establish

488
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,000
decent working conditions on literally uninhabitable planets and asteroids,

489
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,440
where a person's employer controls her access not only to healthcare and food now, but to air?

490
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,560
And what about all the ecological damage these companies are doing in the meantime on Earth?

491
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,640
What happens to our environment when a single rocket scorches the land it leaves behind,

492
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,320
drops its boosters in low Earth orbit or dumps them in the sea, and deposits millions of pounds

493
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,320
of rocket fuel into the atmosphere? What happens to the residents of Boca Chica, Texas,

494
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,520
whom SpaceX has displaced from their suddenly toxic homes, including the humans,

495
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,360
who now can't afford to live anywhere else because nobody wants to buy their houses,

496
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,960
and the wildlife that has increasingly nowhere to go? In what sense is this space adventure

497
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,800
benefiting all humanity? If these galactic messiahs kill off most of us in the process,

498
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,920
along with the only biosphere that allows us actually to be, then what exactly are they saving?

499
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,960
The operative fallacy here, to which Jacob introduced us yesterday, is known as long-termism.

500
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,360
Popular among Silicon Valley types, the long-termer conviction

501
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,440
is that the galactic immortality of the species is more important than the current well-being

502
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,440
of any given community. Hunger, poverty, racism, warfare,

503
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,600
hurricanes, floods, pandemics, genocides, and extinctions might seem like enormous concerns,

504
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,760
but ultimately they're just the ups and downs of the evolution of the species.

505
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,240
As techno-philosopher Nick Bostrom assures us, from the perspective of humanity as a whole,

506
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,680
even the worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the great sea of life.

507
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,720
So the key is to rise above the everyday struggles of particular humans and focus instead on the

508
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,640
long-term existence of the species. I'll give away the punchline and say that in addition to

509
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,360
being a dreadful reading of Hegel, long-termism is a high-tech version of what Malcolm X called

510
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,440
pie and the sky and heaven and the hereafter. Sick of the suffering black Americans continued

511
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,600
to undergo for the sake of an unjust law and order, Malcolm blamed America's racist social

512
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,320
system on the Christian teaching that earthly suffering would be rewarded in the afterlife.

513
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,960
To his mind, the doctrine of heaven maintained an even glorified oppression,

514
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,480
convincing black Americans that it was useless or even ungodly to overthrow their oppressors.

515
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,360
From the perspective of eternal bliss, poverty, racism, and even enslavement would seem like

516
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,280
nothing at all mere ripples on the great sea of life. Similarly, the space-hungry billionaires

517
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,200
tell the poor, the refugees, the sick imprisoned, endangered, and extinct to hold out for heaven

518
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,760
on the asteroid belt. There is a murderous numerology at work here, which sets the 8 billion

519
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,880
people currently on the planet, 700 million of whom live in extreme poverty, against, say, the 10

520
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,880
to the 23rd people who might exist if we manage to someday to colonize the Virgo supercluster.

521
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,480
You see, 10 to the 23 is numerically more, a whole lot more than 8 billion or 700 million.

522
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,000
Therefore, the long-termers insist that our energies be directed toward the hypothetical humans

523
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,760
rather than the actual ones. In fact, they caution, actual humans might not actually be

524
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,400
actual at all. They could be computer simulations. I'm not making it up. The idea, as you know,

525
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,200
has been around in one form or another since Descartes' meditations, but it came raging back

526
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,000
in 1999 with a matrix and in the Gamergeek philosophy of Bostrom, who argues that if it

527
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,320
is possible, even in principle, to create a conscious simulation, then we are almost certainly

528
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:44,640
living in such a simulation. In the meantime, the futurist economist Robin Hansen reasons

529
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,920
that if we are living in a simulation, we should behave as brashly and boldly as possible so that

530
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,120
our simulators remain sufficiently entertained to keep us plugged in. Assuming that we are living

531
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:01,120
in a simulation should have the overall effect, says Hansen, of making us more present-oriented

532
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,640
and more selfish than we might otherwise be. Your motivation to save for retirement, he reasons,

533
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,520
or to help the poor in Ethiopia might be muted by realizing that in your simulation,

534
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,760
you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia. I won't drive you mad with the details of these

535
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,600
scenarios, which are mind-boggling at best and diabolical at worst. I bring them up only as a

536
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,680
means of filling out the intellectual biography of our most energetic space utopian, whose deep

537
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,600
dive into long-termism has produced in him a conviction that we are most likely living in

538
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,840
a computer simulation. Our consciousness is probably the creation of super-intelligent beings

539
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,120
running a super-advanced version of Minecraft and the rest of the universe is just a virtual

540
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:53,040
backdrop to our trivial pursuits. Or it's always possible that we're not so much simulated as

541
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,240
manufactured. If it's not a simulation, Musk speculates, then maybe we're in a lab and there's

542
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,440
some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop out of curiosity like

543
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,000
mold in a Petri dish. But whether we're mold spores or Mario and Luigi, the quest is clear,

544
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,760
to stay alive by going forth, increasing and multiplying. And here's saying, if the world

545
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,680
around us is just a quantum computation or an alien Petri dish, then who cares about coral

546
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,960
reefs and wetlands? If they're really important, the simulators will make more. And if they don't

547
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,320
make more, then the herons and the frogs and sea turtles will have been a necessary trade-off to get

548
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,240
humanity up to the next virtual level on Mars. It's at this point that the desperate among us

549
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,600
might seek out those poets and prophets who can see through the absurdities of our current situation.

550
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,840
Those poets and prophets who, rather than giving us the same world on another planet,

551
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,680
can actually imagine other ways of being. Part six and part the last.

552
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,040
In the ones who walk away from Omelas, science fiction author Ursula Le Guin describes a

553
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,080
gleaming utopian city. The streets are bright and colorful, the parks are healthy and plentiful,

554
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:16,240
the people marry the music gay, the animals well cared for, the sun and rain in perfect balance,

555
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,920
and the technology sufficient to everyone's comfort within the bounds of mutual care. For

556
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,360
example, there are very fast little trains, she says, and double-decked trams, but no cars or

557
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:34,560
helicopters. The only hitch is that the joy of this city is sustained by the unrelenting suffering

558
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:41,920
of a single child, naked, sporadically fed and locked in a basement with old mops and dirt floors.

559
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,800
They all know it is there, the narrator explains, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come

560
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,320
to see it, others are content merely to know it's there. They all know that it has to be there,

561
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,080
that their friendships, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships,

562
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,640
the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers,

563
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,760
even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies depend wholly

564
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,800
on this child's abominable misery. In a brief preface to the story,

565
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,320
Le Guin traces its central conceit back to the American psychologist William James,

566
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,080
who offered it as a thought experiment. What if millions of people could be kept permanently

567
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,080
happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far off edge of things should

568
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:37,840
lead a life of lonely torment? James finds this prospect unbearable. None of us, he insists,

569
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,800
would accept such a bargain. In fact, the very knowledge of the torment of that one soul would

570
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,800
ruin the happiness of all of our millions, wouldn't it? Dear old William James says, or so Le Guin,

571
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:56,480
so mild, so naively gentlemanly, look how he says us, she marvels, assuming all his readers are as

572
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,400
decent as himself. But of course we're not. What Le Guin's narration allows us to realize

573
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,320
is not only that some people are happy to balance their happiness on the suffering of others,

574
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:14,720
like the omelons and their sacrificial child, but that most of us in the overdeveloped world are

575
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,520
as well. Most of the wealthy residents of these overdeveloped nations are delighted to find bargain

576
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,360
clothes made by children in basement sweatshops. Most of us are happy to travel to resort towns,

577
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,640
whose residents are denied access to their own beaches. Most of us love fresh fruit even though

578
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,560
it's been grown and picked under unbearable conditions, flown on jets that pollute the airways,

579
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,520
driven on trucks that kill whatever tries to cross the road, and carefully stacked by people who

580
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,200
can't afford to buy it. This is the way capitalism works. The happiness of some is sustained by the

581
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,640
suffering of everyone else. The only difference between us and the omelons is that we don't really

582
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,640
want to know any of this, and of course that the suffering children on whom we rely are horrifically

583
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:07,600
more numerous than one. Le Guin's story ends with a tribute to the ones who walk away. Those few

584
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,120
omelons who realize that their happiness is not worth the suffering of even one child and who walk

585
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:19,040
alone into the darkness. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than

586
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,480
the city of happiness, the narrator confesses. I cannot describe it at all. It's possible that

587
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,760
it does not exist, but they seem to know where they're going, the ones who walk away from omelons.

588
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,080
And Le Guin's implied question is whether you, the reader, are able to see it too.

589
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,480
Can you imagine a society that doesn't depend on the misery of others, a kingdom of God that's at

590
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,480
hand rather than hovering in some cosmic hellscape? Can you see it clearly enough to believe it,

591
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,600
and can you believe it enough to start walking there? Can you walk away from this hatred of the

592
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,960
earth and its creatures? Can I? But where would we go? You might ask. Given the global and now

593
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,120
outer spatial reach of corporate capital, there is no away left, at least not one to which any of

594
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,640
us has physical access. Where could we possibly go to live otherwise? And even if we could find

595
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,800
such an elsewhere, what about that poor, naked, suffering child? How would our walking away

596
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,400
from omelons do anything to change omelons? Couldn't we be accused, like the rich guys,

597
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,160
of blasting away from our world rather than caring enough to fix it? These are perhaps some of the

598
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,800
questions Afrofuturist sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin had in mind when she wrote her narrative response

599
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:42,240
to Le Guin, entitled The Ones Who Stay and Fight. In the resplendent city of Amhelat, the people

600
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,120
are well fed, healthy, and even enjoy us. They hail from diverse backgrounds, speak multiple

601
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:53,520
languages, and enact laws that ensure the safety and comfort of all citizens. And so this is Amhelat,

602
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:00,000
the narrator explains, a city whose inhabitants simply care for one another. Throughout the story,

603
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,440
the narrator pauses to address our likely skepticism. How could a society possibly be this

604
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,920
functional, this communally minded, this joyous? Surely there's a hitch. Of course there's a hitch.

605
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:19,440
And much like Le Guin's omelas, the hitch of Jemisin's Amhelat involves a child, a single child,

606
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,760
whose father has discovered transmissions from the benighted hellscape of the reader's own world,

607
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,400
our earth, and who has begun to learn from earthly media and to spread the idea so commonplace here

608
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,040
that some people are less important than others. This poison threatens the society of Amhelat

609
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,120
so fundamentally that a panel of reluctant social workers finds the child's father, kills him,

610
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,280
and then turns to face his enraged, grieving, ideologically ruined daughter. And just as the

611
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,240
reader braces for more violence, one of the social workers, quote, crouches and takes the child's

612
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,200
hand. What, the narrator exclaims, what surprises you? Did you think this would end with the cold

613
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:11,680
eyed slaughter of a child? There are other options. And this is Amhelat, friend, where even a pitiful

614
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,160
disease child matters. There are other options, not somewhere out there, but in the middle of the

615
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,440
mess we're in. Finding them and living them out would be the work of the ones who stay and fight.

616
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,960
In other words, the ones who stay are actually the makers of other worlds.

617
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,920
Meanwhile, the escape artists refuse to see that the world might be otherwise. It's the ones who

618
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,120
stay who end up making other worlds, while the ones who blast away preserve the very world they're

619
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:45,520
escaping by refusing to see other options. I point out this ironic alignment, not in order to raise

620
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,960
objections to Le Guin, to whom I am desperately indebted, but to point out the deeply conservative

621
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,560
nature of the Astro Topians. The rocket men want to leave the earth because they want to keep the

622
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:02,640
world the way it is. So they seek more land and resources to plunder in space. Meanwhile, the

623
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:09,200
hungry, colonized, black, indigenous working class, earth loving and peace seeking among us, are filled

624
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,440
with what Afrofuturist jazz genius Sun Ra called the burning need for something else. Not the same

625
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,720
system in some cosmic future, but a radically different system right now and right here.

626
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,520
As the Americanist Jane of Brown writes in Black Utopias, we must jump into the break,

627
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,920
the cut, into an entirely different paradigm. Le Guin herself issued a similar imperative

628
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,160
when she received the 2014 National Book Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American

629
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:44,160
letters. Hard times are coming, Le Guin said, two years before the election of Donald Trump.

630
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,560
When we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now.

631
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,760
According to Le Guin, it is authors of speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy

632
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,640
who can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being

633
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,320
and even imagine real grounds for hope. Other ways of being as in Jemisin's Amhalat,

634
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:12,960
whose residents can all have homes if they want them. A city where every soul matters. A city whose

635
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,880
inhabitants simply care for one another. It's that sort of world she imagines and it's that sort of

636
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:28,800
earth that I'm after. Thanks.

637
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:44,720
Thank you.

638
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:53,040
We have until 5.45 for some Q and A. So hold your hand up if you would like to ask a question or

639
00:57:53,040 --> 00:58:04,960
make a comment and Amanda will bring you a mic.

640
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,600
I once had a, of all your thinking, I uh usually at the beginning of class you know to warm things

641
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,680
up I'll ask is the students have any announcements are there any things you want us to come support

642
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,400
are you you know are you gonna go hit bats and balls are you gonna sing are you gonna whatever

643
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
what can we come give announcements and they they had they had no announcements and they

644
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,040
looked totally miserable so I knew I couldn't just start class you know that look when you

645
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,760
look out at your students you're like damn what am I gonna do with these kids like they're just

646
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,760
they're miserable today and so it's like does anybody want to dance and one of my students

647
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,240
god bless Wesleyan University was like I'll dance really he's like yeah what you got and I was like

648
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:48,720
he asked me to put on A Day in the Life by the Beatles this this baby who was born in like 2014

649
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,280
I put on a day in the life and that kid stands up and just dances for five straight minutes

650
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,680
and then the song ends and he sits down and the class is like yeah like what nobody got up to dance

651
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,600
with the poor guy but like they were all really into it they were really into somebody else dancing

652
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,240
okay hi that's another question you're gonna you're gonna dance Alexis

653
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,760
so I'm curious to the extent to which you think that it's uh these these like Elon Musk and people

654
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,720
who have these kind of plans to go to Mars and things the extent to which they're trying to

655
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,800
save themselves or what or they actually believe this or whether they're trying to get us to believe

656
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:34,240
it right because the idea is that if if it's if it's something they're actually trying to do it

657
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,280
seems like it's philanthropy right because it's something they're not going to be able to see

658
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,560
because it's so often the future even if they do do work and so the question becomes is it just

659
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,520
something like that we will stop being concerned about about the way in which our planet is being

660
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,880
destroyed and we're all being harmed because we're because now we we trust Elon Musk will help us

661
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,400
something like that in the end and he doesn't really believe that he can do this but that he's

662
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,000
trying to get so do you think that's what's going on or do you think that I mean it's hard to say

663
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,960
with motivation or that there's that they actually legitimately or convince themselves that this is

664
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,600
possible or what do you think's going with their motivation okay so for what it's worth I think

665
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:15,440
they're both earnest I think that I think they both believe what they say it may not be true it

666
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,080
may be that they're you know like truly diabolical geniuses be like I'm gonna say this but I'm really

667
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:25,360
just gonna make a lot of money like I think that they both think that this is the way to ensure the

668
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,240
long-term survival of the human species all this having been said I think that their visions are

669
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,680
different their motivations are different and this question of selfishness versus selflessness is a

670
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,160
little bit different um Jeff Bezos talks about um wanting he says you know look we could stop using

671
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,840
so much energy but that would be really boring and I want my great great grandchildren to be using

672
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,040
more energy than I do and the only way my great grandchildren can use more energy than me is if

673
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,080
we go into outer space so he's concerned for his lineage he's not necessarily concerned for himself

674
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,760
I don't he doesn't think he's going to survive this but he's concerned for his lineage and for the

675
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,200
kinds of people he he wants there to be more guys like him him and Mark Zuckerberg he there those

676
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,160
are those are the big you know and his and his grandchildren right and the way to do this is

677
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,120
to ensure that they can have as much energy as they want to in outer space but he's he's not

678
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,160
going to get there so in that sense yeah he's like um I don't know he's like Vanderbilt and the rail

679
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,160
roads or something like that like he's building the infrastructure and he's like go be a great nation

680
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:32,960
without me um Musk is a little more complicated um he's he think he says he wants to die on Mars

681
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,920
I don't know if he really thinks he'll actually get to Mars but whether or not he can he's so

682
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:46,560
taken by this Bostrom simulation argument that we need to get to Mars in order again to assure the

683
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:52,000
long-term survival of the species in order to keep us going long enough to figure out a way

684
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,160
ourselves to simulate consciousness right whether we're already simulated or we're not already

685
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,560
simulated we need to figure out a way to do it ourselves because once we can do it

686
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,520
then we can bring back Elon Musk after he's dead um so he's obsessed with bringing back the great

687
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,920
men of the past and he wants to be one of those who can be just like downloaded into any piece of

688
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,240
body um in the in the Virgo supercluster or something like that so there does seem to be a

689
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,560
little more but but either way I don't think we gain a lot by saying that they're not um they're

690
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,320
not being honest with us or something I think I think that they are and then the question is

691
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,920
whether and just like you know we those of us who again teach religion we teach about charismatic

692
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,640
profits all the time and I think most of them are fully convinced in the truth of what they're

693
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,600
saying that doesn't mean it's a good religious movement right that doesn't mean you want to

694
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:48,080
move to that particular commune but yeah thank you that was absolutely fabulous thanks so I

695
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,320
want to ask you a question about Peter Isherwell he's the fictional uh billionaire guru in the

696
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:00,960
movie don't look up are you familiar I started watching it so uh I will ask the question in

697
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:07,520
such a way that you do not need to have seen the film thank you right the this figure in the film

698
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:16,320
stands in as a sort of doppelganger for Musk or uh Bezos or to a lesser degree Steve Jobs right

699
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,360
sort of obsessed with their own impact on the grand arc of human history so in that movie it

700
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,480
the the character shows up as sort of an obvious critique so maybe I'm a bit of a naive is this

701
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,040
the one who's like is it bad to make a lot of money should we not be really rich is that guy

702
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:40,960
that's one of the acolytes who's persuaded by this character's uh race to mine asteroids right so

703
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,920
the question is sort of like why don't we see through these persons right why don't we recognize

704
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:55,760
Musk as a Barnum and Bailey circus actor and that's a perhaps a naive question for a scholar of

705
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,560
religion to ask right why don't we see false prophets for what they are but really the question

706
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:12,000
is what kinds of counter narratives do you see I think Citing Le Guin and Jemisin here at the end

707
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,600
is a great way to do that but I'd love to hear you sort of think out loud about sort of like what

708
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,720
kinds of opposing narratives help uh call into question the the kinds of power and influence

709
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:28,800
these individuals have yeah great thank you um okay so why don't we see these false prophets for

710
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,640
who they will clearly some people do like the folks who made don't look up because it's clear

711
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,000
what the tone of movie is even though I haven't seen the whole thing right um and clearly some

712
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,520
people don't write the folks Sarah was introducing us to who are like the hardcore muskvites or

713
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,800
musketeers or muskowitz's or whatever right they they um they are they they want this vision

714
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:55,440
they're excited by this vision I think in park space is really cool um I open this this book um

715
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,360
this astrotopia book by thinking about my own fascination with space right I'm I'm in the middle

716
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:07,040
of you know we're thinking about this critique of all of these these figures trying to colonize the

717
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,720
cosmos um and and I look around my my five year old's bedroom and I realize that like all of his

718
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,640
stuff has like little stars and cosmos on them and little galaxies and I'm like oh wow I'm obsessed

719
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,320
with space like what do I want from space right um space is really cool the idea of you know living

720
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:30,800
in a new society elsewhere is um is is is attractive has been attractive since the doctrine of

721
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,960
terranilias that Whitney bowman exposes so beautifully as the product of a particularly

722
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,400
bad reading of genesis right um so you know I understand why they're so excited they're excited

723
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,600
because musk says at some point like there has to be good news at some point like we got we gotta

724
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:50,880
give kids something to believe in people like some there has to be a future for them and so this is a

725
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,320
promise of a future like you you want a future if you're a person and so that's you know that's

726
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,880
possible and and it's and it's cool um my own students for what it's worth when we study this

727
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,480
material together hate first of all they hate Jeff Bezos even more than they hate Elon musk

728
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,240
which is really interesting to me I have a little soft spot for Bezos because he's such a nerd

729
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,040
you know like he's always citing things got footnotes things like that but um they absolutely

730
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:21,360
load Jeff Bezos um they increasingly dislike Elon musk since the twitter business um that not

731
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:32,080
withstanding they um they dislike them but they think they they can't see around the logic they're

732
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:36,560
like yeah I I don't know what else we're gonna do I guess I'm gonna go live in an orbital space colony

733
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:42,240
there's a there's another jemisin short story in this uh how long until black future month

734
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:49,440
the same volume called cloud dragon skies and in this it's it's every um there's a there's a major

735
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,080
apocalyptic event and everybody on earth is given the option either to move to the asteroid belt on

736
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:01,360
some kind of rotating space colony and have as much stuff as they want they can have energy they can

737
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,720
have you know I don't know like veggie burgers whatever like you you don't you have all that's

738
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,520
all the stuff that we have on the asteroid belt or she says uh you could have earth and nothing

739
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,320
I mean just no technology no power no and at that point she says the people who stayed

740
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,680
all of the rabbis and the llamas and the teachers came forward to remind people how actually to

741
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,640
live on the earth and how to sustain themselves and you know the folks who wanted to be more

742
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:35,680
comfortable move to the asteroid belt so ask my students all right where do you go right do you

743
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,480
what do you want do you want the asteroid belt not like a rotating shopping mall but with like

744
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,480
everything you have um or do you want the earth and nothing and with the exception of one student

745
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,080
they were all like shit I gotta move to the asteroid belt and they didn't feel good about it

746
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,240
right they weren't like yes Elon they're not that kind of my students at least they're not that kind

747
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,640
they're not and they hate Jeff but they're just like I I can't so and it was at that point that I

748
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,400
was like it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism how is it easier

749
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,880
to imagine living without air than without your phone like how is that but I see it I see it I'm

750
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,640
not making fun of this logic I understand what they mean they're like you could never convince

751
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:19,680
people to give up their stuff so you're gonna have to take them off the earth so I think that that's

752
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,480
there yeah there's a convincing that the logic is convincing I think in a lot of ways that the

753
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:32,880
the messiahs themselves are not counter narratives okay um so right this branch of feminist afro

754
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,240
futurist indigenous futurist there's a great indigenous future futurist volume by grace Dillon

755
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:44,000
that sort of coins the genre of indigenous futurism it's 2012 it's called walking the clouds

756
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:52,640
and indigenous futurism is an explicit um conversation with afro futurism and uh there

757
01:08:52,640 --> 01:09:00,080
there you know gives ways of deploying traditional ecological knowledges um particularly from native

758
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,720
american and native australian and original australian communities um to imagine different

759
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,280
ways of being in the future and the thing is like we so so the human community has already done this

760
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,840
right the human human community all over the place has ways of living on the earth as the earth

761
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:19,920
without destroying the earth right um it just it's just not this one like not this particular one

762
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,120
that I grew up in that right um so um certainly indigenous and afro futurist futurist literatures

763
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:33,760
I think are hugely helpful here um but also like Pope Francis has like a different kind of story

764
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:39,120
about how we're supposed to live in relation to the earth and calling all of the creatures around

765
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,000
us brother and sister and caring for them and abolishing capitalism in order to care for the

766
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,400
poor and this intertwining of um you know the the disaster of poverty and the disaster of warfare

767
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:58,240
and the disaster of ecocide um so I think that these teachers are all around us um even in you

768
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:04,320
know even at the head of the the the christian body that colonized the whole earth like at this

769
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,240
point he's like yeah this isn't a good way of living um so they're there and I think the question

770
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,160
is just how we how we listen to them and how we how we do things otherwise but it's not like we

771
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,920
don't have the imagination for it

772
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:31,840
hi I was wondering if you had any guidelines for distinguishing between um genuine other

773
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,360
wisest genuine other ways of being and the fantasies that sustain the ways that we live now

774
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,440
as it strikes me that people who go to the resorts towns are wanting something other than the corporate

775
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,200
world that they're living in and so the imagination of this other world this resort town is part of

776
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:51,520
what sustains the system that lets them continuing to work and there's a lot of times really subtle

777
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,640
ways that's still functioning even within our attempt to imagine and otherwise we're sometimes

778
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,880
sustaining what we already have so are there guidelines for distinguishing between those

779
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,520
two can they be distinguished um thank you so much for that um I think I don't know that these are

780
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,600
universe these are not universal guidelines these are my guidelines for the way that I went so things

781
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:19,040
that I I will call efforts to think of genuine other wisest versus um efforts just to you know

782
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:24,480
continue as we are and you're absolutely right that the um you know resort culture of white lotus

783
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:30,480
for example is like an escape from the crazy rat race that sustains the rat race this is victor

784
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,880
turner this is liminality this is your two-day weekend in order to keep working as hard as you

785
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,760
can on the five-day so that's the same system um the question is whether there's a different system

786
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:48,400
and the thing that I tend to be looking out for um is uh societies that care for its and this

787
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,960
societies that care for its inhabitants it's just very straightforward like all of them

788
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,880
like all of them um especially the ones who are poor especially the ones who don't have access to

789
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:08,800
the people who have resources I was um uh I how do I frame this um I live in a town in Connecticut

790
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,040
it's a central Connecticut town that's like kind of it's not on a rail line it's kind of nowhere

791
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,760
in particular it was terribly planned there's a highway along the river like it's a sad um

792
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:25,120
post urban town that is trying so hard to bring itself out of the economic ruin of the 1970s

793
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,240
when all the factories pulled out and all that right you know you know the New England story

794
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:37,120
um and uh there is uh there are a lot of different kinds of folks who live there

795
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,880
people of all sorts of different economic backgrounds all sorts of mental health

796
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,800
abilities and capacities um and I I was in a position of having to be in conversation with

797
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,840
a police officer in the town who said you know there are a lot of crazy people here in Middletown

798
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,920
because the problem is that whenever anybody's picked up anywhere between Hartford and New Haven

799
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,960
this we're talking about like a 50 mile radius he's like the cops always say to them go to Middletown

800
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,040
because you'll get taken care of there um because there's a community health center where people

801
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:11,040
can get free health care there's food there's a soup kitchen there's an actively working right um

802
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:17,360
and he was sort of disgusted by it he's like so therefore our town is a mess and my first thought

803
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,120
was like holy crap that's like the first thing I've heard in a really long time that sounds like

804
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,720
like a gesture toward this kind of society there's a place where you can go if you don't have a home

805
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,480
and you can get health care like really there's a town and I live in it and people make fun of

806
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,120
this town because it's so weird and like badly planned but um so I think that's that's the kind

807
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,760
of thing that I'm looking for I'm looking for a a society whose inhabitants care for one another

808
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,400
um and and this includes of course the the more than human world um Catherine where is Catherine

809
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:52,080
Catherine because this beautiful um uh uh exegesis of another Le Guin story Newton's sleep in Destin

810
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:58,000
for the stars um and I'm indebted to you forever for pointing out this amazing story of these um

811
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:05,440
of this millenarian movement that uh goes to live basically in an O'Neill cylinder um and they

812
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,760
they take the the best and brightest among them and they take the the ones who like passed all

813
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,760
the tests and they end up with an almost entirely white crew um almost entirely able-bodied all

814
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,080
of the women have to be under 40 so that they're you know decently fertile and all right um so

815
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,520
there's this you know eugenics project built into the um and what happens is well I don't want to

816
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,000
give it away but they've left the rest of the created world behind right like even Noah took one

817
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,960
two of every animal um these imagine that when we imagine these space colonies we're not we don't

818
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,400
even think about like taking two elephants with us and taking two giraffes and making sure that we

819
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:47,280
have this kind of um like biodiverse species so um so this this would also include a deep attention

820
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,560
to the way that we're totally constituted by um vegetables and animals and you know not just the

821
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,640
not just ourselves so anyway those are things I'm looking for but it's not a good it's not a good

822
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,720
heuristic I understand that it's just like this is what rings my bell I'm looking for justice or

823
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:07,360
something like that yeah hi hi yes this is maybe a little tricky tricky maybe a little sensitive

824
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,760
so we'll just see if it goes anywhere that's fine but um it's it's interesting to me you've

825
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,600
honed in on some of the identities of these kind of billionaire um space profits as it as it were

826
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,920
mainly that they're they're rich white men and it also occurs to me that Elon Musk is autistic

827
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,080
and a connection that I will draw is that Oliver Sacks who I'm sure you wrote wrote a book called

828
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:36,000
an anthropologist on Mars and that comment was literally in reference to a spouse I believe

829
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:42,400
living in the in the context of an autistic spouse and felt like an anthropologist on Mars

830
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:48,240
in relating to this person and so maybe that's just an interesting coincidence but I wonder if

831
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:54,560
you care to speculate if or how or if it matters at all how that might relate to some of Musk's

832
01:15:54,560 --> 01:16:00,320
visions and and sort of relationships with earth and space just a thought gosh I wish I knew how

833
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:07,920
to answer this question I don't but I um this this produced um I can just tell a story um which is

834
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:14,320
in um in my classroom the first time I taught this um this particular question produced um the

835
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,240
one of the hardest classroom situations I've ever been in um because a a student who was about to

836
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:27,840
graduate to go work for Elon Musk and SpaceX um got very upset um about the students in the class

837
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:35,600
who were criticizing Musk um he started um sort of tearing up and he said you know it's not fair

838
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,280
of you to accuse him of being in all these privileged positions after all he's autistic and

839
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:47,200
you know he's so he is he is disabled and he's um and we need to be you know kinder to him and more

840
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:56,800
understanding um and uh and it took the students a while to recover um and another of them said

841
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,160
yeah but but look at the damage that he's doing um to all these sorts of beings and all these

842
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:09,920
and he his SpaceX had just been um audited for um sexism and for abuses like labor abuses and all

843
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:21,040
the time um so I don't know how to um I certainly don't know how to connect um his uh his autism

844
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,760
to his sort of seeing the world differently um I think it's really cool to think about um Greta

845
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:31,440
Thunberg the um the ecological activist who talks herself about who gives an account herself and

846
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:38,000
says look I my autism allows me not to force me not to close myself off from the world and makes

847
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,440
me open up to it such that like the destruction of our earth is hurting me physically um I would

848
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,320
need to hear him talk about that to know how he experiences that um but I certainly don't think

849
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,680
and I don't think this is where you were going but I certainly don't think um that it's a that um

850
01:17:53,680 --> 01:18:02,080
that his having you know neurodiversity is a is a reason to um sort of allow him to escape critique

851
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,480
or or anything like that um so because there there are all sorts of things you can do with

852
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,280
neurodiversity you can do good things or you can do bad things um but anyway I would like yeah I

853
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,960
don't I haven't I haven't I don't know if you've heard of him sort of account for his kind of

854
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,080
cosmic vision and his neurological situation but have you have you heard anything like that

855
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,040
but yeah yeah thank you so much yeah

856
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:40,960
he has self perpetuated the the narrative that he is has Asperger's um but there is no

857
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:49,760
definitive diagnosis and in the videos you see of him being very gregarious very he cultivates

858
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:57,120
this after a period of time and so there's a lot of debate as to how much of this is him performing

859
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:06,000
this identity of the brilliant genius uh Asperger's and how much of it is actually real thanks so we

860
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,360
actually have a question from online from Kadas who is live streaming from Toronto we live in the

861
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:21,360
future now it's amazing hi hello kagdas and tio anyway um he's he's written in he says if you

862
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:26,800
can ask really quick for me here it is is there a difference between musk and those folks and all

863
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:34,800
those data scientists that are now part of nerd theology and aren't those people replaceable

864
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,000
while nerd theology is not oh my gosh can anybody in this room or can can we get more I don't know

865
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,040
what nerd theology is kagdas kagdas I thought all theology was nerd theology

866
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,000
why did I get into this line of work um I am so sorry would you my friend please be

867
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,600
in contact with me by email and I'd love to talk more about this um you can find me very easily

868
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,960
just throw me an email and let's talk about it thank you so much for the question I'm so sorry

869
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,720
not to know um what that what that is but I want to know more thanks

870
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:14,000
hi thank you so much um this is brilliant and um thought provoking in so many ways um

871
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:24,800
and I get my question is um I hadn't occurred to me that um where musk has kind of multiple reasons

872
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:33,280
for needing to leave earth and contrast with bezos who condenses it down to one thing

873
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:41,040
and namely energy um out of all the multiple things that human beings need um do you have

874
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:48,000
a sense for why why he what what's his logic maybe two questions what is what is the reason

875
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:56,720
that he gives for narrowing it down to just the energy issue and what sense do you maybe make

876
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:03,840
of it like you know do you have a sense for why he would narrow that okay um so let me ask the

877
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,840
question behind it to answer the question that's behind it too which is um musk never talks about

878
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:16,240
dependence on energy on fossil fuels on polluting the skies um he doesn't talk about ecology at all

879
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,160
ecological collapse is not one of his coming disasters it's an asteroid or it's robots

880
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:27,360
or it's like so he just never addresses climate change bezos absolutely addresses climate change

881
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:35,200
and he but he wants to have a single a single problem so that it that one problem can be addressed

882
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,120
so it's not a multifarious problem because then that's gonna so he has to consolidate it into one

883
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:45,360
problem one could imagine his consolidating in it into um the relentless pursuit of profit for

884
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,400
example which necessitates extractivism which necessitates overproduction which necessitates

885
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,040
it necessitates inequality and you know he doesn't want to do that because that's precisely the

886
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:04,240
system that he wants us to perpetuate um so he he goes for a problem that has in his eyes a very

887
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:09,040
clear solution which is the energy problem he's also relying on the work of oniel who's working

888
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:15,440
in the 70s who's responding to an energy crisis and so for oniel the energy crisis was the crisis

889
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:20,800
this was this this sort of coalesced all of our other problems under the reliance on energy so

890
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,920
i think these are some some of the reasons he goes for that thanks

891
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:32,480
hello hi um i'd like to invite you to expand more on the note on which you close the presentation

892
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,680
which is the word care and what you mean by care if i can invite that word to travel we began with

893
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:44,000
the absence of care we arrive at care in the book you name some figures who can keep the care and

894
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,840
mlk the barricades dorthy day as opposed to others who don't keep the care some people have it they

895
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,760
had it yesterday they have it today they might have it in the future but what is it great

896
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:04,320
um i'm trying to decide there's always that moment where you're like do i go for heidegger

897
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,720
or do i not go for heidegger um because going for heidegger can be so helpful but then you've

898
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:13,200
got heidegger and then you have to deal with him and then you're like why is heidegger here um

899
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:20,400
but there's a sense there's a sense from heidegger um with whom i have a very tortured relationship

900
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:26,560
and whom i'm sure will make it up to all of us in the afterlife his idiocy um in the face of his

901
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:36,720
extreme brilliance um that for heidegger um care is uh dwelling with that's how he defines it like a

902
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:43,200
commitment to dwelling with to remaining with so what i make of uh mk jemisin's community is this

903
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:49,520
is a city in which the inhabitants that that what the care which is marked for her by things like

904
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,560
everybody can have a house if they want to if they'd rather sleep outside you don't put spikes on

905
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,960
benches so that they can't sleep you make sure that the bridges are swept so that people if they

906
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:06,320
want to sleep there can sleep there right um everybody has money everybody has enough food

907
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,520
everybody like these are the sort of markers of care um but it seems to me that you only get to

908
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:17,840
those markers if you are committed to living with like living together not living in a different

909
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,840
place not living in a wealthier enclave not living with a um so i would i would i would say

910
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:31,840
that um and again this is like this is like my my my my little caredar um starts beeping

911
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:39,440
when i see um practices that um are put into place when people are committed to dwelling

912
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,520
with one another living with one another and treating one another um as though everybody is

913
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:56,000
just as important as anybody else is that do we're gonna take one final question from over here

914
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,320
okay um hi hi thank you for your brilliant and horrifying presentation and especially for uh

915
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:11,200
helping the pill go down easier with your great sense of humor um it seems to me that most religions

916
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:17,440
have to do with the promise of divine rescue from this world this one has a new twist especially with

917
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,040
musk that we're going to somehow go off to some other galaxy and these folks pretend to be really

918
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:29,360
sciency right but uh what we know is that the universe is expanding and i've never heard a credible

919
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:34,960
scientist suggest that anything like these folks are suggesting is anything but fanciful

920
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:45,440
do they ever get pushed and um by uh scientists who say you're you're literally not on planet earth

921
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:53,280
intellectually on this stuff and here's the problem with obama and oh and first of all let me let me

922
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,080
go back to the um religion and other worldliness and i'm totally indebted to your work on green

923
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,080
religions and earthy religions and um jz smith has this distinction between what he calls utopian

924
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,880
religions and lockative religions that utopian religions tell us that our real home is somewhere

925
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,720
else and lockative religions say this is where we come from this is where our ancestors are this is

926
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:18,560
and these are of course the traditions that you're interested in right um so this in my in my um

927
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,960
sort of informal catalog is a is an extreme and again a sort of plotting version of a utopian

928
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:33,520
religion just in this very sort of concrete bad white heady in form um okay uh now i've lost track

929
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:40,400
of the other of the big question the big question was about remind me oh the scientist science yes

930
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:46,880
what does science say okay so here's the thing this is what scientists say scientists say this guy is

931
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,240
nuts this man is is absolutely off his rocker we can't newt mars we can't

932
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:01,280
but i'm not gonna get i i a geologist i'm a planetary scientist i love mars and i want to

933
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,320
know about rocks on mars and i want to understand what they are and where they came from and what

934
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:12,800
it says about is there like some little bayata hiding in a rock somewhere on mars that means i

935
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,800
need missions to mars and nasa isn't funding those freaking missions and i know if i'm a

936
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,800
planetary scientist because this is what my planetary scientists friends say that if they

937
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:27,760
ever get to mars it's gonna be on one of elan musk's rockets right if they even just get like a

938
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:35,680
robotic lander on mars right so increasingly science our scientists are epistemologically

939
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,600
dependent upon the corporate sector of the space race and as one of my friends said she was like i

940
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,320
hate this guy but if he can get me to mars okay like how else am i nasa hasn't done it

941
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,640
like what have they been doing for so this is the problem it doesn't matter that he's intellectually

942
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:56,160
debunked he's getting the stuff in the sky right and then and then this is the same issue and then

943
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,520
depending on your political orientation um whether you care about the moon or mars you might debunk

944
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,040
him scientifically but you're like yeah but we got to get to the moon because it's because china

945
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,960
and that's all it ever is there's there's no indication of like what it's just

946
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:14,320
because china um and so therefore no matter what you we know we can we can dismiss his long-term

947
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:19,840
visions but like he's he's gonna make a lander that lands on the moon and he's gonna help us make

948
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,960
the gateway that allows us to rotate anywhere we want on the moon to navigate anywhere we want

949
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,240
on the moon we were not going to be able to get a decent military position without this kind of

950
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:35,760
reusable affordable space technology he's the one who's giving it to us who cares that he's a crazy

951
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:43,520
who cares that he's a crazy person we need we need him yeah and on that note please join me once

952
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:55,280
more in thanking mary jane
