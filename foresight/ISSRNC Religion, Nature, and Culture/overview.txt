Checking ISSRNC Religion, Nature, and Culture/Mary-Jane Rubenstein Keynote Address - 2023 ISSRNC Conference.txt
1. **Question about Commitment to Living Together**: The questioner is asking if Mary Jane (MJ) has encountered any intentional communities or groups where individuals are committed to living together, not just cohabiting but genuinely treating each other as equals and valuing community over individual wealth or status.

2. **MJ's Response on Intentional Communities**: MJ describes practices she's observed in various intentional communities, emphasizing that when people commit to dwelling with one another, treating everyone as important, and working together, it can lead to meaningful and successful communal living.

3. **Question about Science and Space Ambitions**: The questioner challenges Elon Musk's scientific credibility regarding his space ambitions, noting that most scientists consider Musk's plans for Mars colonization fanciful and not grounded in current scientific understanding of space travel. However, the questioner acknowledges that despite the skepticism, Musk's companies might still be the ones to advance space exploration due to their investments and technological developments.

4. **MJ's Response on Science and Space Race**: MJ agrees that Musk is a controversial figure and his scientific claims have been debunked. However, she points out that scientists are increasingly dependent on corporate funding for space exploration, including Musk's ventures. She suggests that political and national interests, such as competing with China, might drive the support for Musk's space endeavors, regardless of his unconventional approach.

5. **Final Remarks**: MJ concludes by highlighting the paradox where scientific integrity is secondary to the practical advancements in space technology that Musk's companies provide. She suggests that despite Musk's questionable vision for Mars colonization, his contributions to affordable and reusable space technology are significant and necessary for future space exploration, including military applications.

In summary, MJ discussed both the philosophical aspects of intentional communities and the pragmatic realities of space exploration, highlighting the complex interplay between ideals, science, and political/economic interests. She acknowledged the tension between skepticism about Musk's plans and the practical benefits of his space technology advancements.
