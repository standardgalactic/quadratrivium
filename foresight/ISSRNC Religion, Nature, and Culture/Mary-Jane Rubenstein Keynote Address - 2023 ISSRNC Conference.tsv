0	6280	Dr. Mary Jane Rubinstein is a professor of religion and science in society at Wesleyan
6280	11520	University and is affiliated with the philosophy department and the feminist gender and sexuality
11520	12920	studies program there.
12920	17920	She holds a BA from Williams College, an M. Phil from Cambridge University, and a PhD
17920	20800	from Columbia University.
20800	24900	Her research unearths the philosophies and histories of religion and science, especially
24900	29000	in relation to cosmology, ecology, and space travel.
29000	33640	She is the author of Astro Topia, The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race, which
33640	39760	you'll be hearing, I think, some material from that book more or less this afternoon.
39760	44600	That book just came out from University of Chicago in 2022, and I highly recommend it.
44600	49920	I think it's one of the first works of yours that seems to me to make a more explicit connection
49920	56880	between thinking about space, cosmology, astronomy, and actually, I would say, ethics, but at
56880	60840	least the environment in a much more explicit way.
60840	68220	Pantheologies, excuse me, God's Worlds and Monsters, Columbia University Press 2018,
68220	72200	Worlds Without End, the lives, many lives of the universe, I'm sorry, the multiverse,
72200	77480	which is the book that just received the Iris Award this afternoon, if you missed that.
77480	79280	Congratulations.
79280	85580	And Strange Wonder, the closure of metaphysics in the opening of all Columbia University
85580	91140	Press 2009, which, for me, was a book that I came across when I also became very interested
91140	94940	in wonder and started writing about wonder, and then I came across, I think, first, an
94940	98860	article of yours, and then your book, and I thought, sure, you said like everything
98860	103940	that I wanted to say, which keeps happening, keeps happening with everything that I'm interested
103940	108340	in, I think, ah, well, Ruben Steiner, you did it.
108340	115380	She's also, and of course, she just won the 2022 Iris Award for her book that I mentioned
115380	120780	earlier from 2014, Worlds Without End, the many lives of the multiverse, so.
120780	126880	And she's also involved currently in a project called Sacred Space, Religion, and Cosmic
126880	132260	Exploration, which is a series, or involves a series of webinars with Lance Garabi, and
132260	137420	this is through the Interplanetary Initiative here at Arizona State University.
137420	142660	So please join me in welcoming our keynote speaker, Dr. Mary Jane Rubenstein, and we'll
142660	147380	have some time for questions and comments afterwards, but we will have to also clear
147380	150740	out of this room quickly to prepare for our evening festivities.
150740	160100	So welcome, Dr. Rubenstein.
160100	166700	Thank you so much, Lisa, and thank you to Lisa and to Amanda Nichols and to Evan Berry for
166700	172180	getting together this just beautiful gathering of lovely people.
172180	178180	I have never been to the ISS RNC, this is my first time here, and I am just taken by
178180	183100	the collegiality and warmth and generosity of everybody here, so I'm so grateful for
183100	187140	the community here and for the welcome that you've given me.
187140	189140	Thank you all so much.
189140	196460	Quick zero item, Jacob Boss and I seem to be wearing the same dress, our slides are,
196460	202500	have the same background, because what else, but so anyway, great slides look alike.
202500	206580	I'm sorry, Jacob, that I, that, you know, I hope that that's okay with you.
206580	209620	Okay, I'm going to start with a tune up.
209620	217300	I'd like to open by considering the title of our joint endeavor this weekend, After
217300	218820	Earth.
218820	223980	Each of us could endlessly turn this little stone of a prepositional phrase and reveal
224020	230460	in it all manner of meanings, but to me there are three that most readily announce themselves.
230460	235340	The first is the sense of after Earth as straightforwardly temporal.
235340	240540	There has been Earth and there either will or won't be something after it.
240540	246140	So I'll be talking today about plans to move some portion of humanity and human productions
246140	252060	off this planet and onto another, plans that will allegedly allow the species to embark
252140	254900	on an eternal cosmic future.
254900	260780	These are instances of after Earth in its most proddingly sequential sense.
260780	266420	It's the kind of thinking we find in the post-apocalyptic Will and Jaden Smith film that shares a title
266420	272940	with our conference or in Interstellar with its somber, destinal tagline, mankind was
272940	277700	born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.
277700	283740	The second sense of after Earth as it resounds in my particular ears is ontological, taking
283740	289980	its lead from Bill McKibbin's suggestion that what we are living on and as is no longer
289980	297940	Earth, rather than a self-regulating, broadly homeostatic, Gyanic symbiont, the planet has
297940	305180	become a convulsing set of mutually destabilizing systems that McKibbin calls Earth as if the
305180	309620	planet itself were groaning and wailing at us.
309620	314980	And third, you knew I'd do this, you can't be a continental dweeb and not do this, third
314980	318900	is the sense of being in pursuit of Earth.
318900	323500	And it's this sense I'd ultimately like to consider as a possible horizon.
323500	326180	Here's some hildegard to help us.
326180	331860	What if we thought of Earth as what we're after, as what we want, what we desire, what
331860	333820	we're trying for?
333820	339140	Thackeray uses the preposition in this sense when he speaks of an abiding tenderness in
339140	345220	the newcomer's most worthy titular kernel with that fidelity which was an instinct of
345220	347260	his nature, writes Thackeray.
347260	353100	The brave young man thought ever of his absent child and longed after him.
353100	359540	What if Earth were what we long after, what we care about as in she asked after the health
359540	360980	of my mother?
360980	367580	What if it's not speed or comfort or even love that we're after, but Earth itself?
367580	373420	In the human condition, Hannah Arendt reminds us that the word human is etymologically inextricable
373420	374860	from humus.
374860	379020	To be human is to be earthly, earthish, earthen.
379020	385260	In this particular sense, then, it's actually incoherent to speak of humans living in space.
385260	390260	Once we figure out how to build communities elsewhere, we will be post-human, post-humus
390540	396020	or rendered more optimistically by my colleague Lance Garave, astro sapien.
396020	402260	If we ever actually move to the moon or Mars, we will, along this interpretation, be a different
402260	403260	species.
403260	404980	We will no longer be human.
404980	410460	And in fact, Elena Roche argued earlier this afternoon that we're already no longer human.
410460	412620	We're already something else.
412620	418260	Then again, to cite Eleanor Craig's riff on Sylvia Winter, we have in an important sense
418260	420460	never been human.
420460	427060	After all, the imperial culture that has defined humanity in its own image has been so ruthlessly
427060	432500	inhumane that the concept collapses under its own colonial freight.
432500	438660	Ben again again, as Winter herself insists, the dehumanized have always invented new ways
438660	443180	of being human that transform the terms of that term.
443180	448460	In particular, by refusing humanity's frenetic self-distinction from the animal-vegetable
448460	454960	mineral world, along with the frenetic Abrahamic distinction between this world and divinity.
454960	460060	In this sense, we might think of being after the human and being after Earth as entangled
460060	465740	projects, and here I'm indebted to Carol Wayne White, for whom becoming human would
465740	472020	also mean becoming more than human, which is to say both earthen and sacred, and as such
472020	477140	totally bound up with the more than human world that constitutes us, and that we in
477140	480580	turn both create and destroy.
480580	486020	All of these senses of after Earth can be found uncannily composted in the funeral
486020	491420	litany of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, whose familiar ashes-to-ashes dust-to-dust
491420	497940	is preceded by the phrase Earth to Earth, a rare orthodox admission that the Earth is
497940	499860	our Alpha and Omega.
499860	507260	We come both from it and to it, which is to say we're both after it and after it.
507260	512940	This afternoon evening I'll be focusing on the first temporal, arguably least interesting
512940	518600	sense I have just sketched of after Earth, in the hopes of opening onto the last aspirational
518600	519600	sense of it.
519600	525060	I'll spend most of my time unveiling the new workings of what Amber Lowe theorized yesterday
525060	532220	as the master's clock, that is the unrelenting teleology of settler colonialism that's now
532220	536280	urging us to go grab new land and exploit after Earth.
536280	541260	It's a shocking instance, I'll use this term again of what Alfred North Whitehead called
541260	547620	the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, namely the notion that living after Earth means abandoning
547620	553420	it by boarding rocket ships and building new homes in underground Martian bunkers and
553420	556100	orbital space colonies.
556100	559620	Especially for the theatrically inclined, it's a fascinating story.
559620	564180	Honestly, if I were feeling more playful, I'd suggest we turn the whole thing into a comedy
564180	569740	of errors, call it the fallacy of misplaced concrete, and run it in a Gilbert and Sullivan
569740	570740	theater.
570740	576660	The problem is, I can't find this particular story funny for too long, because regardless
576660	583060	of whether Elon Musk ever makes it to Mars, or Jeff Bezos actually builds a paradise between
583060	589380	the moon and New York City, they and their astroprenerial cohort can do a monstrous amount
589380	594180	of ecological damage to and beyond the Earth in the meantime.
594180	600820	The key then, will be to expose the temporal fallacy of the messianic edge of new space,
600820	608340	and to turn the sequential otherworldly after Earth into a passionate thisworldly one.
608340	615460	And let me apologize for Sarah McFarland-Taylor and my spending this much energy on Elon
615460	617420	Musk today.
617420	623660	As you will see, our papers start from very similar places, diverge along totally different
623660	624660	sources.
624660	628540	Sarah's sources are just stunning, and thank you so much for them, and arrive at the same
628540	629540	conclusion.
629540	632460	So this only means to me that we must be right.
632460	638380	So thank you again, Sarah, for your beautiful meticulous and fun paper this morning.
638380	640700	Part one.
640700	647460	On October 23rd, 2020, one day after the final presidential debate, and seven months into
647460	653540	an epidemiological nightmare that had closed schools, crippled local businesses, killed
653540	660500	hundreds of thousands of Americans, and made most parents into psychopaths, the GOP tweeted
660500	664020	a final distillation of its campaign platform.
664020	667740	Prez Trump is fighting for you, it exclaimed.
667740	670380	Here are some of his priorities for a second term.
670380	674060	First, establish permanent manned presence on the moon.
674060	678140	Second, send the first manned mission to Mars.
678140	682900	After the moon and Mars came infrastructure and Wi-Fi.
682900	690460	And then, in a follow-up tweet, the GOP promised a COVID vaccine, medical supplies, and pharmaceuticals.
690920	694100	But they clearly wanted the moon and Mars out front.
694100	698380	Who wants to worry about respirators when you can dream about rockets?
698380	704020	You might recall that during his first hundred days in office, President Biden signed 60
704020	710420	executive orders, almost half of which were direct reversals of Trump-era policies.
710420	716380	This administration disagrees with that one on almost everything except outer space.
716380	723500	In fact, the only major Trump-era objectives the Biden administration has retained are first,
723500	728980	the creation of a space force to wage orbital warfare, and second, the plan to settle the
728980	733700	moon and Mars through a new mission they're calling Artemis, after the Greek goddess of
733700	737100	the moon, the twin sister of Apollo.
737100	739780	Why do we need to settle the moon and Mars?
739780	746200	In Biden's non-referential words, because America can do big things, we can see possibilities
746200	747720	no one has seen before.
747720	751080	We can go places no one has ever gone before.
751080	756200	The message was, frankly, clearer in the Trump administration, which insisted that it is America's
756200	760040	duty to spread its influence throughout the universe.
760040	764680	As Trump declared in his last State of the Union address, in reaffirming our heritage
764680	770240	as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.
770240	776080	Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars.
776120	781480	Most of us are numb at this point to the extension of frontier language into space, but like
781480	786320	any dead metaphor, this one conceals far more than it reveals.
786320	790800	We're all indebted to Catherine Newell for having tracked the metaphor of space, the
790800	792520	final frontier.
792520	799400	To the 1952 special issue of Collier's magazine, entitled Man Will Conquer Space Soon, the
799400	805360	lead article written by former Nazi rocket scientist Verne von Braun was called Crossing
805360	807640	the Last Frontier.
807640	814400	In the short years following his amnesty through the CIA's then-secret Operation Paper Clip,
814400	820320	von Braun had become convinced it was America's destiny to extend human civilization into
820320	826880	outer space for the sake of freedom, democracy, and get this eternal salvation.
826880	832560	A little known detail that Catherine reveals about von Braun is that during his denazification
832640	839240	on American soil, he became a born-again Christian, who believed it was incumbent upon American
839240	845080	earthlings to spread the gospel to what he called man's oldest and last frontier, the
845080	847440	heavens themselves.
847440	853200	Space travel, as von Braun saw it and as Trump recently reaffirmed, is a vertical extension
853200	859680	of manifest destiny, just as God allegedly endorsed and even demanded the westward expansion
859680	865000	of mainly white-skinned European-descended Americans in the 19th century.
865000	870680	God is calling Americans in the 20th and 21st centuries to conquer a new frontier, an infinite
870680	873120	frontier in outer space.
873120	878960	Okay, so in February of 2020, Trump says we're going back to the moon and then to Mars because
878960	883520	space is the next frontier and America's manifest destiny is in the stars.
883520	888840	Of course, the language of divinely authorized conquest is nothing new in the American space
888920	890000	program.
890000	894920	The only thing that's unprecedented in this contemporary space race is the extent to
894920	899560	which private industry is involved in this godly conquest.
899560	905560	And for this development, we must thank not Donald Trump, but his ordinarily more palatable
905560	908520	predecessor, Barack Obama.
908520	915240	The key date here is February 1, 2010, when the Obama administration released the 2011
915240	921120	budget for NASA that ended the space shuttle program and reallocated funds to the so-called
921120	923400	new space industries.
923400	929480	It's time, Obama's advisors had written, to consider turning this transport service over
929480	931200	to the commercial sector.
931200	936560	You know, to make rocket ships as mass produced as cars and buses and speedboats and airplanes,
936560	938520	the problem, of course, was funding.
938520	943400	Who would invest in a company dedicated to flying supplies up to the International Space
943400	944400	Station?
944400	946880	What would be in it for the shareholders?
946880	953640	The situation for the cosmic prospector seemed grim until November of 2015, when Congress
953640	959560	passed a startlingly bipartisan bill called the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness
959560	967040	Act, which promises, among other things, that any U.S. citizen who recovers a rock or mineral
967040	972280	or quantum of water in space is allowed to own, use, and sell it.
972320	974240	Huzzah, said the investors.
974240	979200	We're saved, said the space mining firms that seem to spring out of a thousand simultaneous
979200	980360	know-heres.
980360	987280	After all, if a corporation is a person, a citizen, even, in U.S. law, then its hypothetical
987280	992240	extractions and uses and sales will be protected under this law.
992240	999600	Elated, the CEO of Moon Express, a lunar mining outfit that collaborates closely with NASA,
999600	1006800	went so far as to call the CSLCA the aeronautic equivalent of the Homestead Act.
1006800	1007800	Space.
1007800	1012680	Finally, another frontier for restless white folks.
1012680	1018880	This economically giddy corporate proliferation has brought us into the era known as new space.
1018880	1024240	To an already dense field of political, military, technological, and religious reasons to get
1024240	1029720	America back to space as soon as possible, new space adds the speed and intensity of
1029720	1032560	unregulated capitalist economics.
1032560	1037920	And the excitement over this new gold rush in space transcends party lines, unable to
1037920	1040520	agree on literally anything else.
1040520	1045200	Our elected officials on the left, center, right, and alt-right snuggle in together to
1045200	1052280	hand outer space over to these cosmic conquistadors, these astropreneurs whom I've come to think
1052280	1056320	of as particularly toxic techno-messiahs.
1056320	1063480	And so Sarah was sketching the three roles of the saint and the messiah and the ... help
1063480	1064480	me?
1064480	1065480	The what?
1065480	1066480	Yes.
1066480	1067480	Thank you.
1067480	1072080	And I'm going down the messianic route right here.
1072080	1076600	To be sure, the astropreneurs don't seem particularly religious.
1076600	1081800	They lack the rousing scriptural appeals of Mike Pence, who assured us that God was
1081800	1083800	calling America to conquer the heavens.
1083800	1089440	They can't even muster the civil religiousness of Trump's manifest destiny or Biden's vague
1089440	1091280	spirit of America.
1091280	1097080	What they offer instead are promises to make life fun again, to cleanse us of the guilt
1097080	1103120	of fossil fuels, and above all, to save humanity from eternal death.
1103120	1105960	How will they accomplish such lofty goals?
1105960	1111240	By converting the cosmos itself into capital and building a new Jerusalem on the infinite
1111240	1113520	frontier of outer space.
1113520	1118160	The world is coming to an end, the messiah cries, but trust in me and I'll bring you
1118160	1121480	to a new world where you'll finally be free.
1121480	1126280	Free from death, free from earth, free from guilt and gravity, at least most of it, and
1126280	1129880	free above all from earthly regulation.
1129880	1135320	In the meantime, China's got a rover on Mars, a satellite on the far side of the moon, and
1135320	1138360	a brand new space station in low earth orbit.
1138360	1144920	Richard Branson is selling 200,000 dollar tourist tickets on his notoriously unreliable
1144920	1146440	space plane.
1146440	1150720	Space mining firms have collected billions of dollars before they've even got their
1150720	1152720	probes on an asteroid.
1152720	1158000	A failed Israeli mission has dumped dehydrated tardigrades on the lunar surface.
1158000	1163040	Rwanda has bought the rights to launch 300,000 satellites of its own.
1163040	1168480	The U.S. has created a new branch of the military to pulverize its enemies from the heavens,
1168480	1174160	and some astronautic startup says it's going to build a ferris wheel-shaped space hotel
1174160	1179040	in orbit and name it after, wait for it, Werner von Braun.
1179040	1180800	How did we get here?
1180800	1182360	What is going on?
1182360	1186720	And is there anything, you will stay at the von Braun space hotel, like that is the last
1186720	1187720	plate?
1187720	1191480	Is there anything anyone can do about it?
1191480	1196640	I first realized something was up when Elon Musk launched a car into orbit.
1196640	1202840	It was January of 2018, and SpaceX was looking to test its Falcon heavy rocket, woo the U.S.
1202840	1205720	military, and make sure everybody was watching.
1205720	1211640	So rather than display the rocket's carrying capacity with, say, slabs of concrete or steel,
1211640	1215760	Musk decided to strap a blazing red Tesla Roadster to its back.
1215800	1219840	You will recognize this slide from Sarah's presentation.
1219840	1223440	A perfectly good, even exquisite car.
1223440	1231240	$100,000 worth of chrome, leather, steel, glass, state-of-the-art navigation software,
1231240	1238120	green technology, and human labor hurled uselessly into orbit, not around the Earth, but around
1238120	1239480	the sun.
1239480	1245360	It was an act of immense bravado, extraordinary waste, and literally cosmic presumptuousness
1245440	1250400	Now along with eight planets and some dwarves, moons, and asteroids, there is a tricked-out
1250400	1256760	convertible circling our solar orb, driven to the end of days by a mannequin in a spacesuit
1256760	1260760	called Starman.
1260760	1267120	Musk named his Sisyphean Astro Bot after the alien messiah of David Bowie's 1972 Ziggy
1267120	1269120	Stardust album.
1269120	1273760	Bowie's song, Life on Mars, accompanied the rocket launch that flung the Roadster toward
1273760	1281760	the stars, and his space oddity still loops endlessly on the car's solar-powered JVC speakers.
1281760	1286800	Starman's glove compartment is stuffed with multimedia versions of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's
1286800	1292800	Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy, and the Falcon-heavy rocket itself
1292800	1296000	is named after the millennium Falcon of Star Wars.
1296000	1298480	Musk, you might say, is a geek's geek.
1298560	1304000	His aesthetic, composed by a nostalgia for the future of his teenage past, complete with
1304000	1309680	rockets, spacesuits, Martian colonies, glam rock, and a free-market promise of infinite
1309680	1311280	possibility.
1311280	1313880	Musk is also an inveterate showman.
1313880	1319680	Back in 2003, he was having a hard time getting NASA to take SpaceX and its newly fabricated
1319680	1321760	Falcon 1 seriously.
1321840	1329600	He drove the seven-story rocket on an enormous flatbed truck from Boca Chica, Texas, to Washington,
1329600	1335200	D.C., and parked it on the street outside the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration.
1336000	1341360	In the two decades since then, Musk has continued to manufacture all manner of mind-blowing
1341360	1347360	spectacles, Twitter-storm launches, dramatic explosions, tickets sold to billionaires for
1347360	1353440	trips on unbuilt ships, and a manifesto about his intention to save humanity by getting the
1353440	1355520	hell off this doomed planet Earth.
1356400	1361040	Meanwhile, on the other side of Texas, Jeff Bezos has been making a lot less noise.
1361600	1367200	In the early 2000s, while Musk was dragging NASA, the Air Force, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin
1367200	1372640	into high-profile antitrust suits, Bezos was quietly buying up ranches.
1373280	1380560	Under the auspices of improvised corporations, Bezos cobbled together over 300,000 acres of
1380560	1384560	West Texan land so he could test his rockets without anybody noticing.
1385200	1389840	Musk had bought the land, too, but he makes so much noise that the Rangers at Mother Neff
1389840	1394080	State Park now warn their visitors that if something sounds like the end of the world,
1394080	1396400	it's probably not. At least not yet.
1397360	1400800	The men are both magicians, but of really different sorts.
1401360	1405840	Musk pulls rabbits out of hats while Bezos makes the coin disappear behind your ear.
1406400	1412960	While Musk is shouting, look mom! Wait, that's not it! Bezos hides in his room to perfect the trick.
1413520	1418480	Both billionaires are building reusable, affordable, state-of-the-art rockets,
1418480	1422640	but Musk raced to the launches while Bezos worked on the landings.
1422720	1428320	Elon's had us looking up at the exploding skies while Jeff has kept us staring at our own damn
1428320	1434560	laps, one clicking the lint rollers and cake pans and dog sweaters that finance his more cosmic
1434560	1438880	endeavors. As Bezos finally explained a couple of years ago, quote,
1438880	1443840	every time you buy shoes on Amazon, you're helping Blue Origin. I appreciate it very much,
1444480	1451200	and suddenly I hate my shoes. Bezos himself articulated the methodological distinction
1451200	1458240	between Blue Origin and SpaceX in a 2004 letter to his then-tiny aerospace staff.
1458240	1463280	Be the tortoise, he told them, and not the hare. His motto for the company is
1463280	1472720	gradatim ferociter, or step-by-step ferociously, a grittier Latinate rendition of slow and steady
1472720	1478640	wins the race. The phrase is inscribed on banners beneath the company's coat of arms.
1478640	1486240	It's got a coat of arms, which features two turtles standing on top of a globe reaching
1486240	1492400	from North America to a gilded solar system. Crowning the image is a cruciform sun.
1493120	1498480	Anchoring it is a winged hourglass with all the sands run out, and the whole thing looks kind
1498480	1502720	of like a 15th century cosmographed walked into a Harry Potter fanzine.
1502720	1510720	More nerd than geek, Bezos reads everything in print, considers even the most outlandish
1510720	1515520	alternatives before making up his mind, and demands that ideas be pitched to him in full
1515520	1521840	paragraph form. As we all know, he's a book's guy. In addition to ESOP, his references include
1521840	1526880	JR, Tolkien, Isaac, Asimov, Jules Verne, E&M Banks, Neil Stevenson, and William Gibson.
1527440	1532960	Now and then he even mentions a wrinkle in time, the only work by a woman to make the
1532960	1539200	astropreneurial canon. But when it comes to space, Bezos' biggest influence is Star Trek.
1540000	1546080	While Musk is off actualizing George Lucas with his exploding falcons and epic soundtracks,
1546080	1552640	Bezos is cultivating the more genteel gestalt of the star ship Enterprise. As the Atlantic's
1552720	1559680	Franklin Feuer reports, Bezos initially wanted to call Amazon MakeItSo.com as an homage to Captain
1559680	1569680	Jean-Luc Picard, whom he now uncannily resembles. Bezos named his dog Kamala in honor of the
1569680	1574800	empathic metamorph you may remember from Krio's Prime. And as you may have heard about a year
1574800	1580480	ago, he boldly took William Shatner, where no 90-year-old actor had gone before. Shatner came
1580480	1586560	back terrified. Let's talk about that later. The question you might be asking is why? What are
1586560	1594400	these billionaires up to in space? It is old news to you by now. Elon Musk wants us to go to Mars.
1594400	1602000	In fact, he explained in a 2016 manifesto, it's been his goal all along making humans a
1602000	1608080	multi-planetary species by setting up a self-sustaining city on the red planet.
1608160	1613360	To anyone who will listen, Musk explains that Earth is a ticking time bomb. Sooner or later,
1613360	1619680	something will destroy humanity, whether it be an asteroid, nuclear war, or AI robots gone rogue.
1619680	1624400	Sooner or later, we're going to have to find somewhere else to live. And given the literally
1624400	1629600	infernal conditions of Venus, it's like 900 degrees Fahrenheit there, Mars is our best chance.
1630320	1634000	Catherine explained this morning, the roots of this logic, this coming disaster logic,
1634000	1639360	are also in Werner von Braun. Of course, five billion years from now,
1639360	1644240	the sun will explode into a red giant and engulf Earth and Mars in a fiery apocalypse.
1644240	1649680	So if we want humanity to endure forever, we're eventually going to have to make it to another
1649680	1655200	solar system. But we'll never be able to live anywhere else unless we start close to home
1655200	1660480	and soon before a giant asteroid or Alexa 5.0 wipes out the whole species.
1661440	1666880	At times, Musk seems to realize how much he sounds like that guy on the street with a cardboard
1666880	1672880	sign for tending the end of the world. Both disavowing and adopting the role of lunatic
1672880	1679520	prophet, Musk writes, I do not have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but eventually there will be
1679520	1686320	some doomsday event. With apocalypse on the horizon, our first option is to just let disaster
1686400	1691600	extinguish us as it did the dinosaurs. An option Musk finds so intolerable,
1691600	1698000	he never even entertains it. The alternative, he says, is to become a space-bearing civilization
1698000	1703600	and a multi-planetary species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go. So Mars it is.
1704320	1711200	The challenge will be making the enterprise affordable-ish. At the moment, Musk shows by
1711200	1718000	means of a perfectly bizarre Venn diagram, the price to Mars is infinite, leaving the set of
1718000	1723600	people who want to go to Mars completely distinct from the set of people who can afford to go to Mars.
1725040	1730400	Using conventional technology, Musk estimates that the price for a round-trip ticket to the
1730400	1738560	red planet could drop from infinity to $10 billion a person. But once his rockets attain full
1738560	1744800	reusability and efficiency, Musk predicts he'll be able to lower the cost to $200,000,
1744800	1752080	the median cost of a house in the United States. At that price, in his words, almost anyone could go
1752080	1758880	to Mars. All they need to do is save up a bit, sell their house, and pack a very small bag.
1759680	1765360	Anyone who doesn't have a house to sell can always get sponsored by an employer and pay it off with a
1765360	1773040	few years of labor as an indentured servant, I swear to the gods he has said this. When it comes
1773040	1779040	to advertising his new colony, Musk alternates between appealing to aspirational homesteaders
1779040	1785760	and revving up post-adolescent pub crawlers. On the one hand, he admits Mars is going to be seriously
1785760	1792080	hard work. Under current conditions, it's impossible to breathe or even just be on the planet without
1792080	1798080	a spacesuit. Since Mars has so little atmosphere, it would turn all the water in the human body to
1798080	1805120	steam and kill it instantaneously. Even with a spacesuit, there's so much radiation on Mars
1805120	1811120	that it will likely cause the colonists severe health problems. So as Musk concedes from time to
1811120	1819280	time, Mars will be like the Orhan Trail on a really bad day. There's a good chance you'll die, he says.
1819280	1820720	It's going to be tough going.
1823840	1827040	On the other hand, and this is the part Musk tends to dwell on,
1827040	1833760	the Martian Trail is going to be pretty cool. The trip itself will be like an astronaut club med.
1833760	1842320	A hundred people aboard one 400 foot BFR or big effing rocket for a seven month trip that Musk
1842320	1849200	insists will never feel cramped or boring. There will be zero gravity games Musk is really into
1849200	1854800	bouncing around. Plus movies, lecture halls, cabins, and our restaurant. It will be really fun to go,
1854800	1860560	Musk enthusiasts. You're going to have a great time. Nowhere in these descriptions does Musk explain
1860560	1866640	who will be staffing the restaurants, cleaning the cabins, or wiping the space vomit off the
1866640	1873600	gleaming walls of the BFR. Nor does he say who will be giving the lectures. Will it be you?
1874320	1880240	Will it be me? Extolling the virtues of Sylvia Winter and Robin Wall Kimmerer on a six month
1880240	1888160	rocket to Mars? As for the planet itself, Musk promises that it would be quite fun to be on Mars
1888160	1892560	because you would have gravity that's about 37% of that of Earth. So you would be able to lift
1892640	1899600	many things and bound around. Sure, the air is primarily carbon dioxide, but the same stuff that's
1899600	1905680	so toxic to humans will make it easy to grow plants, quote, just by compressing the atmosphere,
1905680	1912000	unquote. Faced with the problem of what he calls the radiation thing, Musk says inexplicably that
1912000	1917520	it's not too big of a deal. And although he understands that Mars is a little cold, the
1917520	1923280	average temperature is negative 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is to say over 100 degrees
1923280	1932000	below freezing. He assures his future colonists that we can warm it up. How exactly do you warm
1932000	1937840	up a frozen planet? You stick it in the microwave, hit the airspace above the ice caps with some
1937840	1942720	hydrogen bombs, and you'll jumpstart the global warming process, liberate tons of water and move
1942720	1949280	the Martian colony that much closer to autonomy. To be sure, most scientists think this is an
1949280	1955680	absolutely ridiculous plan. The director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos has estimated
1955680	1964160	it would take more than 10,000 missiles to carry out the nuke Mars. 10,000 Musk's response on Twitter,
1964720	1973120	no problem. If you're furrowing your brow at this fantasy of planetary hacking,
1973120	1979040	you're not alone. As astrobiologist Lucienne Walkowitz reminds us, we don't have a great
1979040	1985200	track record of controlling geological processes on the planet we've already got. How can we hope to
1985200	1991680	make a habitat out of Mars when we can't even preserve the habitability of Earth? It would seem
1991680	1997920	that recalibrating the biosystems of an already oxygenated, temperate, blue-green orb would be
1997920	2005920	a far easier task than bringing a planetary dust storm to life. When asked why he is choosing to
2005920	2011840	save humanity by sending us to Mars rather than by addressing injustice, poverty, and climate
2011840	2018480	change on Earth, Musk will often laugh and say, please forgive the direct quotation, fuck Earth.
2018560	2025760	Earth is done. Earth is history. Earth is so last eon. Considering the coral reefs, wet lands,
2025760	2031840	and clean skies that SpaceX has polluted and destroyed, and considering Musk's own advancement
2031840	2038080	of artificial intelligence, one could even accuse him of worsening the disaster to intensify the
2038080	2044480	need for salvation, of making the planet genuinely uninhabitable so that we will indeed need to leave
2044480	2052800	it for an after-Earth Martian utopia. Unlike the more classic utopians, Plato, Moore, Marx, and Engels,
2053440	2058560	Musk doesn't give us a clear idea of what his ideal society looks like. What he offers instead are
2058560	2064160	abstract promises of freedom from Earth, from international regulation, from gravity, and even
2064160	2069200	from death, at least at the level of the species. He hasn't hammered out the details because the
2069200	2077280	details would destroy the perfection, but it's going to be awesome on Mars. Part four. Jeff Bezos
2077280	2084480	isn't so sure. To my friends who want to move to Mars one day, Bezos reports, I say, why don't you go
2084480	2089280	live in Antarctica first for three years and then see what you think? Because Antarctica is a garden
2089280	2095760	paradise compared to Mars. We have sent probes to every planet in the solar system, says Bezos,
2095760	2100720	and believe me, Earth is the best one. There are waterfalls and beaches and palm trees and
2100720	2105360	fantastic cities and restaurants, and you're not going to get that anywhere but Earth for a really,
2105360	2112880	really long time. So if Musk is happy to leave Earth in the dust, Bezos is set on saving it.
2112880	2118960	If Musk named his SpaceX after the place he'd like to go, Bezos named Blue Origin after the
2118960	2125920	place he'll always be from, this gem of a planet called Earth. How then will Bezos restore and
2125920	2132960	preserve the blueness of our origin, the beauty of our Earth, by getting us off the planet? The
2132960	2138720	problem for Bezos is energy. We're using too much of it. Given an expanding and modernizing human
2138720	2144800	population, global industrial humanity will reach some absolute limits within the next century.
2144800	2149920	There's simply not enough fuel, whether from the ground, the wind, or even the sun as it's
2149920	2155520	accessible on Earth, to power a whole planet's worth of first-rate hospitals, bleeding-edge
2155520	2162320	electronics, megachurches, superstores, slaughterhouses, and industrial farms. We need more energy,
2162320	2168640	so we've got to go to space. So the old Marxist adage is true. It's easier to imagine the end
2168640	2173840	of the world than the end of capitalism, rather than proposing an alternative to the extraction
2173920	2179680	of resources, the relentless pursuit of profit, and the wasteful cruelty of factory farming.
2180240	2185920	Rather than use the funds he calls his Amazon winnings to win back the actual Amazon,
2186560	2192240	Bezos is spending all that money and time exporting the whole ecosystem into space.
2192800	2198480	Here's the way it'll work. Rather than checking out all the way to Mars, which is too far,
2198480	2205600	Bezos proposes we construct a series of bases on the Moon. We install solar panels on every base,
2205600	2210720	gaining access to far more solar energy than we could ever harness on Earth. We mine the Moon
2210720	2216400	for water, whose elements can be split and recombined into rocket fuel. Using far less energy than we
2216400	2222560	need at Cape Canaveral, we power many missions to mine asteroids for heavy and rare Earth metals,
2222560	2228480	at which point we begin to construct miles-long, free-floating habitations between the Earth
2228480	2235040	and the Moon. Yes, you've heard that right, giant space pods. The idea comes from Gerard O'Neill,
2235760	2241280	the Princeton physicist who began proposing in the mid-19th century that all heavy industry
2241280	2247680	and much of the human population be moved into space. Mines and factories would occupy asteroids
2247680	2253440	and the Moon, while residents, recreation and commerce would take place in giant cylindrical
2253440	2260800	tubes rotating to simulate gravity and positioned at Lagrange points to maintain a steady orbit.
2261840	2266480	Having attended O'Neill's lectures in college, Bezos remains a devotee.
2266480	2272560	This is Maui on its best day all year long, he says. No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.
2273120	2277680	In our climate-controlled Edens, we'd have everything we love on Earth, like air,
2277680	2282560	tree, birds and beaches, but nothing we hate. O'Neill, infamously promised,
2282560	2288240	we'd finally be free of mosquitoes. And in the meantime, Mother Earth would get a long overdue nap.
2289040	2293520	With all heavy industry and a good deal of humanity relocated off-planet,
2293520	2298880	the Earth could be zoned for light industry, some residents and recreation. In short, Earth
2298880	2303360	would become a planetary park, a great vacation spot, a lovely place to go to college.
2304080	2308560	Meanwhile, out in space, humans would get to play as many video games, have as many kids,
2308560	2314800	and eat as much red meat as they want, powered by limitless energy. According to Bezos' calculations,
2314800	2321360	an O'Neill-hacked solar system could in principle support one trillion human beings.
2321360	2327120	That's a thousand Mozart's, he marvels. A thousand Einstein's. What a cool civilization that would be.
2327920	2332560	It seems a cheap but necessary shot to point out that by this dopey logic,
2332560	2337360	we would also gain a thousand Hitler's and a thousand Stalin's. But Bezos is leaving it
2337360	2341920	to the next generation to work out the details. How are we going to build O'Neill colonies,
2341920	2347440	out of what materials, under what sort of political systems? Bezos has no idea. He's here to build
2347440	2352080	the infrastructure so that the big thinkers of the future can hammer out the details.
2353040	2359280	In short, Bezos will establish the extraterrestrial roads and bridges so that the future dreamers
2359280	2365920	can figure out what to do with them. Bezos will pave the way for future Bezos' and Zuckerberg's,
2365920	2370960	and even future Musk's, once they've had enough of those radioactive dust storms on Mars.
2372800	2380080	So these are our two post-terrestrial utopias. Fuck Earth and Occupy Mars versus Save Earth
2380080	2385840	by drilling the universe. Of course, both of these visions are a long way off.
2385840	2391440	So far, no one's been to Mars. No one's mined an asteroid or built a rotating space cylinder,
2391440	2396320	and it's been half a century since anybody walked on the moon. But in the meantime,
2396320	2402320	the new space nicks are already making a total mess. Musk has filled his allotted altitude in
2402320	2408080	low Earth orbit with so many Starlink satellites that he's edging into the territory allocated
2408160	2414000	to Amazon. Astronomers and space ecologists keep warning that between dead satellites,
2414000	2418960	live satellites, paint chips, lost tools, shrapnel, old cameras, and the International
2418960	2425120	Space Station, there's just too much stuff up there. At speeds of 18,000 miles per hour,
2425120	2430480	the collision of anything with anything else is disastrous, and despite our steady ability to
2430480	2437120	produce this deadly litter, we have absolutely no way to clean it up. The most promising idea so far,
2437120	2442160	which failed spectacularly the one time it was tested, is that we might be able to snag some
2442160	2451920	passing garbage with a harpoon. A harpoon. It's like wailing, technology. The scene in space is
2451920	2458880	total chaos, and yet Bezos, Musk, and a growing cadre of smaller-time astropreneurs continue
2458880	2464960	unfazed, promising thousands more satellites, suborbital tourism, orbital tourism, private
2464960	2471280	space stations, space hotels, and gazillion-dollar asteroids, all as multifarious means to our
2471280	2477440	beautiful future in space. The road to Utopia is paved this time with careening space junk and
2477440	2482560	towering egos, swearing till they're blue in the face that they're doing it for all humanity.
2483760	2487200	Part five. There are six parts, by the way. You're like, how many damn parts are in there?
2487920	2495440	Part five. It's a logic as familiar as Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. One small step for a man
2495440	2500800	is supposed to have amounted to one giant leap for mankind. But the Apollo missions ended up
2500800	2506160	doing very little for poor black indigenous and immigrant people in Armstrong's own country,
2506720	2513360	not to mention the entirety of mankind. Similarly, the escalating pursuit of profit in space
2513440	2518480	will leave non-investors even farther behind than they already are. As the New Republic's
2518480	2523760	Clive Thompson predicts, the big winners in space will likely be the big winners on Earth.
2524480	2529600	After all, a corporation's chief obligations are to its wealthy shareholders,
2529600	2535840	not to its workers or even its clients, let alone the whole species. And yet the corporations keep
2535840	2541680	feeding us these mystifying promises to benefit humanity, assuring us in the words of science
2541680	2545920	writer Martin Robbins that when we go into space, we will all magically become nice.
2547360	2552080	Under these conditions, though, it's just so unlikely. Do we really expect that the
2552080	2557280	billionaires who can't find any cause worth supporting on Earth will finally redistribute
2557280	2563280	their wealth once they get deeper into the final frontier? Do we really expect that the notoriously
2563280	2568960	inhumane industries of mining, manufacturing, and global retail will suddenly establish
2568960	2574000	decent working conditions on literally uninhabitable planets and asteroids,
2574000	2579440	where a person's employer controls her access not only to healthcare and food now, but to air?
2580240	2584560	And what about all the ecological damage these companies are doing in the meantime on Earth?
2585200	2590640	What happens to our environment when a single rocket scorches the land it leaves behind,
2590640	2596320	drops its boosters in low Earth orbit or dumps them in the sea, and deposits millions of pounds
2596320	2602320	of rocket fuel into the atmosphere? What happens to the residents of Boca Chica, Texas,
2602320	2607520	whom SpaceX has displaced from their suddenly toxic homes, including the humans,
2607520	2611360	who now can't afford to live anywhere else because nobody wants to buy their houses,
2611360	2616960	and the wildlife that has increasingly nowhere to go? In what sense is this space adventure
2616960	2622800	benefiting all humanity? If these galactic messiahs kill off most of us in the process,
2622880	2627920	along with the only biosphere that allows us actually to be, then what exactly are they saving?
2629440	2634960	The operative fallacy here, to which Jacob introduced us yesterday, is known as long-termism.
2635680	2639360	Popular among Silicon Valley types, the long-termer conviction
2639360	2645440	is that the galactic immortality of the species is more important than the current well-being
2645440	2649440	of any given community. Hunger, poverty, racism, warfare,
2649440	2655600	hurricanes, floods, pandemics, genocides, and extinctions might seem like enormous concerns,
2655600	2659760	but ultimately they're just the ups and downs of the evolution of the species.
2660400	2666240	As techno-philosopher Nick Bostrom assures us, from the perspective of humanity as a whole,
2666960	2671680	even the worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the great sea of life.
2672320	2678720	So the key is to rise above the everyday struggles of particular humans and focus instead on the
2678720	2684640	long-term existence of the species. I'll give away the punchline and say that in addition to
2684640	2691360	being a dreadful reading of Hegel, long-termism is a high-tech version of what Malcolm X called
2691360	2697440	pie and the sky and heaven and the hereafter. Sick of the suffering black Americans continued
2697440	2703600	to undergo for the sake of an unjust law and order, Malcolm blamed America's racist social
2703600	2708320	system on the Christian teaching that earthly suffering would be rewarded in the afterlife.
2708320	2712960	To his mind, the doctrine of heaven maintained an even glorified oppression,
2712960	2718480	convincing black Americans that it was useless or even ungodly to overthrow their oppressors.
2718480	2723360	From the perspective of eternal bliss, poverty, racism, and even enslavement would seem like
2723360	2729280	nothing at all mere ripples on the great sea of life. Similarly, the space-hungry billionaires
2729280	2735200	tell the poor, the refugees, the sick imprisoned, endangered, and extinct to hold out for heaven
2735200	2741760	on the asteroid belt. There is a murderous numerology at work here, which sets the 8 billion
2741760	2748880	people currently on the planet, 700 million of whom live in extreme poverty, against, say, the 10
2748880	2754880	to the 23rd people who might exist if we manage to someday to colonize the Virgo supercluster.
2754880	2762480	You see, 10 to the 23 is numerically more, a whole lot more than 8 billion or 700 million.
2762480	2768000	Therefore, the long-termers insist that our energies be directed toward the hypothetical humans
2768000	2773760	rather than the actual ones. In fact, they caution, actual humans might not actually be
2773760	2780400	actual at all. They could be computer simulations. I'm not making it up. The idea, as you know,
2780400	2785200	has been around in one form or another since Descartes' meditations, but it came raging back
2785200	2792000	in 1999 with a matrix and in the Gamergeek philosophy of Bostrom, who argues that if it
2792000	2798320	is possible, even in principle, to create a conscious simulation, then we are almost certainly
2798320	2804640	living in such a simulation. In the meantime, the futurist economist Robin Hansen reasons
2804640	2809920	that if we are living in a simulation, we should behave as brashly and boldly as possible so that
2809920	2815120	our simulators remain sufficiently entertained to keep us plugged in. Assuming that we are living
2815120	2821120	in a simulation should have the overall effect, says Hansen, of making us more present-oriented
2821120	2826640	and more selfish than we might otherwise be. Your motivation to save for retirement, he reasons,
2826640	2831520	or to help the poor in Ethiopia might be muted by realizing that in your simulation,
2831520	2837760	you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia. I won't drive you mad with the details of these
2837760	2843600	scenarios, which are mind-boggling at best and diabolical at worst. I bring them up only as a
2843600	2849680	means of filling out the intellectual biography of our most energetic space utopian, whose deep
2849680	2855600	dive into long-termism has produced in him a conviction that we are most likely living in
2855600	2861840	a computer simulation. Our consciousness is probably the creation of super-intelligent beings
2861840	2867120	running a super-advanced version of Minecraft and the rest of the universe is just a virtual
2867120	2873040	backdrop to our trivial pursuits. Or it's always possible that we're not so much simulated as
2873040	2878240	manufactured. If it's not a simulation, Musk speculates, then maybe we're in a lab and there's
2878240	2883440	some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop out of curiosity like
2883440	2890000	mold in a Petri dish. But whether we're mold spores or Mario and Luigi, the quest is clear,
2890000	2895760	to stay alive by going forth, increasing and multiplying. And here's saying, if the world
2895760	2901680	around us is just a quantum computation or an alien Petri dish, then who cares about coral
2901680	2906960	reefs and wetlands? If they're really important, the simulators will make more. And if they don't
2906960	2912320	make more, then the herons and the frogs and sea turtles will have been a necessary trade-off to get
2912320	2918240	humanity up to the next virtual level on Mars. It's at this point that the desperate among us
2918240	2923600	might seek out those poets and prophets who can see through the absurdities of our current situation.
2924240	2929840	Those poets and prophets who, rather than giving us the same world on another planet,
2929840	2935680	can actually imagine other ways of being. Part six and part the last.
2937360	2943040	In the ones who walk away from Omelas, science fiction author Ursula Le Guin describes a
2943040	2950080	gleaming utopian city. The streets are bright and colorful, the parks are healthy and plentiful,
2950080	2956240	the people marry the music gay, the animals well cared for, the sun and rain in perfect balance,
2956240	2961920	and the technology sufficient to everyone's comfort within the bounds of mutual care. For
2961920	2967360	example, there are very fast little trains, she says, and double-decked trams, but no cars or
2967360	2974560	helicopters. The only hitch is that the joy of this city is sustained by the unrelenting suffering
2974560	2981920	of a single child, naked, sporadically fed and locked in a basement with old mops and dirt floors.
2982960	2988800	They all know it is there, the narrator explains, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come
2988800	2994320	to see it, others are content merely to know it's there. They all know that it has to be there,
2994320	2998080	that their friendships, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships,
2998080	3002640	the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers,
3002640	3007760	even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies depend wholly
3007760	3012800	on this child's abominable misery. In a brief preface to the story,
3012800	3018320	Le Guin traces its central conceit back to the American psychologist William James,
3018320	3024080	who offered it as a thought experiment. What if millions of people could be kept permanently
3024080	3030080	happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far off edge of things should
3030080	3037840	lead a life of lonely torment? James finds this prospect unbearable. None of us, he insists,
3037840	3042800	would accept such a bargain. In fact, the very knowledge of the torment of that one soul would
3042800	3048800	ruin the happiness of all of our millions, wouldn't it? Dear old William James says, or so Le Guin,
3049680	3056480	so mild, so naively gentlemanly, look how he says us, she marvels, assuming all his readers are as
3056480	3062400	decent as himself. But of course we're not. What Le Guin's narration allows us to realize
3062400	3068320	is not only that some people are happy to balance their happiness on the suffering of others,
3068320	3074720	like the omelons and their sacrificial child, but that most of us in the overdeveloped world are
3074720	3081520	as well. Most of the wealthy residents of these overdeveloped nations are delighted to find bargain
3081520	3087360	clothes made by children in basement sweatshops. Most of us are happy to travel to resort towns,
3087360	3092640	whose residents are denied access to their own beaches. Most of us love fresh fruit even though
3092640	3098560	it's been grown and picked under unbearable conditions, flown on jets that pollute the airways,
3098560	3103520	driven on trucks that kill whatever tries to cross the road, and carefully stacked by people who
3103520	3109200	can't afford to buy it. This is the way capitalism works. The happiness of some is sustained by the
3109200	3114640	suffering of everyone else. The only difference between us and the omelons is that we don't really
3114640	3120640	want to know any of this, and of course that the suffering children on whom we rely are horrifically
3120640	3127600	more numerous than one. Le Guin's story ends with a tribute to the ones who walk away. Those few
3127600	3133120	omelons who realize that their happiness is not worth the suffering of even one child and who walk
3133120	3139040	alone into the darkness. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than
3139040	3144480	the city of happiness, the narrator confesses. I cannot describe it at all. It's possible that
3144480	3149760	it does not exist, but they seem to know where they're going, the ones who walk away from omelons.
3150480	3154080	And Le Guin's implied question is whether you, the reader, are able to see it too.
3154960	3160480	Can you imagine a society that doesn't depend on the misery of others, a kingdom of God that's at
3160480	3166480	hand rather than hovering in some cosmic hellscape? Can you see it clearly enough to believe it,
3166480	3171600	and can you believe it enough to start walking there? Can you walk away from this hatred of the
3171600	3178960	earth and its creatures? Can I? But where would we go? You might ask. Given the global and now
3178960	3185120	outer spatial reach of corporate capital, there is no away left, at least not one to which any of
3185120	3190640	us has physical access. Where could we possibly go to live otherwise? And even if we could find
3190640	3196800	such an elsewhere, what about that poor, naked, suffering child? How would our walking away
3196800	3202400	from omelons do anything to change omelons? Couldn't we be accused, like the rich guys,
3202400	3208160	of blasting away from our world rather than caring enough to fix it? These are perhaps some of the
3208160	3214800	questions Afrofuturist sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin had in mind when she wrote her narrative response
3214800	3222240	to Le Guin, entitled The Ones Who Stay and Fight. In the resplendent city of Amhelat, the people
3222240	3227120	are well fed, healthy, and even enjoy us. They hail from diverse backgrounds, speak multiple
3227120	3233520	languages, and enact laws that ensure the safety and comfort of all citizens. And so this is Amhelat,
3233520	3240000	the narrator explains, a city whose inhabitants simply care for one another. Throughout the story,
3240000	3245440	the narrator pauses to address our likely skepticism. How could a society possibly be this
3245440	3251920	functional, this communally minded, this joyous? Surely there's a hitch. Of course there's a hitch.
3252480	3259440	And much like Le Guin's omelas, the hitch of Jemisin's Amhelat involves a child, a single child,
3259440	3265760	whose father has discovered transmissions from the benighted hellscape of the reader's own world,
3265760	3272400	our earth, and who has begun to learn from earthly media and to spread the idea so commonplace here
3272960	3279040	that some people are less important than others. This poison threatens the society of Amhelat
3279040	3285120	so fundamentally that a panel of reluctant social workers finds the child's father, kills him,
3285120	3291280	and then turns to face his enraged, grieving, ideologically ruined daughter. And just as the
3291840	3298240	reader braces for more violence, one of the social workers, quote, crouches and takes the child's
3298240	3305200	hand. What, the narrator exclaims, what surprises you? Did you think this would end with the cold
3305200	3311680	eyed slaughter of a child? There are other options. And this is Amhelat, friend, where even a pitiful
3311680	3318160	disease child matters. There are other options, not somewhere out there, but in the middle of the
3318240	3323440	mess we're in. Finding them and living them out would be the work of the ones who stay and fight.
3324080	3328960	In other words, the ones who stay are actually the makers of other worlds.
3328960	3333920	Meanwhile, the escape artists refuse to see that the world might be otherwise. It's the ones who
3333920	3339120	stay who end up making other worlds, while the ones who blast away preserve the very world they're
3339120	3345520	escaping by refusing to see other options. I point out this ironic alignment, not in order to raise
3345520	3350960	objections to Le Guin, to whom I am desperately indebted, but to point out the deeply conservative
3350960	3356560	nature of the Astro Topians. The rocket men want to leave the earth because they want to keep the
3356560	3362640	world the way it is. So they seek more land and resources to plunder in space. Meanwhile, the
3362640	3369200	hungry, colonized, black, indigenous working class, earth loving and peace seeking among us, are filled
3369200	3375440	with what Afrofuturist jazz genius Sun Ra called the burning need for something else. Not the same
3375680	3380720	system in some cosmic future, but a radically different system right now and right here.
3380720	3385520	As the Americanist Jane of Brown writes in Black Utopias, we must jump into the break,
3385520	3391920	the cut, into an entirely different paradigm. Le Guin herself issued a similar imperative
3391920	3398160	when she received the 2014 National Book Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American
3398160	3404160	letters. Hard times are coming, Le Guin said, two years before the election of Donald Trump.
3404160	3408560	When we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now.
3409200	3413760	According to Le Guin, it is authors of speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy
3413760	3420640	who can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being
3420640	3426320	and even imagine real grounds for hope. Other ways of being as in Jemisin's Amhalat,
3426320	3432960	whose residents can all have homes if they want them. A city where every soul matters. A city whose
3432960	3438880	inhabitants simply care for one another. It's that sort of world she imagines and it's that sort of
3438880	3448800	earth that I'm after. Thanks.
3448800	3464720	Thank you.
3465440	3473040	We have until 5.45 for some Q and A. So hold your hand up if you would like to ask a question or
3473040	3484960	make a comment and Amanda will bring you a mic.
3485520	3491600	I once had a, of all your thinking, I uh usually at the beginning of class you know to warm things
3491600	3495680	up I'll ask is the students have any announcements are there any things you want us to come support
3495680	3500400	are you you know are you gonna go hit bats and balls are you gonna sing are you gonna whatever
3500400	3504240	what can we come give announcements and they they had they had no announcements and they
3504240	3507040	looked totally miserable so I knew I couldn't just start class you know that look when you
3507040	3509760	look out at your students you're like damn what am I gonna do with these kids like they're just
3509760	3513760	they're miserable today and so it's like does anybody want to dance and one of my students
3513760	3520240	god bless Wesleyan University was like I'll dance really he's like yeah what you got and I was like
3521760	3528720	he asked me to put on A Day in the Life by the Beatles this this baby who was born in like 2014
3530400	3535280	I put on a day in the life and that kid stands up and just dances for five straight minutes
3535280	3541680	and then the song ends and he sits down and the class is like yeah like what nobody got up to dance
3541680	3545600	with the poor guy but like they were all really into it they were really into somebody else dancing
3548000	3552240	okay hi that's another question you're gonna you're gonna dance Alexis
3553600	3559760	so I'm curious to the extent to which you think that it's uh these these like Elon Musk and people
3559760	3564720	who have these kind of plans to go to Mars and things the extent to which they're trying to
3564720	3568800	save themselves or what or they actually believe this or whether they're trying to get us to believe
3568800	3574240	it right because the idea is that if if it's if it's something they're actually trying to do it
3574240	3577280	seems like it's philanthropy right because it's something they're not going to be able to see
3577280	3582560	because it's so often the future even if they do do work and so the question becomes is it just
3582560	3587520	something like that we will stop being concerned about about the way in which our planet is being
3587520	3592880	destroyed and we're all being harmed because we're because now we we trust Elon Musk will help us
3592880	3596400	something like that in the end and he doesn't really believe that he can do this but that he's
3596400	3600000	trying to get so do you think that's what's going on or do you think that I mean it's hard to say
3600000	3604960	with motivation or that there's that they actually legitimately or convince themselves that this is
3604960	3609600	possible or what do you think's going with their motivation okay so for what it's worth I think
3609600	3615440	they're both earnest I think that I think they both believe what they say it may not be true it
3615440	3620080	may be that they're you know like truly diabolical geniuses be like I'm gonna say this but I'm really
3620080	3625360	just gonna make a lot of money like I think that they both think that this is the way to ensure the
3625360	3630240	long-term survival of the human species all this having been said I think that their visions are
3630240	3635680	different their motivations are different and this question of selfishness versus selflessness is a
3635680	3642160	little bit different um Jeff Bezos talks about um wanting he says you know look we could stop using
3642160	3647840	so much energy but that would be really boring and I want my great great grandchildren to be using
3647840	3653040	more energy than I do and the only way my great grandchildren can use more energy than me is if
3653040	3658080	we go into outer space so he's concerned for his lineage he's not necessarily concerned for himself
3658080	3661760	I don't he doesn't think he's going to survive this but he's concerned for his lineage and for the
3661760	3667200	kinds of people he he wants there to be more guys like him him and Mark Zuckerberg he there those
3667200	3672160	are those are the big you know and his and his grandchildren right and the way to do this is
3672720	3677120	to ensure that they can have as much energy as they want to in outer space but he's he's not
3677120	3682160	going to get there so in that sense yeah he's like um I don't know he's like Vanderbilt and the rail
3682160	3686160	roads or something like that like he's building the infrastructure and he's like go be a great nation
3686160	3692960	without me um Musk is a little more complicated um he's he think he says he wants to die on Mars
3693840	3699920	I don't know if he really thinks he'll actually get to Mars but whether or not he can he's so
3699920	3706560	taken by this Bostrom simulation argument that we need to get to Mars in order again to assure the
3706560	3712000	long-term survival of the species in order to keep us going long enough to figure out a way
3712800	3718160	ourselves to simulate consciousness right whether we're already simulated or we're not already
3718240	3722560	simulated we need to figure out a way to do it ourselves because once we can do it
3722560	3727520	then we can bring back Elon Musk after he's dead um so he's obsessed with bringing back the great
3727520	3733920	men of the past and he wants to be one of those who can be just like downloaded into any piece of
3733920	3738240	body um in the in the Virgo supercluster or something like that so there does seem to be a
3738240	3742560	little more but but either way I don't think we gain a lot by saying that they're not um they're
3742560	3746320	not being honest with us or something I think I think that they are and then the question is
3746320	3751920	whether and just like you know we those of us who again teach religion we teach about charismatic
3751920	3756640	profits all the time and I think most of them are fully convinced in the truth of what they're
3756640	3759600	saying that doesn't mean it's a good religious movement right that doesn't mean you want to
3759600	3768080	move to that particular commune but yeah thank you that was absolutely fabulous thanks so I
3768080	3774320	want to ask you a question about Peter Isherwell he's the fictional uh billionaire guru in the
3774320	3780960	movie don't look up are you familiar I started watching it so uh I will ask the question in
3780960	3787520	such a way that you do not need to have seen the film thank you right the this figure in the film
3787520	3796320	stands in as a sort of doppelganger for Musk or uh Bezos or to a lesser degree Steve Jobs right
3796320	3803360	sort of obsessed with their own impact on the grand arc of human history so in that movie it
3803360	3808480	the the character shows up as sort of an obvious critique so maybe I'm a bit of a naive is this
3808480	3813040	the one who's like is it bad to make a lot of money should we not be really rich is that guy
3813040	3820960	that's one of the acolytes who's persuaded by this character's uh race to mine asteroids right so
3820960	3827920	the question is sort of like why don't we see through these persons right why don't we recognize
3827920	3835760	Musk as a Barnum and Bailey circus actor and that's a perhaps a naive question for a scholar of
3835760	3842560	religion to ask right why don't we see false prophets for what they are but really the question
3842560	3852000	is what kinds of counter narratives do you see I think Citing Le Guin and Jemisin here at the end
3852000	3855600	is a great way to do that but I'd love to hear you sort of think out loud about sort of like what
3855600	3862720	kinds of opposing narratives help uh call into question the the kinds of power and influence
3862720	3868800	these individuals have yeah great thank you um okay so why don't we see these false prophets for
3868800	3872640	who they will clearly some people do like the folks who made don't look up because it's clear
3872640	3878000	what the tone of movie is even though I haven't seen the whole thing right um and clearly some
3878000	3883520	people don't write the folks Sarah was introducing us to who are like the hardcore muskvites or
3883520	3888800	musketeers or muskowitz's or whatever right they they um they are they they want this vision
3888800	3895440	they're excited by this vision I think in park space is really cool um I open this this book um
3895440	3901360	this astrotopia book by thinking about my own fascination with space right I'm I'm in the middle
3901360	3907040	of you know we're thinking about this critique of all of these these figures trying to colonize the
3907040	3912720	cosmos um and and I look around my my five year old's bedroom and I realize that like all of his
3912720	3918640	stuff has like little stars and cosmos on them and little galaxies and I'm like oh wow I'm obsessed
3918640	3924320	with space like what do I want from space right um space is really cool the idea of you know living
3924320	3930800	in a new society elsewhere is um is is is attractive has been attractive since the doctrine of
3930800	3934960	terranilias that Whitney bowman exposes so beautifully as the product of a particularly
3934960	3940400	bad reading of genesis right um so you know I understand why they're so excited they're excited
3940480	3945600	because musk says at some point like there has to be good news at some point like we got we gotta
3945600	3950880	give kids something to believe in people like some there has to be a future for them and so this is a
3950880	3956320	promise of a future like you you want a future if you're a person and so that's you know that's
3956320	3960880	possible and and it's and it's cool um my own students for what it's worth when we study this
3960880	3966480	material together hate first of all they hate Jeff Bezos even more than they hate Elon musk
3966480	3970240	which is really interesting to me I have a little soft spot for Bezos because he's such a nerd
3970400	3975040	you know like he's always citing things got footnotes things like that but um they absolutely
3975040	3981360	load Jeff Bezos um they increasingly dislike Elon musk since the twitter business um that not
3981360	3992080	withstanding they um they dislike them but they think they they can't see around the logic they're
3992080	3996560	like yeah I I don't know what else we're gonna do I guess I'm gonna go live in an orbital space colony
3996560	4002240	there's a there's another jemisin short story in this uh how long until black future month
4002960	4009440	the same volume called cloud dragon skies and in this it's it's every um there's a there's a major
4009440	4016080	apocalyptic event and everybody on earth is given the option either to move to the asteroid belt on
4016080	4021360	some kind of rotating space colony and have as much stuff as they want they can have energy they can
4021360	4026720	have you know I don't know like veggie burgers whatever like you you don't you have all that's
4026720	4031520	all the stuff that we have on the asteroid belt or she says uh you could have earth and nothing
4032320	4038320	I mean just no technology no power no and at that point she says the people who stayed
4038320	4043680	all of the rabbis and the llamas and the teachers came forward to remind people how actually to
4043680	4048640	live on the earth and how to sustain themselves and you know the folks who wanted to be more
4048640	4055680	comfortable move to the asteroid belt so ask my students all right where do you go right do you
4055680	4060480	what do you want do you want the asteroid belt not like a rotating shopping mall but with like
4060480	4066480	everything you have um or do you want the earth and nothing and with the exception of one student
4066480	4072080	they were all like shit I gotta move to the asteroid belt and they didn't feel good about it
4072080	4076240	right they weren't like yes Elon they're not that kind of my students at least they're not that kind
4077120	4080640	they're not and they hate Jeff but they're just like I I can't so and it was at that point that I
4080640	4084400	was like it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism how is it easier
4084400	4090880	to imagine living without air than without your phone like how is that but I see it I see it I'm
4090880	4094640	not making fun of this logic I understand what they mean they're like you could never convince
4094640	4099680	people to give up their stuff so you're gonna have to take them off the earth so I think that that's
4100400	4104480	there yeah there's a convincing that the logic is convincing I think in a lot of ways that the
4104480	4112880	the messiahs themselves are not counter narratives okay um so right this branch of feminist afro
4112880	4118240	futurist indigenous futurist there's a great indigenous future futurist volume by grace Dillon
4118240	4124000	that sort of coins the genre of indigenous futurism it's 2012 it's called walking the clouds
4125040	4132640	and indigenous futurism is an explicit um conversation with afro futurism and uh there
4132640	4140080	there you know gives ways of deploying traditional ecological knowledges um particularly from native
4140080	4144720	american and native australian and original australian communities um to imagine different
4144720	4149280	ways of being in the future and the thing is like we so so the human community has already done this
4149280	4153840	right the human human community all over the place has ways of living on the earth as the earth
4153840	4159920	without destroying the earth right um it just it's just not this one like not this particular one
4159920	4165120	that I grew up in that right um so um certainly indigenous and afro futurist futurist literatures
4165120	4173760	I think are hugely helpful here um but also like Pope Francis has like a different kind of story
4173760	4179120	about how we're supposed to live in relation to the earth and calling all of the creatures around
4179120	4184000	us brother and sister and caring for them and abolishing capitalism in order to care for the
4184000	4190400	poor and this intertwining of um you know the the disaster of poverty and the disaster of warfare
4190400	4198240	and the disaster of ecocide um so I think that these teachers are all around us um even in you
4198240	4204320	know even at the head of the the the christian body that colonized the whole earth like at this
4204320	4208240	point he's like yeah this isn't a good way of living um so they're there and I think the question
4208240	4212160	is just how we how we listen to them and how we how we do things otherwise but it's not like we
4212160	4215920	don't have the imagination for it
4223120	4231840	hi I was wondering if you had any guidelines for distinguishing between um genuine other
4231840	4237360	wisest genuine other ways of being and the fantasies that sustain the ways that we live now
4237360	4241440	as it strikes me that people who go to the resorts towns are wanting something other than the corporate
4241440	4245200	world that they're living in and so the imagination of this other world this resort town is part of
4245200	4251520	what sustains the system that lets them continuing to work and there's a lot of times really subtle
4251520	4256640	ways that's still functioning even within our attempt to imagine and otherwise we're sometimes
4256640	4260880	sustaining what we already have so are there guidelines for distinguishing between those
4260880	4267520	two can they be distinguished um thank you so much for that um I think I don't know that these are
4267520	4271600	universe these are not universal guidelines these are my guidelines for the way that I went so things
4271600	4279040	that I I will call efforts to think of genuine other wisest versus um efforts just to you know
4279040	4284480	continue as we are and you're absolutely right that the um you know resort culture of white lotus
4284480	4290480	for example is like an escape from the crazy rat race that sustains the rat race this is victor
4290480	4294880	turner this is liminality this is your two-day weekend in order to keep working as hard as you
4294880	4299760	can on the five-day so that's the same system um the question is whether there's a different system
4299760	4308400	and the thing that I tend to be looking out for um is uh societies that care for its and this
4308400	4312960	societies that care for its inhabitants it's just very straightforward like all of them
4313600	4318880	like all of them um especially the ones who are poor especially the ones who don't have access to
4319440	4328800	the people who have resources I was um uh I how do I frame this um I live in a town in Connecticut
4328800	4333040	it's a central Connecticut town that's like kind of it's not on a rail line it's kind of nowhere
4333040	4337760	in particular it was terribly planned there's a highway along the river like it's a sad um
4338640	4345120	post urban town that is trying so hard to bring itself out of the economic ruin of the 1970s
4345120	4348240	when all the factories pulled out and all that right you know you know the New England story
4349120	4357120	um and uh there is uh there are a lot of different kinds of folks who live there
4357120	4360880	people of all sorts of different economic backgrounds all sorts of mental health
4360880	4366800	abilities and capacities um and I I was in a position of having to be in conversation with
4366800	4371840	a police officer in the town who said you know there are a lot of crazy people here in Middletown
4371840	4377920	because the problem is that whenever anybody's picked up anywhere between Hartford and New Haven
4377920	4382960	this we're talking about like a 50 mile radius he's like the cops always say to them go to Middletown
4382960	4387040	because you'll get taken care of there um because there's a community health center where people
4387040	4391040	can get free health care there's food there's a soup kitchen there's an actively working right um
4391680	4397360	and he was sort of disgusted by it he's like so therefore our town is a mess and my first thought
4397360	4401120	was like holy crap that's like the first thing I've heard in a really long time that sounds like
4401680	4406720	like a gesture toward this kind of society there's a place where you can go if you don't have a home
4406720	4410480	and you can get health care like really there's a town and I live in it and people make fun of
4410480	4415120	this town because it's so weird and like badly planned but um so I think that's that's the kind
4415120	4419760	of thing that I'm looking for I'm looking for a a society whose inhabitants care for one another
4419760	4424400	um and and this includes of course the the more than human world um Catherine where is Catherine
4424400	4432080	Catherine because this beautiful um uh uh exegesis of another Le Guin story Newton's sleep in Destin
4432160	4438000	for the stars um and I'm indebted to you forever for pointing out this amazing story of these um
4439680	4445440	of this millenarian movement that uh goes to live basically in an O'Neill cylinder um and they
4445440	4449760	they take the the best and brightest among them and they take the the ones who like passed all
4449760	4455760	the tests and they end up with an almost entirely white crew um almost entirely able-bodied all
4455760	4460080	of the women have to be under 40 so that they're you know decently fertile and all right um so
4460080	4465520	there's this you know eugenics project built into the um and what happens is well I don't want to
4465520	4470000	give it away but they've left the rest of the created world behind right like even Noah took one
4470000	4474960	two of every animal um these imagine that when we imagine these space colonies we're not we don't
4474960	4480400	even think about like taking two elephants with us and taking two giraffes and making sure that we
4480400	4487280	have this kind of um like biodiverse species so um so this this would also include a deep attention
4487280	4492560	to the way that we're totally constituted by um vegetables and animals and you know not just the
4492560	4496640	not just ourselves so anyway those are things I'm looking for but it's not a good it's not a good
4496640	4500720	heuristic I understand that it's just like this is what rings my bell I'm looking for justice or
4500720	4507360	something like that yeah hi hi yes this is maybe a little tricky tricky maybe a little sensitive
4507360	4511760	so we'll just see if it goes anywhere that's fine but um it's it's interesting to me you've
4511840	4517600	honed in on some of the identities of these kind of billionaire um space profits as it as it were
4518880	4523920	mainly that they're they're rich white men and it also occurs to me that Elon Musk is autistic
4524960	4530080	and a connection that I will draw is that Oliver Sacks who I'm sure you wrote wrote a book called
4530080	4536000	an anthropologist on Mars and that comment was literally in reference to a spouse I believe
4536640	4542400	living in the in the context of an autistic spouse and felt like an anthropologist on Mars
4542400	4548240	in relating to this person and so maybe that's just an interesting coincidence but I wonder if
4548240	4554560	you care to speculate if or how or if it matters at all how that might relate to some of Musk's
4554560	4560320	visions and and sort of relationships with earth and space just a thought gosh I wish I knew how
4560320	4567920	to answer this question I don't but I um this this produced um I can just tell a story um which is
4567920	4574320	in um in my classroom the first time I taught this um this particular question produced um the
4574320	4580240	one of the hardest classroom situations I've ever been in um because a a student who was about to
4580240	4587840	graduate to go work for Elon Musk and SpaceX um got very upset um about the students in the class
4587840	4595600	who were criticizing Musk um he started um sort of tearing up and he said you know it's not fair
4595600	4601280	of you to accuse him of being in all these privileged positions after all he's autistic and
4601280	4607200	you know he's so he is he is disabled and he's um and we need to be you know kinder to him and more
4607200	4616800	understanding um and uh and it took the students a while to recover um and another of them said
4616800	4622160	yeah but but look at the damage that he's doing um to all these sorts of beings and all these
4622160	4629920	and he his SpaceX had just been um audited for um sexism and for abuses like labor abuses and all
4629920	4641040	the time um so I don't know how to um I certainly don't know how to connect um his uh his autism
4641040	4645760	to his sort of seeing the world differently um I think it's really cool to think about um Greta
4645840	4651440	Thunberg the um the ecological activist who talks herself about who gives an account herself and
4651440	4658000	says look I my autism allows me not to force me not to close myself off from the world and makes
4658000	4663440	me open up to it such that like the destruction of our earth is hurting me physically um I would
4663440	4668320	need to hear him talk about that to know how he experiences that um but I certainly don't think
4668320	4673680	and I don't think this is where you were going but I certainly don't think um that it's a that um
4673680	4682080	that his having you know neurodiversity is a is a reason to um sort of allow him to escape critique
4682080	4686480	or or anything like that um so because there there are all sorts of things you can do with
4686480	4691280	neurodiversity you can do good things or you can do bad things um but anyway I would like yeah I
4691280	4694960	don't I haven't I haven't I don't know if you've heard of him sort of account for his kind of
4694960	4700080	cosmic vision and his neurological situation but have you have you heard anything like that
4701040	4705040	but yeah yeah thank you so much yeah
4713040	4720960	he has self perpetuated the the narrative that he is has Asperger's um but there is no
4720960	4729760	definitive diagnosis and in the videos you see of him being very gregarious very he cultivates
4729760	4737120	this after a period of time and so there's a lot of debate as to how much of this is him performing
4737120	4746000	this identity of the brilliant genius uh Asperger's and how much of it is actually real thanks so we
4746000	4753360	actually have a question from online from Kadas who is live streaming from Toronto we live in the
4753440	4761360	future now it's amazing hi hello kagdas and tio anyway um he's he's written in he says if you
4761360	4766800	can ask really quick for me here it is is there a difference between musk and those folks and all
4766800	4774800	those data scientists that are now part of nerd theology and aren't those people replaceable
4774800	4780000	while nerd theology is not oh my gosh can anybody in this room or can can we get more I don't know
4780000	4785040	what nerd theology is kagdas kagdas I thought all theology was nerd theology
4787520	4792000	why did I get into this line of work um I am so sorry would you my friend please be
4792000	4797600	in contact with me by email and I'd love to talk more about this um you can find me very easily
4797600	4800960	just throw me an email and let's talk about it thank you so much for the question I'm so sorry
4800960	4804720	not to know um what that what that is but I want to know more thanks
4804720	4814000	hi thank you so much um this is brilliant and um thought provoking in so many ways um
4814000	4824800	and I get my question is um I hadn't occurred to me that um where musk has kind of multiple reasons
4824800	4833280	for needing to leave earth and contrast with bezos who condenses it down to one thing
4833840	4841040	and namely energy um out of all the multiple things that human beings need um do you have
4841040	4848000	a sense for why why he what what's his logic maybe two questions what is what is the reason
4848000	4856720	that he gives for narrowing it down to just the energy issue and what sense do you maybe make
4856720	4863840	of it like you know do you have a sense for why he would narrow that okay um so let me ask the
4863840	4869840	question behind it to answer the question that's behind it too which is um musk never talks about
4870640	4876240	dependence on energy on fossil fuels on polluting the skies um he doesn't talk about ecology at all
4876800	4882160	ecological collapse is not one of his coming disasters it's an asteroid or it's robots
4882160	4887360	or it's like so he just never addresses climate change bezos absolutely addresses climate change
4889520	4895200	and he but he wants to have a single a single problem so that it that one problem can be addressed
4895200	4899120	so it's not a multifarious problem because then that's gonna so he has to consolidate it into one
4899120	4905360	problem one could imagine his consolidating in it into um the relentless pursuit of profit for
4905360	4910400	example which necessitates extractivism which necessitates overproduction which necessitates
4911360	4917040	it necessitates inequality and you know he doesn't want to do that because that's precisely the
4917040	4924240	system that he wants us to perpetuate um so he he goes for a problem that has in his eyes a very
4924240	4929040	clear solution which is the energy problem he's also relying on the work of oniel who's working
4929040	4935440	in the 70s who's responding to an energy crisis and so for oniel the energy crisis was the crisis
4935440	4940800	this was this this sort of coalesced all of our other problems under the reliance on energy so
4940800	4943920	i think these are some some of the reasons he goes for that thanks
4947200	4952480	hello hi um i'd like to invite you to expand more on the note on which you close the presentation
4952480	4957680	which is the word care and what you mean by care if i can invite that word to travel we began with
4957680	4964000	the absence of care we arrive at care in the book you name some figures who can keep the care and
4964000	4969840	mlk the barricades dorthy day as opposed to others who don't keep the care some people have it they
4969840	4973760	had it yesterday they have it today they might have it in the future but what is it great
4976880	4984320	um i'm trying to decide there's always that moment where you're like do i go for heidegger
4984320	4988720	or do i not go for heidegger um because going for heidegger can be so helpful but then you've
4988720	4993200	got heidegger and then you have to deal with him and then you're like why is heidegger here um
4994000	5000400	but there's a sense there's a sense from heidegger um with whom i have a very tortured relationship
5000400	5006560	and whom i'm sure will make it up to all of us in the afterlife his idiocy um in the face of his
5006560	5016720	extreme brilliance um that for heidegger um care is uh dwelling with that's how he defines it like a
5016720	5023200	commitment to dwelling with to remaining with so what i make of uh mk jemisin's community is this
5023200	5029520	is a city in which the inhabitants that that what the care which is marked for her by things like
5029520	5034560	everybody can have a house if they want to if they'd rather sleep outside you don't put spikes on
5034560	5038960	benches so that they can't sleep you make sure that the bridges are swept so that people if they
5038960	5046320	want to sleep there can sleep there right um everybody has money everybody has enough food
5046320	5051520	everybody like these are the sort of markers of care um but it seems to me that you only get to
5051600	5057840	those markers if you are committed to living with like living together not living in a different
5057840	5063840	place not living in a wealthier enclave not living with a um so i would i would i would say
5064720	5071840	that um and again this is like this is like my my my my little caredar um starts beeping
5072640	5079440	when i see um practices that um are put into place when people are committed to dwelling
5079440	5085520	with one another living with one another and treating one another um as though everybody is
5085520	5096000	just as important as anybody else is that do we're gonna take one final question from over here
5096000	5104320	okay um hi hi thank you for your brilliant and horrifying presentation and especially for uh
5104320	5111200	helping the pill go down easier with your great sense of humor um it seems to me that most religions
5111200	5117440	have to do with the promise of divine rescue from this world this one has a new twist especially with
5117440	5123040	musk that we're going to somehow go off to some other galaxy and these folks pretend to be really
5123040	5129360	sciency right but uh what we know is that the universe is expanding and i've never heard a credible
5129360	5134960	scientist suggest that anything like these folks are suggesting is anything but fanciful
5135920	5145440	do they ever get pushed and um by uh scientists who say you're you're literally not on planet earth
5145440	5153280	intellectually on this stuff and here's the problem with obama and oh and first of all let me let me
5153280	5158080	go back to the um religion and other worldliness and i'm totally indebted to your work on green
5158080	5164080	religions and earthy religions and um jz smith has this distinction between what he calls utopian
5164080	5168880	religions and lockative religions that utopian religions tell us that our real home is somewhere
5168880	5172720	else and lockative religions say this is where we come from this is where our ancestors are this is
5172720	5178560	and these are of course the traditions that you're interested in right um so this in my in my um
5179280	5184960	sort of informal catalog is a is an extreme and again a sort of plotting version of a utopian
5184960	5193520	religion just in this very sort of concrete bad white heady in form um okay uh now i've lost track
5193520	5200400	of the other of the big question the big question was about remind me oh the scientist science yes
5200400	5206880	what does science say okay so here's the thing this is what scientists say scientists say this guy is
5206960	5212240	nuts this man is is absolutely off his rocker we can't newt mars we can't
5214960	5221280	but i'm not gonna get i i a geologist i'm a planetary scientist i love mars and i want to
5221280	5226320	know about rocks on mars and i want to understand what they are and where they came from and what
5226320	5232800	it says about is there like some little bayata hiding in a rock somewhere on mars that means i
5232800	5238800	need missions to mars and nasa isn't funding those freaking missions and i know if i'm a
5238800	5242800	planetary scientist because this is what my planetary scientists friends say that if they
5242800	5247760	ever get to mars it's gonna be on one of elan musk's rockets right if they even just get like a
5247760	5255680	robotic lander on mars right so increasingly science our scientists are epistemologically
5255680	5261600	dependent upon the corporate sector of the space race and as one of my friends said she was like i
5261600	5266320	hate this guy but if he can get me to mars okay like how else am i nasa hasn't done it
5266320	5270640	like what have they been doing for so this is the problem it doesn't matter that he's intellectually
5270640	5276160	debunked he's getting the stuff in the sky right and then and then this is the same issue and then
5276160	5281520	depending on your political orientation um whether you care about the moon or mars you might debunk
5281520	5285040	him scientifically but you're like yeah but we got to get to the moon because it's because china
5285760	5288960	and that's all it ever is there's there's no indication of like what it's just
5289280	5294320	because china um and so therefore no matter what you we know we can we can dismiss his long-term
5294320	5299840	visions but like he's he's gonna make a lander that lands on the moon and he's gonna help us make
5299840	5304960	the gateway that allows us to rotate anywhere we want on the moon to navigate anywhere we want
5304960	5310240	on the moon we were not going to be able to get a decent military position without this kind of
5310240	5315760	reusable affordable space technology he's the one who's giving it to us who cares that he's a crazy
5315840	5323520	who cares that he's a crazy person we need we need him yeah and on that note please join me once
5323520	5335280	more in thanking mary jane
