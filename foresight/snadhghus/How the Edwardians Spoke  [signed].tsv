0	14080	Our understanding of Edwardian Britain is dominated by images.
14080	20280	We can see it in flickering footage of the time, in formal family portraits.
20280	25680	But apart from a few famous voices, the people themselves remain silent.
25680	31040	We can see the Edwardians, but we can't hear them.
31040	36360	But there has been a remarkable discovery which for the first time gives voice to our ancestors.
36360	39960	And it has come from the most unlikely place, Germany.
39960	43200	There were a man and had two sons.
43200	49280	Hundreds of recordings have come to light which reveal the voices of British prisoners from the First World War.
49280	69360	I'm going to return to the hometowns of these men and meet their families.
69360	74800	How does it feel to hear one of your relatives speaking to you from nearly a century ago?
74800	87360	And how much of all our voices changed since Edwardian times?
87360	94720	What do you think the placement of a Geordiac accent is? Where it's formed in the mouth? What the mouth shapes like?
94720	100240	Well, to be honest, I wouldn't know. The thing that strikes me about a Geordiac accent is the tune of it.
100240	102640	It goes up at the end of the sentences.
102640	108720	But I have to say, for someone like me, Geordia's probably the most difficult accent.
108720	116960	I have an unusual job. I teach accents for a living. I teach accents to actors for theatre, television, films.
116960	123120	In the time I've been teaching, I've taught over 350 accents.
123120	126880	It can end on an op, it can end on a don, it can end wherever you like.
126880	133040	But it's got to have that direction about going over the wheeere of the North Sea in order to get there.
133040	134400	Right, right.
134400	139840	And I think, too, that there's much more variety of tune in a new castle accent, don't you?
139840	145040	Than in most other accents. I mean, you'd get a thing that a lot of the lads are speaking really low down.
145040	152400	But there are a huge number of the women that actually can move about an octave within a sentence.
152560	157440	Try saying to me, Jim Court, this is a long one to remember.
157440	163760	Jim Court, six fish, we are stuck at the weekend. Keep going over the top.
163760	169360	At the weekend. Exactly. So you've got that glottal going with a K at the weekend with Jackie.
169360	171200	Right. And that helps you enormously, doesn't it?
171200	172960	Jackie. Yes, OK.
172960	176720	Jim Court, six fish at the weekend with Jackie.
176720	179040	Good.
182880	187440	The British Isles has a rich tapestry of different accents.
187440	194880	Over the years, I've come to feel connections between the way we speak and the scenery that surrounds us.
194880	201520	It seems to me that landscape dictates or has something to do with the tune of an accent.
201600	206480	It certainly feels true that the flatter a landscape, the flatter the accent,
207840	214000	the area of East Anglia being a perfect example, which is probably the flattest counter geographically
214000	219600	and has the flattest accent. So there's a feeling like in East Anglia, you take a few steps forward,
219600	225360	little step back, another little step forward, and it stays very much on like two or three notes,
225360	229920	which could contrast very clearly with somewhere like South Wales,
230560	234560	the hills and valleys where we're traveling from the valley over the top of the hillside
234560	238560	onto the other side. And so there's a feeling of expansiveness.
241040	248320	One of the most interesting factors in accents to me is whether the tune is in major or minor key.
249040	254560	Good examples of that to make that clear would be Birmingham, which is absolutely in minor key.
254560	259760	So I could go on and on in where I like, but never ever end on a definite note.
259760	264560	So you hear that sort of dull minor key ending as opposed to something like North Yorkshire,
264560	270320	where I'm ending up very, very much on definite notes and I'm bound to sound more sure of myself.
272640	277280	A career of listening to voices has taught me how quickly accent and dialect,
277280	280880	the particular words local to each region, change over time.
280960	285440	To find out how people used to speak in the past, I'm dependent on old recordings
285440	291520	and the further back I go, the fewer there are. Sound recording was in its infancy in the Edwardian
291520	298480	era, and so was reserved for the great and the good. This is what makes the discovery of recordings
298480	302240	of ordinary soldiers from World War I so remarkable.
302400	310320	I've come to Berlin to find out more about these recordings of British prisoners of war.
311200	316720	Just four years ago, author John Adams came across them by chance while researching local dialect.
318720	324240	I first came across these recordings through a book in the British Library.
324240	329760	This book was called Cheshire Montart, Cheshire dialect. It was published in 1938,
330240	336720	and it referred back to recordings made of prisoners of war during the First World War.
337600	344160	These recordings were said to be in Berlin, so I wrote to the Humboldt University and asked them
344160	350480	if the recording still existed. I got a marvellous reply back. If I told them what I wanted,
350480	355200	they would send them to me. So I phoned up the British Library Sound Archive and said,
355680	361120	were they aware that these recordings existed? And they said no, and if they did exist,
361120	362640	they were of national importance.
370720	375680	Miraculously, these fragile records made from a brittle resin called shellac
375680	380720	survived the devastation of Berlin during the Second World War, and are still there today.
386000	390480	Hidden away in a corner of the city stands the archive which holds the recordings,
390480	396960	overseen by sound and music expert JÃ¼rgen Marenholds. He has dedicated the last eight years
396960	399760	to a meticulous process of cataloging and filing.
404640	407360	How many First World War recordings do you have here?
408320	416240	Oh, we have 1,650 shellac recordings here in our archive.
416880	419600	And how many British prisoners of war does that include?
420160	425680	I think we have 200 recordings on shellac discs.
425680	430240	So if I said a county to you, you could just pick something out of the cabinet?
430720	433600	Yes, for example, we have...
433600	434960	If I said Dorset.
434960	442480	Yes, Dorset, for example. The code number is 467.
447760	448080	Yes.
451920	454400	So this is it. This is the first one I see.
454720	461120	So this is a recording of Dorset. What does that say?
461120	463840	It's also South of Dorset.
463840	473040	And the recording is of, written in hand writing, the recording is of the farmer's daughter.
473040	474640	The farmer's daughter, is that right?
474640	479760	Yes, it's right. And the code number is PK467.
480160	483680	The recordings were masterminded by two men.
483680	489200	Alois Brandl was an Austrian academic fascinated by British accents and dialects,
489200	497200	whose research trips to this country have been brought to an abrupt end by the outbreak of war.
497200	505200	Wilhelm Durgen was a sound specialist, whose dream was to create a museum of languages and music from around the world.
509760	517040	In the first few months of the war, several thousand British soldiers were captured and taken prisoner in Germany.
517040	522800	They were held in dozens of camps stretching across the country.
522800	528880	As the war raged, Durgen realized that on his doorstep was a captive resource.
528880	536080	These camps offered him a unique opportunity to record the speech and music of many different nationalities.
536080	542400	Seizing his chance, Durgen put forward his plan to make recordings of the prisoners to the German authorities.
542400	550640	The Germans would have been very keen to exploit the resource of all these prisoners of different nationalities who had effectively landed on their doorstep.
550640	557600	They would have had access to a huge range of ethnic groups of languages and of cultural traditions,
557600	565440	which would have made it very interesting for ethnographers, musical historians, linguists.
565520	567760	Permission was granted.
567760	575840	Between 1915 and 1918, Brandl and Durgen formed part of a team of academics who chored over 70 prisoner of war camps,
575840	581120	recording around 250 languages and dialects.
581120	590320	For Brandl, this was the perfect opportunity to study his favorite subject, British accents and dialects.
590320	596480	For the prisoners of war, however, life in the camps was harsh.
596480	599200	The physical surroundings of camps varied greatly.
599200	605360	For the ordinary soldiers, they were often not unlike in perhaps some of the camps that they'd experienced at home in the British Army,
605360	612880	but they were often of a far inferior standard, usually hutted accommodation, possibly with up to 20 or 30 men in each hut.
612880	616720	They'd be very, very cold in the winter and German winters can be extremely cold,
616720	623280	and these men didn't have access to warm winter clothing in many cases, or they'd lost their warm winter clothing during their capture.
623280	629600	So they would be wired in, they would be sentries, and in some cases there would also be dogs patrolling the outer perimeter.
629600	634160	So it was an extremely oppressive and very unpleasant place to be incarcerated.
636960	642320	For three years, Brandl and Durgen devoted all their time to this ambitious project.
642320	646160	Travelling from camp to camp, they recorded one prisoner after another,
646160	652000	building up a vast archive of voices and keeping detailed written records of each speaker.
652000	657520	It's fantastic to see this at last, and I really can't wait to hear it. Can you play it for me?
657520	660000	Oh yes, I can do.
667040	671040	Oh, that's a recording of Sidney Wilkins.
671040	674000	But how can you know the speed at which to play it?
676320	684720	The last groove here has an A, and I can control this A with our tune fork here.
686720	694240	And when the speed of the recording is right, I have the same tune from this record.
694560	696480	And now the...
699360	704160	So now you're adjusting the speed down here. Yes, there's the pitch control.
710000	715200	And now you're here, it's the same tune, and now the record is ready for...
715200	719040	So can we hear Sidney? Yes, now we can hear the real voice.
719520	725760	He's all the farmer's daughters, the beautiful I'm told, whose parents died in laughter,
725760	732160	five hundred pounds in gold. Her uncle kept a plow boy, who Mary loved so well.
732160	735920	And in her uncle's garden, the tales of love would tell.
735920	739600	There were a wealthy squire who all came here to see,
739600	743440	but still she loved her plow boy on the banks of the sweet Dundee.
744800	746720	What do you think about this recording?
749600	754400	That's amazing. I mean, I don't know what Sidney would think about us listening to this now.
755680	760160	If I listen to his recording, I mean, if I do it from my clinical more scientific side,
760160	765680	if I listen to that recording and you asked me where he came from in England,
765680	770960	I don't think I would guess Dorset. I thought I would guess somewhere deeper into the West
770960	778160	country, because he sounds almost like Somerset nowadays. These sounds he makes,
778160	786000	like Zummer and Varmer, these F-stavies and S-zeds really belong deeper into the West country.
791200	795040	The text most frequently recorded was the parable of the prodigal son,
795040	800960	but the prisoners also recited poems, told local stories and sang songs.
825040	844240	What do you think about that?
844960	846880	I just, I'm very emotional.
849920	857120	Very emotional, because it's just, it's a very typical Scottish song and it's about the songs
857120	865760	about longing. And it just touches me about longing from home. You just hear the yearning
865760	872640	in the voice and it sounds exactly, the accent sounds exactly as you'd hear some of that area now.
874960	879760	The recordings had an educational purpose to document for the German nation the speech
879760	884560	and music of the rest of the world, but was there a greater plan in mind?
886880	890400	How did they get the finances? Because particularly at that time during the war,
891440	896400	there wasn't a lot of spare money around, presumably. Yes, the first two years are
896480	904720	spent by the German government. Really? Yes, because this was a colonial area of Germany too
905360	914000	and they thought at the beginning of the First World War that they do not lost this
915200	921200	world war. Oh, so they thought that they were going to come to all these places and pass
921200	927680	themselves off as native speakers of Dorset. So this is the devious plan. When they have
928240	934240	the good recordings, they can train all the people who go to the new colonies.
936000	939920	Do you, do you, do you surmise that? Do you guess that or do you know that?
940720	946240	I know that because it was the purpose of Willem Durgen and that is written down
946800	954640	in some readings that this was also to train, well, this recordings were also made to train
955600	959840	the person who go to the, to the colonies or to parts of England.
963840	969280	There was a man who had two sons, the youngest of them said to his father.
969360	975840	PK737 was the recording by Philip Jarvis of the prodigal son in March 1917.
976960	979680	We know that Philip was born in Macclesfield in Cheshire,
980560	992320	but few other details are known about him and no photographs have survived.
993040	1004720	I've come to Macclesfield to meet Philip's family. I don't really know this area so first I'm keen
1004720	1018640	to get a feel for the local accent. When I'm studying an accent, I try my best to get into the
1018640	1022720	heart of the place and sensibility behind the people as well as just the sound.
1030000	1038560	I stand at bus stops, I queue in the post office, I go into pubs, I go into community centres.
1039680	1046320	When I come into bars, I often have a tape recorder hidden in a pocket. It's not always
1046320	1054480	feasible to do that. So I usually find myself a quiet corner, listen to people, and I write down
1054480	1063680	phonetically what I'm hearing. Everybody's talking about the darts, boo-wood. This is my favourite
1063680	1073680	diphthong. So I can write that down phonetically. So I see my diphthong here is ua, like in sewer,
1073680	1079520	but which we'd never expect in this context of boo-wood. So at least I've learned how to say
1079520	1088000	the dart, boo-wood. Philip Jarvis grew up in a gamekeeper's lodge in the countryside, so I want
1088000	1094720	to get into the heart of the rural community to hear how that accent sounds today. I love coming
1094720	1100800	places like this when I'm researching an accent. I'm full of anticipation, full of excitement
1100800	1106080	about what I'll find. I've never been to Macclesfield before, so I have an idea of what the accent's
1106080	1112080	going to be like. I hope it's going to be my expectation, so that it's going to be a very
1112080	1114640	physical, grounded sound.
1114640	1132800	I suspect that members of the farming community hold on to the accent far more and hold on to
1132800	1139040	the dialect more. They recognise the dialect for words. Because they're a community, because they
1139040	1144880	don't see as many people outside their own working environment.
1155440	1163040	This is Bianca. This is Bianca, the cow. Yes, Baynaud. So you've spent a long time cleaning her up,
1163040	1171280	haven't you? And are you a farmer? One's been a farmer, yes. I go out to work full time as well.
1177280	1181280	Did you buy any cows today? No, sold two. And how much do you get for them?
1183440	1188560	Nearly a thousand for one and seven hundred and something for the other one. And have you been
1188560	1194480	selling as well, mate? No, I've just come to look for some straw, that's all. How much do you pay for
1194480	1202960	straw? Too much, yeah, between Â£40 and Â£50 depending on whether it's barley or wheat.
1206480	1212000	I've had a fantastic morning here, really, because there's such a sense of community
1212000	1219040	amongst the farmers. And I really feel that the accent is possibly much less changed in a group
1219040	1225840	like this. Perhaps because farmers' children spend more time with their parents and are actually
1225840	1234160	obliged, really, to work with them, the accent carries on along with a lot of the other traditions.
1242080	1258080	I'm about a mile from where Philip Jarvis grew up at Alderley Edge. He spent the first 25 years
1258080	1263840	of his life here and his father was a gamekeeper, so he was very much part of this land. He also
1263840	1270000	came back here after the war. I've never been here before, but if I'd made a guess on listening to
1270000	1275920	the recording, I would have guessed that it was a place with a lot of openness of space,
1275920	1280480	because you can feel space around it. You can hear it in the quality of the tone,
1281120	1286960	that the tone quality is very open. It's not nasal at all, like Manchester, where you hear
1286960	1292400	the nasality of Manchester being just over there, you hear that sort of whiny quality. Whereas in
1292400	1297840	this part of Cheshire, the tunes are very down to earth. You can't imagine an accent from an area
1297840	1304480	like this being lazy in any way. This is organised, beautiful, so I've got a lot of better bits of
1304480	1310800	butter. That very firm, grounded tea seems to fit with it. And these incredibly rich diphthongs,
1311600	1317040	it wouldn't make sense to me that somebody said they looked at something for hours and hours.
1318320	1322960	They look at it for hours and hours and hours.
1328320	1339040	I've come to meet the Jarvis family, who lived just three miles from where Philip was born.
1341280	1348240	So you're all related in some way to Philip Jarvis, and Michael, you're the closest relation?
1349360	1354560	Yes, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and Philip's father were brothers.
1355520	1360400	And he didn't marry himself? No, I believe Philip was a bachelor. There seemed to be
1361360	1366080	a few lost years from when he came out of the army, when he got demobbed in 1919.
1366080	1372160	There's quite a few lost years too when he died. But you know nothing about him at all?
1372160	1378000	Not from that time. He was a blood-reality fly, you know, and he probably had it rough in the
1378560	1383840	in the prisoner-war camp, and he went through a lot. A lot of people don't actually realise what
1383840	1389760	them poor souls went through. He was in service, what they used to call service, and then in the army,
1389760	1394160	and he doesn't know what a family life is, and we do appreciate what we've got.
1394160	1398960	And you're a very close family, aren't you? I'm a family now. This is my wife, Marion,
1399600	1407200	with son Darren, Nicola, granddaughter Jordan, have two more children, nine grandchildren,
1408720	1412880	and it's just one big, one big happy family. Well, there's one other thing that we do know
1412880	1419520	about him. We know what he sounded like. Yes. So would you like to... Oh, definitely.
1419760	1429680	There was a man who had two sons. The youngest of them said to his father,
1430480	1437760	give me that part of your thing that belongs to me. So father, give him his share. Not many days
1437760	1443920	after, the young man saw the door of his belonging together and went away into a far country.
1444560	1451040	There he wasted all that he had. When he had spent everything, a great famine came out of
1451040	1459040	country, and he'd begun to be in warmth. High time, is it that I should go back to my father?
1459680	1465360	This day, I would start for warmth, and I would go to my father and say to him,
1465920	1470000	father, I'll stand against heaven and against thee.
1478000	1484720	Well, I know what you're all recording sounds right, do that though, do I?
1484720	1487440	You think he sounds very frightened when he's making it, I mean...
1487680	1500400	It's the old word. His mum and his father, you know, his mum like, you know, but it was...
1502000	1506720	Oh dear, it is very, very... Very emotional, it sounds frightened.
1507600	1511040	How did you feel about listening to Philip's voice for the first time, Nicola?
1511840	1518000	I kind of found it quite harrowing, just thinking that, you know, he's the same kind of age as
1518000	1521840	what I am now, and listening to the circumstances he's in there and...
1521840	1526960	He sounded a lot older than what he is to me. Yeah, he did sound older, I just found it really...
1526960	1532000	To me, he sounds a lot older than 30s, because you can hear guys, the older guys around here,
1532960	1536560	and some of them, they still speak like that, it's unbelievable.
1537440	1540240	So does he sound quite country to you? Yes, he does, yeah.
1541520	1546080	Because there's a couple of farmers that used to go in a local pub and they would speak like that,
1546080	1550320	he's just like listening to them again. Is there anything that surprises you about the
1550320	1555200	accent at that time that you wouldn't hear now? He's a lot stronger.
1556080	1563600	When I arrived here, I had this memory of Philip's voice in my head, and this idea that it's so
1563680	1569440	seem to fit the countryside, where you see, I mean, everything's very beautiful and neat here,
1569440	1574640	isn't it? But I suspect that accents have got a bit more, I don't like the term lazy,
1574640	1581920	but a bit more slap happy. How would you say the word H-E-R-E? H-E-R-E, here.
1582560	1588080	Darren, how would you say the word here? Here. And what would you say, Nicola? Say here.
1588080	1591360	What would you say, Jordan? Here. Right, you speak like your mummy, of course you do.
1591920	1598720	So there's a very big movement in Vile's sound. So here is two sounds, isn't it? Here.
1599440	1604160	And yours has become one sound here. Yes, you do. Yes, you're...
1604160	1608240	Yeah, I say all over here. Yeah, come over here.
1610720	1616880	I think, Nicola, that you have quite a lot of Mancunian in your accent. Would that surprise
1616960	1623120	you to hear that? It does really, yeah. Like I say, I've never really... I don't think I've got any
1623120	1630640	accent. My impression of the Macclesfield sound is that it's very down to earth, and your tunes are
1630640	1637200	much more sort of floaty, that they don't actually end somewhere definite. Got our nasal problem.
1637200	1643120	But you sound as if you have more of a Mancunian sort of tone of voice, which is not a criticism in
1643120	1646560	any sort of way. It's just a comment. Try and get down there every other week to go primal.
1654560	1662080	It's very different reading about somebody and reading the facts and figures and hearing somebody's
1662080	1670240	voice. I feel as if Philips with us in this room now. Yeah, I hope he is. I hope he is, and then he
1670240	1680480	knows that we've heard him, because I'm sure when he was reading the story, wondering if anybody's
1680480	1684720	ever going to hear this. Is anyone going to listen to it? And 90 years on, we've listened to it.
1685840	1691760	What do you think about him telling the story of the prodigal son? I would think it's marvellous,
1691760	1698000	really, and how we feel now. The prodigal son's come back. His next birthday will raise a glass to him.
1700800	1709760	I can't help wondering what some of the prisoners felt like when they were making these recordings.
1712800	1721280	Some of them sound frightened, hesitant, nervous. I think they must have been rather
1721280	1727840	suspicious about what the recordings were for. This is the only photograph that exists of a
1727840	1733440	recording being made. Brandl is standing in front of the speaker, and the other prisoners are
1733440	1739920	awaiting their turn. The text is being held up by Durgan, who has one hand firmly behind the
1739920	1747600	prisoner's head, directing his voice towards the trumpet. Brandl, who oversaw the recordings,
1747600	1753760	as Quotidus is saying, this is the work of peacetime. We will not talk about the war.
1754720	1760480	Nothing will happen to you if you are unwilling to speak. Well, that's reassuring.
1762400	1771840	He also says, we sought out the farmer's lads from isolated farms, the fishermen from tiny harbours,
1771840	1776880	the shepherds, and above all, all those who are almost unable to read or write.
1776960	1784080	Local dialect in the strict sense of the word is restricted to those of low intelligence,
1784800	1793360	and is consequently deficient in intellectual content. That's a fave judgmental thing to say,
1793360	1799840	isn't it? Brandl may have had a questionable attitude towards his subjects, but he was
1799840	1804080	passionate in his desire to chart accents and dialects across the British Isles.
1805040	1810160	He was part of a pioneering group of academics working in this new world of phonetics.
1810960	1816640	The British linguist Henry Sweet worked with Brandl. A founder of modern phonetics, Sweet
1816640	1820480	is thought to have been one of the models for Henry Higgins, the professor in Pygmalion.
1821440	1826400	Brandl's fascination with this country also brought him into contact with one of our most famous
1826400	1834320	writers. Brandl, in his travels investigating accents, had a connection with Thomas Hardy,
1834320	1840240	and actually he sent some of his students to meet with him and remarked in his book on how helpful
1840240	1850240	Thomas Hardy had been with them. Thomas Hardy's writing was steeped in the language and traditions
1850240	1857120	of the countryside. He had a passionate love of the West Country, and his writing made heroes and
1857120	1869680	heroines of ordinary country folk. One of the strongest rural accents I've heard amongst these
1869680	1878640	recordings comes from Wiltshire. Charlie Shears was recorded in May 1916, aged 24.
1880240	1898800	This is Cricklade in Wiltshire where Charlie Shears was born, grew up and returned to after the war.
1900160	1905440	Charlie loved it here. He was a farmer, and he felt at one with the landscape.
1905440	1912720	Charlie's gentle, rural burr reflects the undulating, rolling nature of this landscape.
1936400	1940240	In Charlie's time, Cricklade was at the heart of the farming community.
1942320	1947280	Today, with the industrial turn of Swindon just 10 minutes away, it's a commuter town.
1950480	1955680	Charlie's sister, aged 98, still lives nearby and remembers her brother well.
1957200	1962000	To your, Mrs Bartlett, your Charlie's sister, and this is your daughter Helen,
1962240	1966240	Charlie's niece. Can you tell me some memories of Charlie when you...
1966800	1972640	Well, my mum told me that he should have been in school, but he skipped school,
1973280	1979360	and he lit a firework, and he threw it through the window, and it landed on one of the kids' heads,
1979360	1981920	burnt all his hair off. Oh my goodness.
1982240	1993520	And that is when the copper chased him and his friend, and they come to a little stream.
1993520	1996720	Well, they didn't have a proper bridge, they had a board like that.
1996720	2002160	You had a course on the board. They got over the board, the police moved me, and they went like that.
2006720	2008560	And what did he say to them about that?
2008560	2013040	Oh, he told them. He said, I've got a great respect for your parents,
2013040	2020160	but I think you two should join the army. Oh, dear. So is that why he joined the army?
2020160	2025200	That's right. And then Charlie joined the reserves. That's how he was called up when at first.
2025920	2030000	I think it was Kitchener's Army. I think that's what they called it.
2030560	2037600	And when Charlie went to war, he was captured early, early on.
2038160	2047040	Yes. And I remember my mum saying that he'd gone to Germany, but he was okay,
2047040	2055360	because he never wrote anything bad to her. And did he go with some other boys from the village?
2055360	2063520	Yes, he did go with friends. I think only him. Only Uncle Charlie came back, didn't he?
2063520	2070240	Yeah, he came home on my birthday. And he brought me the prettiest dress I've ever had.
2070240	2078720	Oh, it was lovely. And it was the church, where we went up to the church, went on the people's
2078720	2083920	lawn, you know, and had tea and buns and stuff. And that was my birthday.
2084560	2087600	I'm already thinking that Charlie tried to escape from the camp.
2088480	2094080	He did. He did, but they caught him. And what happened?
2094080	2100240	They stripped him and tied him to a tree. Well, he didn't tell us that, but his mate did.
2100960	2107200	He'd tell us the funny things, but he wouldn't tell us, you know, things like that.
2107200	2111920	He said, when they were helping the Germans pack their loads of bread for the people,
2112560	2117920	they had baggy trousers. When they weren't looking, they had a dozen in their electrolysis legs.
2118960	2123680	You don't remember your uncle at all, do you? No, only as an older man. I can't remember
2123680	2128560	him when I was a child. Well, he must have been about 60 when I was born, so. But I could remember
2128560	2133360	him being very upright, ramrod straight, you know, I suppose that was being in the army.
2133920	2138880	He was a lovely man, but very dry sense of humour. Do you remember Charlie's voice?
2139600	2146800	No, I don't think I can. No, I was looking at a picture of him, and I couldn't remember.
2146800	2150320	I couldn't. I should have remembered, but I can't.
2152720	2157360	As you know, we've got a recording of your brother Charlie, and I'd like to play it to you.
2159360	2164880	There were a man as had two sons. The younger on them said to his father,
2165600	2170800	give me the part of the good that belongs to me. So the father, getting his sure,
2171520	2175840	print many days ahead of the young man, put all his belongings together,
2175840	2179680	and went away to a far country. There a wife did all of that.
2180560	2186160	When I had spent everything, a good man had come over the country, and had begun to be in one.
2187360	2193040	A hour long, I had to check any work I could get, and I was glad when I found a flight
2193040	2199440	with a man of upcountry. I wouldn't have recognised it. I can't believe that.
2199440	2206080	It's possible he's speaking in with more dialect than he normally used, because it's very, very
2206080	2210640	thick. Oh my goodness, yes. With his girth, and girth, and summer. I think that's
2210640	2214640	more Somerset than Wiltshire. I wouldn't have recognised his voice.
2214640	2218080	I wouldn't have recognised his voice at all. Normally. I wouldn't.
2218080	2222560	No, I don't think many people speak like that. Unless you go to a village where
2223360	2226880	somebody's lived all their life and never moved out of the village, that's the way
2226880	2232560	Wiltshire people did speak. Not so much with the Zeds for summer. I can't remember that,
2232560	2236720	but I can remember elderly relatives talking with that strong, strong accent,
2236720	2239200	because they never moved away from their villages. Exactly.
2239200	2242160	They always lived in the same village, and everybody spoke the same.
2242160	2246320	It's very interesting, isn't it? I mean, I can't believe that I've actually
2246320	2250960	listened to him speaking in those circumstances all those years ago.
2250960	2254880	It just gave me a quite shiver down my spine. Yeah.
2260800	2263920	The recordings I've heard so far have been a revelation.
2265200	2268320	The accents and dialects are so much stronger than I'd expected.
2269200	2273680	I've come to get a second opinion from one of the country's leading experts, Johnny Robinson.
2273920	2281680	Brandl and Durgan spent a huge amount of time recording the prisoner's speech in the form of
2281680	2286240	phonetics. Can we just have a look at the phonetics that they wrote? Yeah.
2286800	2294240	Because although it's written in what looks like very rapid handwriting, I think we can read it
2294240	2299680	from the phonetics that we know today. That's right. This is fascinating text, isn't it? Because
2299680	2305520	this is at a time when linguists like Durgan and Brandl and people in the UK, like Henry Sweeter,
2305520	2311520	I believe, worked with them, were formulating a sort of national, international convention,
2311520	2316720	if you like, for how do we write sounds. And it's a very early version of what has become
2316720	2320640	the international phonetic alphabet. And so it's a fantastic early glimpse of how that came about.
2321680	2326720	The men who were recorded were given the text of the prodigal son and asked to change any
2326720	2333600	words or expressions into their local dialect. Do you think that would have put pressure on them
2333600	2338400	to invent dialect to some extent? It would be interesting to know, wouldn't it? Because yes,
2338400	2343200	I suspect if they were given a text and given time to prepare, then they may well be drawing on
2343200	2347360	expressions perhaps from their grandparents or people they knew back at home, rather than just
2347360	2354320	necessarily using the expressions that are natural to themselves. Let's listen to Philip Jarvis from
2354320	2361840	Macclesfield. He's telling the story of the prodigal son. There was a man who had two sons,
2362560	2368240	the youngest to them said to his father, give me that part of your thing that belongs to me.
2369360	2374640	So, father, give him his share. He's got more dialect words probably than any of the other
2374640	2380720	speakers that I've heard. I mean, I'm interested particularly in his use of father. Could you
2380720	2385360	show me something about that? That's right. That's a very traditional broad dialect pronunciation
2385360	2391040	that was widely heard in the Northwest Midlands from that sort of area. And we still hear other
2391040	2395760	dialect pronunciations, don't we, to this day? We hear father in the north for instance in Yorkshire
2395760	2400160	and in Lancashire, certainly. And that would have been the original pronunciation in the
2400160	2404640	northern half of England, father. And that vowel sound was gradually lengthened over time. You hear
2404640	2408960	father in parts of the north now and certainly you hear father in the south of England.
2409040	2416320	I'd love to play you a recording we have of a man from Oxfordshire. Wonderful, that sounds fascinating,
2416320	2423920	yeah. There were a man who had two sons, the younger on them said to his father,
2424640	2429200	give me that part of your good that belongs to me. So, the father gave me share.
2430160	2436400	There he got rid of all he had. When he got rid of everything, a great famine come over the country.
2439040	2442720	What do you think of that? Wonderful recording, isn't it, yeah? I suspect to
2443440	2448400	modern listeners that would sound as if it was from somewhere in the West Country or somewhere
2448400	2453520	Devon Cornwall door sort of accent, it sounds like, to modern ears, doesn't it? But it's very
2453520	2457840	typical of speech in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, booking, I'm sure, of that sort of date.
2458400	2462880	So do you still hear the R pronounced after vowels the way it is on that recording?
2462880	2467920	Yeah, he says father, doesn't he, and he says adder words with the R pronounced on wherever
2467920	2472080	it features in the word, doesn't he, and that's something again that is typical of
2472080	2476400	speech in the West Country these days, isn't it? So do you feel that the nature of rural
2476400	2482080	Oxfordshire has changed? Absolutely, I mean, Oxford is not very far away from London, so
2482960	2486400	large parts of the southeast of England have changed quite dramatically, haven't they,
2486400	2492080	from a rural community to commuter populations, and that's changed the nature of speech in
2492080	2494480	rural communities in lots of areas in the southeast of England.
2495440	2498400	John, having heard these recordings, what are your thoughts?
2498400	2502560	Well, it's been fascinating to hear them, hasn't it, and have a glimpse of dialects of that time,
2502560	2506560	and certainly things have changed since then, perhaps more dramatically in some parts of the
2506560	2511120	country than others. But in terms of accent, things have evolved very slowly, and there is
2511120	2514880	still a great deal of difference as you move across the country in terms of accent. So it's
2514880	2520160	been great to be able to hear slight differences and also perhaps find a bit of a link with the past
2520160	2528800	as well. In addition to the English voices, Brandon Durgan made 44 Irish, 4 Welsh, and 74
2528800	2534000	Scottish recordings. We now know that rural accents have been affected by the spread of
2534000	2539680	cities into the countryside. But what has happened in the more remote corners of the British Isles?
2540800	2546240	George Campbell, who was recorded in July 1916, was born and brought up in Aberdeen.
2546240	2555040	But the town has changed dramatically since then, as oil workers have moved in, and the fishing
2555040	2566320	industry has declined. 45 again, 45 again, 45! It's all haddock nowadays. Yeah, it's all small
2567040	2573440	So there's no cod around to speak of? Very, very often. Sometimes Peterhead, they've got bigger
2573440	2577760	markets, and we only get the buck cheese stuff, like the small boats, all the big boats go over
2577760	2587360	the road now. All right, up the road, up the road to Peterhead. 45 per one, 45.6, 46 per one,
2587360	2593600	46.7. What's that cost, 60? That's 45 pounds of ox. That's 51 kilos in there, so it's about 80
2594320	2602000	And have you always been in the fish? Yeah, since I was 19, I've been in the fish and there's been
2602000	2606240	massive changes. I mean, some days there's no fish and there's more at all.
2610080	2618640	What I hear in the fish market is an accent that seems to me absolutely unchanged. It feels as if
2618640	2623840	it's centuries old. It's not just an accent, it's a dialect. It's a whole code away of speaking.
2624800	2626320	It's impenetrably thick.
2629840	2634320	Every accent's got a point of tension, and it's very clear in the Aberdeen accent. I was brought
2634320	2639440	up in Aberdeen in left when I was 18, and I've still got that point of tension. It's here,
2639440	2646160	it's the upper lip that's very, very immobile. It's something to do with it being the Calvinist
2646240	2652080	coast, about just covering up your orifice, don't look inside my orifice. It's definitely something
2652080	2659280	to do with that. But it's also the fact that it's bitterly cold here, so everybody's sort of wondering
2659280	2666400	around like that, sort of shielding their mouths against the cold. The essence of the tone quality
2666400	2674480	in Aberdeen is that it lacks nasality. This is common to ports. People do suffer from sinus problems.
2674480	2680080	They sound as if they have a bunged up nose. So it happens from Aberdeen, you hear the tone
2680080	2685600	quality like that, as if I'm not breathing through my nose, into somewhere like Liverpool.
2685600	2691200	Although you've got a different tone quality, you can hear that I sound bunged up, or even like
2691200	2704160	New York. It's almost like I've got a cold. I'm sure that George Campbell would have
2704160	2710880	walked along this beach. Everybody who's an Aberdonian walks along this beach at some point,
2710880	2719440	and it's usually deserted. It's interesting that when he was asked to demonstrate something of his
2719440	2726240	dialect in the Prisoner of War camp, he chose three Scottish songs. He's got a beautiful voice,
2726320	2734960	beautiful tenor voice. He chose three incredibly nostalgic songs by the Bonny Bonny Banks of
2734960	2742960	Loch Lomond, Coming Through the Rye, and John Anderson, Majo John. They're all songs about longing for home.
2742960	2757680	I've come to meet George's son, Alexander Campbell. The father was a very musical man,
2757680	2762560	wasn't he? Do you have memories of that? Yes, particularly if I say he played the banjo.
2763680	2769360	I can recollect him playing in the dance bands, mostly Friday or Saturday evenings, as it was in
2769360	2774160	those days. I believe he did tap dancing as well, is that correct? There's evidence that he did have
2774160	2780720	the tap shoes with the rattly taps. So he was multi-talented in the musical field. I think he
2780720	2785200	was the one that would have a go at probably anything. I've got some photographs I managed to
2785840	2791120	bring out of the old files. Oh, that's fantastic. Maybe the first one is my mother and father,
2792080	2796560	probably not long after they were married. Oh, that's very nice. Your mum looks very young.
2797200	2801360	We have one or two from what would appear to be concert parties where he's dressed as the
2801360	2810320	dancing comedian. Oh, I see. And that's an enlargement of the same of him only. So this is George Campbell,
2810880	2817440	light comedian and dancer. That's fantastic. You look like your father, actually. Well,
2817440	2822800	probably some of the features are there. This is probably the most intriguing one. It's actually
2822800	2831840	in the camp. Oh, wow. There's the German guard. Eating time. Mealtime and the German guard's got
2831840	2840560	the cigarette between his teeth. Very dirty looking, aren't they? But it looks very casual,
2840560	2847040	doesn't it? Yes. And if they're kilts with aprons over them. Correct. There are so few
2847040	2853680	photographs of the prisoners who were recorded. It's just fantastic. I think there were more
2853680	2859520	recordings made of your father's voice than of any other man that I've heard.
2860720	2866320	So your father's... Maybe not surprising. And your father was obviously... First volunteer.
2866320	2873440	First volunteer and a fantastic example. And then they made all these recordings of him.
2873440	2879440	Whereas with other people, they made one or two. Your dad was pretty unstoppable when it came to
2879440	2884080	his recordings. And this is the first song that he...
2903440	2931760	Very good. That's quite intriguing the way it's come over.
2933520	2939040	Is there anything that surprises you listening to him? No, I can understand. I could picture him
2939040	2945280	singing that. I actually... I find it very touching, you know, this sort of sound of Scotland. Sentimental
2945280	2956080	stuff. Yes. Yes. But I mean, very, very kind of personal stuff. It's odd hearing that. It is odd.
2956080	2960880	What, like it's a ghostly voice from the past? Or... I'm trying to link it to what I have,
2961600	2968640	by way of any recollection or anything. Your father sings John Anderson Madgeau,
2968640	2973520	but he also speaks the lyrics because these Germans were very interested in the accent.
2973520	2978560	So I'd like you to listen to a bit of his speaking voice. I haven't heard of that.
2978560	2982560	You didn't ever say recite poems or anything, but it would be very interesting to hear that.
2990880	2998320	John Anderson Madgeau, John, when we were first to quench, your locks were like the raven,
2998320	3006080	your body brow would spin. Now we must start up doing John, and hand in hand we'll go,
3007040	3013840	and we'll sleep together at your feet, John Anderson Madgeau. Now you're an old ghost, John.
3016320	3020480	That last comment sounds like... Does it? I can't quite hear what he says at the end.
3021680	3025920	I wasn't clear, but it just sounded the way we'd hear that. Say something just off the cuff.
3025920	3029200	Yes, so it's a wee bit cheeky at the end of the recording for the Germans.
3029200	3031840	Yes, yes. Take it, I'll leave it. That's right, yes.
3032880	3035600	Does it make you sad at all listening to it?
3035600	3039760	Anyway, not dramatically sad, because it's such a long time ago,
3040400	3046000	but to hear the voice even, the fact that it's there, because apart from a few remnants of
3046000	3052640	photographs and things that we have, and certificates, there is nothing left, is there?
3052640	3060960	No. It's a long time ago. There are a couple of copies of the words of the Bonny, Bonny banks
3060960	3069440	of Loch Lomond. Would you read the first verse to me? Read it? I'm not going to sing it. Anyway,
3069440	3074640	by your Bonny banks and by your Bonny braids, where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,
3075440	3080240	there me and my true love spent many happy days on the Bonny banks.
3097120	3102400	These voices sound so familiar, singing songs and telling stories about their homeland.
3102480	3105440	It's easy to forget the speakers were imprisoned in Germany.
3106080	3108800	What was being recorded in this country at that time?
3109760	3113120	In this sort of period, most of our spoken voice recordings are of famous people,
3113120	3117440	so statesmen, politicians, royalty, that sort of thing. And any women?
3117440	3120640	We do have some recordings of women. We've got a very early recording in 1890, for instance,
3120640	3124720	of Florence Nightingale, and we've also got a recording from 1908 of Christabel Pankhurst.
3125680	3135120	The reasons why women should have the vote are obvious to every fair-minded person.
3135120	3140480	The British Constitution provides that taxation and representation shall go together.
3141440	3148160	The excesses of men must be avoided. They must be compelled by a united and determined
3148160	3159440	women's movement to do justice in this matter. We are resolved that 1909 must and shall see
3159440	3162560	the political establishment of British women.
3165280	3171600	Oh, that's fantastic. It's fantastic. But it sounds almost exaggerated with its I, mine,
3172160	3176560	A's and- That's like one or two slightly, what we might now feel, a slightly old-fashioned
3177120	3182800	vows. I love the way that she belches out the vowel sounds, and the vowel sounds being the
3182800	3189600	sounds that carry the emotion. So she says things like, the excesses of men must be avoided.
3189600	3194160	That's right. It's very clear and crisp, isn't it? Very clear and crisp, and it gives the vowels full
3194160	3198960	value, although it's very, very clear on the consonants. That's right. You mentioned to me
3198960	3204960	earlier that you have a recording of Shackleton. We have, yes, from 1916, I think, yeah. And was
3204960	3209840	he middle class Southern? He was. He attended Dulwich College. So again, he was very much middle
3209840	3213920	class. Went to a boarding school, traditional boarding school. Could I listen to him? Absolutely, yeah.
3215040	3223200	The British Antarctic Expedition left New Zealand on the 1st of January, 1908. We restrained our steps
3223200	3231600	over crevasses to soft snow. On the 3rd of March, a party ascended that mountain, and for the first
3231600	3240640	time in human history, the great mountain Erebus, 13,350 times, was ascended by men.
3242720	3248080	That's so interesting, because he's much less grand than I imagined he would be. I mean, obviously,
3248080	3253600	he's got a lot of very grand sounds with his man sounding like men. That's right. And he talks about
3253600	3258640	the time rather than the times, which one associates now with somebody who's trying to
3258640	3265280	sound grand, the driveway and syndrome. Right. But what I'm so fascinated by is that to my ear,
3265280	3270640	they sound quite neutral, as if they could almost be of now. That's right. There are one or two elements
3270640	3274160	there that don't sound out of place nowadays, aren't they, in the way he speaks? No. It's such a very
3274160	3279520	familiar voice, that sort of early broadcast voice, if you like, that the BBC adopted. But as you say,
3279520	3282480	there are one or two vowels that sound slightly old-fashioned. He talked about falling on his
3282480	3288400	hands and knees, for instance, where most speakers of his social standing nowadays would say hands,
3288400	3292400	not hands. So there are one or two things that sound old-fashioned, but lots, as you say,
3292400	3299280	pretty modern, really. I mean, I suppose I've got this idea that sound has a sense of neutralised
3299280	3307920	as time's gone on. So I've assumed that the sound of the 20s and 30s was maybe less strong
3307920	3311840	than the audience. But actually, it's quite the other case, isn't it? We've got this neutral sound
3311920	3317680	in Wardian English, and then the no-cow sound, the very, very clipped, upmarket jolly sort of sound
3317680	3321920	that came after the war. That's right. I think that was very fashionable at the time, wasn't it? It was
3321920	3328960	a part of a certain social set, and certainly he heard very much in that period. It's fascinating
3328960	3336000	to know more about the accents of the middle classes at that time. But there is a strange irony in
3336000	3341200	the fact that I've learned so much about how ordinary people spoke from a German sound specialist
3341280	3348240	and an Austrian academic. The significance of these Berlin recordings is that it's often the case
3348240	3353840	that we think of the First World War as a silent war. We see silent film, silent footage of gray
3353840	3361920	figures doing soldierly things, but we don't actually hear their voices. So it's very exciting to hear
3361920	3367760	young contemporary voices speaking about not necessarily the war and their military experience,
3367760	3371520	but providing us with some idea of what our ancestors sounded like.
3387280	3392880	So what have I learned about how the Edwardians used to speak? Certainly they articulated their
3392880	3399200	words and didn't drop their H's and T's as many of us do now. But there's no doubt that regional
3399200	3404000	accents were stronger back then, and as cities have grown and our lifestyles have changed,
3404000	3410400	they have become diluted. Rural accents are changing all the time as towns spread into the
3410400	3416480	countryside and youngsters in the country want to sound more and more like city kids. At the same time,
3416480	3421840	new accents are emerging in the cities, and this is why I find this area so exciting.
3422960	3429440	All these years ago, Brandl recognized this. He said we do not stand before a peaceful sea,
3429440	3431680	but before an ever-changing stream.
3436880	3440800	It's incredible to hear these voices speaking to us from so long ago.
3442240	3444480	It almost feels as if they're coming back to life.
3447040	3452000	In some ways, these prisoners of war were the lucky ones who at least had a better chance of
3452000	3459040	making it home. But despite the joy of getting back, for many the horror of World War I overshadowed
3459040	3467200	the rest of their lives. Philip Jarvis was one of these men, forgotten by history. He died an
3467200	3474320	unremarkable death at the age of 67, living just 10 miles from where he was born. Five years later,
3474320	3478960	the stone marking his grave was moved and more bodies were buried in his plot.
3480480	3484160	Today, Philip's kerbstone lies in a nearby garden.
3486880	3490640	But now, his voice, along with hundreds of others, lives on.
3491680	3496080	They are living and breathing again, telling stories of returning home.
