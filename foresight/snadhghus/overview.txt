1. In January 1908, a group of New Zealanders led by Edward Kennedy successfully climbed Mount Erebus in Antarctica, an achievement previously unattempted.

2. The recordings from the Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv, made in 1908, are significant because they provide a historical audio snapshot of how English was spoken at the time by Edwardian men from different parts of Britain.

3. These recordings reveal that Edwardian speakers had clear articulation, pronounced their H's and T's distinctly, and regional accents were more pronounced than they are today.

4. The Edwardian accent has evolved over time, with regional dialects becoming less distinct as urbanization spreads and new accents emerge in cities.

5. The voices of these men from 1908 offer a rare insight into the past, allowing us to hear how our ancestors spoke and bringing them back to life almost a century later.

6. The story of Philip Jarvis, one of the speakers on the recordings, illustrates the human impact of World War I. He was a prisoner of war who eventually returned home but was haunted by the war's trauma until his death at age 67.

7. Today, the voices of these soldiers serve as a historical record, offering personal insights into their experiences and the era they lived in, and ensuring that their stories are not forgotten.
