00:00.000 --> 00:14.080
Our understanding of Edwardian Britain is dominated by images.

00:14.080 --> 00:20.280
We can see it in flickering footage of the time, in formal family portraits.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.680
But apart from a few famous voices, the people themselves remain silent.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.040
We can see the Edwardians, but we can't hear them.

00:31.040 --> 00:36.360
But there has been a remarkable discovery which for the first time gives voice to our ancestors.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.960
And it has come from the most unlikely place, Germany.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.200
There were a man and had two sons.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.280
Hundreds of recordings have come to light which reveal the voices of British prisoners from the First World War.

00:49.280 --> 01:09.360
I'm going to return to the hometowns of these men and meet their families.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.800
How does it feel to hear one of your relatives speaking to you from nearly a century ago?

01:14.800 --> 01:27.360
And how much of all our voices changed since Edwardian times?

01:27.360 --> 01:34.720
What do you think the placement of a Geordiac accent is? Where it's formed in the mouth? What the mouth shapes like?

01:34.720 --> 01:40.240
Well, to be honest, I wouldn't know. The thing that strikes me about a Geordiac accent is the tune of it.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.640
It goes up at the end of the sentences.

01:42.640 --> 01:48.720
But I have to say, for someone like me, Geordia's probably the most difficult accent.

01:48.720 --> 01:56.960
I have an unusual job. I teach accents for a living. I teach accents to actors for theatre, television, films.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.120
In the time I've been teaching, I've taught over 350 accents.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.880
It can end on an op, it can end on a don, it can end wherever you like.

02:06.880 --> 02:13.040
But it's got to have that direction about going over the wheeere of the North Sea in order to get there.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.400
Right, right.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.840
And I think, too, that there's much more variety of tune in a new castle accent, don't you?

02:19.840 --> 02:25.040
Than in most other accents. I mean, you'd get a thing that a lot of the lads are speaking really low down.

02:25.040 --> 02:32.400
But there are a huge number of the women that actually can move about an octave within a sentence.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.440
Try saying to me, Jim Court, this is a long one to remember.

02:37.440 --> 02:43.760
Jim Court, six fish, we are stuck at the weekend. Keep going over the top.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.360
At the weekend. Exactly. So you've got that glottal going with a K at the weekend with Jackie.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.200
Right. And that helps you enormously, doesn't it?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.960
Jackie. Yes, OK.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.720
Jim Court, six fish at the weekend with Jackie.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.040
Good.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.440
The British Isles has a rich tapestry of different accents.

03:07.440 --> 03:14.880
Over the years, I've come to feel connections between the way we speak and the scenery that surrounds us.

03:14.880 --> 03:21.520
It seems to me that landscape dictates or has something to do with the tune of an accent.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.480
It certainly feels true that the flatter a landscape, the flatter the accent,

03:27.840 --> 03:34.000
the area of East Anglia being a perfect example, which is probably the flattest counter geographically

03:34.000 --> 03:39.600
and has the flattest accent. So there's a feeling like in East Anglia, you take a few steps forward,

03:39.600 --> 03:45.360
little step back, another little step forward, and it stays very much on like two or three notes,

03:45.360 --> 03:49.920
which could contrast very clearly with somewhere like South Wales,

03:50.560 --> 03:54.560
the hills and valleys where we're traveling from the valley over the top of the hillside

03:54.560 --> 03:58.560
onto the other side. And so there's a feeling of expansiveness.

04:01.040 --> 04:08.320
One of the most interesting factors in accents to me is whether the tune is in major or minor key.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.560
Good examples of that to make that clear would be Birmingham, which is absolutely in minor key.

04:14.560 --> 04:19.760
So I could go on and on in where I like, but never ever end on a definite note.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.560
So you hear that sort of dull minor key ending as opposed to something like North Yorkshire,

04:24.560 --> 04:30.320
where I'm ending up very, very much on definite notes and I'm bound to sound more sure of myself.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.280
A career of listening to voices has taught me how quickly accent and dialect,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.880
the particular words local to each region, change over time.

04:40.960 --> 04:45.440
To find out how people used to speak in the past, I'm dependent on old recordings

04:45.440 --> 04:51.520
and the further back I go, the fewer there are. Sound recording was in its infancy in the Edwardian

04:51.520 --> 04:58.480
era, and so was reserved for the great and the good. This is what makes the discovery of recordings

04:58.480 --> 05:02.240
of ordinary soldiers from World War I so remarkable.

05:02.400 --> 05:10.320
I've come to Berlin to find out more about these recordings of British prisoners of war.

05:11.200 --> 05:16.720
Just four years ago, author John Adams came across them by chance while researching local dialect.

05:18.720 --> 05:24.240
I first came across these recordings through a book in the British Library.

05:24.240 --> 05:29.760
This book was called Cheshire Montart, Cheshire dialect. It was published in 1938,

05:30.240 --> 05:36.720
and it referred back to recordings made of prisoners of war during the First World War.

05:37.600 --> 05:44.160
These recordings were said to be in Berlin, so I wrote to the Humboldt University and asked them

05:44.160 --> 05:50.480
if the recording still existed. I got a marvellous reply back. If I told them what I wanted,

05:50.480 --> 05:55.200
they would send them to me. So I phoned up the British Library Sound Archive and said,

05:55.680 --> 06:01.120
were they aware that these recordings existed? And they said no, and if they did exist,

06:01.120 --> 06:02.640
they were of national importance.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.680
Miraculously, these fragile records made from a brittle resin called shellac

06:15.680 --> 06:20.720
survived the devastation of Berlin during the Second World War, and are still there today.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.480
Hidden away in a corner of the city stands the archive which holds the recordings,

06:30.480 --> 06:36.960
overseen by sound and music expert JÃ¼rgen Marenholds. He has dedicated the last eight years

06:36.960 --> 06:39.760
to a meticulous process of cataloging and filing.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.360
How many First World War recordings do you have here?

06:48.320 --> 06:56.240
Oh, we have 1,650 shellac recordings here in our archive.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.600
And how many British prisoners of war does that include?

07:00.160 --> 07:05.680
I think we have 200 recordings on shellac discs.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.240
So if I said a county to you, you could just pick something out of the cabinet?

07:10.720 --> 07:13.600
Yes, for example, we have...

07:13.600 --> 07:14.960
If I said Dorset.

07:14.960 --> 07:22.480
Yes, Dorset, for example. The code number is 467.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.080
Yes.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.400
So this is it. This is the first one I see.

07:34.720 --> 07:41.120
So this is a recording of Dorset. What does that say?

07:41.120 --> 07:43.840
It's also South of Dorset.

07:43.840 --> 07:53.040
And the recording is of, written in hand writing, the recording is of the farmer's daughter.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.640
The farmer's daughter, is that right?

07:54.640 --> 07:59.760
Yes, it's right. And the code number is PK467.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.680
The recordings were masterminded by two men.

08:03.680 --> 08:09.200
Alois Brandl was an Austrian academic fascinated by British accents and dialects,

08:09.200 --> 08:17.200
whose research trips to this country have been brought to an abrupt end by the outbreak of war.

08:17.200 --> 08:25.200
Wilhelm Durgen was a sound specialist, whose dream was to create a museum of languages and music from around the world.

08:29.760 --> 08:37.040
In the first few months of the war, several thousand British soldiers were captured and taken prisoner in Germany.

08:37.040 --> 08:42.800
They were held in dozens of camps stretching across the country.

08:42.800 --> 08:48.880
As the war raged, Durgen realized that on his doorstep was a captive resource.

08:48.880 --> 08:56.080
These camps offered him a unique opportunity to record the speech and music of many different nationalities.

08:56.080 --> 09:02.400
Seizing his chance, Durgen put forward his plan to make recordings of the prisoners to the German authorities.

09:02.400 --> 09:10.640
The Germans would have been very keen to exploit the resource of all these prisoners of different nationalities who had effectively landed on their doorstep.

09:10.640 --> 09:17.600
They would have had access to a huge range of ethnic groups of languages and of cultural traditions,

09:17.600 --> 09:25.440
which would have made it very interesting for ethnographers, musical historians, linguists.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.760
Permission was granted.

09:27.760 --> 09:35.840
Between 1915 and 1918, Brandl and Durgen formed part of a team of academics who chored over 70 prisoner of war camps,

09:35.840 --> 09:41.120
recording around 250 languages and dialects.

09:41.120 --> 09:50.320
For Brandl, this was the perfect opportunity to study his favorite subject, British accents and dialects.

09:50.320 --> 09:56.480
For the prisoners of war, however, life in the camps was harsh.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.200
The physical surroundings of camps varied greatly.

09:59.200 --> 10:05.360
For the ordinary soldiers, they were often not unlike in perhaps some of the camps that they'd experienced at home in the British Army,

10:05.360 --> 10:12.880
but they were often of a far inferior standard, usually hutted accommodation, possibly with up to 20 or 30 men in each hut.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.720
They'd be very, very cold in the winter and German winters can be extremely cold,

10:16.720 --> 10:23.280
and these men didn't have access to warm winter clothing in many cases, or they'd lost their warm winter clothing during their capture.

10:23.280 --> 10:29.600
So they would be wired in, they would be sentries, and in some cases there would also be dogs patrolling the outer perimeter.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.160
So it was an extremely oppressive and very unpleasant place to be incarcerated.

10:36.960 --> 10:42.320
For three years, Brandl and Durgen devoted all their time to this ambitious project.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.160
Travelling from camp to camp, they recorded one prisoner after another,

10:46.160 --> 10:52.000
building up a vast archive of voices and keeping detailed written records of each speaker.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.520
It's fantastic to see this at last, and I really can't wait to hear it. Can you play it for me?

10:57.520 --> 11:00.000
Oh yes, I can do.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.040
Oh, that's a recording of Sidney Wilkins.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.000
But how can you know the speed at which to play it?

11:16.320 --> 11:24.720
The last groove here has an A, and I can control this A with our tune fork here.

11:26.720 --> 11:34.240
And when the speed of the recording is right, I have the same tune from this record.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.480
And now the...

11:39.360 --> 11:44.160
So now you're adjusting the speed down here. Yes, there's the pitch control.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.200
And now you're here, it's the same tune, and now the record is ready for...

11:55.200 --> 11:59.040
So can we hear Sidney? Yes, now we can hear the real voice.

11:59.520 --> 12:05.760
He's all the farmer's daughters, the beautiful I'm told, whose parents died in laughter,

12:05.760 --> 12:12.160
five hundred pounds in gold. Her uncle kept a plow boy, who Mary loved so well.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.920
And in her uncle's garden, the tales of love would tell.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.600
There were a wealthy squire who all came here to see,

12:19.600 --> 12:23.440
but still she loved her plow boy on the banks of the sweet Dundee.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.720
What do you think about this recording?

12:29.600 --> 12:34.400
That's amazing. I mean, I don't know what Sidney would think about us listening to this now.

12:35.680 --> 12:40.160
If I listen to his recording, I mean, if I do it from my clinical more scientific side,

12:40.160 --> 12:45.680
if I listen to that recording and you asked me where he came from in England,

12:45.680 --> 12:50.960
I don't think I would guess Dorset. I thought I would guess somewhere deeper into the West

12:50.960 --> 12:58.160
country, because he sounds almost like Somerset nowadays. These sounds he makes,

12:58.160 --> 13:06.000
like Zummer and Varmer, these F-stavies and S-zeds really belong deeper into the West country.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.040
The text most frequently recorded was the parable of the prodigal son,

13:15.040 --> 13:20.960
but the prisoners also recited poems, told local stories and sang songs.

13:45.040 --> 14:04.240
What do you think about that?

14:04.960 --> 14:06.880
I just, I'm very emotional.

14:09.920 --> 14:17.120
Very emotional, because it's just, it's a very typical Scottish song and it's about the songs

14:17.120 --> 14:25.760
about longing. And it just touches me about longing from home. You just hear the yearning

14:25.760 --> 14:32.640
in the voice and it sounds exactly, the accent sounds exactly as you'd hear some of that area now.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.760
The recordings had an educational purpose to document for the German nation the speech

14:39.760 --> 14:44.560
and music of the rest of the world, but was there a greater plan in mind?

14:46.880 --> 14:50.400
How did they get the finances? Because particularly at that time during the war,

14:51.440 --> 14:56.400
there wasn't a lot of spare money around, presumably. Yes, the first two years are

14:56.480 --> 15:04.720
spent by the German government. Really? Yes, because this was a colonial area of Germany too

15:05.360 --> 15:14.000
and they thought at the beginning of the First World War that they do not lost this

15:15.200 --> 15:21.200
world war. Oh, so they thought that they were going to come to all these places and pass

15:21.200 --> 15:27.680
themselves off as native speakers of Dorset. So this is the devious plan. When they have

15:28.240 --> 15:34.240
the good recordings, they can train all the people who go to the new colonies.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.920
Do you, do you, do you surmise that? Do you guess that or do you know that?

15:40.720 --> 15:46.240
I know that because it was the purpose of Willem Durgen and that is written down

15:46.800 --> 15:54.640
in some readings that this was also to train, well, this recordings were also made to train

15:55.600 --> 15:59.840
the person who go to the, to the colonies or to parts of England.

16:03.840 --> 16:09.280
There was a man who had two sons, the youngest of them said to his father.

16:09.360 --> 16:15.840
PK737 was the recording by Philip Jarvis of the prodigal son in March 1917.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.680
We know that Philip was born in Macclesfield in Cheshire,

16:20.560 --> 16:32.320
but few other details are known about him and no photographs have survived.

16:33.040 --> 16:44.720
I've come to Macclesfield to meet Philip's family. I don't really know this area so first I'm keen

16:44.720 --> 16:58.640
to get a feel for the local accent. When I'm studying an accent, I try my best to get into the

16:58.640 --> 17:02.720
heart of the place and sensibility behind the people as well as just the sound.

17:10.000 --> 17:18.560
I stand at bus stops, I queue in the post office, I go into pubs, I go into community centres.

17:19.680 --> 17:26.320
When I come into bars, I often have a tape recorder hidden in a pocket. It's not always

17:26.320 --> 17:34.480
feasible to do that. So I usually find myself a quiet corner, listen to people, and I write down

17:34.480 --> 17:43.680
phonetically what I'm hearing. Everybody's talking about the darts, boo-wood. This is my favourite

17:43.680 --> 17:53.680
diphthong. So I can write that down phonetically. So I see my diphthong here is ua, like in sewer,

17:53.680 --> 17:59.520
but which we'd never expect in this context of boo-wood. So at least I've learned how to say

17:59.520 --> 18:08.000
the dart, boo-wood. Philip Jarvis grew up in a gamekeeper's lodge in the countryside, so I want

18:08.000 --> 18:14.720
to get into the heart of the rural community to hear how that accent sounds today. I love coming

18:14.720 --> 18:20.800
places like this when I'm researching an accent. I'm full of anticipation, full of excitement

18:20.800 --> 18:26.080
about what I'll find. I've never been to Macclesfield before, so I have an idea of what the accent's

18:26.080 --> 18:32.080
going to be like. I hope it's going to be my expectation, so that it's going to be a very

18:32.080 --> 18:34.640
physical, grounded sound.

18:34.640 --> 18:52.800
I suspect that members of the farming community hold on to the accent far more and hold on to

18:52.800 --> 18:59.040
the dialect more. They recognise the dialect for words. Because they're a community, because they

18:59.040 --> 19:04.880
don't see as many people outside their own working environment.

19:15.440 --> 19:23.040
This is Bianca. This is Bianca, the cow. Yes, Baynaud. So you've spent a long time cleaning her up,

19:23.040 --> 19:31.280
haven't you? And are you a farmer? One's been a farmer, yes. I go out to work full time as well.

19:37.280 --> 19:41.280
Did you buy any cows today? No, sold two. And how much do you get for them?

19:43.440 --> 19:48.560
Nearly a thousand for one and seven hundred and something for the other one. And have you been

19:48.560 --> 19:54.480
selling as well, mate? No, I've just come to look for some straw, that's all. How much do you pay for

19:54.480 --> 20:02.960
straw? Too much, yeah, between Â£40 and Â£50 depending on whether it's barley or wheat.

20:06.480 --> 20:12.000
I've had a fantastic morning here, really, because there's such a sense of community

20:12.000 --> 20:19.040
amongst the farmers. And I really feel that the accent is possibly much less changed in a group

20:19.040 --> 20:25.840
like this. Perhaps because farmers' children spend more time with their parents and are actually

20:25.840 --> 20:34.160
obliged, really, to work with them, the accent carries on along with a lot of the other traditions.

20:42.080 --> 20:58.080
I'm about a mile from where Philip Jarvis grew up at Alderley Edge. He spent the first 25 years

20:58.080 --> 21:03.840
of his life here and his father was a gamekeeper, so he was very much part of this land. He also

21:03.840 --> 21:10.000
came back here after the war. I've never been here before, but if I'd made a guess on listening to

21:10.000 --> 21:15.920
the recording, I would have guessed that it was a place with a lot of openness of space,

21:15.920 --> 21:20.480
because you can feel space around it. You can hear it in the quality of the tone,

21:21.120 --> 21:26.960
that the tone quality is very open. It's not nasal at all, like Manchester, where you hear

21:26.960 --> 21:32.400
the nasality of Manchester being just over there, you hear that sort of whiny quality. Whereas in

21:32.400 --> 21:37.840
this part of Cheshire, the tunes are very down to earth. You can't imagine an accent from an area

21:37.840 --> 21:44.480
like this being lazy in any way. This is organised, beautiful, so I've got a lot of better bits of

21:44.480 --> 21:50.800
butter. That very firm, grounded tea seems to fit with it. And these incredibly rich diphthongs,

21:51.600 --> 21:57.040
it wouldn't make sense to me that somebody said they looked at something for hours and hours.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.960
They look at it for hours and hours and hours.

22:08.320 --> 22:19.040
I've come to meet the Jarvis family, who lived just three miles from where Philip was born.

22:21.280 --> 22:28.240
So you're all related in some way to Philip Jarvis, and Michael, you're the closest relation?

22:29.360 --> 22:34.560
Yes, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and Philip's father were brothers.

22:35.520 --> 22:40.400
And he didn't marry himself? No, I believe Philip was a bachelor. There seemed to be

22:41.360 --> 22:46.080
a few lost years from when he came out of the army, when he got demobbed in 1919.

22:46.080 --> 22:52.160
There's quite a few lost years too when he died. But you know nothing about him at all?

22:52.160 --> 22:58.000
Not from that time. He was a blood-reality fly, you know, and he probably had it rough in the

22:58.560 --> 23:03.840
in the prisoner-war camp, and he went through a lot. A lot of people don't actually realise what

23:03.840 --> 23:09.760
them poor souls went through. He was in service, what they used to call service, and then in the army,

23:09.760 --> 23:14.160
and he doesn't know what a family life is, and we do appreciate what we've got.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.960
And you're a very close family, aren't you? I'm a family now. This is my wife, Marion,

23:19.600 --> 23:27.200
with son Darren, Nicola, granddaughter Jordan, have two more children, nine grandchildren,

23:28.720 --> 23:32.880
and it's just one big, one big happy family. Well, there's one other thing that we do know

23:32.880 --> 23:39.520
about him. We know what he sounded like. Yes. So would you like to... Oh, definitely.

23:39.760 --> 23:49.680
There was a man who had two sons. The youngest of them said to his father,

23:50.480 --> 23:57.760
give me that part of your thing that belongs to me. So father, give him his share. Not many days

23:57.760 --> 24:03.920
after, the young man saw the door of his belonging together and went away into a far country.

24:04.560 --> 24:11.040
There he wasted all that he had. When he had spent everything, a great famine came out of

24:11.040 --> 24:19.040
country, and he'd begun to be in warmth. High time, is it that I should go back to my father?

24:19.680 --> 24:25.360
This day, I would start for warmth, and I would go to my father and say to him,

24:25.920 --> 24:30.000
father, I'll stand against heaven and against thee.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.720
Well, I know what you're all recording sounds right, do that though, do I?

24:44.720 --> 24:47.440
You think he sounds very frightened when he's making it, I mean...

24:47.680 --> 25:00.400
It's the old word. His mum and his father, you know, his mum like, you know, but it was...

25:02.000 --> 25:06.720
Oh dear, it is very, very... Very emotional, it sounds frightened.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.040
How did you feel about listening to Philip's voice for the first time, Nicola?

25:11.840 --> 25:18.000
I kind of found it quite harrowing, just thinking that, you know, he's the same kind of age as

25:18.000 --> 25:21.840
what I am now, and listening to the circumstances he's in there and...

25:21.840 --> 25:26.960
He sounded a lot older than what he is to me. Yeah, he did sound older, I just found it really...

25:26.960 --> 25:32.000
To me, he sounds a lot older than 30s, because you can hear guys, the older guys around here,

25:32.960 --> 25:36.560
and some of them, they still speak like that, it's unbelievable.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.240
So does he sound quite country to you? Yes, he does, yeah.

25:41.520 --> 25:46.080
Because there's a couple of farmers that used to go in a local pub and they would speak like that,

25:46.080 --> 25:50.320
he's just like listening to them again. Is there anything that surprises you about the

25:50.320 --> 25:55.200
accent at that time that you wouldn't hear now? He's a lot stronger.

25:56.080 --> 26:03.600
When I arrived here, I had this memory of Philip's voice in my head, and this idea that it's so

26:03.680 --> 26:09.440
seem to fit the countryside, where you see, I mean, everything's very beautiful and neat here,

26:09.440 --> 26:14.640
isn't it? But I suspect that accents have got a bit more, I don't like the term lazy,

26:14.640 --> 26:21.920
but a bit more slap happy. How would you say the word H-E-R-E? H-E-R-E, here.

26:22.560 --> 26:28.080
Darren, how would you say the word here? Here. And what would you say, Nicola? Say here.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.360
What would you say, Jordan? Here. Right, you speak like your mummy, of course you do.

26:31.920 --> 26:38.720
So there's a very big movement in Vile's sound. So here is two sounds, isn't it? Here.

26:39.440 --> 26:44.160
And yours has become one sound here. Yes, you do. Yes, you're...

26:44.160 --> 26:48.240
Yeah, I say all over here. Yeah, come over here.

26:50.720 --> 26:56.880
I think, Nicola, that you have quite a lot of Mancunian in your accent. Would that surprise

26:56.960 --> 27:03.120
you to hear that? It does really, yeah. Like I say, I've never really... I don't think I've got any

27:03.120 --> 27:10.640
accent. My impression of the Macclesfield sound is that it's very down to earth, and your tunes are

27:10.640 --> 27:17.200
much more sort of floaty, that they don't actually end somewhere definite. Got our nasal problem.

27:17.200 --> 27:23.120
But you sound as if you have more of a Mancunian sort of tone of voice, which is not a criticism in

27:23.120 --> 27:26.560
any sort of way. It's just a comment. Try and get down there every other week to go primal.

27:34.560 --> 27:42.080
It's very different reading about somebody and reading the facts and figures and hearing somebody's

27:42.080 --> 27:50.240
voice. I feel as if Philips with us in this room now. Yeah, I hope he is. I hope he is, and then he

27:50.240 --> 28:00.480
knows that we've heard him, because I'm sure when he was reading the story, wondering if anybody's

28:00.480 --> 28:04.720
ever going to hear this. Is anyone going to listen to it? And 90 years on, we've listened to it.

28:05.840 --> 28:11.760
What do you think about him telling the story of the prodigal son? I would think it's marvellous,

28:11.760 --> 28:18.000
really, and how we feel now. The prodigal son's come back. His next birthday will raise a glass to him.

28:20.800 --> 28:29.760
I can't help wondering what some of the prisoners felt like when they were making these recordings.

28:32.800 --> 28:41.280
Some of them sound frightened, hesitant, nervous. I think they must have been rather

28:41.280 --> 28:47.840
suspicious about what the recordings were for. This is the only photograph that exists of a

28:47.840 --> 28:53.440
recording being made. Brandl is standing in front of the speaker, and the other prisoners are

28:53.440 --> 28:59.920
awaiting their turn. The text is being held up by Durgan, who has one hand firmly behind the

28:59.920 --> 29:07.600
prisoner's head, directing his voice towards the trumpet. Brandl, who oversaw the recordings,

29:07.600 --> 29:13.760
as Quotidus is saying, this is the work of peacetime. We will not talk about the war.

29:14.720 --> 29:20.480
Nothing will happen to you if you are unwilling to speak. Well, that's reassuring.

29:22.400 --> 29:31.840
He also says, we sought out the farmer's lads from isolated farms, the fishermen from tiny harbours,

29:31.840 --> 29:36.880
the shepherds, and above all, all those who are almost unable to read or write.

29:36.960 --> 29:44.080
Local dialect in the strict sense of the word is restricted to those of low intelligence,

29:44.800 --> 29:53.360
and is consequently deficient in intellectual content. That's a fave judgmental thing to say,

29:53.360 --> 29:59.840
isn't it? Brandl may have had a questionable attitude towards his subjects, but he was

29:59.840 --> 30:04.080
passionate in his desire to chart accents and dialects across the British Isles.

30:05.040 --> 30:10.160
He was part of a pioneering group of academics working in this new world of phonetics.

30:10.960 --> 30:16.640
The British linguist Henry Sweet worked with Brandl. A founder of modern phonetics, Sweet

30:16.640 --> 30:20.480
is thought to have been one of the models for Henry Higgins, the professor in Pygmalion.

30:21.440 --> 30:26.400
Brandl's fascination with this country also brought him into contact with one of our most famous

30:26.400 --> 30:34.320
writers. Brandl, in his travels investigating accents, had a connection with Thomas Hardy,

30:34.320 --> 30:40.240
and actually he sent some of his students to meet with him and remarked in his book on how helpful

30:40.240 --> 30:50.240
Thomas Hardy had been with them. Thomas Hardy's writing was steeped in the language and traditions

30:50.240 --> 30:57.120
of the countryside. He had a passionate love of the West Country, and his writing made heroes and

30:57.120 --> 31:09.680
heroines of ordinary country folk. One of the strongest rural accents I've heard amongst these

31:09.680 --> 31:18.640
recordings comes from Wiltshire. Charlie Shears was recorded in May 1916, aged 24.

31:20.240 --> 31:38.800
This is Cricklade in Wiltshire where Charlie Shears was born, grew up and returned to after the war.

31:40.160 --> 31:45.440
Charlie loved it here. He was a farmer, and he felt at one with the landscape.

31:45.440 --> 31:52.720
Charlie's gentle, rural burr reflects the undulating, rolling nature of this landscape.

32:16.400 --> 32:20.240
In Charlie's time, Cricklade was at the heart of the farming community.

32:22.320 --> 32:27.280
Today, with the industrial turn of Swindon just 10 minutes away, it's a commuter town.

32:30.480 --> 32:35.680
Charlie's sister, aged 98, still lives nearby and remembers her brother well.

32:37.200 --> 32:42.000
To your, Mrs Bartlett, your Charlie's sister, and this is your daughter Helen,

32:42.240 --> 32:46.240
Charlie's niece. Can you tell me some memories of Charlie when you...

32:46.800 --> 32:52.640
Well, my mum told me that he should have been in school, but he skipped school,

32:53.280 --> 32:59.360
and he lit a firework, and he threw it through the window, and it landed on one of the kids' heads,

32:59.360 --> 33:01.920
burnt all his hair off. Oh my goodness.

33:02.240 --> 33:13.520
And that is when the copper chased him and his friend, and they come to a little stream.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.720
Well, they didn't have a proper bridge, they had a board like that.

33:16.720 --> 33:22.160
You had a course on the board. They got over the board, the police moved me, and they went like that.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.560
And what did he say to them about that?

33:28.560 --> 33:33.040
Oh, he told them. He said, I've got a great respect for your parents,

33:33.040 --> 33:40.160
but I think you two should join the army. Oh, dear. So is that why he joined the army?

33:40.160 --> 33:45.200
That's right. And then Charlie joined the reserves. That's how he was called up when at first.

33:45.920 --> 33:50.000
I think it was Kitchener's Army. I think that's what they called it.

33:50.560 --> 33:57.600
And when Charlie went to war, he was captured early, early on.

33:58.160 --> 34:07.040
Yes. And I remember my mum saying that he'd gone to Germany, but he was okay,

34:07.040 --> 34:15.360
because he never wrote anything bad to her. And did he go with some other boys from the village?

34:15.360 --> 34:23.520
Yes, he did go with friends. I think only him. Only Uncle Charlie came back, didn't he?

34:23.520 --> 34:30.240
Yeah, he came home on my birthday. And he brought me the prettiest dress I've ever had.

34:30.240 --> 34:38.720
Oh, it was lovely. And it was the church, where we went up to the church, went on the people's

34:38.720 --> 34:43.920
lawn, you know, and had tea and buns and stuff. And that was my birthday.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.600
I'm already thinking that Charlie tried to escape from the camp.

34:48.480 --> 34:54.080
He did. He did, but they caught him. And what happened?

34:54.080 --> 35:00.240
They stripped him and tied him to a tree. Well, he didn't tell us that, but his mate did.

35:00.960 --> 35:07.200
He'd tell us the funny things, but he wouldn't tell us, you know, things like that.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.920
He said, when they were helping the Germans pack their loads of bread for the people,

35:12.560 --> 35:17.920
they had baggy trousers. When they weren't looking, they had a dozen in their electrolysis legs.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.680
You don't remember your uncle at all, do you? No, only as an older man. I can't remember

35:23.680 --> 35:28.560
him when I was a child. Well, he must have been about 60 when I was born, so. But I could remember

35:28.560 --> 35:33.360
him being very upright, ramrod straight, you know, I suppose that was being in the army.

35:33.920 --> 35:38.880
He was a lovely man, but very dry sense of humour. Do you remember Charlie's voice?

35:39.600 --> 35:46.800
No, I don't think I can. No, I was looking at a picture of him, and I couldn't remember.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.320
I couldn't. I should have remembered, but I can't.

35:52.720 --> 35:57.360
As you know, we've got a recording of your brother Charlie, and I'd like to play it to you.

35:59.360 --> 36:04.880
There were a man as had two sons. The younger on them said to his father,

36:05.600 --> 36:10.800
give me the part of the good that belongs to me. So the father, getting his sure,

36:11.520 --> 36:15.840
print many days ahead of the young man, put all his belongings together,

36:15.840 --> 36:19.680
and went away to a far country. There a wife did all of that.

36:20.560 --> 36:26.160
When I had spent everything, a good man had come over the country, and had begun to be in one.

36:27.360 --> 36:33.040
A hour long, I had to check any work I could get, and I was glad when I found a flight

36:33.040 --> 36:39.440
with a man of upcountry. I wouldn't have recognised it. I can't believe that.

36:39.440 --> 36:46.080
It's possible he's speaking in with more dialect than he normally used, because it's very, very

36:46.080 --> 36:50.640
thick. Oh my goodness, yes. With his girth, and girth, and summer. I think that's

36:50.640 --> 36:54.640
more Somerset than Wiltshire. I wouldn't have recognised his voice.

36:54.640 --> 36:58.080
I wouldn't have recognised his voice at all. Normally. I wouldn't.

36:58.080 --> 37:02.560
No, I don't think many people speak like that. Unless you go to a village where

37:03.360 --> 37:06.880
somebody's lived all their life and never moved out of the village, that's the way

37:06.880 --> 37:12.560
Wiltshire people did speak. Not so much with the Zeds for summer. I can't remember that,

37:12.560 --> 37:16.720
but I can remember elderly relatives talking with that strong, strong accent,

37:16.720 --> 37:19.200
because they never moved away from their villages. Exactly.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.160
They always lived in the same village, and everybody spoke the same.

37:22.160 --> 37:26.320
It's very interesting, isn't it? I mean, I can't believe that I've actually

37:26.320 --> 37:30.960
listened to him speaking in those circumstances all those years ago.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.880
It just gave me a quite shiver down my spine. Yeah.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.920
The recordings I've heard so far have been a revelation.

37:45.200 --> 37:48.320
The accents and dialects are so much stronger than I'd expected.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.680
I've come to get a second opinion from one of the country's leading experts, Johnny Robinson.

37:53.920 --> 38:01.680
Brandl and Durgan spent a huge amount of time recording the prisoner's speech in the form of

38:01.680 --> 38:06.240
phonetics. Can we just have a look at the phonetics that they wrote? Yeah.

38:06.800 --> 38:14.240
Because although it's written in what looks like very rapid handwriting, I think we can read it

38:14.240 --> 38:19.680
from the phonetics that we know today. That's right. This is fascinating text, isn't it? Because

38:19.680 --> 38:25.520
this is at a time when linguists like Durgan and Brandl and people in the UK, like Henry Sweeter,

38:25.520 --> 38:31.520
I believe, worked with them, were formulating a sort of national, international convention,

38:31.520 --> 38:36.720
if you like, for how do we write sounds. And it's a very early version of what has become

38:36.720 --> 38:40.640
the international phonetic alphabet. And so it's a fantastic early glimpse of how that came about.

38:41.680 --> 38:46.720
The men who were recorded were given the text of the prodigal son and asked to change any

38:46.720 --> 38:53.600
words or expressions into their local dialect. Do you think that would have put pressure on them

38:53.600 --> 38:58.400
to invent dialect to some extent? It would be interesting to know, wouldn't it? Because yes,

38:58.400 --> 39:03.200
I suspect if they were given a text and given time to prepare, then they may well be drawing on

39:03.200 --> 39:07.360
expressions perhaps from their grandparents or people they knew back at home, rather than just

39:07.360 --> 39:14.320
necessarily using the expressions that are natural to themselves. Let's listen to Philip Jarvis from

39:14.320 --> 39:21.840
Macclesfield. He's telling the story of the prodigal son. There was a man who had two sons,

39:22.560 --> 39:28.240
the youngest to them said to his father, give me that part of your thing that belongs to me.

39:29.360 --> 39:34.640
So, father, give him his share. He's got more dialect words probably than any of the other

39:34.640 --> 39:40.720
speakers that I've heard. I mean, I'm interested particularly in his use of father. Could you

39:40.720 --> 39:45.360
show me something about that? That's right. That's a very traditional broad dialect pronunciation

39:45.360 --> 39:51.040
that was widely heard in the Northwest Midlands from that sort of area. And we still hear other

39:51.040 --> 39:55.760
dialect pronunciations, don't we, to this day? We hear father in the north for instance in Yorkshire

39:55.760 --> 40:00.160
and in Lancashire, certainly. And that would have been the original pronunciation in the

40:00.160 --> 40:04.640
northern half of England, father. And that vowel sound was gradually lengthened over time. You hear

40:04.640 --> 40:08.960
father in parts of the north now and certainly you hear father in the south of England.

40:09.040 --> 40:16.320
I'd love to play you a recording we have of a man from Oxfordshire. Wonderful, that sounds fascinating,

40:16.320 --> 40:23.920
yeah. There were a man who had two sons, the younger on them said to his father,

40:24.640 --> 40:29.200
give me that part of your good that belongs to me. So, the father gave me share.

40:30.160 --> 40:36.400
There he got rid of all he had. When he got rid of everything, a great famine come over the country.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.720
What do you think of that? Wonderful recording, isn't it, yeah? I suspect to

40:43.440 --> 40:48.400
modern listeners that would sound as if it was from somewhere in the West Country or somewhere

40:48.400 --> 40:53.520
Devon Cornwall door sort of accent, it sounds like, to modern ears, doesn't it? But it's very

40:53.520 --> 40:57.840
typical of speech in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, booking, I'm sure, of that sort of date.

40:58.400 --> 41:02.880
So do you still hear the R pronounced after vowels the way it is on that recording?

41:02.880 --> 41:07.920
Yeah, he says father, doesn't he, and he says adder words with the R pronounced on wherever

41:07.920 --> 41:12.080
it features in the word, doesn't he, and that's something again that is typical of

41:12.080 --> 41:16.400
speech in the West Country these days, isn't it? So do you feel that the nature of rural

41:16.400 --> 41:22.080
Oxfordshire has changed? Absolutely, I mean, Oxford is not very far away from London, so

41:22.960 --> 41:26.400
large parts of the southeast of England have changed quite dramatically, haven't they,

41:26.400 --> 41:32.080
from a rural community to commuter populations, and that's changed the nature of speech in

41:32.080 --> 41:34.480
rural communities in lots of areas in the southeast of England.

41:35.440 --> 41:38.400
John, having heard these recordings, what are your thoughts?

41:38.400 --> 41:42.560
Well, it's been fascinating to hear them, hasn't it, and have a glimpse of dialects of that time,

41:42.560 --> 41:46.560
and certainly things have changed since then, perhaps more dramatically in some parts of the

41:46.560 --> 41:51.120
country than others. But in terms of accent, things have evolved very slowly, and there is

41:51.120 --> 41:54.880
still a great deal of difference as you move across the country in terms of accent. So it's

41:54.880 --> 42:00.160
been great to be able to hear slight differences and also perhaps find a bit of a link with the past

42:00.160 --> 42:08.800
as well. In addition to the English voices, Brandon Durgan made 44 Irish, 4 Welsh, and 74

42:08.800 --> 42:14.000
Scottish recordings. We now know that rural accents have been affected by the spread of

42:14.000 --> 42:19.680
cities into the countryside. But what has happened in the more remote corners of the British Isles?

42:20.800 --> 42:26.240
George Campbell, who was recorded in July 1916, was born and brought up in Aberdeen.

42:26.240 --> 42:35.040
But the town has changed dramatically since then, as oil workers have moved in, and the fishing

42:35.040 --> 42:46.320
industry has declined. 45 again, 45 again, 45! It's all haddock nowadays. Yeah, it's all small

42:47.040 --> 42:53.440
So there's no cod around to speak of? Very, very often. Sometimes Peterhead, they've got bigger

42:53.440 --> 42:57.760
markets, and we only get the buck cheese stuff, like the small boats, all the big boats go over

42:57.760 --> 43:07.360
the road now. All right, up the road, up the road to Peterhead. 45 per one, 45.6, 46 per one,

43:07.360 --> 43:13.600
46.7. What's that cost, 60? That's 45 pounds of ox. That's 51 kilos in there, so it's about 80

43:14.320 --> 43:22.000
And have you always been in the fish? Yeah, since I was 19, I've been in the fish and there's been

43:22.000 --> 43:26.240
massive changes. I mean, some days there's no fish and there's more at all.

43:30.080 --> 43:38.640
What I hear in the fish market is an accent that seems to me absolutely unchanged. It feels as if

43:38.640 --> 43:43.840
it's centuries old. It's not just an accent, it's a dialect. It's a whole code away of speaking.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.320
It's impenetrably thick.

43:49.840 --> 43:54.320
Every accent's got a point of tension, and it's very clear in the Aberdeen accent. I was brought

43:54.320 --> 43:59.440
up in Aberdeen in left when I was 18, and I've still got that point of tension. It's here,

43:59.440 --> 44:06.160
it's the upper lip that's very, very immobile. It's something to do with it being the Calvinist

44:06.240 --> 44:12.080
coast, about just covering up your orifice, don't look inside my orifice. It's definitely something

44:12.080 --> 44:19.280
to do with that. But it's also the fact that it's bitterly cold here, so everybody's sort of wondering

44:19.280 --> 44:26.400
around like that, sort of shielding their mouths against the cold. The essence of the tone quality

44:26.400 --> 44:34.480
in Aberdeen is that it lacks nasality. This is common to ports. People do suffer from sinus problems.

44:34.480 --> 44:40.080
They sound as if they have a bunged up nose. So it happens from Aberdeen, you hear the tone

44:40.080 --> 44:45.600
quality like that, as if I'm not breathing through my nose, into somewhere like Liverpool.

44:45.600 --> 44:51.200
Although you've got a different tone quality, you can hear that I sound bunged up, or even like

44:51.200 --> 45:04.160
New York. It's almost like I've got a cold. I'm sure that George Campbell would have

45:04.160 --> 45:10.880
walked along this beach. Everybody who's an Aberdonian walks along this beach at some point,

45:10.880 --> 45:19.440
and it's usually deserted. It's interesting that when he was asked to demonstrate something of his

45:19.440 --> 45:26.240
dialect in the Prisoner of War camp, he chose three Scottish songs. He's got a beautiful voice,

45:26.320 --> 45:34.960
beautiful tenor voice. He chose three incredibly nostalgic songs by the Bonny Bonny Banks of

45:34.960 --> 45:42.960
Loch Lomond, Coming Through the Rye, and John Anderson, Majo John. They're all songs about longing for home.

45:42.960 --> 45:57.680
I've come to meet George's son, Alexander Campbell. The father was a very musical man,

45:57.680 --> 46:02.560
wasn't he? Do you have memories of that? Yes, particularly if I say he played the banjo.

46:03.680 --> 46:09.360
I can recollect him playing in the dance bands, mostly Friday or Saturday evenings, as it was in

46:09.360 --> 46:14.160
those days. I believe he did tap dancing as well, is that correct? There's evidence that he did have

46:14.160 --> 46:20.720
the tap shoes with the rattly taps. So he was multi-talented in the musical field. I think he

46:20.720 --> 46:25.200
was the one that would have a go at probably anything. I've got some photographs I managed to

46:25.840 --> 46:31.120
bring out of the old files. Oh, that's fantastic. Maybe the first one is my mother and father,

46:32.080 --> 46:36.560
probably not long after they were married. Oh, that's very nice. Your mum looks very young.

46:37.200 --> 46:41.360
We have one or two from what would appear to be concert parties where he's dressed as the

46:41.360 --> 46:50.320
dancing comedian. Oh, I see. And that's an enlargement of the same of him only. So this is George Campbell,

46:50.880 --> 46:57.440
light comedian and dancer. That's fantastic. You look like your father, actually. Well,

46:57.440 --> 47:02.800
probably some of the features are there. This is probably the most intriguing one. It's actually

47:02.800 --> 47:11.840
in the camp. Oh, wow. There's the German guard. Eating time. Mealtime and the German guard's got

47:11.840 --> 47:20.560
the cigarette between his teeth. Very dirty looking, aren't they? But it looks very casual,

47:20.560 --> 47:27.040
doesn't it? Yes. And if they're kilts with aprons over them. Correct. There are so few

47:27.040 --> 47:33.680
photographs of the prisoners who were recorded. It's just fantastic. I think there were more

47:33.680 --> 47:39.520
recordings made of your father's voice than of any other man that I've heard.

47:40.720 --> 47:46.320
So your father's... Maybe not surprising. And your father was obviously... First volunteer.

47:46.320 --> 47:53.440
First volunteer and a fantastic example. And then they made all these recordings of him.

47:53.440 --> 47:59.440
Whereas with other people, they made one or two. Your dad was pretty unstoppable when it came to

47:59.440 --> 48:04.080
his recordings. And this is the first song that he...

48:23.440 --> 48:51.760
Very good. That's quite intriguing the way it's come over.

48:53.520 --> 48:59.040
Is there anything that surprises you listening to him? No, I can understand. I could picture him

48:59.040 --> 49:05.280
singing that. I actually... I find it very touching, you know, this sort of sound of Scotland. Sentimental

49:05.280 --> 49:16.080
stuff. Yes. Yes. But I mean, very, very kind of personal stuff. It's odd hearing that. It is odd.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.880
What, like it's a ghostly voice from the past? Or... I'm trying to link it to what I have,

49:21.600 --> 49:28.640
by way of any recollection or anything. Your father sings John Anderson Madgeau,

49:28.640 --> 49:33.520
but he also speaks the lyrics because these Germans were very interested in the accent.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.560
So I'd like you to listen to a bit of his speaking voice. I haven't heard of that.

49:38.560 --> 49:42.560
You didn't ever say recite poems or anything, but it would be very interesting to hear that.

49:50.880 --> 49:58.320
John Anderson Madgeau, John, when we were first to quench, your locks were like the raven,

49:58.320 --> 50:06.080
your body brow would spin. Now we must start up doing John, and hand in hand we'll go,

50:07.040 --> 50:13.840
and we'll sleep together at your feet, John Anderson Madgeau. Now you're an old ghost, John.

50:16.320 --> 50:20.480
That last comment sounds like... Does it? I can't quite hear what he says at the end.

50:21.680 --> 50:25.920
I wasn't clear, but it just sounded the way we'd hear that. Say something just off the cuff.

50:25.920 --> 50:29.200
Yes, so it's a wee bit cheeky at the end of the recording for the Germans.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.840
Yes, yes. Take it, I'll leave it. That's right, yes.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.600
Does it make you sad at all listening to it?

50:35.600 --> 50:39.760
Anyway, not dramatically sad, because it's such a long time ago,

50:40.400 --> 50:46.000
but to hear the voice even, the fact that it's there, because apart from a few remnants of

50:46.000 --> 50:52.640
photographs and things that we have, and certificates, there is nothing left, is there?

50:52.640 --> 51:00.960
No. It's a long time ago. There are a couple of copies of the words of the Bonny, Bonny banks

51:00.960 --> 51:09.440
of Loch Lomond. Would you read the first verse to me? Read it? I'm not going to sing it. Anyway,

51:09.440 --> 51:14.640
by your Bonny banks and by your Bonny braids, where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,

51:15.440 --> 51:20.240
there me and my true love spent many happy days on the Bonny banks.

51:37.120 --> 51:42.400
These voices sound so familiar, singing songs and telling stories about their homeland.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.440
It's easy to forget the speakers were imprisoned in Germany.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.800
What was being recorded in this country at that time?

51:49.760 --> 51:53.120
In this sort of period, most of our spoken voice recordings are of famous people,

51:53.120 --> 51:57.440
so statesmen, politicians, royalty, that sort of thing. And any women?

51:57.440 --> 52:00.640
We do have some recordings of women. We've got a very early recording in 1890, for instance,

52:00.640 --> 52:04.720
of Florence Nightingale, and we've also got a recording from 1908 of Christabel Pankhurst.

52:05.680 --> 52:15.120
The reasons why women should have the vote are obvious to every fair-minded person.

52:15.120 --> 52:20.480
The British Constitution provides that taxation and representation shall go together.

52:21.440 --> 52:28.160
The excesses of men must be avoided. They must be compelled by a united and determined

52:28.160 --> 52:39.440
women's movement to do justice in this matter. We are resolved that 1909 must and shall see

52:39.440 --> 52:42.560
the political establishment of British women.

52:45.280 --> 52:51.600
Oh, that's fantastic. It's fantastic. But it sounds almost exaggerated with its I, mine,

52:52.160 --> 52:56.560
A's and- That's like one or two slightly, what we might now feel, a slightly old-fashioned

52:57.120 --> 53:02.800
vows. I love the way that she belches out the vowel sounds, and the vowel sounds being the

53:02.800 --> 53:09.600
sounds that carry the emotion. So she says things like, the excesses of men must be avoided.

53:09.600 --> 53:14.160
That's right. It's very clear and crisp, isn't it? Very clear and crisp, and it gives the vowels full

53:14.160 --> 53:18.960
value, although it's very, very clear on the consonants. That's right. You mentioned to me

53:18.960 --> 53:24.960
earlier that you have a recording of Shackleton. We have, yes, from 1916, I think, yeah. And was

53:24.960 --> 53:29.840
he middle class Southern? He was. He attended Dulwich College. So again, he was very much middle

53:29.840 --> 53:33.920
class. Went to a boarding school, traditional boarding school. Could I listen to him? Absolutely, yeah.

53:35.040 --> 53:43.200
The British Antarctic Expedition left New Zealand on the 1st of January, 1908. We restrained our steps

53:43.200 --> 53:51.600
over crevasses to soft snow. On the 3rd of March, a party ascended that mountain, and for the first

53:51.600 --> 54:00.640
time in human history, the great mountain Erebus, 13,350 times, was ascended by men.

54:02.720 --> 54:08.080
That's so interesting, because he's much less grand than I imagined he would be. I mean, obviously,

54:08.080 --> 54:13.600
he's got a lot of very grand sounds with his man sounding like men. That's right. And he talks about

54:13.600 --> 54:18.640
the time rather than the times, which one associates now with somebody who's trying to

54:18.640 --> 54:25.280
sound grand, the driveway and syndrome. Right. But what I'm so fascinated by is that to my ear,

54:25.280 --> 54:30.640
they sound quite neutral, as if they could almost be of now. That's right. There are one or two elements

54:30.640 --> 54:34.160
there that don't sound out of place nowadays, aren't they, in the way he speaks? No. It's such a very

54:34.160 --> 54:39.520
familiar voice, that sort of early broadcast voice, if you like, that the BBC adopted. But as you say,

54:39.520 --> 54:42.480
there are one or two vowels that sound slightly old-fashioned. He talked about falling on his

54:42.480 --> 54:48.400
hands and knees, for instance, where most speakers of his social standing nowadays would say hands,

54:48.400 --> 54:52.400
not hands. So there are one or two things that sound old-fashioned, but lots, as you say,

54:52.400 --> 54:59.280
pretty modern, really. I mean, I suppose I've got this idea that sound has a sense of neutralised

54:59.280 --> 55:07.920
as time's gone on. So I've assumed that the sound of the 20s and 30s was maybe less strong

55:07.920 --> 55:11.840
than the audience. But actually, it's quite the other case, isn't it? We've got this neutral sound

55:11.920 --> 55:17.680
in Wardian English, and then the no-cow sound, the very, very clipped, upmarket jolly sort of sound

55:17.680 --> 55:21.920
that came after the war. That's right. I think that was very fashionable at the time, wasn't it? It was

55:21.920 --> 55:28.960
a part of a certain social set, and certainly he heard very much in that period. It's fascinating

55:28.960 --> 55:36.000
to know more about the accents of the middle classes at that time. But there is a strange irony in

55:36.000 --> 55:41.200
the fact that I've learned so much about how ordinary people spoke from a German sound specialist

55:41.280 --> 55:48.240
and an Austrian academic. The significance of these Berlin recordings is that it's often the case

55:48.240 --> 55:53.840
that we think of the First World War as a silent war. We see silent film, silent footage of gray

55:53.840 --> 56:01.920
figures doing soldierly things, but we don't actually hear their voices. So it's very exciting to hear

56:01.920 --> 56:07.760
young contemporary voices speaking about not necessarily the war and their military experience,

56:07.760 --> 56:11.520
but providing us with some idea of what our ancestors sounded like.

56:27.280 --> 56:32.880
So what have I learned about how the Edwardians used to speak? Certainly they articulated their

56:32.880 --> 56:39.200
words and didn't drop their H's and T's as many of us do now. But there's no doubt that regional

56:39.200 --> 56:44.000
accents were stronger back then, and as cities have grown and our lifestyles have changed,

56:44.000 --> 56:50.400
they have become diluted. Rural accents are changing all the time as towns spread into the

56:50.400 --> 56:56.480
countryside and youngsters in the country want to sound more and more like city kids. At the same time,

56:56.480 --> 57:01.840
new accents are emerging in the cities, and this is why I find this area so exciting.

57:02.960 --> 57:09.440
All these years ago, Brandl recognized this. He said we do not stand before a peaceful sea,

57:09.440 --> 57:11.680
but before an ever-changing stream.

57:16.880 --> 57:20.800
It's incredible to hear these voices speaking to us from so long ago.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.480
It almost feels as if they're coming back to life.

57:27.040 --> 57:32.000
In some ways, these prisoners of war were the lucky ones who at least had a better chance of

57:32.000 --> 57:39.040
making it home. But despite the joy of getting back, for many the horror of World War I overshadowed

57:39.040 --> 57:47.200
the rest of their lives. Philip Jarvis was one of these men, forgotten by history. He died an

57:47.200 --> 57:54.320
unremarkable death at the age of 67, living just 10 miles from where he was born. Five years later,

57:54.320 --> 57:58.960
the stone marking his grave was moved and more bodies were buried in his plot.

58:00.480 --> 58:04.160
Today, Philip's kerbstone lies in a nearby garden.

58:06.880 --> 58:10.640
But now, his voice, along with hundreds of others, lives on.

58:11.680 --> 58:16.080
They are living and breathing again, telling stories of returning home.
