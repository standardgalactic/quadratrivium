WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.360
so welcome everybody welcome back to some faces as well it is so so exciting to

00:29.360 --> 00:34.960
be sharing the space with you again this evening or newly this evening I'm

00:34.960 --> 00:42.400
really it's the third session today of these kind of existential offerings live

00:42.400 --> 00:46.760
events and I'm just starting to have it as something that I really really look

00:46.760 --> 00:51.520
forward to because each session is so different and the discussions always

00:51.520 --> 00:57.080
leave me with so much to think about and as ever I just want to kind of bring

00:57.080 --> 01:02.600
in that that that idea that even though we're just squares on each other's

01:02.600 --> 01:06.880
screens we are real people in real time joining together and sharing this

01:06.880 --> 01:12.600
experience and it's it's just so special I know that some of the people here have

01:12.600 --> 01:17.480
bought tickets that are free some of them have donated some of them have spent

01:17.480 --> 01:22.600
money it either way it's just so you know it's so wonderful because what we are

01:22.600 --> 01:27.960
giving all of us is is our time and that is so valuable and I'm so grateful so

01:27.960 --> 01:32.320
thank you so much to the people that are live and watching for sharing your time

01:32.320 --> 01:36.160
and thank you so much for the people that will watch this in the future for

01:36.160 --> 01:41.560
have using your time this precious time to be engaging with these existential

01:41.560 --> 01:47.120
ideas and even though we're in the present today we're going right back to

01:47.120 --> 01:53.040
the past to explore ancient existential ideas with none other than

01:53.040 --> 01:58.880
Marcos Maria Mendez who is joining us all the way from Argentina so thank you

01:58.880 --> 02:05.280
Marcos we met in Athens and I remember you were standing there kind of

02:05.280 --> 02:11.240
improvising your talk passionately about Greek philosophies and how they're still

02:11.240 --> 02:16.920
relevant today and I just thought right we need to have these ideas spread

02:16.920 --> 02:21.960
further so this is the reason that Marcos shares the space with us today and I

02:21.960 --> 02:27.520
won't chatter and take up any more time Marcos I just welcome you and welcome you

02:27.520 --> 02:34.040
to introduce yourself well thank you it's a wonderful wonderful thing to be

02:34.040 --> 02:41.640
here and yes in fact we met in Athens and well you might expect a little bit of

02:42.000 --> 02:47.280
the same things here because not very much in the preparation of the

02:47.280 --> 02:55.140
topics but of the let's say culmination of many of the years of work and of

02:55.140 --> 03:03.320
study in these things and the basic ideas governing the centers of

03:03.320 --> 03:10.440
the talk so well thank you all for being here and I'll say hello from Argentina

03:10.440 --> 03:15.840
the other side of the world so thanks for taking the time to be here with us

03:15.840 --> 03:21.600
and yeah I'm not very much for introductions I'm let's just say that

03:21.600 --> 03:27.560
I'm a clinical psychologist and I have been for the last almost 10 years and I

03:27.560 --> 03:36.520
find that existentialism at least those ideas and those concepts are very

03:36.560 --> 03:43.080
helpful in the clinical practice in fact at some point I'd say that the

03:43.080 --> 03:51.880
existential dilemmas are so central to the human experience that we can't avoid

03:51.880 --> 04:01.200
them and it's perfectly clear that one or at a certain point we all have to face

04:01.200 --> 04:07.480
those things so many people come to to the practice and say okay I have this

04:07.480 --> 04:17.280
problem I have this big luggage on my back and I can't get rid of it so the

04:17.280 --> 04:22.560
basic concept today will be that well these questions they they persist

04:22.560 --> 04:28.440
throughout history and the idea of the existential school as a school of thought

04:28.440 --> 04:36.120
is well let's say has some certain issues and I don't know if you if you're

04:36.120 --> 04:43.520
all familiar with with the idea of existentialism but and I repeat that

04:43.520 --> 04:50.400
anyone can can interrupt me if the if my words don't come clearly enough the

04:50.400 --> 04:58.480
idea of existentialism is complex because the the basic thoughts are not

04:58.480 --> 05:04.800
very clear why because we have existentialists that are apes that are

05:04.800 --> 05:14.760
apes existential Christians and agnostics so the basic ideas can be applied to

05:14.840 --> 05:26.720
many things the the the school of thought just came to be at least formally with in

05:26.720 --> 05:33.720
France after the second world war I like that there is a lot of European public

05:33.720 --> 05:39.240
because well you might be all very much in touch with the with the history of

05:39.560 --> 05:46.600
of that maybe not yourself but yes only on the generations before you very

05:46.600 --> 05:52.920
different than the experience we have here in in South America so after the

05:52.920 --> 06:04.520
second world war at least in France the ideas just started to be and well I I

06:05.160 --> 06:12.320
think you might have heard of Jean-Paul Sartre he monopolized the idea of the

06:12.320 --> 06:19.880
existentialist he he just adored the word which is very different from let's say

06:19.880 --> 06:26.440
Albert Camus which hated the word existentialism he defined himself as

06:27.240 --> 06:34.680
absurdism the absurd sorry if my if my pronunciation is I find myself saying

06:34.680 --> 06:38.680
some words for the first time in English because of course I've studied them in

06:38.680 --> 06:47.800
in Spanish so I apologize in advance if some of the words don't come up very very very well

06:48.200 --> 06:58.360
so you might have heard of the basic concept of Sartre that the existence

06:58.360 --> 07:05.960
precedes the essence which is in a certain way I'm not trying to make a lecture

07:05.960 --> 07:10.560
about this because there are many far better explanations for this I'm just

07:10.560 --> 07:15.640
trying to introduce the concept so that then we can go towards the antiquity

07:16.600 --> 07:21.480
or the ancient times I think antiquity is just for the furniture right

07:23.560 --> 07:32.520
no okay and the the idea of of the existence precedes the essence counts

07:34.360 --> 07:41.720
in an antagonistic way to the essentialism the the idea that Plato and Aristotle have

07:41.800 --> 07:47.960
that everything has an essence and that everything has the thing that makes the

07:47.960 --> 07:54.920
thing what it is not some other thing so if you if you lost that that would no longer be that thing

07:55.560 --> 08:01.640
the the basic explanation is the knife you can have a handle that's plastic wood

08:02.440 --> 08:08.280
no handle at all but if you take the blade it's no longer a knife so the essence

08:09.240 --> 08:11.640
is that that characteristic which is

08:13.880 --> 08:21.880
unsupprable from the thing itself so Sartre says you know that's not it what if what if we just

08:22.440 --> 08:30.120
don't have any any essence and we create ourselves which is a way of thinking about it

08:30.120 --> 08:36.920
which is a way that I don't particularly agree and that's the thing I don't agree in a way with

08:36.920 --> 08:47.160
one of the most influential existentialists of the world and of history because well Sartre never

08:47.160 --> 08:53.800
never did any clinical practice never studied the development of of the humankind and how we

08:53.800 --> 09:04.520
come from a newborn to to something so there is in a sense a well a school of thought that goes

09:04.600 --> 09:13.080
towards that thing okay no we're just a blind a blank canvas and everything it's supplied which

09:14.760 --> 09:21.880
in a certain way has led to to many of the of the serious aspects of of today this idea that

09:21.880 --> 09:30.440
word we're just what we what we choose to be which is maybe not the case we have certain limits and

09:31.400 --> 09:41.080
the the development that the development of let's say the cognitive functions are of course

09:42.440 --> 09:53.960
rooted on on the body so the the basic idea of Sartre might have been mistaken in a certain way

09:53.960 --> 10:01.240
but but it surely has done some some good things for the for the confrontation of ideas which is in

10:01.240 --> 10:06.600
fact the the basic concept we have here and and that we can talk about all those things

10:08.760 --> 10:21.640
so the so the idea would be that that the that the the the existentialists of the post-war

10:21.640 --> 10:31.480
world war focused on the let's say phenomenology of the understanding of the humankind trying to

10:31.480 --> 10:41.000
incorporate the subjective experience of the of the of the person to the understanding of

10:41.000 --> 10:49.880
reality which is in fact up until today the the basic framework of of existential psychotherapy

10:49.880 --> 10:58.760
phenomenology existential phenomenology so it's a very interesting concept which changed a lot of

10:58.760 --> 11:10.280
the of the way we thought of of the humankind and in fact it's well very unique in its perspective

11:10.680 --> 11:22.840
I'm not saying Sartre just said no so far along he he had many many great great ideas for example

11:22.840 --> 11:32.600
the idea of hell which is not a new idea in itself but I don't know and please correct me if I'm not

11:33.560 --> 11:39.480
saying that the title of the name correct and in the right way it's behind closed doors

11:40.440 --> 11:50.760
might have been or something like that in Spanish it's no exit in English no exit okay

11:51.560 --> 12:00.520
that idea of the Sartre and hell which is not no other thing than the people others which is

12:01.480 --> 12:08.280
very unique and I can understand why he might might be able to to to think that way

12:09.160 --> 12:15.640
but he missed the idea that the others are also the ones that introduce us to the world so this

12:15.640 --> 12:26.840
idea that we come in in in a blank canvas is well to say the least naive in fact he even said

12:26.840 --> 12:36.120
towards the end of his career and his life that he he gave little importance to the material

12:36.120 --> 12:46.600
aspects of of human of human experience which is again a very very same thing to do to be able

12:46.600 --> 12:56.360
to see the the errors of our past but the idea would be that these questions the questions of

12:57.400 --> 13:05.320
death meaning uh freedom Sartre is very much into into freedom this that the the whole

13:07.480 --> 13:13.880
excess of freedom we have comes with with an angst comes with the suffering which is not

13:13.960 --> 13:24.200
of the aspects of of this school of thought so it's all these questions have been since

13:25.080 --> 13:34.200
the the beginning is of humankind so the the existentialism in a sense has been around

13:35.160 --> 13:45.800
well for as long as we are here the questions are and persist so I thinking about about today

13:45.800 --> 13:53.880
I came up with with with a question myself why did we start calling existentialism at least the

13:53.880 --> 14:05.240
formal school of thought after the the world war and I have no good answers sorry but there

14:05.240 --> 14:13.960
there is an aspect that that I think it's crucial that it's that the the questions went further away

14:13.960 --> 14:25.640
from religion than before so the Greeks at least for our western traditions our focus

14:26.280 --> 14:31.640
much more on the Greeks than let's say on on on some other parts of the world

14:33.320 --> 14:42.360
but they they made the same the same questions we do now exactly the same ones

14:43.080 --> 14:50.280
one one could say well we we copied them and and how can it be that we have

14:50.840 --> 15:00.120
haven't got any answers after so so long and and it came to me also a quote from a very good

15:01.880 --> 15:08.680
psycho psychoanalyst and sociologist that's called eric from who said that the

15:08.920 --> 15:17.880
that the technology advances much more than the wisdom we have so the wisdom we possess now

15:17.880 --> 15:25.400
is not at all what what we need because well we're making the same questions as Plato we're

15:25.400 --> 15:35.960
making the same observations as Aristotle and Socrates so one must wonder if if we will ever

15:35.960 --> 15:43.160
if we will ever find the answers and the questions for meaning well what is the meaning of it all

15:44.920 --> 15:51.720
at least my answer is well there is no meaning which might be within the the school of thought

15:51.720 --> 16:00.040
of existentialism that the the the branch of nihilism the nihilist nihilists say that well

16:00.120 --> 16:05.400
there is no apparent meaning and there is no god and there is no nothing that that can

16:05.400 --> 16:12.200
actually give the meaning there i would say there is a smaller branch that says positive

16:12.200 --> 16:18.840
nihilism negative nihilism the negative nihilism would be the the character of of the soyelsky

16:20.120 --> 16:26.760
if if there is no god and there is no immortality then what what well then everything is permitted

16:26.760 --> 16:33.480
in brother scaramosov but there is also the positive nihilism which is okay there is no

16:33.480 --> 16:41.960
meaning at all we are responsible for creating it we are the ones that that give life meaning

16:42.600 --> 16:50.280
which is a powerful thing a very powerful concept to say that we are responsible but it's also a

16:50.280 --> 16:57.560
burden it's also a very very harsh reality that we are responsible for ourselves

16:59.720 --> 17:11.640
so well i think that if you're here now might be because you you you find yourself challenging

17:11.640 --> 17:19.720
those ideas you find yourself wondering all of this because let's face it it's not a very popular

17:19.720 --> 17:25.240
subject all of this you don't go to a party and say okay yeah but what what's the meaning of all of

17:25.240 --> 17:34.600
this i think okay do you all know we're gonna die someday you won't be very much appreciated in the

17:34.600 --> 17:44.440
party so there is a certain element of of uncomfortableness in all of this a very deep

17:44.440 --> 17:52.600
uncomfortableness i would say but it's also charged with with the very profound sense of

17:52.600 --> 18:03.080
wondering and of course i i say to you to your you can you can ask the questions you need but

18:03.080 --> 18:12.600
i think at some point we all have the the the wondering of saying okay but why why is this

18:12.600 --> 18:19.320
the way i live why is this the way it's suffer which is in fact one of the of the tools we use

18:19.320 --> 18:28.600
in psychotherapy we we try and and and get the questions with with a certain sense of of weight

18:28.600 --> 18:38.680
behind them not just the the hollow words again hollow words the words with with nothing behind

18:38.680 --> 18:45.960
them to to find the person asking the right questions or at least the questions that

18:47.480 --> 18:54.600
well they are able to to handle because it's very difficult to to face yourself with a question that

18:55.560 --> 19:08.120
nobody can answer the you and the the ideas and the problems these brings are well

19:10.360 --> 19:18.280
i would say eternal but but it's a very a very weird way of of talking about the human experience

19:18.360 --> 19:22.600
because in fact the the human experience is finite so

19:25.000 --> 19:31.800
i'd say they they will accompany the the the experience of for humankind but we individually

19:32.360 --> 19:40.120
have a very different way of approaching it so i'll go back to to to the idea of the of the

19:40.120 --> 19:53.720
ancients well i also came across i'll i'll take the opportunity to introduce all of the of the

19:53.720 --> 20:02.600
english-speaking audience or participants to um maybe the greatest writer of of argentina which

20:02.600 --> 20:12.120
is Jorge Luis Borges i don't know if you've known him but he's wonderful it's like reading Edgar

20:12.120 --> 20:27.080
Lampeau for for for us by the at the at the last years of his life he was in a project of of having

20:27.080 --> 20:35.240
the the most important hundred books so he took the time to choose each one of them he didn't

20:36.600 --> 20:49.240
didn't complete the the all the collection but he introduced in my in my curiosity one of the

20:49.640 --> 20:59.800
of the most ancient stories the the epic of Gilgamesh which is a very odd a very odd well choice

21:01.720 --> 21:10.600
but in there it's the epic of Gilgamesh is the Sumerian that's a myth a story about a hero

21:11.320 --> 21:19.000
which let's say it simply he he faced a lot of challenges of course but the the most important

21:19.000 --> 21:28.520
aspect is he was searching for immortality and well he didn't make it of course spoilers spoilers

21:28.520 --> 21:39.560
for for a very old book but in a certain way we can see the the question of mortality even before

21:39.640 --> 21:46.680
the Greek civilization in fact the epic of Gilgamesh inspired a lot of the Iliad and the Odyssey so

21:48.440 --> 22:00.120
we find there the the well even the flood yes but also the the the work on hell in hell sorry

22:00.680 --> 22:06.520
in hell that the the hero needs to go to hell to find something

22:07.560 --> 22:14.600
Odysseus did it in the Odyssey Gilgamesh did it in in his epic but I'd like to say that

22:15.240 --> 22:22.440
this this is the point there is something there that that goes beyond the the the basic story

22:22.440 --> 22:29.160
the basic narrative which surrounds it to say okay they were wondering what would it be for someone

22:29.160 --> 22:35.880
to look for immortality in a certain poetic way he found it because well we're we're still talking

22:35.880 --> 22:45.320
about him so good for him but the the question lies there what is mortality and how can we face it

22:46.200 --> 22:53.480
and we're still looking for answers today there is even a whole branch of psychology that's

22:54.440 --> 23:03.000
that that that dedicates itself to the to the people that are dying and well it's very it's very

23:03.000 --> 23:16.120
difficult for us to to to symbolize that so we tried a lot in a lot of ways but we are creatures

23:16.200 --> 23:19.720
of meaning we need meaning in our lives

23:23.080 --> 23:31.800
the in in greek greece in Athens I mentioned the paraitolia and I don't know if it's

23:32.520 --> 23:40.280
perfectly translated english if it's basically that but it's the principle of the brain to look for

23:40.280 --> 23:46.440
patterns and to look for meaning things even if if they are not there which might have been a very

23:46.440 --> 23:56.120
evolutionary edge for us but it's still here with us that we need to look for meaning I always

23:57.000 --> 24:04.520
at least when I work with teenagers I give the I give them the the idea that color in itself

24:04.520 --> 24:09.640
doesn't exist it's like what are you talking about of course it exists I mean look at look

24:09.640 --> 24:15.560
at all the the colors we have here well in fact color is a construction of the of our brain

24:16.200 --> 24:24.360
it's not something let's say objective different animal different eyes see different colors the

24:24.360 --> 24:31.240
colors are the reflection of the light that our eye and our brain are able to produce

24:32.200 --> 24:43.480
but color in itself is not a thing which is very weird but which is again a testament of the

24:43.480 --> 24:51.960
evolutionary presence of meaning in in not only in in our lives but but surrounding us

24:52.200 --> 25:00.360
so they of course it's the it's the strange explanation but it's in fact the way it is

25:01.320 --> 25:07.160
even if we if our experience is nothing like it so

25:08.920 --> 25:16.280
well these ideas go go towards mythology in mythology at least

25:17.240 --> 25:23.960
the one I specialize in which is Greek mythology we find a lot of the of the problems of

25:23.960 --> 25:36.040
existentialism so it's like existentialism is a new branch of of philosophy why would it be so

25:36.040 --> 25:45.800
present over so many things so so long ago written and it's like well yeah because existentialism

25:45.800 --> 26:00.040
has been around forever and there is a certain strange parallelism in in the idea of psychoanalysis

26:00.040 --> 26:09.320
of conscious and conscious and in that's that's very well established in in mythology and philosophy

26:09.320 --> 26:17.560
in the ancient world on one hand the idea of rationality as the great means of understanding

26:17.560 --> 26:25.560
the universe and ourselves and in a certain way mythology just came around and saying that these

26:25.560 --> 26:34.040
are the ways we we understand the world and ourselves so the the great hero of Greek mythology

26:34.040 --> 26:42.600
might be Odysseus the only mortal one the only purely mortal that he suffered a lot and there we

26:42.600 --> 26:52.440
find one of the aspects that I think actually defines existentialism that life is is tragedy

26:53.000 --> 26:59.800
and there's nothing we can do about it of course we can we have all the techniques and

26:59.800 --> 27:07.720
on all them the the technology that allows us to live quite comfortable we're not very hungry so often

27:07.720 --> 27:15.080
we're not very cold so often we have the entertainment we have medicine yet there's

27:15.080 --> 27:25.480
nothing we can do with the existential dilemmas and it comes to to mind now sorry if I if I keep on

27:25.480 --> 27:39.000
bringing stuff the the the the soma of all of no sorry all no 1980 no brave new world hoaxly

27:40.920 --> 27:43.320
where the the drug that's just

27:43.720 --> 27:52.600
implicated let's say or decreased all the the the suffering in in oneself and it's like

27:53.960 --> 28:00.680
if we could do that if we had a drug which we have plenty of them but none that that are so

28:01.640 --> 28:11.400
so at least so effective should we do it should we release the world from the suffering and even

28:12.120 --> 28:18.760
if we if we can wouldn't there be a lot of people that think okay but what if I just

28:19.800 --> 28:26.840
bring this down if I burn this up if I punch this this person so

28:29.720 --> 28:39.880
it's another well paradox of existentialism it's suffering something we need to avoid there is

28:39.880 --> 28:49.240
something that makes us who we are and in a certain way psychology deals with the suffering

28:49.240 --> 29:00.360
with psychopathology and of course I'd say that again sorry sorry Saturday that that I

29:01.080 --> 29:07.640
that I criticized him so much he he knew nothing of psychopathology I don't know if you're aware

29:07.640 --> 29:18.200
that he even tried to introduce a he hated Freud he absolutely detested him and

29:20.840 --> 29:29.800
there is a movie in the 1960s Freud the secret passion I think it's called that Sartre wrote the

29:30.760 --> 29:37.400
the first draft of the of the movie well the director said no this this just puts Freud in a

29:37.400 --> 29:50.040
in a horrible position why would you do that that script was discarded but he tried to introduce a

29:50.040 --> 29:57.160
psychoanalysis even called existential psychoanalysis which denied the idea of the unconscious

29:57.160 --> 30:06.280
now the unconscious is still today debated a lot even if we at least here in Argentina

30:06.840 --> 30:16.280
psychoanalysis is quite popular and not so in in in Europe or other countries I found myself

30:16.280 --> 30:24.840
seeing that in Athens which I later called upon say okay you're leaving behind a very useful tool

30:25.800 --> 30:33.160
that might be able to explain a lot of what's going on so the

30:35.720 --> 30:43.080
the the ancient idea of of the search for meaning is later present in in religion

30:43.080 --> 30:48.200
that the constitution of of the the big religions we have today as answers

30:48.440 --> 30:57.240
for the the the search for meaning what does in a certain way religion do

30:58.120 --> 31:04.760
it gives you the the certainty of what happens beyond death wonderful like now you know

31:05.320 --> 31:15.080
this is what happens and every religion gives an answer so religion is quite useful in that way

31:15.880 --> 31:21.800
to to to release ourselves from the the despair that can come from us

31:23.320 --> 31:29.640
also gives you okay this is the way you live this is the way you need to to to conduct yourself

31:29.640 --> 31:39.080
which is again very useful and even even though in psychoanalysis Freud was very harsh on religion

31:39.720 --> 31:47.400
he recognized the the usefulness it had maybe he was too

31:49.080 --> 31:57.640
too naive to see that it's not about rationality the the thing of religion it's about much more

31:57.640 --> 32:02.760
and it gives much more even today of course european

32:02.760 --> 32:12.440
and it's going a little further away from religion as people are even more educated but

32:13.560 --> 32:20.040
the the rest of the world is another experience and we see we see it in the in the conflicts

32:20.040 --> 32:30.120
we're having right now at least in the the middle east so these things are still present

32:31.080 --> 32:40.520
the war is still present in in the in the in the world we we have it's like no but the the

32:40.520 --> 32:47.960
greeks were from war to war well that's not the greeks that's humankind we just go from one thing

32:47.960 --> 32:54.680
to another and we can even count the years in the world that there were no wars at all which are

32:54.680 --> 33:04.520
very few so the the existential dilemmas are still here and they have practical

33:05.160 --> 33:16.440
aspects to it there is even the the the idea of what do we do with the with the intolerance

33:17.400 --> 33:29.000
and you you guys over over europe are much much closer to the wars than i am but there is a specific

33:29.000 --> 33:36.360
aspect of saying okay what do we do do we fight for survival or are we able to to just talk about it

33:37.080 --> 33:48.680
what you do and there is no no talk no talk available so there is a in these there are

33:48.680 --> 33:58.760
also very practical aspects in fact i think of another another story

33:59.320 --> 34:10.520
written by by camus which takes the concept or the concept of sycophers i don't know if if all

34:10.520 --> 34:16.280
of you know who sycophers is but he's a character from greek mythology that that

34:17.720 --> 34:25.160
cheated on death on two occasions and after that he was condemned by the gods to

34:25.160 --> 34:36.680
to well to tartarus the hell of the of the weak world he was condemned to to carry a huge rock

34:37.720 --> 34:45.160
onto the top of the mountain and at the end of the day exhausted he saw how it rolled over all over

34:45.160 --> 34:54.040
again so that he was he had to to go again and again so he was condemned to meaninglessness

34:55.080 --> 35:01.800
he was condemned to the labor and to the effort without any reward at all so

35:05.320 --> 35:14.360
camus many many years after takes that story to talk about suicide to talk about meaning

35:14.360 --> 35:21.160
and to talk about a very difficult aspect of reality that's saying okay why don't we kill

35:21.160 --> 35:29.480
ourselves so he said all the questions of philosophy are on second place towards the

35:29.480 --> 35:36.760
question of suicide because on that we find ourselves asking okay what makes me want to

35:36.760 --> 35:45.320
live the life i have so it's a very again don't talk about suicide on parties because that's no

35:49.560 --> 35:57.480
it's not an easy an easy subject yet it's a very important subject so it's a very very

35:58.040 --> 36:11.080
when the the helpful organization talks about that they they they of course they give them the

36:11.080 --> 36:19.480
thing the certain importance yet they struggle to to talk about it and just and to find the

36:20.440 --> 36:26.920
the real reasons why people do it because it's a very difficult aspect and and a very difficult

36:26.920 --> 36:37.160
thing to to understand it's a very personal experience so well it's of course alarming that

36:37.160 --> 36:45.720
that's almost one million of people are committed suicide a year according to the statistics but

36:46.360 --> 36:54.120
it's also a very important thing to talk about because that's the maybe one of the most existential

36:54.760 --> 37:03.240
problems we have because it faces us with with with our condition and why would someone choose

37:03.240 --> 37:13.320
that there is i remember when i was working at um at the public hospital that i i discussed this

37:13.320 --> 37:20.200
with a colleague of mine saying all suicide is psychopathological because of course we can we

37:21.160 --> 37:29.160
can see with someone with depression someone maybe with schizophrenia but it's all suicide like that

37:31.640 --> 37:41.400
and it's a very at least i haven't come upon the the question any other any other place other

37:41.800 --> 37:51.800
other myself but it's um well it's very difficult to face those those problems so

37:52.840 --> 38:00.520
oh we tend to avoid them and we can avoid them particularly in our societies which are

38:02.120 --> 38:11.080
meant to distract us there is a very good book of Vargas Llosa sorry another Latin American writer

38:11.560 --> 38:17.400
and it's called the the the civilization of entertainment she's very good

38:18.680 --> 38:23.400
very simple to to read maybe the translation should be should be good enough

38:26.120 --> 38:36.920
but we can avoid it for so long for it punches us in the face because because we at least well

38:37.160 --> 38:43.800
not all of us will have to face death at some point maybe not ourselves but yes and the people

38:43.800 --> 38:53.320
we love we will have to to deal with suffering one way or another so this idea that the the world

38:53.320 --> 39:01.000
decides a nice place where we should be comfortable might be very detrimental for us might be very

39:01.000 --> 39:17.400
very very false which in a in a certain way comes to the to the to the to the to the fight

39:17.480 --> 39:25.320
of of ideas very barely poorly equipped so

39:28.360 --> 39:36.840
well i think of of the of the buddhist one of the of the four noble truths of buddhism

39:37.160 --> 39:46.600
life is suffering and that's again we go to the antiquity we go to towards

39:47.320 --> 39:55.480
the the these three fathers of thought which were socrates confucius and the buddha

39:56.360 --> 40:04.840
which changed the way we understood things but none of them said that life is something

40:05.800 --> 40:13.320
nice and something comfortable and something that that's a gift from the gods in fact they

40:13.320 --> 40:23.800
they socrates well criticized a lot and and with good with good ideas the socratic method is still

40:23.800 --> 40:34.680
present in us in our psychotherapy so the the the ideas of buddha and confucius all come to a

40:34.920 --> 40:40.600
the questions of existentialism what should we do with our life how do we deal with death

40:40.600 --> 40:50.600
how do we deal with suffering and are so inextricably linked with the with with ourselves that

40:51.320 --> 40:59.240
we find that it's worth exploring all of these things even if we have no answer

40:59.960 --> 41:07.720
and of course if you are here you are interested in one way or another for all of this and that

41:08.600 --> 41:17.640
the the the the the basic idea of existentialism which in this in this sort of activities and

41:17.640 --> 41:26.440
and channels and and the the offerings is a a wonderful place to to explore this and to

41:27.000 --> 41:34.920
at least feel that the suffering we might have is not unique to us because that that's

41:34.920 --> 41:44.200
another thing that within the the psychotherapy sphere we try and deal that the person comes

41:44.200 --> 41:52.040
saying okay i suffer i suffer specifically my suffering is unique and to a certain point it is

41:53.000 --> 41:59.080
but certain aspects of that are absolutely

42:01.480 --> 42:04.600
shared between us so

42:07.640 --> 42:11.640
my my ideas would be to to

42:14.600 --> 42:21.640
to find the way of of asking this to find and to find places where we can talk about all of this

42:22.840 --> 42:30.920
maybe there are some some very good guidance in all of these things and in fact we can even

42:30.920 --> 42:40.840
help help other people in this network of existential branching for the for the difficult

42:40.840 --> 42:49.240
aspects of life because i guaranteed you know someone who's struggling with all of this if not

42:49.240 --> 43:02.520
yourself and that struggling is in a certain way the the the core aspect of of the greek idea

43:02.520 --> 43:09.560
that there's a tragedy that's why they invented tragedy then came the romans that made them the

43:09.560 --> 43:16.040
circus with the with the coliseum and the the entertainment of death but the greeks and i

43:16.040 --> 43:23.240
think we have a mixture of greek and roman that's why we have i don't know the world cup and that's

43:23.240 --> 43:30.040
fantastic as it is it's so it's purely entertainment and but also we have the tragedy

43:30.040 --> 43:38.680
we have the the movies and we have the the the art that connects us with that part of of ourselves

43:39.400 --> 43:53.080
so i hope nobody nobody has has fallen into a silent despair but yes that we can we can

43:53.080 --> 43:59.320
hear you and see what what you have to say about all of this of course there's a lot to

44:00.280 --> 44:08.120
to to learn about ancient times and i think those three figures are a wonderful way of starting

44:08.680 --> 44:19.560
i also recommend um uh called jaspers then that he talks about all of these three figures uh no no

44:19.560 --> 44:28.680
i think he changes socrates for jesus so he talks about the figure those those three figures us and

44:29.000 --> 44:43.160
as um as a way of understanding who we are so uh i think it's uh it's later over there but i hope

44:44.360 --> 44:53.640
everyone's uh wondering at least my idea would be that we we share questions not the the answers

44:53.640 --> 44:59.240
because of course this is not a lecture that i have the the absolute truth and in fact it's

44:59.880 --> 45:07.800
more of the of the experience we have and the and the the the ways we have of understanding

45:07.800 --> 45:19.160
ourselves and our lives and the and the spaces we we uh we're in even if it's work family

45:19.720 --> 45:29.080
and the these sort of places but how can we apply certain things of this towards the the

45:30.040 --> 45:32.040
the concrete aspects of our lives

45:38.600 --> 45:42.520
i think if any if anybody if anybody um

45:43.000 --> 45:51.960
um uh finds finds yourself uh wondering how can we connect over this of course it's a very good

45:51.960 --> 46:01.000
thing if you if you can talk and and say um i hope nobody's uh dizzy with all the the the

46:01.000 --> 46:06.040
concepts and the ideas sorry if i if i branch too much

46:06.440 --> 46:13.560
no it was exciting to follow all of the different branches and go on such a journey

46:14.520 --> 46:21.560
in in my own thinking and our own thinking but then throughout history and just um i'm gonna

46:21.560 --> 46:27.800
reiterate what what marcos is saying let's make this a discussion let's make this a questioning

46:27.800 --> 46:33.320
a shared questioning together um and i think the question that comes for me or the kind of

46:33.320 --> 46:40.200
discussion that exploration that comes for me is what you say about clients coming to us or

46:40.200 --> 46:48.360
people coming to us or even for ourselves that in that moment our suffering feels like the most

46:49.160 --> 46:58.520
unique and extreme experience of suffering that could exist and even as therapists even as coaches

46:58.520 --> 47:06.360
even as reflective and intelligent beings that know that statistically historically that's not

47:06.360 --> 47:15.400
the case but still somehow there's that sense that big sense if we're being approached or

47:15.400 --> 47:20.440
confronting something in the future or in the moment or in the past that's incredibly difficult

47:20.440 --> 47:27.800
for us that we are isolated in it um i suppose i don't want to speak for ages i would love for

47:27.800 --> 47:33.720
other people to jump in can i can i ask yeah yeah tony go so lovely to see you and thank you so

47:33.720 --> 47:44.520
much for doing these things awesome i mean i've had um i've in my life i've had five suicide

47:44.520 --> 47:54.360
friends which i think is an exception of suicide friends and um the impact of that is may and i

47:54.360 --> 48:02.120
you know i'm a deep absurdist or existentialist and you know my my question on a daily basis is

48:02.120 --> 48:12.200
really is about resilience and opposing forces to this absurdity because i mean if you know i think

48:12.200 --> 48:19.960
we all get that it's absurd um i think that you know every time i read lots of stuff i resonate

48:19.960 --> 48:26.680
more than you can ever believe but i think the question is how to live an absurdity in a way

48:26.680 --> 48:36.680
that um is nourishing and uh as a you know i'm a pathologist by training so so i mean you know

48:36.680 --> 48:43.720
i'm a hard-nosed scientist so the question always is is you know we know we know what we know if you

48:43.720 --> 48:49.080
like the complexity of of of these questions but what's the antidote

48:54.680 --> 49:00.200
two things come come to mind of course sisyphus and and the and the absurd

49:00.280 --> 49:02.840
but

49:05.400 --> 49:15.800
the the the existential branch of thought comes a bit against the idea the rationality can can

49:15.800 --> 49:22.760
read us of all the problems we have so that that's where the the subjective aspect comes from

49:23.560 --> 49:32.760
and in a certain way there is no antidote at least not an antidote that can work for everyone

49:33.880 --> 49:43.240
because meaning is a very personal experience so nobody can well you can try and impose meaning

49:43.240 --> 49:52.120
on others you can try and say okay look this works for me try it but that doesn't assure you that

49:52.200 --> 50:01.160
that it will work so it's a very very close relationship you have with with suicide the

50:01.160 --> 50:11.240
absurd i don't think many people acknowledge the absurdity of all because it's a very difficult

50:11.240 --> 50:22.600
thing to to digest it's it's very it leaves us very naked onto the world so that's where the

50:22.600 --> 50:30.600
the subjective tools come in at least my faith goes towards the person goes to work towards

50:30.600 --> 50:37.160
the individual so one question just because then i'll i'll chat up because i could talk for england

50:37.160 --> 50:46.760
um nisha our lovely nisha who we love so much um the famous camel hypothesis you know you know

50:46.760 --> 50:54.280
which i i pretty much love actually i i use it every day i mean i suppose my question is is is

50:54.280 --> 51:03.240
the camel a desensitized absurdist and tony can i ask you to explain the camel for people that don't

51:03.720 --> 51:11.320
well yeah sorry sorry i mean the camel is you know in in um nisha thought and it's quite

51:11.320 --> 51:19.320
close to go to actually the the camel um you know he believed that four metamorphosis of man was the

51:19.320 --> 51:26.440
camel first then the camel becomes a lion the lion slays the dragon and the dragon becomes the child

51:26.440 --> 51:33.800
so he he basically said that uh and i know it's very interesting because you use the word all

51:33.800 --> 51:40.840
dyshuxley who i love um i mean and you you use the word who i mean was it all dyshuxley or was it

51:40.840 --> 51:47.000
the the other guy who came up with the term the proletariat so let's use the word the proletariat

51:47.000 --> 51:54.600
that nisha came up with the idea the proletariat were camors and that they had desensitized themselves

51:54.600 --> 52:00.760
to this absurdity and then in came the lions that were trying to transform who were absolutely

52:00.760 --> 52:08.360
naked to that absurdity tried to slay the slay the dragon and then became the child so i mean you

52:08.360 --> 52:15.000
know there there is a question i have on a daily basis in my own world of which so many people seem

52:15.000 --> 52:21.960
to be happy and absurdity that distresses me really but i'll shut up on that one maybe otherwise

52:21.960 --> 52:31.320
i might talk for england well remember that the the camel needs to give way to the lion the lion

52:31.320 --> 52:38.760
then to the child uh we're talking about the spoke saratustra which is a very good book

52:39.880 --> 52:48.520
very recommended possible but yeah might might be difficult but but it but but within it the

52:49.320 --> 52:52.280
all the concepts of nature and

52:54.600 --> 53:01.960
in a certain way he needs to talks about the camel as as a metaphor for the animal that's

53:01.960 --> 53:09.720
that's very very harsh and able to to support a lot of weight in fact that's the the idea

53:09.720 --> 53:18.920
that the camel carries the weight of of the hump onto itself which gives him or if sorry

53:18.920 --> 53:26.120
the the chance to survive the desert would give him the chance to to to live but then it needs to

53:26.120 --> 53:33.720
change uh the the it was a very very accurate idea that the last metamorphosis of the child

53:34.280 --> 53:41.480
because the child plays because the child creates and because the child is in a certain way

53:45.000 --> 53:52.680
all potential so the idea of of getting rid of of god was not in in

53:54.440 --> 53:58.520
talking about this idea of god is dead and we have killed him

53:59.080 --> 54:08.840
and to be able to create and to create our own morality our own way of living makes us the

54:08.840 --> 54:20.280
the ubermanche makes us the ultra ultra man i don't know in english um yeah the ubermanche

54:20.280 --> 54:34.440
the ubermanche uh if if um i would say that i i agree in a certain sense with with barter and

54:34.440 --> 54:44.840
rassel one of the of the great um the philosophers of great britain uh he says i i think in an

54:44.840 --> 54:52.040
in an essay about nature that we should we should always listen to him but be very careful to follow

54:52.040 --> 55:01.400
him because the idea of the government doesn't consider the idea of others with us doesn't

55:01.400 --> 55:07.560
consider the idea that we can build our own morality for ourselves because we we're never

55:07.560 --> 55:17.000
on us alone i i go to to add his total again the only ones who don't need others are the beasts

55:17.000 --> 55:25.640
or the gods all of us we need we need the other and that's also the the the idea of

55:26.600 --> 55:34.040
but why but why i would love to go to a dinner party with all of you and talk about suicide

55:34.040 --> 55:40.280
but why why are we so different to the camel

55:43.480 --> 55:51.800
we meaning who this group who are here is a representative of existential

55:52.520 --> 55:54.600
thinkers or behaviors or whatever

55:58.840 --> 56:04.360
what makes you think we're we're so different from the camel well maybe we are firing things

56:04.360 --> 56:12.520
the reason i i think is because i'm a biologist and i i see that groups of societies have such

56:12.520 --> 56:19.400
clusters of different if you like types who are there with a different job our job is to

56:20.120 --> 56:27.240
agitate society really and that's well i'll go i'll go back to the

56:29.160 --> 56:35.160
do you remember the the the cave allegory of Plato yeah yeah the

56:37.480 --> 56:43.960
do you remember why they chose to stay chained and and to see the shadows no because

56:44.920 --> 56:54.440
because seeing the truth because facing all these things is extremely difficult and not all of us

56:54.440 --> 57:04.760
are prepared and well one would say also with with the haxley idea why would someone

57:05.720 --> 57:15.480
uh anesthetize himself and we do it all the time we're not we're not exempt of the suffering

57:15.480 --> 57:25.080
these entails so it's a very difficult thing and we try and be children in a certain way in

57:25.080 --> 57:34.680
in an extreme way but it's difficult and might be that at some point we are camels and some

57:34.680 --> 57:42.200
point we're lions and some point we're children and some points we are we are just too tired to

57:42.200 --> 57:56.520
face all of this so um it's it's a a a strange way this idea of of facing all of this that's why

57:57.240 --> 58:04.840
well in many ways religion is still very very disseminated across the world

58:05.000 --> 58:14.360
um very helpful in many ways because it's uh i would not say impossible but extremely hard

58:14.360 --> 58:24.440
to think of everything ourselves we need to rely on the on to to to stand on the shoulders of giants

58:25.320 --> 58:31.000
umberto eco has a very good book about that that's called on the shoulders of giants

58:31.480 --> 58:38.600
no i need to us because we need we we rely on on on the ones that came before

58:39.560 --> 58:46.360
and that's why the idea would be they can still teach us a lot but we need to look further and if

58:46.360 --> 58:53.880
we can't see further it's because they made the the much of the hard work i don't know what the

58:53.960 --> 59:01.400
world would be without the greeks i think i mean um i can't remember the author but

59:02.760 --> 59:11.800
but he talked about the the battle of marathon as uh maybe the the most important event on the

59:11.800 --> 59:19.960
history of western civilization because if they if the Athenians had lost that battle the world

59:19.960 --> 59:27.240
would be a lot different and democracy would have would have let's say um died in its infancy

59:28.680 --> 59:39.320
so uh yeah i i think i got i got carried away but um why people thank you for not to thank you for

59:39.320 --> 59:50.120
the dialogue i'd love that no but but the but i i i'd say i find it much more interesting

59:50.120 --> 59:58.680
why would someone face these things rather than than be anesthetized it's it's uh i think that

59:58.680 --> 01:00:05.480
question is much more uh much more relevant why would someone choose to face all of this

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.840
when they can just immerse themselves in i don't know football politics even religion

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:22.440
that gives you the answers there is a in psychoanalysis we we talk about uh sorry if the translation

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:31.320
is not correct uh not the fault and how would you say if when something is missing in you

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:47.480
um devoid devoid yeah it's not exactly void uh it's like the the castrate castrated when

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:59.560
and something is missing let's just call it the the missing fanaticism and and Freud makes a very

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:09.720
good case of this fanaticism compensates the missing so you um and and the missing might very well be

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:21.000
the meaning in life and that's a a missing that cannot be undone cannot we cannot um we cannot

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:32.280
uh successfully um equilibrate equilibrated or balance it so of course the the fanaticism

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:44.360
supports in religion remember the thing of of the void it might be the void i have to look

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:49.720
for the translation i've never read Freud in english which would be a very interesting experience

01:01:50.440 --> 01:02:02.760
and the the fanaticism is the compensation of that we we we feel that void with with that

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:14.520
with our team with our church with our values and much of the artistic aspects of the of the child

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:23.960
goes towards that children find themselves playing with with let's say an empty box

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.080
and they have have a wonderful time but adults we say but it's just a box

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:41.160
that doesn't matter the children create in in the void in the absence of and maybe that's

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:49.160
where we at least the ones that approach these ideas go towards we create where there is none

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:57.560
we we make ourselves answers where there is no answer at all and that's very difficult that's

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:09.160
might be uh very very harsh on on or heavy but in a certain way these places are wonderful for that

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.960
to say that we all are asking the same questions what can we do with that

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:25.160
so i don't know if it's i i don't have a very optimistic answers for this at least not in the

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:33.000
in the existential department um but but yeah um i hope it answers a little bit of the question

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.840
yeah thank you welcome you're welcome

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:48.520
can i ask you something where do you place the human encounter

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:59.160
in encounter meeting of two persons the social encounter yeah yeah in in this

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:10.200
uh in this difficult process of of trying to deal with existence or yeah

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:22.120
or the void or whatever or so yeah you say the child creates in the absence of things you know

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:30.280
so and maybe that's easier than than to create by means of the human relationship

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.160
that's that's why it's so difficult to relate maybe you know

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.120
maybe there's the truth in there or something i don't know so the topic of of human encounter

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:51.960
does it has a place in this in this existentialistic position uh yeah

01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:08.600
i think the i think it was in the in the 80s or the 70s in tokyo there was um a very big problem

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:18.840
with suicides of young men so the government consults with a group of psychologists and the

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:27.240
psychologists suggest that uh as the as the means of suicide was the train to jump onto the train

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.240
that they put mirrors on the other side of the of the train of the of the of the

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:43.480
the the place where the train of the rails yeah the idea was that that would give the the man

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:53.480
like a shock of narcissism to say okay no i look at myself and and i choose not to jump

01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:01.960
well that didn't work of course why because the mirror is never the mirror literally

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:09.080
the mirror we see ourselves by other relationships we have at the others at the encounters

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:20.280
and the it was like a very literal way of understanding humankind

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:30.840
so the encounter is not only necessary is the thing that makes us who we are

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:38.520
if if nobody was there to receive you when you were a newborn you would die or even if

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:50.040
he if they give you the food and the shelter you would still die because i think it's called white

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:59.960
death um the the that happened i think it was started in poland uh at a certain war

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:08.280
where many of the adults when were killed and many babies were left at the care of very few people

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.680
and they gave them the shelter and the warmth and the and the food but they gave them no more

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:25.160
attention than they needed there was no let's say sorry for the word erotic eroticization of

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:32.920
the subjectivity of the of the psychic apparatus so there wasn't like no will to live

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:43.560
so yeah the the encounter is is what makes us who we are that's why sartre says that the hell is

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:49.240
others because they are very capable of torturing ourselves but they are also capable of saving

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.560
and that's where he missed he just saw the the the negative aspect of the encounter

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:10.040
and yeah existentialism is always about people never in solitude we we might suffer in solitude

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:21.960
but dilemmas are shared the the problems are uh well very much uh faced together that's at least

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:29.560
one of the the core ideas of psychotherapy but another an encounter can help you face things

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:38.600
that you could not face before that's why they approach us or or anyone and that's a

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.240
a very powerful encounter at least when you click when you have the

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.400
for chemistry with your with your therapist it's a wonderful experience

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:56.040
so yeah the encounter is uh central it's like the antidote we found the antidote

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:02.200
it might might be for for tony i like that one

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.800
yeah well we need it we need it my friend we need it i begin to like tony yeah

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:21.240
well we'll we'll be there together okay well that that's uh well that that came from an encounter

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.600
so yeah the the answer in action

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.560
and anna says in the chat all we need is love and a smiley face

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.880
well yeah

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.920
i don't know if he was so catchy all we need is meaning snub so

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.680
yeah not so so phonetically attractive

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.320
if frankle was in the Beatles that was his thing

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:18.520
so uh it's um of course the the ideas would be uh would forth uh very very well in much more

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:27.000
time and much more uh uh deep analysis of of the the Greek culture and of the

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:35.960
Buddhism and the ideas they have and there is a lot of analysis we can make of all of this

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:45.560
even the the bible has a lot of extension uh aspects to it it's after all well very very

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:55.960
inspired in in Greek ideas but that's the the the the the book that

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.960
the western civilization was built upon so of course it's in a certain way

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:11.080
filled with ideas we can connect not because of the of the truth of the idea i don't know if

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:20.440
i don't believe adam and eve are a literal and a literal story about how we come to be

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:27.640
but yes that it has a certain metaphors we must remember that we are symbolic creatures

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:35.320
the words we use are metaphors if i speak of a tree the word tree means nothing

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.800
if we have the meaning shed that's where the metaphor applies and and we understand each other

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:50.120
so through metaphors and through the stories as well as and i think that's the idea of the Greeks

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:58.040
they understood that that the metaphors on the on the myth and the philosophy uh could coexist

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:09.960
and in fact did in there but and as as tony said well biology and science is so wonderful too

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:21.720
the problem is and i find it's a very very funny question for me that can science answer all the

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:29.960
questions it's a question that can't be answered but by science because science can't deal with

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:39.320
everything i think that's a tremendous question um but i mean one just one one with this thing

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.160
do you think that many humans are suppressed existentialists

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.160
what do you mean what what do you mean by suppressed

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:59.720
well conformity has has erased their questioning

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.400
well that's that's education for you formal education because i mean i i have a children's

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:17.720
book that my grandchild had and i think that the modern children books are moving away from

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:26.680
metaphor to literal so it's a bit like you know oh i i agree and and it's you wonder whether what's

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:34.360
going to happen is that we're going to suppress a lot of it in um in banality which i think is a

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:49.480
very interesting word well i see it as well i i um in this couple of years of days i saw news

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:03.080
that in the simpsons um the new episodes of the simpsons will not have a Homer strangling Bart

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:10.760
yeah because oh no you can't show this because the children and i was like

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:21.160
that's that's uh an interesting take on that that that that we we lose the idea of that that's

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:30.120
a cartoon that's not that the people go struggling people because they see Homer uh so it was like

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:36.680
that's like going towards the most literal of the of the readings you can make of that

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:45.560
and and in a certain way the most simplistic and superficial idea of that of course it's a

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:53.880
it's a funny example but i agree that we are losing metaphor we are losing the idea that words

01:14:54.520 --> 01:15:03.880
are complex things they're not defined they're not um they're not written in stone like saying

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:12.360
okay god means peace well it depends on where you are and what context and what place and and

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:22.440
how you use the word so uh yeah i i agree with the diagnosis that we are we are becoming more

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:33.320
literal at or at least they they are trying to they like who they are i think it's a lot based on

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:43.320
ideology and a way of thinking of people and our children specifically but it happens over there

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:56.520
and happens here in in argentina as well uh literality is quite uh i would say it's like they

01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:04.440
they don't give the child the chance to to fall it's like everything everything is controlled and

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:14.440
and uh it's it's um no good that they struggle because when you introduce something to a child

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:21.480
well they can repeat the word but they don't quite understand the concept the abstract idea

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:30.120
yet uh it's a struggle they have to make to to to keep incorporating things

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:41.480
so the the idea of the literality is is very yeah i would say it's poisonous enough

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:49.080
as it is to not make people think very very deeply thinking has never been easy

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:58.360
has never been economically friendly uh in the in the in the in the sense of the of the brain the

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:08.520
brain itself it's quite lazy it tries it tries to deal with with everything even information

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:18.760
as as efficiently as possible so it's it is going against the current against the the the the the

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:28.120
waves but i think it's a fight that's worth giving to try and think i don't think it's a

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:35.240
very good very good pathway not to think about things and not to connect with things because

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:42.520
it's not only that you lose the the the capacity to think abstractly of complex ideas but you also

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:51.800
lose the ability to connect with the emotions to go within so and and that's even more difficult to

01:17:52.680 --> 01:18:03.640
to counter weight and because they they they chop off the the possibility of um well of connecting

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:12.440
with with the high emotions and powerful emotions but also with harsh emotions so uh that's part of

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:25.560
life the both extremes i hope everyone leaves here with many questions

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:39.000
it's it's interesting because we came in thinking about ancient existential thinking and kind of

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.400
following it questioning its trajectory but this part of the conversation is quite disturbing to

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:53.320
think of where that future will go you know it can we get to the point as if if existential ideas

01:18:53.320 --> 01:19:00.920
started at the start of human civilization is the trajectory that we're following that eventually

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:07.640
we won't question are we are we questioning less deeply i mean it's it's kind of mind blowing to

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:15.480
think that i think generally speaking the the like you've been saying the the value in storytelling

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:23.240
the value in myth the value in arts the value in performance all of this has been replaced by other

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:32.520
value systems that have just been you know really really shoved into the the faces and the psyches

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:39.960
of the population and uh you know it's it's not a comfortable thought it's quite an oppressive

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:47.640
thought to think where does that where does that go from here but you you might want to think what

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:57.480
what are we doing here today aren't we uh trying to to deal with with some aspects of the of the

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:08.280
human reality in a in a deep way and in a deep uh and and uh yeah maybe disturbing idea that's why

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:16.520
the the the dystopian authors are so so interesting to me because they show a part of the of the

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:25.000
reality which could come to be i mean i i love the t-shirt that's saying of orwell that says

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:35.640
i told you so i think that's brilliant i i warned you guys not with with much anticipation

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:48.520
and we we have a constantly news about the state of of um double thought i i i i i saw in england

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:55.800
those uh interesting news that police goes to your to your place if you don't have the

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:02.440
right idea if you protest against something that's not you should not be protested against

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:13.800
so it's well that's orwellian all right and and that's why thinking has always been problematic

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:25.080
but uh at least in a in a in a community way this is a very powerful thing but also in the

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:35.000
in the in the psychotherapy department is okay think about uh about yourself and who you are

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:47.080
who you want to be who you can be uh so yeah i don't find that that it's more disturbing now

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:53.720
than it was before we've seen atrocities uh all over the the history of humankind

01:21:53.720 --> 01:22:05.160
and maybe the the shock comes with the idea that life should be easy peaceful and and with a

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:15.160
with a with a soft music behind you know life is and and the events of the world have shown that

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:22.600
life is difficult and life is many times unexpected but we need to fight for the

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:29.400
the ideas we stand for and for the things that makes us who we are so yeah

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.120
of course it's disturbing but it's only disturbing if you look at it

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.920
the thing is it's difficult to look and to understand what what do we see that's why people

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.680
who was it Pascal

01:22:52.920 --> 01:23:02.440
that says something like this like it's easier or i don't know it's easier for

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:09.960
for people to to trust what they see in their eyes instead of thinking about it

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:17.880
because one is seeing beyond what you see maybe a little bit connected with the

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:27.160
literality we talked before so it's always been difficult but it's a fight that

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:35.080
uh at least gives meaning at least to me to to keep on with the with the ideas

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.000
that and that these things deserve the the time and deserve our energy

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:54.360
and i think in one way kind of thinking what Tony was saying at the beginning it

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:01.080
there's something you know unified there's something almost courageous to be spending

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:07.640
your life specifically dedicated to exploring these ideas and you were speaking about this

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:12.680
kind of this group of existentialists collecting together today whether that's live or you know

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:21.080
in the in the future viewers but it another side of that argument is everyone to to an

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:28.600
extent everybody is questioning these ideas in their own way and actually finding a community

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:36.360
like we have created and are creating there is there's something a lot easier to be able

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:42.920
to to question in this collective community and have the resources that we do and i think

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:48.520
you know everybody's thinking but where it's almost easier we're almost fortunate to have

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.920
to be thinking about it in this community rather than just flailing around you know

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.120
isolatedly and a lot of my clients come to me because they have been questioning these

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:06.680
questions alone and it's incredibly scary and painful whether that's finding a community within

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.440
an existential philosophy and having those resources or whether that's in music and

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:16.680
collaborating in that way or arts in that way but i remember naturally there was one of your

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.640
that lovely thing you did was it last year when you interviewed all these people and

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:28.120
there was a guy who said um you know that he would go to a dinner party and never leave

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:33.640
not leave if we were talking about this subject i can't remember the name of the guy but it but

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.720
it's very it's almost irony isn't it that we would um we as a group would love a dinner party around

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:49.160
this we would drink all night you wouldn't we wouldn't leave whereas most parties i go to

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.880
i want to be there under 30 seconds and i'm on to delete so isn't it ironic

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:09.400
the remember that not everyone is ready for those questions but once you start it's very

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:19.960
difficult to believe that once you start is almost like there is a point of no return

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:28.840
yeah i love that i love that what what is your drive to continue questioning

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.000
my drive

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.400
at some point why do you why do you look at the disturbing

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:50.280
why do i look at that it's disturbing at the disturbing i mean looking at things

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.040
things are disturbing only when you look at it and you said

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.280
yeah so what's your drive to open yourself to the disturbing

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:10.840
i remember there was a writer that was was asked why does he write

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.520
and he answered because i cannot not do it

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:27.160
and and and i think once you go towards these questions you can't stop you can't i mean it's

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:37.000
very difficult to to uh very difficult or even impossible without any uh huge defense mechanisms

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:45.960
might be crippling defense mechanisms to see something to not see something that you saw

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:55.960
so um i if i can't i cannot stop looking at things but that doesn't mean that

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.440
that i can't appreciate the the wonderful things that are down here look at the the space we have

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:09.640
we have today it's a wonderful thing to be able to communicate from two sides of the world

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:15.320
and to talk about these things of course they are difficult of course they are uncomfortable

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:21.320
but the the alternative is much worse at least for me that's why it's a choice

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.800
and it's a difficult choice and it's a choice that might not be for all

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:36.920
remember that these things are and and the the struggles we have are the same the same as the

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:45.480
ones that uh the Greeks had the the the cave the allegory of the cave is exactly that many

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:51.640
will choose to remain in the cave and there is nothing we can do for them because they they

01:28:51.640 --> 01:29:01.800
have to choose and that's the freedom that's the the exercise of freedom they have even if it's not

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:12.600
for the for the their their benefit that's of course we can we can lament we can we can

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:25.240
we can suffer the idea of them of everyone not seeing something we can't impose that thing on

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:33.080
them that's why at least in psychotherapy it's no use if someone says oh no you should go to therapy

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.960
and and and i'll take you because there is not something personal that the person chooses to work

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:51.320
there i remember in in the public hospital and we had a specific team that dedicated themselves to

01:29:52.280 --> 01:30:00.120
to to traffic yeah so so the people that that came to to renew their licenses need to make a

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:10.200
a psychic test and and have a certain space and i would say no i i don't want them because they

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:15.480
are not patients they don't choose to be there they are forced by the circumstances of their work

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:23.320
and in fact that's the the case they didn't work in therapy they they just it was just a

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:32.200
part of the of the functionality of the the demands that the the the the government made

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:40.920
that's why it's first the desire desire to go there desire to work that's a very good first step

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.640
to therapy

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:56.440
i've got my eye on the time and uh just like you say it's once you start it's very difficult to

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:02.040
stop i think we've all proved the case that it's very difficult to stop this and even when we close

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:09.160
today today's session we'll all be thinking because we really can't stop um but in terms of actual

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:14.920
time we we definitely have to bring it to a close unfortunately but i want to thank absolutely

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.680
everybody thank you so much for for taking the time to come and thank you for everyone that

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:26.840
contributed either just by your presence or just in the chat or or part of the conversation to make

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:32.200
this event what it is it's so nice to have a community i think that's what comes for me today

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:38.040
one of the many things it's so amazing to have this community to explore these questions and um

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:43.880
it wouldn't exist without everybody that makes it so so thank you so much and of course a huge

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:51.160
