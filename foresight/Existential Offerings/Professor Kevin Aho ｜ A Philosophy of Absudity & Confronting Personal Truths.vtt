WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.520
So welcome, Kevin. Thank you so, so much for coming along today. What an amazing way to

00:23.520 --> 00:29.280
start the week. I really appreciate your time here. So for those who are not familiar with

00:29.280 --> 00:38.640
yourself or with your work, how would you introduce yourself? Well, I am Kevin Aho. I'm a professor

00:38.640 --> 00:48.960
of philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University. I've been here in Florida since 2004 at this

00:48.960 --> 00:55.840
university. And I'm also the chair of the Department of Communication and Philosophy

00:55.840 --> 01:04.000
at the university right now. I did, I had kind of a convoluted journey through graduate school.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.720
I started out at the new school for social research in New York City and then moved to

01:10.720 --> 01:16.800
University of Utah and Salt Lake City and then finished up my PhD at the University of South

01:16.800 --> 01:25.520
Florida in Tampa, where I studied with a very important figure in existential philosophy,

01:25.520 --> 01:32.800
an especially Heidegger, a fellow named Charles Guillaume, who sadly passed away this past summer,

01:33.440 --> 01:41.200
but had a long and influential career and taught a lot of students. And so that's that's the brief

01:41.200 --> 01:48.640
condensed version of who I am. And I consider myself a specialist in existential philosophy,

01:49.520 --> 01:56.960
phenomenology of the body, and areas of existential psychotherapy and phenomenological

01:56.960 --> 02:05.520
psychotherapy. Now, phenomenology of the body is not something that I come across people saying

02:05.520 --> 02:14.240
a lot as their specialties. Yeah, yeah, it's a it's a it's a booming field right now. It's

02:14.240 --> 02:22.240
largely indebted to the renewed interest in the work of Maurice Meryl Ponte and some important

02:22.240 --> 02:31.360
and seminal feminist figures, obviously, Simone de Beauvoir, one and Iris Marion Young, another

02:31.360 --> 02:39.360
figure. And it's simply a recognition that the body is not something we have, and that we're

02:39.360 --> 02:47.200
only contingently connected to. It's who we are, we are our bodies, we exist through our bodies,

02:47.200 --> 02:53.360
we live through the vehicle of our bodies. And so it's an attempt to undermine that classic

02:53.360 --> 03:00.320
Cartesian dualism that the human being is composed of two distinct substances and an immaterial mind

03:00.320 --> 03:07.920
in a causally determined body. And phenomenology undoes that dualism in helpful ways.

03:12.480 --> 03:19.680
So you spoke slightly about your your kind of academic journey into this amazing field of

03:19.680 --> 03:26.880
philosophy and of existentialism. But what drew you to want to specialize in existentialism in

03:26.880 --> 03:34.320
the first place? How did you stumble upon this, this particular? Yeah, it's a good question. I came

03:34.320 --> 03:42.320
from a family of intellectuals. My father was a professor of sociology, but mostly kind of German

03:42.320 --> 03:50.400
social theory and was raised, came of age during the counterculture revolution in the 60s and early

03:50.400 --> 03:59.440
70s, when existentialism was all the rage and everyone was carrying around tattered copies of

03:59.440 --> 04:10.480
Camus and Sartre and Beauvoir. And and my parents met in graduate school. And so I was surrounded

04:10.480 --> 04:20.240
by books growing up. And I in my second semester of college, I was actually an engineering major

04:20.240 --> 04:26.880
in college, believe it or not. And the second semester of college, I read Dostoevsky's The

04:26.880 --> 04:35.680
Brothers Karamazov during the winter break. And the book had a transformative impact on me.

04:36.560 --> 04:43.360
And it raised all of these deep existential questions about the meaning of life, the existence of

04:43.360 --> 04:53.840
God, the problems of nihilism, the experiences of anxiety and the face of death. And it awakened

04:53.840 --> 05:00.720
me to the fact that I've had these experiences. I feel this in my everyday life. And I changed

05:00.720 --> 05:07.840
my major to philosophy and never looked back. And many other aspects of philosophy I find

05:08.000 --> 05:15.440
uninteresting and boring, metaphysics and epistemology, even much of ethics, moral philosophy,

05:15.440 --> 05:29.280
I find boring and turgid. But existentialism always inspired me and shaped me. And it has stayed

05:29.280 --> 05:39.120
with me since I was 18 or 19 years old. And I had powerful experiences in my early adulthood and

05:39.120 --> 05:46.240
late adolescence of hanging out with my high school friends, you know, getting high and having a few

05:46.240 --> 05:52.240
beers under the stars, and talking about the meaning of life. And what is it all about? And who are

05:52.240 --> 05:59.280
we? And why are we here? And I realized that those were the questions of the existentials, right?

05:59.280 --> 06:06.400
Those are deep and important existential questions. And unfortunately, as we move into adulthood and

06:06.400 --> 06:13.760
find our way into careers and family life, we oftentimes lose touch with those important

06:13.760 --> 06:20.320
questions. And we kind of drift along in our existence until there's a crisis or a breakdown.

06:20.320 --> 06:28.000
And suddenly we wake up again to how important existential thinking is. And so that has kind

06:28.000 --> 06:36.560
of been the arc of my life. It's always been shaped and informed by an existential attitude or an

06:36.560 --> 06:46.480
existential orientation. It sounds like you genuinely connected with the kind of existential

06:46.560 --> 06:52.800
questions and never were able to kind of shake them away rather than stumbling across

06:52.800 --> 07:00.080
a textbook in a formalized module and saying, okay, I better learn this theory. You've felt the

07:00.080 --> 07:08.320
questions within you. That was a visceral experience. It wasn't about a vocation. It wasn't

07:08.320 --> 07:14.560
about even getting a job as a philosophy professor. It was about a way of existing. And so I would be

07:14.560 --> 07:21.520
doing existentialism if I was managing a restaurant or working in middle management somewhere for a

07:21.520 --> 07:26.800
company. I would still be watching existential films, listening to existential music,

07:28.080 --> 07:36.240
reading existential poetry and all of the things that move me, as you say, viscerally or in a

07:36.240 --> 07:46.080
mooted way. Because they speak to the concerns at the core of our condition. These are the ultimate

07:46.080 --> 07:54.640
concerns of our lives. And so yeah, they've had a powerful orienting impact on me.

07:58.240 --> 08:05.200
You bring up something for me, which is the fact that you're going through that phase of life when

08:05.200 --> 08:10.400
you're younger and you're chatting with your friends and you're asking these massive, massive

08:10.400 --> 08:15.840
questions, these really deep questions. And then you fade into a life where you're not

08:15.840 --> 08:20.320
what you're not supposed to be asking these questions. I remember for me, I don't know about

08:20.320 --> 08:27.280
you, but it was kind of almost stigmatized to ask why rather than to just follow, to question

08:27.280 --> 08:32.000
these deep meanings rather than to just pick a career and follow it. I don't know if you can relate

08:32.080 --> 08:40.160
to that. Oh, certainly I can. And it's, you know, just because we are kind of sucked into

08:41.040 --> 08:47.840
the shallows of social convention and go with the flow of everyday life, the existentialists

08:47.840 --> 08:54.240
make it clear that that's not a moral failing. It's not as if you're doing something wrong. It's just

08:54.960 --> 09:01.920
part of the inertia of being human, that we're always going to be, Heidegger has this

09:02.640 --> 09:09.840
language of temptation, we're tempted by the they or the public world, because it's comfortable,

09:09.840 --> 09:18.240
it's predictable, it's well ordered, and it covers over the anxiety, that kind of quivering

09:18.240 --> 09:26.640
unease, that all human beings experience an unease that reminds us that there's something wrong

09:26.640 --> 09:34.640
with us, that there's something disconnected or out of sync with us and the world. And it's

09:34.640 --> 09:38.880
because we're conscious, it's because we're self aware that we're aware that we're going to die,

09:38.880 --> 09:48.080
we're aware that God is dead, and there are no moral absolutes. And so I think existentialists

09:48.080 --> 09:57.120
are just deeply attuned to the fragility and weakness of human beings, that we drift to religion,

09:57.120 --> 10:03.200
we drift to comfort, we drift to social norms, because it shelters us and it protects us.

10:03.840 --> 10:11.280
It's not a bad thing, it's just, it's structural to the human condition. But thankfully in life,

10:11.280 --> 10:17.840
we have breakdown experiences, where that comfortable facade collapses and we're forced

10:17.840 --> 10:25.200
to confront ourselves and face who we are. And that's why anxiety conditions, whether you call

10:25.200 --> 10:30.720
it anxiety, if you're Kierkegaard or Nazia, if you're Sard, or absurdity, if you're Camus,

10:32.080 --> 10:40.080
or the horror of the nothing, if you're Nietzsche, all of these experiences are edifying

10:40.080 --> 10:47.440
experiences because they jolt us out of our rootinized drift and force us to face ourselves

10:47.440 --> 10:54.320
and to face our existence. And so the existentialists do something counterintuitive, and that is

10:55.600 --> 11:00.880
they tell us that anxiety is a good thing, it's a teacher, it's not something that should be

11:00.880 --> 11:06.000
medicated necessarily, it's not something that should be controlled with cognitive behavioral

11:06.000 --> 11:11.200
therapy necessarily. That's not to say that those things shouldn't be included in a treatment plan,

11:11.840 --> 11:17.200
but we should listen and attend to those experiences because they're teaching us valuable lessons about

11:17.200 --> 11:27.600
who we are. Because I always have heard that existentialism gets a bad rep for being too focused

11:27.600 --> 11:33.680
on the negative, too focused on the dark, but I, similarly to what you've just said, have never

11:33.680 --> 11:38.640
experienced like that. There's always been a sensation that it acknowledges and explores

11:38.640 --> 11:44.160
the darker side that is inevitably going to be there, whether you're facing it or not.

11:44.160 --> 11:51.840
And actually, if you're able to explore these different philosophies, these different perspectives

11:51.840 --> 11:57.760
on the dark and really confront and really explore what that means for you, you are empowering yourself

11:57.760 --> 12:03.280
in the way that nothing, no denial or no putting it to the side will ever, ever do.

12:04.320 --> 12:09.040
And that's one of the recurring misconceptions about existentialism, that it's a dark,

12:09.680 --> 12:18.000
brooding, navel-gazing philosophy. It's not at all. The idea is when you confront death and face death,

12:18.880 --> 12:25.840
you awaken to the fact that life is not a dress rehearsal, that this is the only life you have

12:26.560 --> 12:34.480
and confronting finitude, facing anxiety, injects a measure of intensity and urgency

12:34.480 --> 12:40.560
and vitality into our existence that otherwise it wouldn't have. And this is why Nietzsche calls

12:40.560 --> 12:45.760
his philosophy a gay science. It's a happy philosophy. It's not a morbid philosophy. It's

12:45.760 --> 12:51.760
a joyful philosophy. And Kierkegaard will say the same thing, right, that when you confront death,

12:52.720 --> 12:59.520
it opens us up to how precious and poignant and fragile every moment is, because it can

12:59.520 --> 13:06.320
be snatched away from us at any time. And so in many ways existentialism, at least for me,

13:06.320 --> 13:11.280
is the most life-affirming of all philosophies. It's not a death-focused philosophy at all. It's

13:13.280 --> 13:18.000
reminding us of how precious each moment is and that we can't take any day for granted.

13:18.640 --> 13:28.720
Now I jumped straight into existential philosophies and I am not as familiar with other philosophies.

13:28.720 --> 13:35.680
So how would you distinguish between what differentiates existential philosophies from

13:35.680 --> 13:43.840
other philosophies? Well, I mean, just in terms of academic specialties, in Anglo-American

13:43.840 --> 13:51.840
philosophy, existentialism is completely marginalized because it doesn't focus on the

13:51.840 --> 13:59.440
core issues of truth and knowledge and the nature of reality and what is the best,

13:59.440 --> 14:04.960
what is good conduct, what ought we to do. Existentialism doesn't care about any of that

14:04.960 --> 14:11.840
generally because the concern is not on philosophical abstractions. What is the

14:11.840 --> 14:16.800
nature of beauty, truth, justice, the good life? No, actually that's not true. They're concerned

14:16.800 --> 14:22.800
with the good life. The existentialist is concerned with what does it mean to be human?

14:22.800 --> 14:28.880
What is existence? And so what the existentialists do is they shift the philosophical orientation

14:28.880 --> 14:35.120
away from theoretical detachment where we theorize about abstract forms and turn our

14:35.120 --> 14:40.960
attention to the concrete flesh and blood particulars of everyday life, which is what

14:41.040 --> 14:52.960
existence engages or is involved in. And so it's a complete reversal of the traditional

14:52.960 --> 15:00.400
philosophical orientation that we inherit from Plato and Aristotle and that gets refined and

15:00.400 --> 15:09.760
consolidated with figures like Descartes and Kant. It's not a philosophy rooted in theoretical

15:09.760 --> 15:18.240
reflection, it's a philosophy rooted in attentiveness to the concreteness of our existence, of our

15:18.240 --> 15:26.960
being. And that means it focuses on the way we live every day, the moods we feel, the affective

15:26.960 --> 15:33.680
experiences that shape us and shock us into awareness like those anxiety moods or nausea moods.

15:34.480 --> 15:45.360
And so it's always been a kind of peripheral fringe philosophy in the UK and the United States,

15:45.360 --> 15:52.160
obviously less so in the Golden Age of French philosophy and German philosophy in the 20s

15:52.160 --> 16:03.360
and 30s and teens. But thankfully that's starting to change. And one of the drivers of this change

16:03.440 --> 16:11.120
is a recognition that because existentialism focuses on concrete existence, it can expand the

16:11.120 --> 16:19.760
philosophical perspective to include voices that have been traditionally marginalized in the

16:19.760 --> 16:27.120
philosophical mainstream. So feminist philosophy, of course, was in many ways inaugurated by Simone

16:27.120 --> 16:35.040
de Beauvoir. Critical race theory was deeply impacted by Frans Fanon who was a student of

16:35.040 --> 16:42.480
Sartre and Beauvoir's and was influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponte. And so these other forms of

16:43.120 --> 16:51.440
philosophical approach that have never had a voice at the table are finally being seen as

16:51.440 --> 16:59.360
bona fide philosophical perspectives that in my view are in many ways indebted to existentialism

17:00.160 --> 17:06.480
by focusing on the concrete and the particular instead of abstract universal forms or essences.

17:08.880 --> 17:15.600
I know this is me speaking from a completely biased perspective but I hear when you say that it

17:15.600 --> 17:24.320
makes me find it hard to imagine why other philosophies have the ability to matter if we

17:24.320 --> 17:29.920
haven't understood what it is to be ourselves. If we haven't understood the kind of existential

17:29.920 --> 17:36.160
aspect of existence, why does it matter what's right or wrong if we don't know what we are?

17:36.800 --> 17:43.920
Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I find most of Anglophone philosophy quite boring and uninteresting

17:43.920 --> 17:52.080
because of that. And as a teacher, the classes that excite the students and engage the students

17:52.080 --> 17:58.240
and inspire the students are existentially themed courses because they're at that stage in life where

17:58.240 --> 18:03.760
they're asking those questions. What am I doing? What is it about? Why am I majoring in this and

18:03.760 --> 18:10.880
not in that? And how is this going to shape the future of my life? And so when we start talking

18:10.880 --> 18:17.840
about Friedrich Nietzsche or Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Saag, the students resonate to these

18:17.840 --> 18:25.200
questions because they're feeling them right now at age 18, 19, 20, 21 and they're going to have to

18:25.200 --> 18:34.080
confront those really serious concerns. They're not so passionate about abstract metaphysical

18:34.080 --> 18:39.760
speculation. Those are interesting and curious thought puzzles but they're curious in the same

18:39.760 --> 18:46.240
way that I'm curious about getting good at chess or figuring out the New York Times crossword puzzle.

18:47.120 --> 18:53.840
Those thought experiments or philosophical curiosities don't keep me up at night. They don't

18:53.840 --> 18:58.880
wake me up at 3 a.m. where I'm jolted awake and I think what's the meaning of my life? That's

18:58.880 --> 19:06.080
existentialism. That's more important. Yeah, there's a difference between intellectual

19:07.040 --> 19:14.240
fascination, intellectual curiosity and kind of an inherent questioning that you're saying

19:14.240 --> 19:21.040
kind of innately surfaces at certain times of life you're saying and in certain experiences,

19:21.040 --> 19:27.760
for example, this really life-shattering or life-questioning experiences. Yeah, exactly.

19:29.440 --> 19:34.160
And we have been obviously discussing the phenomenon but we have not been defining the

19:34.240 --> 19:41.360
phenomenon. If that is possible, how would you define it? Well, existentialism as a technical

19:41.360 --> 19:50.640
term is almost beyond a clear definition and it's an ism, as I write in my book, that really

19:51.760 --> 19:58.640
is misleading. It's not like rationalism or empiricism or or scientism or naturalism.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.520
It doesn't refer to a unified philosophical school

20:06.000 --> 20:12.320
and the word wasn't introduced until the 1940s by Gabriel Marcell and

20:13.280 --> 20:20.720
Marcell used that word to refer to the philosophies of Sartre and Beauvoir but existentialism as a

20:20.720 --> 20:26.400
word didn't exist in the 19th century so Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,

20:26.480 --> 20:35.120
the word didn't even exist. But I think to get a sense of the overall contours of what the word

20:35.120 --> 20:46.160
refers to, it refers to a philosophical focus on what it means to be human. What does it mean

20:46.160 --> 20:53.920
for a human being to exist? And the idea is that we exist in a way that's fundamentally different

20:53.920 --> 21:02.480
from the way this water bottle exists or this cell phone exists. We are not substances, we're not

21:02.480 --> 21:11.200
static things that are objectively present to be studied. We are activities or processes or

21:11.200 --> 21:21.920
happenings so existence is an event for humans. It's an event of self-making or self-fashioning.

21:22.480 --> 21:29.120
We make ourselves who we are through the meaning-giving choices that we undertake

21:29.120 --> 21:35.120
as our lives unfold. And this is what Sartre means when he says existence precedes essence.

21:36.080 --> 21:43.920
There is no pre-given essence that determines who we are. We make ourselves who we are by

21:44.720 --> 21:51.840
choices, by actions. And those actions are always constrained by our embodiment,

21:51.840 --> 22:00.160
our social historical situation, our gendered or sexual situation. So it's not as if our

22:01.360 --> 22:09.920
self-created, the activity of self-creation is completely unhinged. It's not completely undetermined.

22:09.920 --> 22:17.280
It's situated and constrained by what the existentialists call facticity, the facticity of

22:17.280 --> 22:27.280
who we are. And so what we do as humans is we are in a struggle or a tension between the

22:27.280 --> 22:34.320
givens of our situation and our capacity to interpret and give meaning to those givens.

22:34.320 --> 22:41.200
And the existentialists call that transcendence. So we're always in this tension between transcendence

22:41.200 --> 22:49.840
and facticity. And that struggle is existence itself, right? I'm giving meaning to the fact that

22:49.840 --> 22:57.040
I'm a man in the 21st century who's white and middle class and for the time being ambulatory

22:57.040 --> 23:03.280
and able-bodied. And I'm going to have to interpret and give meaning to that factical determination

23:03.280 --> 23:10.960
as it changes and shifts and is modified throughout the course of my life. And of course what that

23:10.960 --> 23:19.200
means is that the process of self-making is finite. It's temporal. It comes to an end. In other words,

23:19.200 --> 23:26.640
we make ourselves who we are with the recognition that that process of self-making is finite,

23:26.640 --> 23:34.480
that we are beings on the way towards death. And we don't like that. That scares us. So oftentimes

23:34.480 --> 23:42.560
we live in a way that is in denial or flight from our own finitude, from our own mortality.

23:43.120 --> 23:49.680
And that's why most of our lives are inauthentic, or in the words of Sartre and Beauvoir, in bad faith.

23:50.240 --> 23:56.720
We live in a state of self-deception most of our lives. And we think in the course of our lives

23:56.720 --> 24:03.920
that there's something real and enduring and lasting about our existence. But the existentialists

24:03.920 --> 24:08.160
want to remind us that there is nothing real, enduring or lasting about our existence. Our

24:08.160 --> 24:14.000
existence is finite. And that's not a bad thing. It's just part of what it means to be human,

24:14.000 --> 24:21.040
and we need to kind of own up to that. And so central to that process of authentic self-creation

24:21.600 --> 24:28.640
is a kind of honesty, that we need to be honest with ourselves and cut away all of the layers of

24:28.640 --> 24:37.440
self-deception that we carry with ourselves to protect us from the horror of our finitude,

24:37.440 --> 24:43.120
the horror of our contingency. So one of the things that the existentialists say is that

24:44.080 --> 24:51.360
we exist, but we don't have to exist. There's no reason for us to exist. We just happen to be

24:51.360 --> 24:59.120
thrown into existence. And against the backdrop of our thrownness, we now have to make ourselves

24:59.120 --> 25:06.320
into who we are. And that's a huge burden. That's the burden of freedom. It's dizzying and anxiety

25:06.320 --> 25:11.920
provoking. And we don't like to accept that either. And that's why we like to be told what to do.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.680
We like our priests to tell us what to do, our therapists to tell us what to do, our pop

25:15.680 --> 25:21.520
psychologists to tell us how to live our lives. We don't want to do it on our own. And of course,

25:21.520 --> 25:28.160
what the existentialists want to say is, you're always on your own anyway. You've got to be honest

25:28.160 --> 25:40.160
with yourself. So that's the cliff notes version of existentialism. Hard to define, but there are

25:40.720 --> 25:48.720
kind of central features built into it. Freedom, authenticity, temporality, all of these things

25:48.720 --> 25:55.120
kind of undergird all of the existentialist philosophers. The problem, unfortunately, is that

25:56.560 --> 26:01.760
some of the most significant voices in existentialism aren't philosophers at all.

26:02.480 --> 26:09.520
They're novelists like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. They're poets like Reiner Maria Rilke. They're

26:09.520 --> 26:18.800
filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa. They're playwrights like Sartre and novelists like Beauvoir. And so

26:20.160 --> 26:29.440
existentialism expands far beyond the academic world. It's not exclusive to philosophers.

26:29.680 --> 26:37.200
It's open to anyone who's sincerely concerned about the human condition and is anxious about

26:37.200 --> 26:42.720
what it means to be human and is trying to articulate and express that anxiety or that concern.

26:43.600 --> 26:50.160
And there are also religious existentialists and atheistic existentialists. And so not all

26:51.040 --> 27:01.920
existentialists are following Nietzsche's maxim that God is dead. Many of the most important

27:01.920 --> 27:07.040
existentialists were theistic existentialists like Dostoevsky, like Paul Tillich, like Martin

27:07.040 --> 27:12.080
Buber. And there are some existentialists that don't believe in free will, like Nietzsche. He

27:12.080 --> 27:17.760
thinks free will is a fiction. It's an illusion. But most existentialists have some conception

27:17.840 --> 27:25.600
of freedom, of free will. And so this is why it's so difficult to demarcate the boundaries

27:25.600 --> 27:33.600
of what existentialism is. Yet there are these familiar names that are

27:34.880 --> 27:40.320
going to generally be coming across when you're studying it, especially from an academic point

27:40.640 --> 27:48.880
of view. And it's making me think who, how, how did these particular names get selected and

27:48.880 --> 27:55.840
put into the textbooks? And why are they the ones kind of being regurgitated and shared,

27:55.840 --> 28:01.200
not that there's anything not completely marvelous about what they're sharing and that they shouldn't

28:01.200 --> 28:09.040
be shared? But why them? Why not anyone else? Because they're the ones that do it. They're the

28:09.040 --> 28:16.880
ones that engage the human condition in the most powerful and accessible and visceral way.

28:17.600 --> 28:24.400
And so other novelists may talk about the human condition in certain ways, but very few do it the

28:24.400 --> 28:30.720
way Dostoevsky does it, in crime and punishment or in the Brothers Karamazah. Very few articulate

28:30.720 --> 28:36.560
the experience of confronting death like Tolstoy does and the death of Ivan Iliac. Very few capture

28:37.120 --> 28:44.720
the despair in the face of the dizzying abyss of existence like Soren Kierkegaard does and

28:44.720 --> 28:53.840
sickness unto death. So these are the figures that engage the human condition in the most powerful

28:53.840 --> 29:02.160
way. But there are other marginal figures or figures on the periphery that do it in different

29:02.160 --> 29:09.440
ways. But in my view, they may not do it as well. And or some may not have been discovered yet,

29:09.440 --> 29:17.360
who knows. But when it comes to the major figures, they're major for a reason. Because their legacy

29:17.360 --> 29:26.640
is enduring and lasting because they tend to do it better than anyone else. And it being they

29:26.640 --> 29:34.160
speak to that humanness within you to that unspeakable part of you, which is just craving

29:34.160 --> 29:41.040
stimulation, craving questions, craving answers. And they allow this kind of internal communication

29:41.040 --> 29:48.080
with that being. And that's why they're well, it's, it's, I mean, I don't know if it's craving

29:48.080 --> 29:54.000
stimulation or craving answers. I mean, one of the things that the existentialist will say is that

29:54.000 --> 29:59.280
craving for stimulation is actually a form of denial. We want to be stimulated and distracted

29:59.280 --> 30:05.920
from our human condition. And there are no answers to the human condition. What the existentialist

30:05.920 --> 30:11.600
want to do is put us in a state of questionability, that there is no answer to the question what it

30:11.600 --> 30:17.520
means to be human. You have to find that for yourself. You have to give your life meaning.

30:17.520 --> 30:25.040
So there are no, it is not as if the existentialist lays out a guidebook to being who you are.

30:25.760 --> 30:30.960
That's the scary part about existentialism. It's up to you to find out what this means.

30:30.960 --> 30:37.280
This is why Nietzsche, for instance, is so famous for cautioning his readers. Don't become

30:37.280 --> 30:44.640
Nietzscheans. Don't follow me. Follow yourself. You need to, you need to carve out your existence

30:44.640 --> 30:51.120
and give meaning to your existence in the way that matters to you. Nietzsche did it for himself,

30:51.120 --> 30:56.720
but you're not Nietzsche. You have to do it in your own way. Kierkegaard calls this subjective

30:56.720 --> 31:02.000
truth. It's a truth that no one else has access to. It's your truth that belongs to you. And

31:03.760 --> 31:09.440
it's going to be inco-parent and unintelligible to anyone else. And that's why it's precious to

31:09.440 --> 31:14.400
who you are. So one of the tricky things about existentialism is a philosophy, and actually

31:14.400 --> 31:21.680
this is kind of true to philosophy in general. Answers aren't part of the project. The project

31:21.680 --> 31:28.480
is to immerse yourself in the questions, or as Rilke says, live the questions, exist the questions,

31:29.120 --> 31:35.200
and be comfortable in the mystery and the ambiguity of the human condition. The more we try to find

31:35.200 --> 31:41.920
reasons or grounds for our existence, the further away from authenticity we drift. Does that make

31:41.920 --> 31:48.960
sense? And that is my observation of what is causing people the deepest pain, is when they are

31:49.920 --> 31:58.080
needing that answer to what ultimately can't be answered, because it is just life. It is just your

31:58.080 --> 32:04.000
decision. You wake up each day and either do the very much similar thing that you did yesterday,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.480
or you be a completely different version of yourself doing a completely different thing,

32:09.280 --> 32:14.400
there is just infinite ambiguity if you're willing to experience it.

32:15.280 --> 32:25.600
Yeah, and so I think one of the measures of authenticity or being true to ourselves

32:26.320 --> 32:35.520
is to learn how to be comfortable with or to dwell in uncertainty, to dwell in mystery and

32:35.520 --> 32:42.880
ambiguity, and don't recoil from it or don't try to control it and master it, but to immerse

32:42.880 --> 32:51.200
yourself in it. And that is the human condition. It is a fundamentally ambiguous and uncertain

32:51.760 --> 32:58.480
predicament. And the more we try to control it and manipulate it and master it, the more anxious

32:58.480 --> 33:05.360
we become. And this is one of the key features of it in existential psychotherapy. The more you

33:05.360 --> 33:12.720
try to control your anxiety, the more your anxiety takes control of you. The more you befriend your

33:12.720 --> 33:19.280
anxiety and welcome your anxiety and dwell in it, the less control it has over you, the less

33:19.280 --> 33:27.440
power it has over you. For someone that might be watching this and really sitting there struggling

33:27.440 --> 33:34.640
with their mental well-being or with their experience of life, and they were hoping that

33:34.640 --> 33:42.400
existential ideas might alleviate some of that, what would you recommend for them in terms of

33:42.400 --> 33:51.840
either just exploration or particular sources? Well, it's hard for me to say because I'm not a

33:51.840 --> 33:58.080
clinician and I'm not a mental health counselor. And I think it's a case-by-case situation. I think

33:59.680 --> 34:08.880
one of the stereotypes of existentialism is that it's anti-psychiatry. And this is an orientation

34:08.880 --> 34:16.320
that was really pioneered by figures like Artie Lang, who was deeply inspired by existentialism,

34:16.320 --> 34:22.080
especially the work of John Paul Sarge. And the idea is that any medical intervention that

34:22.960 --> 34:33.440
blunts or covers over our freedom or our confrontation with our condition is dehumanizing

34:33.440 --> 34:42.240
and problematic. I don't think that's true at all. I think some people need pharmaceutical

34:42.240 --> 34:49.040
assistance, medication. I think some people need instrumental psychotherapies like cognitive and

34:49.040 --> 34:57.360
behavioral therapy. And so my approach to this from a mental health perspective is very much an

34:57.360 --> 35:04.800
eclectic approach. You use what works. I think someone in the grips of full-blown panic and anxiety,

35:06.080 --> 35:09.760
Nietzsche is not going to help that person. Kierkegaard's not going to help that person. In

35:09.760 --> 35:18.240
fact, it could inflame the situation and amplify it. However, if the anxiety is controlled or

35:18.240 --> 35:25.040
mediated in some sense with an antidepressant or with some form of cognitive and behavioral therapy,

35:25.680 --> 35:35.440
that may allow that suffer to begin the hard work of existential psychotherapy. And so I would

35:35.440 --> 35:43.360
certainly not employ existential psychotherapy as a first line of treatment in every situation

35:43.920 --> 35:50.640
by any means. But I think existential psychotherapy has to be employed for lasting

35:51.520 --> 35:57.760
change, to occur for lasting and significant transformation to happen and growth to happen.

35:59.760 --> 36:05.200
And so yeah, I think that's kind of the way I would go about it.

36:08.240 --> 36:15.040
Which could almost be summarized as saying work out on a kind of on an individual basis,

36:15.040 --> 36:22.800
on a unique basis. And also I would argue in unique to each moment, because so I do work

36:23.520 --> 36:29.200
as a practitioner and I'm obviously highly influenced by existential philosophies in my

36:29.200 --> 36:34.880
work. But what I'm going to do with a client one day or how we will be together in a session

36:34.880 --> 36:40.320
one day is going to be fundamentally different perhaps than the previous week or the next week.

36:40.400 --> 36:46.800
And I feel that from my perspective, at least, there's something about having these philosophical

36:46.800 --> 36:54.080
ideas, having these concepts, having these key themes, almost within myself as lenses or perspectives

36:54.080 --> 37:02.320
to have as an alternative way to look, and especially a lot of it's rooted in not being able

37:02.320 --> 37:09.520
to change, not being able to make a change. I think that's right. And I think one of the great

37:09.520 --> 37:18.320
insights of existentialism is the recognition that anxiety and despair are not medical conditions.

37:18.320 --> 37:24.640
They should be medicalized as discrete medical entities. They are structural to the human

37:24.640 --> 37:31.600
condition. They're inescapable. Everyone is going to have powerful and life shattering

37:31.600 --> 37:37.440
anxiety moments. And and many, most of us will have them over and over again throughout our lives

37:37.440 --> 37:44.000
as we get to go through a divorce or our parents die or we lose our job or we suffer a

37:44.960 --> 37:52.480
serious illness. All of those experiences are going to shatter us. And we're going to have

37:52.480 --> 37:59.920
to confront ourselves. But to say that that experience of existential shattering or anxiety

37:59.920 --> 38:05.200
in the face of our own finitude is a medical condition is really problematic in my view.

38:05.840 --> 38:09.680
Because what the egg doesn't mean they shouldn't be treated and assisted with

38:09.680 --> 38:16.000
with pharmaceuticals or or or CBT or something like this. What the existentialists want to

38:17.040 --> 38:24.480
remind us is that these are instructive edifying opportunities for personal growth and transformation.

38:25.120 --> 38:33.120
Right. They're awakenings. And if we just blunt these awakenings with with tranquilizers

38:33.120 --> 38:39.920
or or are trained to not attend to them and and and avoid them, you're never going to have those

38:39.920 --> 38:44.480
those transformative opportunities that that anxiety can bring to us.

38:47.120 --> 38:51.280
Do you feel that there have been moments in your own life when this is applied?

38:52.160 --> 39:02.560
Oh, God. Countless times in my life, every major breakdown, every crisis existentialism has helped

39:02.560 --> 39:10.960
me. Three years ago, I had a massive heart attack while on a 60 mile bike ride, something I did

39:10.960 --> 39:18.960
regularly. I was kind of a fitness advocate and and a health nut. And I had a massive heart attack.

39:19.040 --> 39:27.040
And my whole world collapsed. My identity as a professor, my identity as a as a physically fit

39:27.040 --> 39:33.360
middle aged man, my identity as a as a partner or in terms of my relationships.

39:34.240 --> 39:43.360
And existentialism helped me work through that trauma and and come through the other side, I

39:43.360 --> 39:49.920
think, as a better human being with a deeper perspective about life's frailty and precariousness

39:50.720 --> 39:58.080
and woke me up to living with a sense of urgency and vitality and intensity that

39:58.880 --> 40:05.520
it's you inevitably get sucked away from in the drift of professional life or or family obligations

40:05.520 --> 40:14.240
and work obligations and so on. So existentialism has through throughout my life from from 18 years

40:14.240 --> 40:23.840
old on, numerous breakdowns, divorce, you know, sicknesses, losses of friends to cancer and illness

40:25.440 --> 40:33.520
has has pulled me through and and deepened my life and and opened up opportunities for growth

40:33.520 --> 40:40.640
and transformation. And so it has been whether it's it's through existential literature or reading

40:40.640 --> 40:47.440
Heidegger again or teaching Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sard in the classroom. It's always been therapeutic

40:47.440 --> 40:56.320
for me. I appreciate you sharing and I suppose because I'm socialized to think it I'm almost

40:56.320 --> 41:02.400
instinctively when you hear someone's experience of trauma you want to instinctively say I'm so

41:02.400 --> 41:08.640
sorry that you had that experience but I'm learning more and more and especially with you sharing this

41:08.640 --> 41:14.640
this brilliant this growth beyond and these new insights that you gain from it. There's almost

41:14.640 --> 41:19.760
a sense that well I'm not sorry that you had that experience in a way you're saying that it

41:19.760 --> 41:26.560
contributed beautifully to your life. And that's actually the the great gift of existential philosophy

41:26.560 --> 41:30.880
is that these these traumas and crises I mean you don't want you don't want to romanticize them you

41:30.880 --> 41:36.160
don't want to romanticize suffering and that's always a temptation in existential philosophy that

41:36.160 --> 41:41.360
he or she who suffers the most is the deepest and the most authentic that's just nonsense and I

41:41.360 --> 41:46.960
don't think that's a right an accurate depiction of what the existentious are trying to do. But

41:46.960 --> 41:56.160
the recognition that that that trauma and suffering and breakdowns awaken us to life's frailty and

41:56.240 --> 42:04.320
its poignancy and remind us not to take our relationships for granted or our day for granted

42:04.320 --> 42:12.240
that it could be snuffed out at any time are tremendously valuable life lessons and they

42:12.240 --> 42:17.520
improve and enhance our lives they don't diminish it at all they make us in my view better people

42:17.520 --> 42:23.280
more compassionate more understanding more sympathetic to the suffering of others and

42:23.360 --> 42:30.640
and so so I I think you're right that that cliche I'm so sorry this happened I'm so sorry for your

42:30.640 --> 42:38.720
loss those losses are opportunities for growth those those those deaths are our opportunities

42:38.720 --> 42:44.800
for transformation and and Kierkegaard is great with this I mean Kierkegaard goes so far as to

42:44.800 --> 42:51.840
say God wants you to die God wants you to die to the world because when you die to the world

42:51.840 --> 42:58.560
the world comes back to you in a way that's more vibrant and intense and urgent than it was before

42:59.200 --> 43:05.440
so so the idea is to die over and over throughout your life and every time you die the world comes

43:05.440 --> 43:12.320
back with more vibrancy intensity and poignancy and and during that process you you prepare for

43:12.320 --> 43:19.040
your actual death in Rilke's words you learn how to die which is the the most important lesson that

43:19.040 --> 43:28.560
a philosopher can teach how can you learn how to die I'm I'm aware that it could be really easy for

43:28.560 --> 43:33.120
someone to for someone to sit here and hear this and think it will it's so easy for you guys to

43:33.120 --> 43:40.480
speak theoretically about embracing the opportunities that suffering provides but hey I'm sitting here

43:40.480 --> 43:47.040
with a real-life experience of suffering and I have no idea how to how how do we do that especially

43:47.040 --> 43:52.480
when we haven't had you know the advantage of years of actual philosophical engagement

43:53.280 --> 43:58.800
yeah it's a it's a very difficult question I mean some people won't most people most people will live

44:00.560 --> 44:05.840
lives of deep suffering and meaninglessness and that's just the part of the predicament of being

44:05.840 --> 44:12.800
human many people live sad ordinary lives that are bereft of deep meaning and significance

44:13.520 --> 44:19.200
Tolstoy says it great in the in the death of Ivan Iliak he says Ivan Iliak lived an ordinary

44:19.200 --> 44:25.200
simple life and therefore it was a life that was most terrible and that's the life that most of us

44:25.200 --> 44:32.960
will live and this is why I think Natalie projects like the ones that you're doing which are trying

44:32.960 --> 44:40.480
to give voice to this the importance of existentialism are so important education is important good

44:40.560 --> 44:46.640
liberal arts humanities education is important reading great literature watching good film

44:46.640 --> 44:53.200
listening to good music those are all important edifying experiences that speak to the human

44:53.200 --> 45:00.800
condition in so far as those those movies and and pieces of literature and and and pieces of music

45:00.800 --> 45:10.400
speak to the human condition and so again you know sadly most of us are going to suffer

45:10.640 --> 45:17.440
and and not have the wisdom that the existential tradition can open and open us up to and one

45:17.440 --> 45:23.120
of the things that I do in my work is I try to popularize existentialism by writing about it

45:23.120 --> 45:30.560
and by giving talks on it and by giving going to conferences and being a Pied Piper to my students

45:30.560 --> 45:37.120
about how important these these questions and ideas are and so I try to incorporate that wisdom

45:37.600 --> 45:43.200
into everything that I do in my conversations with my friends with my partner with my colleagues

45:43.200 --> 45:50.240
reminding them that this this petty squabble about academic bureaucracy doesn't really matter

45:50.240 --> 45:55.600
don't get hung up on it because you're going to die and you're going to die at any time and so put

45:55.600 --> 46:01.520
yourself put things in perspective what really matters in the grand scheme of things and Irvin

46:01.520 --> 46:07.120
Yalam the great existential psychotherapist refers to this as trivializing the trivial

46:08.080 --> 46:14.400
we realize that these things that we worry about most of the time in our lives are trivial stupid

46:15.040 --> 46:21.360
wastes of time that there are much bigger more significant issues on the table like

46:21.920 --> 46:30.080
living a meaningful life and and being a decent human being and how generally does that go down

46:30.400 --> 46:36.400
when you're engaging with people who are are living in the trivial who are embracing the

46:36.400 --> 46:41.120
trivial conversations and you're like hold up you know that is trivial let's let's talk about

46:41.120 --> 46:45.920
something it's a really good question I mean you have to be careful because it's not going to register

46:45.920 --> 46:51.040
for most people I mean most people like Kevin he's so dramatic I mean he's such an intellectual

46:51.040 --> 46:57.600
he's always talking about these heavy things but if you're if you're sensitive and mindful to the

46:57.680 --> 47:05.520
speaking position of other people you can do it in ways that are thoughtful and and sensitive

47:06.080 --> 47:11.840
and so you don't want to bludgeon someone with existential philosophy and say wake up wake up

47:11.840 --> 47:17.200
you can be thoughtful by asking questions like what does that mean for you why is this worrying

47:17.200 --> 47:22.400
you why is this concerning to you with my students it's a little bit different I can be a little bit

47:22.400 --> 47:27.120
more blunt because I am a teacher and they're learning this material so I can shove it down

47:27.120 --> 47:31.840
their throats whether they like it or not but with my friends and my family and my colleagues

47:32.560 --> 47:38.960
you have to be a little bit more indirect and and thoughtful and recognize that these ideas

47:38.960 --> 47:45.840
are quite scary and can be terrifying if you've never dipped your toe into existential philosophy

47:45.840 --> 47:54.000
before and that most of our culture is built in such a way as to deny these concerns

47:54.640 --> 48:00.560
right that that most of our cultural institutions are set up in a way that we don't have to face

48:01.280 --> 48:07.200
the the the existential givens right we don't have to face death we don't have to face absurdity we

48:07.200 --> 48:16.000
don't have to confront anxiety and and um and so so you you want to be cautious in terms of how

48:16.000 --> 48:21.600
you bring this up but but oftentimes it means that I just cut some people out of my life if

48:21.600 --> 48:27.440
they're not willing to engage so I I don't have a lot of friends maybe for that reason but it's

48:27.440 --> 48:32.640
the same reason why I don't have friends who are Donald Trump supporters I just there's no reason

48:32.640 --> 48:39.040
for me to waste my time with someone who is a dogmatic follower of dog Donald Trump I have

48:39.040 --> 48:45.520
nothing really to say to them in the same way that it'd be very hard for me to try to gently

48:45.520 --> 48:53.680
broach the idea that maybe God is an invention to someone who is deeply ensconced in a religious

48:54.320 --> 49:01.680
faith and their identity hinges on the idea that God has to exist it'd be very hard for me to

49:01.680 --> 49:06.720
disentangle that person from those deeply held convictions I could suggest some literature

49:07.440 --> 49:12.400
maybe some books but it wouldn't be a conversation that I'd be interested in having

49:12.800 --> 49:20.880
I remember really early on in my training one of the lecturers must have just supervised some

49:20.880 --> 49:25.120
students because it was obviously quite fresh for her but she was saying that they'd conducted

49:25.120 --> 49:35.040
their entire thesis on the potentially damaging and and ending results that engaging in existential

49:35.040 --> 49:41.360
philosophy can have on interrelationships be that with partners intimate relationships with friends

49:41.360 --> 49:48.480
with family members because it you know we speak about you spoke there about choosing to move away

49:48.480 --> 49:54.080
but it almost becomes and I've spoken with colleagues it almost becomes intolerable not

49:54.080 --> 50:01.120
to think deeply not to see things as trivial when they are trivial yeah I agree and I and I think

50:01.120 --> 50:08.960
and I don't want to be harsh about this but um it's okay to cut people out of your life that

50:08.960 --> 50:15.760
have no that that aren't that aren't bringing meaning and value to your existence and and

50:15.760 --> 50:21.040
with family members it's much more difficult because there are our long-standing connections of

50:21.040 --> 50:29.200
intimacy but I I don't have much problem disconnecting from friends that don't really

50:30.320 --> 50:36.880
see the relevance of these kinds of questions or concerns and I also have a very hard time with

50:36.880 --> 50:44.720
small talk and gossip it makes me very uncomfortable so so going to cocktail parties or where people

50:44.720 --> 50:52.400
are just talking about trivial things that makes me quite anxious and unnerved and and I don't like

50:52.400 --> 50:59.760
that but if a conversation at a party is involving real serious existential questions I'll be there

50:59.760 --> 51:08.400
all night and and I'll be passionate about the conversation and so so um uh it for me it's a

51:08.400 --> 51:16.400
temperamental orientation temperamentally I I I I'm very uncomfortable with with with surface

51:16.400 --> 51:22.720
conversation it makes me it makes me quite anxious and it's the same thing at faculty meetings or

51:22.720 --> 51:26.880
department meetings I'm a department chair so I have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and

51:26.880 --> 51:32.880
deal with upper administration those meetings I I can't stand I have a very difficult time

51:32.880 --> 51:40.000
sitting through that because I see the the the vast waste of time that these meetings suck up

51:40.000 --> 51:44.640
in a life and I think okay there's another two hours of my life that I'll never get back that

51:44.640 --> 51:52.320
that didn't contribute anything to my to my sense of who I am and so I think some people maybe you're

51:52.320 --> 51:59.520
like this uh Natalie that that temperamentally you're just drawn to these ideas it's not something

51:59.520 --> 52:05.520
that you can really help it's just it's it's it's it's part of your your constitution

52:07.360 --> 52:14.960
and I can confidently say that you have just validated so many of my peers experiences there

52:14.960 --> 52:20.560
too when you say you struggle with small talk and and gossip and and I had wondered if that's

52:20.560 --> 52:25.600
just because everyone's just coming to the end of this huge huge doctorate journey which is

52:25.600 --> 52:33.840
exhausting and overwhelming in itself but perhaps it is part of this it might be part of a deeper

52:35.200 --> 52:41.760
existential orientation and you know again if if if a group of friends are sitting around

52:42.480 --> 52:51.200
talking about really important life issues I I'm drawn to that like a laser beam and and I will

52:51.200 --> 52:58.560
listen and nod my head and contribute where I can but if the conversation is about politics or sports

52:58.560 --> 53:08.000
or redecorating a house or installing a backyard gazebo I or what restaurant is good or or who's

53:08.560 --> 53:15.280
coming to town in terms of a band or something I could care less I just I my eyes glaze over

53:15.280 --> 53:20.800
I mean I can play the game and put on the mask of sociability as good as anyone but um

53:22.160 --> 53:27.840
when I go home I'll feel deflated and upset that I lost a few more hours of my life

53:30.160 --> 53:35.600
and I'm not sure if you noticed it but I want to reflect back that you said it's those conversations

53:35.680 --> 53:42.720
and those meetings which don't contribute to who I am and that is what is antagonizing and

53:42.720 --> 53:47.840
frustrating about them yeah and that's not to say that I don't willfully do it and I know it's

53:47.840 --> 53:52.960
important work to keep a university going and I know that we have to put on masks to keep the

53:52.960 --> 54:02.240
machinery of society lubricated and well oiled and and it's also not a judgmental thing I may

54:02.240 --> 54:08.720
come off like I'm being judgmental it's it's it's it's who I am it's I can't help it and I

54:09.680 --> 54:15.360
I think some people love small talk and they love gossip and they love cocktail party

54:15.360 --> 54:21.200
conversations it's just something that I can't bear it's very difficult for me it takes a

54:21.200 --> 54:28.160
tremendous amount of energy to maintain myself at a three or four hour long dinner party where

54:28.160 --> 54:33.840
the conversation is just idle chatter it's I mean I have to have two or three glasses of wine

54:33.840 --> 54:39.440
just to take the edge off and and cope and that may that may be revealing more about me than I

54:39.440 --> 54:46.800
want to suggest but it's it's who I am yeah I don't think it's it's judgmental that it came

54:46.800 --> 54:52.480
across I feel like it was very honest but it makes me realize we don't perhaps often get the

54:52.480 --> 55:01.520
opportunity to express in a safe space honestly what does and doesn't work for us in life we are

55:01.520 --> 55:08.160
often involved with situations that are just part of the pattern of existence and we we tolerate them

55:08.160 --> 55:14.480
and we put our masks on and we we navigate them because we we feel that we have to and I think

55:14.480 --> 55:22.160
that's a great point Natalie and I think my my my personal view is that everyone deep down is

55:22.160 --> 55:27.920
craving for these conversations these deep serious conversations about the meaning of life

55:28.480 --> 55:34.240
but they're scary they're they're frightening conversations because they expose so much that

55:34.240 --> 55:40.320
we want to keep hidden but I think all of us it's I think it's it's it's built into the human

55:40.320 --> 55:46.880
condition we we we are thirsting for these encounters these deep intimate relational

55:46.880 --> 55:52.960
encounters what what Martin Buber calls the IU relation where we're open and exposed to the

55:52.960 --> 55:57.920
other person and this is what draws people to therapy this is why people go into to therapy

55:57.920 --> 56:02.640
because they want to be heard they want to have to have someone listen to them in a way that's

56:02.640 --> 56:11.120
sincere and open and they feel safe in that space in that therapeutic encounter and and that

56:11.120 --> 56:17.040
safety oftentimes isn't there at us at a social gathering or at a party but the more intimate

56:17.040 --> 56:22.400
that that social gathering gets and the more close knit that community of friends and and

56:22.400 --> 56:28.960
relations is the greater the opportunity for deeper conversations and and and more penetrating

56:29.520 --> 56:30.160
discourse

56:33.040 --> 56:40.640
and I wonder where it is in life that we do become so scared of confronting these questions because

56:41.280 --> 56:47.920
if you think about children children are constantly just exploring all of many facets of

56:47.920 --> 56:53.840
themselves all the many potentials of what life has to offer and they do it with such

56:54.560 --> 57:01.760
just innate fearlessness yeah I think we we it gets socialized out of us I think you're right

57:01.760 --> 57:08.160
I think children are always the best philosophers they're always philosophically inquisitive

57:08.160 --> 57:13.920
and and even inquisitive about the deepest and scariest questions about death you know what

57:13.920 --> 57:19.200
happened to our dog what happened to grandma where do they go after they die why why why

57:20.000 --> 57:29.040
and as as as young children get socialized in in in school and in educational institutions

57:29.040 --> 57:35.760
in in peer relations they're kind of told you don't ask those questions anymore you do what

57:35.760 --> 57:44.800
good boys and girls do and and that's a that's sad that's unfortunate and and so we we lose touch

57:44.800 --> 57:55.360
with that wide-eyed openness to the questionability of life that all children have and it gets beaten

57:55.360 --> 57:59.840
out of us and then there's moments in I think late adolescence early adulthood when it wake

57:59.840 --> 58:05.440
when we're woken up again and that's often is happens when you go off to college when you leave

58:05.440 --> 58:11.280
home for the first time right either going to college or go off and and practice a trade at 18

58:11.280 --> 58:19.040
or 19 and you leave the home and suddenly those questions come up again who am I what's the meaning

58:19.040 --> 58:26.320
of my life and um and and and then we get our degree and we get our job and we start our

58:26.320 --> 58:31.920
career we forget those questions until we get our divorce or we we lose our job or we get a

58:31.920 --> 58:39.040
critical illness and then we're woken up again and um so I think that that the experience of

58:39.040 --> 58:45.120
questionability that children have uh comes back to us at different points in our lives I also think

58:45.120 --> 58:52.560
it comes back to us in at the end of life that the older we get the more humble we get the more

58:52.560 --> 59:00.000
open we get toward mystery and and questionability and I'm actually finishing a book right now on

59:00.000 --> 59:08.400
existentialism and aging and argue that the aging process and the intimacy that aging brings us with

59:08.400 --> 59:14.880
grief and loss actually makes us into existentialists I think elder the elderly folk

59:15.520 --> 59:23.280
tend to be more receptive to these ideas uh and there's a lot of interesting uh evidence to suggest

59:23.280 --> 59:30.640
this that we we actually become existentialists the closer we get to death and the more our future

59:30.640 --> 59:35.840
contracts and we realize that we are temporal beings and life is coming to an end

59:39.360 --> 59:44.560
you've set my mind off in a thousand different questions that I need to to keep it straight

59:46.640 --> 59:52.080
and you're speaking about different literature we've got you know we've got theoretical literature

59:52.080 --> 59:57.680
we've got philosophical perhaps novels and you've mentioned poetry and film what about for the

59:57.680 --> 01:00:04.560
person who's sitting there and it's like yeah these these russian or french and western philosophers

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.280
um that they're not my style like there's no way I could engage with those kind of texts I'm not

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.360
interested in classical music I'm not a deep person I'm not a hugely academic or intellectual

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.320
yeah it's a it's a good question I think yeah some people just aren't readers some people aren't

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:30.160
intellectually inclined I think one of the great entry ways into existential thinking if you're not

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:39.360
a literary type is through film I think there's a lot of really great accessible films that

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:47.520
capture the core ideas of existential philosophy and and some of them are blockbusters with some

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:55.280
of the great stars in Hollywood and so what what film can do is it can demystify the alienating

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.920
and intimidating jargon of the existentialists the german terms and the french terms and the

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:09.280
technical language that may be a sartre or a bouvoir or a heidegger would employ um and uh

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.400
I'm thinking of of movies like American Beauty this is the movie by Sam Mendes

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:25.680
um The Tree of Life by Terrence Malick um there's a great Nietzschean themed science fiction film

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:34.160
called Arrival um uh that was directed by Villeneuve um Akira Kurosawa the great japanese director

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:42.560
of course has done so many great existential films the greatest is probably Ikuru um about a man who's

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.480
who's diagnosed with terminal cancer and he's forced to confront a life that has been largely

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:55.600
bereft of meaning and now he's kind of awakened to the urgency of the limited time that he has left

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.000
and so I think film is a great way to introduce and and these films are cross-cultural it's not

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.200
as if these are just western filmmakers I mean Ikuru I mean I'm sorry Kurosawa had such a massive

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:16.160
impact on western filmmakers that in many ways he was the pioneer not not not hollywood or or

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:24.000
french or or american filmmakers and Ingmar Bergman films of course uh anything that Bergman does

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.400
some Woody Allen films are good although he has demonstrated himself to be a loathsome human being

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.400
um so that's one way to do it uh is is through indirectly through film

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:44.720
and I think that's hugely reassuring and partly what this project is aspiring to do because there

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:52.880
isn't for me an obvious go-to place to say I've heard this word this ism as you were speaking

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.360
about it doesn't it's coming up a lot it seems that it could be something curious but I am not

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.920
able to read these huge huge tomes I I don't know where to start I don't know where to go

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.000
and it feels that there's there's there's not just that's kind of stepping stone that opens the door

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.480
that says actually you know yes okay we there are so many ways to be it highly academic about this

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:26.720
and explore it from a highly academic position and and encourage that to be incorporated into

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.480
different professions and different disciplines but actually we don't have to be so so formal

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.160
about it too we can sit back at the cinema we can have a conversation with friends we can just

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:44.960
look at ourselves and say hey who am I and you could show this interview right I mean this I mean

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.160
hopefully we're not using too much highfalutin language we're talking in a way that I think

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.000
everyone could understand and I think even those that aren't that are intimidated by the big novels

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.840
The Crime and Punishment The Brothers Karamazah many of the most powerful and visceral pieces

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.920
of existential literature are very short stories the short stories of the death of Yon Ilyak it's

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:17.280
you know 50 page story Camus the stranger is a very short story Dostoevsky has a bunch of

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:24.480
short stories that are that are powerful and accessible the plays of Jean-Paul Sartre are

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.960
accessible and pretty easy to follow and so it's not as if you have to to sit down with a thousand

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:38.080
page piece of Russian literature to absorb the core ideas you can breeze through you know

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:47.040
Camus the stranger at the beach in an afternoon and be jolted into an awareness of of who we are

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.840
you know and and so there's no reason to be scared of it it's it's accessible in so many

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.280
different kinds of ways I like how you set the setting there like you can just read a

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.560
read a nice novel on the beach because you make me realize that it there's almost this sense that

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:12.560
philosophy must be done in in a in a dark room with a with a cigar or a brand out in the dark

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:19.520
or in the woods or in a classroom but actually I live in Florida I do most of my work at the beach

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:26.320
right or outside in the sunshine and and so absolutely yeah we don't have to play that

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.000
that stereotype of the the serious French intellectual the beret and the black sweater

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.440
and smoking a cigarette at the coffee shop and it's it's a it can be much more relaxed

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:47.920
and and I think it's very accessible and I reckon it was at the time for them as well

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.680
if half of them were writing at cafes and coffee shops and bars and having these chats and just

01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:01.120
writing it down scribbling it down and I believe to an exact I mean in in the golden age in the

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:07.040
in the 1940s and 50s in France it was everywhere I mean existentialism was in the air and it was

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.280
in the coffee shops in the in the in the cafe society on the sidewalks but it was also in

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:18.320
the air in the United States in that way it was a big driver of the counterculture revolution and

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:29.520
and you know Camus and and Sartre and Beauvoir were such important political voices and in speaking to

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:36.080
the Vietnam War to to the civil rights movement to the women's movement it was an important part

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:46.080
of the new left in in Great Britain and so it was it was in the air it wasn't it wasn't isolated

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:53.200
in in academic settings it wasn't there in seminar halls it was it was out in the streets

01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:01.360
is where existentialism had its had its high point and it'd be wonderful to see that come back in

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:07.920
some ways and there are sun glimmers of hope that that's the case I mean there's there's aspects of

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.640
the Black Lives Matter movement at the United States the Mitu movement

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:23.520
the Greta Greta Thernbergs climate strike movement that have real resonances to to existential philosophy

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.280
uh in terms of conveying the urgency of our situation and so my sense is that existentialism

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:39.840
is at a is is is coming back it's coming back uh in and uh being received in ways that it that it

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:47.760
hasn't in the past coming back from textbooks and academia into kind of common dialogue and discourse

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.280
yeah and also yeah I think coming back from from uh a complacency in the face of neoliberal politics

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:06.080
and um uh crass materialism I think that that there's nothing like the recognition that the

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:12.800
planet may be uninhabitable in 40 years to jolt us into an awakening and I see this a lot with my

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.320
students I'm not gonna I'm 51 years old so the the urgency of the climate change isn't going to hit

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.560
me as viscerally but for my 20 year old students they may be living in a planet that is radically

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.160
different than the one that I'm living in when they're my age and so when we talk about neolism

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:39.520
or the death of God and the search for meaning um the climate change crisis can can uh jolt us

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:46.400
into an awareness of those kinds of questions and you're bringing us here nicely back into this

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.080
discussion that existentialism isn't just theoretical it's not just within our mind but it's

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.480
within our embodied world as well it's in the physical world as well and yeah what this leads

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:07.040
back into is what you were sharing about your own your own uh specialities yeah absolutely and my

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:13.040
and my own life I mean it's it's it's shaped me in deep ways in my own life it's pulled me through

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:23.360
profound catastrophic events in my life uh near-death events and and uh if anything my relationship

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.440
to this kind of philosophy is more intimate and profound than it's ever been and it's very much

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.720
different from the the place that I was when I was an 18 or 20 year old uh philosopher enamored by

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.960
Nietzsche and the radical ideas because I hadn't lived them I hadn't lived these ideas I hadn't

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.600
experienced them in the visceral way that you know 30 years of life experience teaches you

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:56.320
and so the wisdom of these thinkers has has become even more pronounced as I've gotten older

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.560
and I don't think that's going to change much I think it's it's going to become more pronounced

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:08.320
as I move into my 60s and 70s if I get there if I make it to tomorrow you see it does feel like an

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:16.880
endless absolutely endless uh journey this the the discovery and exploration of the existential

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.400
field I don't I I was going to say I don't know if I love it or I hate it but I think it's definitely

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.400
that I love it and it's just any person that you speak to has the potential and quite often does

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.080
add a whole mother open door after door after door and you look through and you think wow there's so

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:41.840
much more and I think even the language of love and hate as you know uh is is so is a little bit

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.160
misleading it's it's not that you love it or hate it is that it matters to you it matters to you

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.480
deeply and so those simple binaries of good and evil or love and hate they it doesn't capture

01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:03.200
the ambiguity of of what this field discloses and um all that you can say with sincerity is that this

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:11.440
this material means something to me in a deep way uh even if articulating that meaning is always

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:18.800
going to be inchoate and unclear to the point that people like ourselves are just so inspired

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.880
that we dedicate a significant amount of our life to trying to share that or at least invite or as

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:31.680
I would say offering we're offering other people the opportunity to to explore these I really like

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:38.720
Natalie this idea of existential offering I think there's such a wonderful uh openness about that

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:45.520
phrase what can I offer you and and how can I open you up to the relevance and significance

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.280
of these ideas I think that's a a really neat part of the project thank you I I thought of that when

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.640
I was when I was sitting during my training and I was just being exposed to all of these different

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.840
ideas and I was trying to establish which one I'm supposed to resonate with which particular theory

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:11.200
and how I'm supposed to take it all on board and it suddenly dawned on me that that's not at least

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:19.520
for me that's not what existential philosophies are about they're so magnificently vast and complex

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:25.920
and they will have completely different meanings to each person in each moment depending on where

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:32.720
their situation is and it each one offer an opportunity and offer a different angle and

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:41.040
it's up to us whether we take it or leave it or put it aside for later I agree I agree on that note

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:50.400
how would you describe your existential offering as it were um I guess my existential offering

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:57.920
would in the in the bluntest possible way recognize that this life is not a dress rehearsal

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.920
this is the only life you have this day is the only day that is exist that exists right now and

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.080
remind yourself or be vigilant to the idea that this this is this existence is precarious

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.040
and it's unstable and it's uncertain and that you can't take things for granted

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.320
you can't you can't take these relationships for granted you can't take the beauty of a sunset

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.440
or a rainy afternoon for granted a good meal for granted or a good cup of coffee

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:38.320
treasure those moments because they can be snatched away from you at any time and I think

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:47.440
recognizing that life is not a dress rehearsal will will bring a measure of intensity and urgency

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.880
to aspects of our life that we all too often take for granted

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.440
and why is that intensity and urgency so so important

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:06.000
well because it reminds us of how beautiful and precious this life is and and mysterious

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:14.960
and gracious this life is and um if if you're happy with your an existence where you're just

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:23.120
pulled along by the shallows of everyday life um so much the better for you but my sense is that

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:30.480
most of us don't want to live that way we want to live with a sense that this is a life worth living

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.320
that this is a life that can have deep meaning if we so choose regardless of the career path that

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:42.320
we take it can be embodied in our relationships in the care that we have for our our our sick and

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:48.960
dying parents the way that we love and take care of our children uh or the environment or the natural

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:58.880
world uh and so um my sense is without that measure of intensity and urgency it's not as much of a

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:10.000
life worth living unfortunately I pick up on how you're saying I sense I sense I sense and is this

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.680
what you were referring to in in your in your work earlier when you were saying that this embodied

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:24.400
we're embodied beings as well we're phenomenological beings as well we're not just these yeah yeah I

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.840
mean one of the things one of the great insights of the existentialists is that the human condition

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:36.000
is disclosed to us not through theoretical reflection it's disclosed to us through feelings

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:45.360
through moods through affective experience and um we the the the argument or the suggestion is that

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:52.000
we we feel when we're inauthentic and that feeling is knowledge we know when we're not being true to

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.800
ourselves we know when we're wearing we're wearing masks and and being self-deceptive how do we know

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:07.840
it feels a certain way you see and we are feeling authenticity also feels a certain way uh it we

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:15.120
feel a particular kind of mood that's atmospheric and it colors our our our entire life

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:24.160
you see it's making me think of how many times we can have this feeling and one that we're not

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.960
finding pleasant and one that we're wanting to change and we're finding uncomfortable when

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:34.640
but we're we're staying we're living with it we can do that for for hours or weeks or months or

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:41.920
years we can live with this sense that we our life is not is not being lived and experienced in the

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.240
way that perhaps it should be but yet we're not changing it and that is that embodied sense of

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:55.120
discomfort and i think that you know one of the one of the the underlying themes i think in in

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:03.440
almost all existential philosophy is is courage that you have to have the courage or or steadiness

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.600
to be true to who you are and and whenever you feel yourself get sucked back into a life of

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.240
self-deception which is always going to happen it's inevitable it's again it's structural to the

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:22.960
human condition uh in authenticity to have the courage to to question that temptation uh to

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.720
challenge it to remind yourself what is at stake in life to remind yourself that this is a day that

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.640
you may not get that that the future is an illusion you don't get it tomorrow but tomorrow's not guaranteed

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.720
and so why are you going to go to that cocktail party why are you going to join that committee

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.200
why are you going to waste that time in a in a conversation that's going to have no bearing

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.000
on your existence is there is there other better ways to live better ways to spend the very limited

01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:03.120
time that you have on earth how in those situations do you have the courage to keep going um it's a

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:13.520
good question uh i i remind myself every day i try to remind myself with a mantra every day

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.480
life is short life is short be grateful life is short be grateful i'll say that actually in my car

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.120
when i'm driving to work and when i'm walking onto campus i'll be remind i'll remind myself be

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.200
grateful this day this day this is the only day and it's hard sometimes you know you get sucked

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.560
into the things they sucked into everydayness and and you lose touch with that but i try to

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:46.320
develop a kind of practice this is what what Aristotle calls frenesis it's a practical wisdom

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:52.560
that becomes habit it becomes part of who you are so you don't have to try anymore to be grateful

01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:00.000
you don't have to try anymore to to uh uh be aware of your own temporality or your own finitude

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.200
it it's it just becomes who you are and so you see the sunsets in florida differently you see the

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:15.360
blue sky in a different way you see the trees on campus in a different way and um uh that's that's

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:24.240
practical wisdom and i hugely appreciate your honesty with that with that question because

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:30.160
i think confronting confronting truth confronting life confronting existence

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:36.640
can be exhausting and overwhelming and there are moments that we don't just innately have

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.000
that courage flaring up within us to keep going and to keep exploring but what you're

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.200
sharing here is that this is not just a passive process this is an active engagement

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:56.640
that's right and that's again a central theme in in existentialist philosophy i mean

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.640
sart and buvor actually call it engage literature that the the writing has to be engaged with the

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:14.400
concrete realities of existence and we have to bring that engagement into our own lives

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.720
so that it's not just something that we scribble down on a page it's something that we embody

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:25.920
in in our everyday lives and and it's hard work it's very difficult because self-deception is

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:33.440
very easy it's easy to be inauthentic and it's nice it's comforting and and and tranquilizing

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.480
as heidegger says and also that it you know we we go through that phase where it was respectful to

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.520
be to tranquilize ourselves it was respectful to switch off our questioning brain and to cue

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.920
up in the playground and and sit down in the classroom and study something that isn't

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.000
connecting with you we're trained to do that and you're you're told off if you're not and you're

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:04.560
being respectful if you do and then suddenly it all changes again and yeah i agree i agree

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:13.360
but thank you so much for sharing today kevin i'm wondering was it a real pleasure to have this

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:21.040
conversation and i hope that whoever sees it appreciates it as well and it was really

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.960
fun for me to have this talk and may hopefully our paths will cross sometime in real life

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.160
in the future i'm sure we'll make that happen and i'm sure it will inspire i hope so too

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:39.440
thank you so much kevin it's my pleasure okay we'll talk soon bye bye bye

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.740
you
