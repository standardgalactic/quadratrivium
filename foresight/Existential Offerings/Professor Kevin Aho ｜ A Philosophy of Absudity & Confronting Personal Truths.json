{"text": " So welcome, Kevin. Thank you so, so much for coming along today. What an amazing way to start the week. I really appreciate your time here. So for those who are not familiar with yourself or with your work, how would you introduce yourself? Well, I am Kevin Aho. I'm a professor of philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University. I've been here in Florida since 2004 at this university. And I'm also the chair of the Department of Communication and Philosophy at the university right now. I did, I had kind of a convoluted journey through graduate school. I started out at the new school for social research in New York City and then moved to University of Utah and Salt Lake City and then finished up my PhD at the University of South Florida in Tampa, where I studied with a very important figure in existential philosophy, an especially Heidegger, a fellow named Charles Guillaume, who sadly passed away this past summer, but had a long and influential career and taught a lot of students. And so that's that's the brief condensed version of who I am. And I consider myself a specialist in existential philosophy, phenomenology of the body, and areas of existential psychotherapy and phenomenological psychotherapy. Now, phenomenology of the body is not something that I come across people saying a lot as their specialties. Yeah, yeah, it's a it's a it's a booming field right now. It's largely indebted to the renewed interest in the work of Maurice Meryl Ponte and some important and seminal feminist figures, obviously, Simone de Beauvoir, one and Iris Marion Young, another figure. And it's simply a recognition that the body is not something we have, and that we're only contingently connected to. It's who we are, we are our bodies, we exist through our bodies, we live through the vehicle of our bodies. And so it's an attempt to undermine that classic Cartesian dualism that the human being is composed of two distinct substances and an immaterial mind in a causally determined body. And phenomenology undoes that dualism in helpful ways. So you spoke slightly about your your kind of academic journey into this amazing field of philosophy and of existentialism. But what drew you to want to specialize in existentialism in the first place? How did you stumble upon this, this particular? Yeah, it's a good question. I came from a family of intellectuals. My father was a professor of sociology, but mostly kind of German social theory and was raised, came of age during the counterculture revolution in the 60s and early 70s, when existentialism was all the rage and everyone was carrying around tattered copies of Camus and Sartre and Beauvoir. And and my parents met in graduate school. And so I was surrounded by books growing up. And I in my second semester of college, I was actually an engineering major in college, believe it or not. And the second semester of college, I read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov during the winter break. And the book had a transformative impact on me. And it raised all of these deep existential questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, the problems of nihilism, the experiences of anxiety and the face of death. And it awakened me to the fact that I've had these experiences. I feel this in my everyday life. And I changed my major to philosophy and never looked back. And many other aspects of philosophy I find uninteresting and boring, metaphysics and epistemology, even much of ethics, moral philosophy, I find boring and turgid. But existentialism always inspired me and shaped me. And it has stayed with me since I was 18 or 19 years old. And I had powerful experiences in my early adulthood and late adolescence of hanging out with my high school friends, you know, getting high and having a few beers under the stars, and talking about the meaning of life. And what is it all about? And who are we? And why are we here? And I realized that those were the questions of the existentials, right? Those are deep and important existential questions. And unfortunately, as we move into adulthood and find our way into careers and family life, we oftentimes lose touch with those important questions. And we kind of drift along in our existence until there's a crisis or a breakdown. And suddenly we wake up again to how important existential thinking is. And so that has kind of been the arc of my life. It's always been shaped and informed by an existential attitude or an existential orientation. It sounds like you genuinely connected with the kind of existential questions and never were able to kind of shake them away rather than stumbling across a textbook in a formalized module and saying, okay, I better learn this theory. You've felt the questions within you. That was a visceral experience. It wasn't about a vocation. It wasn't about even getting a job as a philosophy professor. It was about a way of existing. And so I would be doing existentialism if I was managing a restaurant or working in middle management somewhere for a company. I would still be watching existential films, listening to existential music, reading existential poetry and all of the things that move me, as you say, viscerally or in a mooted way. Because they speak to the concerns at the core of our condition. These are the ultimate concerns of our lives. And so yeah, they've had a powerful orienting impact on me. You bring up something for me, which is the fact that you're going through that phase of life when you're younger and you're chatting with your friends and you're asking these massive, massive questions, these really deep questions. And then you fade into a life where you're not what you're not supposed to be asking these questions. I remember for me, I don't know about you, but it was kind of almost stigmatized to ask why rather than to just follow, to question these deep meanings rather than to just pick a career and follow it. I don't know if you can relate to that. Oh, certainly I can. And it's, you know, just because we are kind of sucked into the shallows of social convention and go with the flow of everyday life, the existentialists make it clear that that's not a moral failing. It's not as if you're doing something wrong. It's just part of the inertia of being human, that we're always going to be, Heidegger has this language of temptation, we're tempted by the they or the public world, because it's comfortable, it's predictable, it's well ordered, and it covers over the anxiety, that kind of quivering unease, that all human beings experience an unease that reminds us that there's something wrong with us, that there's something disconnected or out of sync with us and the world. And it's because we're conscious, it's because we're self aware that we're aware that we're going to die, we're aware that God is dead, and there are no moral absolutes. And so I think existentialists are just deeply attuned to the fragility and weakness of human beings, that we drift to religion, we drift to comfort, we drift to social norms, because it shelters us and it protects us. It's not a bad thing, it's just, it's structural to the human condition. But thankfully in life, we have breakdown experiences, where that comfortable facade collapses and we're forced to confront ourselves and face who we are. And that's why anxiety conditions, whether you call it anxiety, if you're Kierkegaard or Nazia, if you're Sard, or absurdity, if you're Camus, or the horror of the nothing, if you're Nietzsche, all of these experiences are edifying experiences because they jolt us out of our rootinized drift and force us to face ourselves and to face our existence. And so the existentialists do something counterintuitive, and that is they tell us that anxiety is a good thing, it's a teacher, it's not something that should be medicated necessarily, it's not something that should be controlled with cognitive behavioral therapy necessarily. That's not to say that those things shouldn't be included in a treatment plan, but we should listen and attend to those experiences because they're teaching us valuable lessons about who we are. Because I always have heard that existentialism gets a bad rep for being too focused on the negative, too focused on the dark, but I, similarly to what you've just said, have never experienced like that. There's always been a sensation that it acknowledges and explores the darker side that is inevitably going to be there, whether you're facing it or not. And actually, if you're able to explore these different philosophies, these different perspectives on the dark and really confront and really explore what that means for you, you are empowering yourself in the way that nothing, no denial or no putting it to the side will ever, ever do. And that's one of the recurring misconceptions about existentialism, that it's a dark, brooding, navel-gazing philosophy. It's not at all. The idea is when you confront death and face death, you awaken to the fact that life is not a dress rehearsal, that this is the only life you have and confronting finitude, facing anxiety, injects a measure of intensity and urgency and vitality into our existence that otherwise it wouldn't have. And this is why Nietzsche calls his philosophy a gay science. It's a happy philosophy. It's not a morbid philosophy. It's a joyful philosophy. And Kierkegaard will say the same thing, right, that when you confront death, it opens us up to how precious and poignant and fragile every moment is, because it can be snatched away from us at any time. And so in many ways existentialism, at least for me, is the most life-affirming of all philosophies. It's not a death-focused philosophy at all. It's reminding us of how precious each moment is and that we can't take any day for granted. Now I jumped straight into existential philosophies and I am not as familiar with other philosophies. So how would you distinguish between what differentiates existential philosophies from other philosophies? Well, I mean, just in terms of academic specialties, in Anglo-American philosophy, existentialism is completely marginalized because it doesn't focus on the core issues of truth and knowledge and the nature of reality and what is the best, what is good conduct, what ought we to do. Existentialism doesn't care about any of that generally because the concern is not on philosophical abstractions. What is the nature of beauty, truth, justice, the good life? No, actually that's not true. They're concerned with the good life. The existentialist is concerned with what does it mean to be human? What is existence? And so what the existentialists do is they shift the philosophical orientation away from theoretical detachment where we theorize about abstract forms and turn our attention to the concrete flesh and blood particulars of everyday life, which is what existence engages or is involved in. And so it's a complete reversal of the traditional philosophical orientation that we inherit from Plato and Aristotle and that gets refined and consolidated with figures like Descartes and Kant. It's not a philosophy rooted in theoretical reflection, it's a philosophy rooted in attentiveness to the concreteness of our existence, of our being. And that means it focuses on the way we live every day, the moods we feel, the affective experiences that shape us and shock us into awareness like those anxiety moods or nausea moods. And so it's always been a kind of peripheral fringe philosophy in the UK and the United States, obviously less so in the Golden Age of French philosophy and German philosophy in the 20s and 30s and teens. But thankfully that's starting to change. And one of the drivers of this change is a recognition that because existentialism focuses on concrete existence, it can expand the philosophical perspective to include voices that have been traditionally marginalized in the philosophical mainstream. So feminist philosophy, of course, was in many ways inaugurated by Simone de Beauvoir. Critical race theory was deeply impacted by Frans Fanon who was a student of Sartre and Beauvoir's and was influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponte. And so these other forms of philosophical approach that have never had a voice at the table are finally being seen as bona fide philosophical perspectives that in my view are in many ways indebted to existentialism by focusing on the concrete and the particular instead of abstract universal forms or essences. I know this is me speaking from a completely biased perspective but I hear when you say that it makes me find it hard to imagine why other philosophies have the ability to matter if we haven't understood what it is to be ourselves. If we haven't understood the kind of existential aspect of existence, why does it matter what's right or wrong if we don't know what we are? Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I find most of Anglophone philosophy quite boring and uninteresting because of that. And as a teacher, the classes that excite the students and engage the students and inspire the students are existentially themed courses because they're at that stage in life where they're asking those questions. What am I doing? What is it about? Why am I majoring in this and not in that? And how is this going to shape the future of my life? And so when we start talking about Friedrich Nietzsche or Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Saag, the students resonate to these questions because they're feeling them right now at age 18, 19, 20, 21 and they're going to have to confront those really serious concerns. They're not so passionate about abstract metaphysical speculation. Those are interesting and curious thought puzzles but they're curious in the same way that I'm curious about getting good at chess or figuring out the New York Times crossword puzzle. Those thought experiments or philosophical curiosities don't keep me up at night. They don't wake me up at 3 a.m. where I'm jolted awake and I think what's the meaning of my life? That's existentialism. That's more important. Yeah, there's a difference between intellectual fascination, intellectual curiosity and kind of an inherent questioning that you're saying kind of innately surfaces at certain times of life you're saying and in certain experiences, for example, this really life-shattering or life-questioning experiences. Yeah, exactly. And we have been obviously discussing the phenomenon but we have not been defining the phenomenon. If that is possible, how would you define it? Well, existentialism as a technical term is almost beyond a clear definition and it's an ism, as I write in my book, that really is misleading. It's not like rationalism or empiricism or or scientism or naturalism. It doesn't refer to a unified philosophical school and the word wasn't introduced until the 1940s by Gabriel Marcell and Marcell used that word to refer to the philosophies of Sartre and Beauvoir but existentialism as a word didn't exist in the 19th century so Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, the word didn't even exist. But I think to get a sense of the overall contours of what the word refers to, it refers to a philosophical focus on what it means to be human. What does it mean for a human being to exist? And the idea is that we exist in a way that's fundamentally different from the way this water bottle exists or this cell phone exists. We are not substances, we're not static things that are objectively present to be studied. We are activities or processes or happenings so existence is an event for humans. It's an event of self-making or self-fashioning. We make ourselves who we are through the meaning-giving choices that we undertake as our lives unfold. And this is what Sartre means when he says existence precedes essence. There is no pre-given essence that determines who we are. We make ourselves who we are by choices, by actions. And those actions are always constrained by our embodiment, our social historical situation, our gendered or sexual situation. So it's not as if our self-created, the activity of self-creation is completely unhinged. It's not completely undetermined. It's situated and constrained by what the existentialists call facticity, the facticity of who we are. And so what we do as humans is we are in a struggle or a tension between the givens of our situation and our capacity to interpret and give meaning to those givens. And the existentialists call that transcendence. So we're always in this tension between transcendence and facticity. And that struggle is existence itself, right? I'm giving meaning to the fact that I'm a man in the 21st century who's white and middle class and for the time being ambulatory and able-bodied. And I'm going to have to interpret and give meaning to that factical determination as it changes and shifts and is modified throughout the course of my life. And of course what that means is that the process of self-making is finite. It's temporal. It comes to an end. In other words, we make ourselves who we are with the recognition that that process of self-making is finite, that we are beings on the way towards death. And we don't like that. That scares us. So oftentimes we live in a way that is in denial or flight from our own finitude, from our own mortality. And that's why most of our lives are inauthentic, or in the words of Sartre and Beauvoir, in bad faith. We live in a state of self-deception most of our lives. And we think in the course of our lives that there's something real and enduring and lasting about our existence. But the existentialists want to remind us that there is nothing real, enduring or lasting about our existence. Our existence is finite. And that's not a bad thing. It's just part of what it means to be human, and we need to kind of own up to that. And so central to that process of authentic self-creation is a kind of honesty, that we need to be honest with ourselves and cut away all of the layers of self-deception that we carry with ourselves to protect us from the horror of our finitude, the horror of our contingency. So one of the things that the existentialists say is that we exist, but we don't have to exist. There's no reason for us to exist. We just happen to be thrown into existence. And against the backdrop of our thrownness, we now have to make ourselves into who we are. And that's a huge burden. That's the burden of freedom. It's dizzying and anxiety provoking. And we don't like to accept that either. And that's why we like to be told what to do. We like our priests to tell us what to do, our therapists to tell us what to do, our pop psychologists to tell us how to live our lives. We don't want to do it on our own. And of course, what the existentialists want to say is, you're always on your own anyway. You've got to be honest with yourself. So that's the cliff notes version of existentialism. Hard to define, but there are kind of central features built into it. Freedom, authenticity, temporality, all of these things kind of undergird all of the existentialist philosophers. The problem, unfortunately, is that some of the most significant voices in existentialism aren't philosophers at all. They're novelists like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. They're poets like Reiner Maria Rilke. They're filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa. They're playwrights like Sartre and novelists like Beauvoir. And so existentialism expands far beyond the academic world. It's not exclusive to philosophers. It's open to anyone who's sincerely concerned about the human condition and is anxious about what it means to be human and is trying to articulate and express that anxiety or that concern. And there are also religious existentialists and atheistic existentialists. And so not all existentialists are following Nietzsche's maxim that God is dead. Many of the most important existentialists were theistic existentialists like Dostoevsky, like Paul Tillich, like Martin Buber. And there are some existentialists that don't believe in free will, like Nietzsche. He thinks free will is a fiction. It's an illusion. But most existentialists have some conception of freedom, of free will. And so this is why it's so difficult to demarcate the boundaries of what existentialism is. Yet there are these familiar names that are going to generally be coming across when you're studying it, especially from an academic point of view. And it's making me think who, how, how did these particular names get selected and put into the textbooks? And why are they the ones kind of being regurgitated and shared, not that there's anything not completely marvelous about what they're sharing and that they shouldn't be shared? But why them? Why not anyone else? Because they're the ones that do it. They're the ones that engage the human condition in the most powerful and accessible and visceral way. And so other novelists may talk about the human condition in certain ways, but very few do it the way Dostoevsky does it, in crime and punishment or in the Brothers Karamazah. Very few articulate the experience of confronting death like Tolstoy does and the death of Ivan Iliac. Very few capture the despair in the face of the dizzying abyss of existence like Soren Kierkegaard does and sickness unto death. So these are the figures that engage the human condition in the most powerful way. But there are other marginal figures or figures on the periphery that do it in different ways. But in my view, they may not do it as well. And or some may not have been discovered yet, who knows. But when it comes to the major figures, they're major for a reason. Because their legacy is enduring and lasting because they tend to do it better than anyone else. And it being they speak to that humanness within you to that unspeakable part of you, which is just craving stimulation, craving questions, craving answers. And they allow this kind of internal communication with that being. And that's why they're well, it's, it's, I mean, I don't know if it's craving stimulation or craving answers. I mean, one of the things that the existentialist will say is that craving for stimulation is actually a form of denial. We want to be stimulated and distracted from our human condition. And there are no answers to the human condition. What the existentialist want to do is put us in a state of questionability, that there is no answer to the question what it means to be human. You have to find that for yourself. You have to give your life meaning. So there are no, it is not as if the existentialist lays out a guidebook to being who you are. That's the scary part about existentialism. It's up to you to find out what this means. This is why Nietzsche, for instance, is so famous for cautioning his readers. Don't become Nietzscheans. Don't follow me. Follow yourself. You need to, you need to carve out your existence and give meaning to your existence in the way that matters to you. Nietzsche did it for himself, but you're not Nietzsche. You have to do it in your own way. Kierkegaard calls this subjective truth. It's a truth that no one else has access to. It's your truth that belongs to you. And it's going to be inco-parent and unintelligible to anyone else. And that's why it's precious to who you are. So one of the tricky things about existentialism is a philosophy, and actually this is kind of true to philosophy in general. Answers aren't part of the project. The project is to immerse yourself in the questions, or as Rilke says, live the questions, exist the questions, and be comfortable in the mystery and the ambiguity of the human condition. The more we try to find reasons or grounds for our existence, the further away from authenticity we drift. Does that make sense? And that is my observation of what is causing people the deepest pain, is when they are needing that answer to what ultimately can't be answered, because it is just life. It is just your decision. You wake up each day and either do the very much similar thing that you did yesterday, or you be a completely different version of yourself doing a completely different thing, there is just infinite ambiguity if you're willing to experience it. Yeah, and so I think one of the measures of authenticity or being true to ourselves is to learn how to be comfortable with or to dwell in uncertainty, to dwell in mystery and ambiguity, and don't recoil from it or don't try to control it and master it, but to immerse yourself in it. And that is the human condition. It is a fundamentally ambiguous and uncertain predicament. And the more we try to control it and manipulate it and master it, the more anxious we become. And this is one of the key features of it in existential psychotherapy. The more you try to control your anxiety, the more your anxiety takes control of you. The more you befriend your anxiety and welcome your anxiety and dwell in it, the less control it has over you, the less power it has over you. For someone that might be watching this and really sitting there struggling with their mental well-being or with their experience of life, and they were hoping that existential ideas might alleviate some of that, what would you recommend for them in terms of either just exploration or particular sources? Well, it's hard for me to say because I'm not a clinician and I'm not a mental health counselor. And I think it's a case-by-case situation. I think one of the stereotypes of existentialism is that it's anti-psychiatry. And this is an orientation that was really pioneered by figures like Artie Lang, who was deeply inspired by existentialism, especially the work of John Paul Sarge. And the idea is that any medical intervention that blunts or covers over our freedom or our confrontation with our condition is dehumanizing and problematic. I don't think that's true at all. I think some people need pharmaceutical assistance, medication. I think some people need instrumental psychotherapies like cognitive and behavioral therapy. And so my approach to this from a mental health perspective is very much an eclectic approach. You use what works. I think someone in the grips of full-blown panic and anxiety, Nietzsche is not going to help that person. Kierkegaard's not going to help that person. In fact, it could inflame the situation and amplify it. However, if the anxiety is controlled or mediated in some sense with an antidepressant or with some form of cognitive and behavioral therapy, that may allow that suffer to begin the hard work of existential psychotherapy. And so I would certainly not employ existential psychotherapy as a first line of treatment in every situation by any means. But I think existential psychotherapy has to be employed for lasting change, to occur for lasting and significant transformation to happen and growth to happen. And so yeah, I think that's kind of the way I would go about it. Which could almost be summarized as saying work out on a kind of on an individual basis, on a unique basis. And also I would argue in unique to each moment, because so I do work as a practitioner and I'm obviously highly influenced by existential philosophies in my work. But what I'm going to do with a client one day or how we will be together in a session one day is going to be fundamentally different perhaps than the previous week or the next week. And I feel that from my perspective, at least, there's something about having these philosophical ideas, having these concepts, having these key themes, almost within myself as lenses or perspectives to have as an alternative way to look, and especially a lot of it's rooted in not being able to change, not being able to make a change. I think that's right. And I think one of the great insights of existentialism is the recognition that anxiety and despair are not medical conditions. They should be medicalized as discrete medical entities. They are structural to the human condition. They're inescapable. Everyone is going to have powerful and life shattering anxiety moments. And and many, most of us will have them over and over again throughout our lives as we get to go through a divorce or our parents die or we lose our job or we suffer a serious illness. All of those experiences are going to shatter us. And we're going to have to confront ourselves. But to say that that experience of existential shattering or anxiety in the face of our own finitude is a medical condition is really problematic in my view. Because what the egg doesn't mean they shouldn't be treated and assisted with with pharmaceuticals or or or CBT or something like this. What the existentialists want to remind us is that these are instructive edifying opportunities for personal growth and transformation. Right. They're awakenings. And if we just blunt these awakenings with with tranquilizers or or are trained to not attend to them and and and avoid them, you're never going to have those those transformative opportunities that that anxiety can bring to us. Do you feel that there have been moments in your own life when this is applied? Oh, God. Countless times in my life, every major breakdown, every crisis existentialism has helped me. Three years ago, I had a massive heart attack while on a 60 mile bike ride, something I did regularly. I was kind of a fitness advocate and and a health nut. And I had a massive heart attack. And my whole world collapsed. My identity as a professor, my identity as a as a physically fit middle aged man, my identity as a as a partner or in terms of my relationships. And existentialism helped me work through that trauma and and come through the other side, I think, as a better human being with a deeper perspective about life's frailty and precariousness and woke me up to living with a sense of urgency and vitality and intensity that it's you inevitably get sucked away from in the drift of professional life or or family obligations and work obligations and so on. So existentialism has through throughout my life from from 18 years old on, numerous breakdowns, divorce, you know, sicknesses, losses of friends to cancer and illness has has pulled me through and and deepened my life and and opened up opportunities for growth and transformation. And so it has been whether it's it's through existential literature or reading Heidegger again or teaching Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sard in the classroom. It's always been therapeutic for me. I appreciate you sharing and I suppose because I'm socialized to think it I'm almost instinctively when you hear someone's experience of trauma you want to instinctively say I'm so sorry that you had that experience but I'm learning more and more and especially with you sharing this this brilliant this growth beyond and these new insights that you gain from it. There's almost a sense that well I'm not sorry that you had that experience in a way you're saying that it contributed beautifully to your life. And that's actually the the great gift of existential philosophy is that these these traumas and crises I mean you don't want you don't want to romanticize them you don't want to romanticize suffering and that's always a temptation in existential philosophy that he or she who suffers the most is the deepest and the most authentic that's just nonsense and I don't think that's a right an accurate depiction of what the existentious are trying to do. But the recognition that that that trauma and suffering and breakdowns awaken us to life's frailty and its poignancy and remind us not to take our relationships for granted or our day for granted that it could be snuffed out at any time are tremendously valuable life lessons and they improve and enhance our lives they don't diminish it at all they make us in my view better people more compassionate more understanding more sympathetic to the suffering of others and and so so I I think you're right that that cliche I'm so sorry this happened I'm so sorry for your loss those losses are opportunities for growth those those those deaths are our opportunities for transformation and and Kierkegaard is great with this I mean Kierkegaard goes so far as to say God wants you to die God wants you to die to the world because when you die to the world the world comes back to you in a way that's more vibrant and intense and urgent than it was before so so the idea is to die over and over throughout your life and every time you die the world comes back with more vibrancy intensity and poignancy and and during that process you you prepare for your actual death in Rilke's words you learn how to die which is the the most important lesson that a philosopher can teach how can you learn how to die I'm I'm aware that it could be really easy for someone to for someone to sit here and hear this and think it will it's so easy for you guys to speak theoretically about embracing the opportunities that suffering provides but hey I'm sitting here with a real-life experience of suffering and I have no idea how to how how do we do that especially when we haven't had you know the advantage of years of actual philosophical engagement yeah it's a it's a very difficult question I mean some people won't most people most people will live lives of deep suffering and meaninglessness and that's just the part of the predicament of being human many people live sad ordinary lives that are bereft of deep meaning and significance Tolstoy says it great in the in the death of Ivan Iliak he says Ivan Iliak lived an ordinary simple life and therefore it was a life that was most terrible and that's the life that most of us will live and this is why I think Natalie projects like the ones that you're doing which are trying to give voice to this the importance of existentialism are so important education is important good liberal arts humanities education is important reading great literature watching good film listening to good music those are all important edifying experiences that speak to the human condition in so far as those those movies and and pieces of literature and and and pieces of music speak to the human condition and so again you know sadly most of us are going to suffer and and not have the wisdom that the existential tradition can open and open us up to and one of the things that I do in my work is I try to popularize existentialism by writing about it and by giving talks on it and by giving going to conferences and being a Pied Piper to my students about how important these these questions and ideas are and so I try to incorporate that wisdom into everything that I do in my conversations with my friends with my partner with my colleagues reminding them that this this petty squabble about academic bureaucracy doesn't really matter don't get hung up on it because you're going to die and you're going to die at any time and so put yourself put things in perspective what really matters in the grand scheme of things and Irvin Yalam the great existential psychotherapist refers to this as trivializing the trivial we realize that these things that we worry about most of the time in our lives are trivial stupid wastes of time that there are much bigger more significant issues on the table like living a meaningful life and and being a decent human being and how generally does that go down when you're engaging with people who are are living in the trivial who are embracing the trivial conversations and you're like hold up you know that is trivial let's let's talk about something it's a really good question I mean you have to be careful because it's not going to register for most people I mean most people like Kevin he's so dramatic I mean he's such an intellectual he's always talking about these heavy things but if you're if you're sensitive and mindful to the speaking position of other people you can do it in ways that are thoughtful and and sensitive and so you don't want to bludgeon someone with existential philosophy and say wake up wake up you can be thoughtful by asking questions like what does that mean for you why is this worrying you why is this concerning to you with my students it's a little bit different I can be a little bit more blunt because I am a teacher and they're learning this material so I can shove it down their throats whether they like it or not but with my friends and my family and my colleagues you have to be a little bit more indirect and and thoughtful and recognize that these ideas are quite scary and can be terrifying if you've never dipped your toe into existential philosophy before and that most of our culture is built in such a way as to deny these concerns right that that most of our cultural institutions are set up in a way that we don't have to face the the the existential givens right we don't have to face death we don't have to face absurdity we don't have to confront anxiety and and um and so so you you want to be cautious in terms of how you bring this up but but oftentimes it means that I just cut some people out of my life if they're not willing to engage so I I don't have a lot of friends maybe for that reason but it's the same reason why I don't have friends who are Donald Trump supporters I just there's no reason for me to waste my time with someone who is a dogmatic follower of dog Donald Trump I have nothing really to say to them in the same way that it'd be very hard for me to try to gently broach the idea that maybe God is an invention to someone who is deeply ensconced in a religious faith and their identity hinges on the idea that God has to exist it'd be very hard for me to disentangle that person from those deeply held convictions I could suggest some literature maybe some books but it wouldn't be a conversation that I'd be interested in having I remember really early on in my training one of the lecturers must have just supervised some students because it was obviously quite fresh for her but she was saying that they'd conducted their entire thesis on the potentially damaging and and ending results that engaging in existential philosophy can have on interrelationships be that with partners intimate relationships with friends with family members because it you know we speak about you spoke there about choosing to move away but it almost becomes and I've spoken with colleagues it almost becomes intolerable not to think deeply not to see things as trivial when they are trivial yeah I agree and I and I think and I don't want to be harsh about this but um it's okay to cut people out of your life that have no that that aren't that aren't bringing meaning and value to your existence and and with family members it's much more difficult because there are our long-standing connections of intimacy but I I don't have much problem disconnecting from friends that don't really see the relevance of these kinds of questions or concerns and I also have a very hard time with small talk and gossip it makes me very uncomfortable so so going to cocktail parties or where people are just talking about trivial things that makes me quite anxious and unnerved and and I don't like that but if a conversation at a party is involving real serious existential questions I'll be there all night and and I'll be passionate about the conversation and so so um uh it for me it's a temperamental orientation temperamentally I I I I'm very uncomfortable with with with surface conversation it makes me it makes me quite anxious and it's the same thing at faculty meetings or department meetings I'm a department chair so I have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and deal with upper administration those meetings I I can't stand I have a very difficult time sitting through that because I see the the the vast waste of time that these meetings suck up in a life and I think okay there's another two hours of my life that I'll never get back that that didn't contribute anything to my to my sense of who I am and so I think some people maybe you're like this uh Natalie that that temperamentally you're just drawn to these ideas it's not something that you can really help it's just it's it's it's it's part of your your constitution and I can confidently say that you have just validated so many of my peers experiences there too when you say you struggle with small talk and and gossip and and I had wondered if that's just because everyone's just coming to the end of this huge huge doctorate journey which is exhausting and overwhelming in itself but perhaps it is part of this it might be part of a deeper existential orientation and you know again if if if a group of friends are sitting around talking about really important life issues I I'm drawn to that like a laser beam and and I will listen and nod my head and contribute where I can but if the conversation is about politics or sports or redecorating a house or installing a backyard gazebo I or what restaurant is good or or who's coming to town in terms of a band or something I could care less I just I my eyes glaze over I mean I can play the game and put on the mask of sociability as good as anyone but um when I go home I'll feel deflated and upset that I lost a few more hours of my life and I'm not sure if you noticed it but I want to reflect back that you said it's those conversations and those meetings which don't contribute to who I am and that is what is antagonizing and frustrating about them yeah and that's not to say that I don't willfully do it and I know it's important work to keep a university going and I know that we have to put on masks to keep the machinery of society lubricated and well oiled and and it's also not a judgmental thing I may come off like I'm being judgmental it's it's it's it's who I am it's I can't help it and I I think some people love small talk and they love gossip and they love cocktail party conversations it's just something that I can't bear it's very difficult for me it takes a tremendous amount of energy to maintain myself at a three or four hour long dinner party where the conversation is just idle chatter it's I mean I have to have two or three glasses of wine just to take the edge off and and cope and that may that may be revealing more about me than I want to suggest but it's it's who I am yeah I don't think it's it's judgmental that it came across I feel like it was very honest but it makes me realize we don't perhaps often get the opportunity to express in a safe space honestly what does and doesn't work for us in life we are often involved with situations that are just part of the pattern of existence and we we tolerate them and we put our masks on and we we navigate them because we we feel that we have to and I think that's a great point Natalie and I think my my my personal view is that everyone deep down is craving for these conversations these deep serious conversations about the meaning of life but they're scary they're they're frightening conversations because they expose so much that we want to keep hidden but I think all of us it's I think it's it's it's built into the human condition we we we are thirsting for these encounters these deep intimate relational encounters what what Martin Buber calls the IU relation where we're open and exposed to the other person and this is what draws people to therapy this is why people go into to therapy because they want to be heard they want to have to have someone listen to them in a way that's sincere and open and they feel safe in that space in that therapeutic encounter and and that safety oftentimes isn't there at us at a social gathering or at a party but the more intimate that that social gathering gets and the more close knit that community of friends and and relations is the greater the opportunity for deeper conversations and and and more penetrating discourse and I wonder where it is in life that we do become so scared of confronting these questions because if you think about children children are constantly just exploring all of many facets of themselves all the many potentials of what life has to offer and they do it with such just innate fearlessness yeah I think we we it gets socialized out of us I think you're right I think children are always the best philosophers they're always philosophically inquisitive and and even inquisitive about the deepest and scariest questions about death you know what happened to our dog what happened to grandma where do they go after they die why why why and as as as young children get socialized in in in school and in educational institutions in in peer relations they're kind of told you don't ask those questions anymore you do what good boys and girls do and and that's a that's sad that's unfortunate and and so we we lose touch with that wide-eyed openness to the questionability of life that all children have and it gets beaten out of us and then there's moments in I think late adolescence early adulthood when it wake when we're woken up again and that's often is happens when you go off to college when you leave home for the first time right either going to college or go off and and practice a trade at 18 or 19 and you leave the home and suddenly those questions come up again who am I what's the meaning of my life and um and and and then we get our degree and we get our job and we start our career we forget those questions until we get our divorce or we we lose our job or we get a critical illness and then we're woken up again and um so I think that that the experience of questionability that children have uh comes back to us at different points in our lives I also think it comes back to us in at the end of life that the older we get the more humble we get the more open we get toward mystery and and questionability and I'm actually finishing a book right now on existentialism and aging and argue that the aging process and the intimacy that aging brings us with grief and loss actually makes us into existentialists I think elder the elderly folk tend to be more receptive to these ideas uh and there's a lot of interesting uh evidence to suggest this that we we actually become existentialists the closer we get to death and the more our future contracts and we realize that we are temporal beings and life is coming to an end you've set my mind off in a thousand different questions that I need to to keep it straight and you're speaking about different literature we've got you know we've got theoretical literature we've got philosophical perhaps novels and you've mentioned poetry and film what about for the person who's sitting there and it's like yeah these these russian or french and western philosophers um that they're not my style like there's no way I could engage with those kind of texts I'm not interested in classical music I'm not a deep person I'm not a hugely academic or intellectual yeah it's a it's a good question I think yeah some people just aren't readers some people aren't intellectually inclined I think one of the great entry ways into existential thinking if you're not a literary type is through film I think there's a lot of really great accessible films that capture the core ideas of existential philosophy and and some of them are blockbusters with some of the great stars in Hollywood and so what what film can do is it can demystify the alienating and intimidating jargon of the existentialists the german terms and the french terms and the technical language that may be a sartre or a bouvoir or a heidegger would employ um and uh I'm thinking of of movies like American Beauty this is the movie by Sam Mendes um The Tree of Life by Terrence Malick um there's a great Nietzschean themed science fiction film called Arrival um uh that was directed by Villeneuve um Akira Kurosawa the great japanese director of course has done so many great existential films the greatest is probably Ikuru um about a man who's who's diagnosed with terminal cancer and he's forced to confront a life that has been largely bereft of meaning and now he's kind of awakened to the urgency of the limited time that he has left and so I think film is a great way to introduce and and these films are cross-cultural it's not as if these are just western filmmakers I mean Ikuru I mean I'm sorry Kurosawa had such a massive impact on western filmmakers that in many ways he was the pioneer not not not hollywood or or french or or american filmmakers and Ingmar Bergman films of course uh anything that Bergman does some Woody Allen films are good although he has demonstrated himself to be a loathsome human being um so that's one way to do it uh is is through indirectly through film and I think that's hugely reassuring and partly what this project is aspiring to do because there isn't for me an obvious go-to place to say I've heard this word this ism as you were speaking about it doesn't it's coming up a lot it seems that it could be something curious but I am not able to read these huge huge tomes I I don't know where to start I don't know where to go and it feels that there's there's there's not just that's kind of stepping stone that opens the door that says actually you know yes okay we there are so many ways to be it highly academic about this and explore it from a highly academic position and and encourage that to be incorporated into different professions and different disciplines but actually we don't have to be so so formal about it too we can sit back at the cinema we can have a conversation with friends we can just look at ourselves and say hey who am I and you could show this interview right I mean this I mean hopefully we're not using too much highfalutin language we're talking in a way that I think everyone could understand and I think even those that aren't that are intimidated by the big novels The Crime and Punishment The Brothers Karamazah many of the most powerful and visceral pieces of existential literature are very short stories the short stories of the death of Yon Ilyak it's you know 50 page story Camus the stranger is a very short story Dostoevsky has a bunch of short stories that are that are powerful and accessible the plays of Jean-Paul Sartre are accessible and pretty easy to follow and so it's not as if you have to to sit down with a thousand page piece of Russian literature to absorb the core ideas you can breeze through you know Camus the stranger at the beach in an afternoon and be jolted into an awareness of of who we are you know and and so there's no reason to be scared of it it's it's accessible in so many different kinds of ways I like how you set the setting there like you can just read a read a nice novel on the beach because you make me realize that it there's almost this sense that philosophy must be done in in a in a dark room with a with a cigar or a brand out in the dark or in the woods or in a classroom but actually I live in Florida I do most of my work at the beach right or outside in the sunshine and and so absolutely yeah we don't have to play that that stereotype of the the serious French intellectual the beret and the black sweater and smoking a cigarette at the coffee shop and it's it's a it can be much more relaxed and and I think it's very accessible and I reckon it was at the time for them as well if half of them were writing at cafes and coffee shops and bars and having these chats and just writing it down scribbling it down and I believe to an exact I mean in in the golden age in the in the 1940s and 50s in France it was everywhere I mean existentialism was in the air and it was in the coffee shops in the in the in the cafe society on the sidewalks but it was also in the air in the United States in that way it was a big driver of the counterculture revolution and and you know Camus and and Sartre and Beauvoir were such important political voices and in speaking to the Vietnam War to to the civil rights movement to the women's movement it was an important part of the new left in in Great Britain and so it was it was in the air it wasn't it wasn't isolated in in academic settings it wasn't there in seminar halls it was it was out in the streets is where existentialism had its had its high point and it'd be wonderful to see that come back in some ways and there are sun glimmers of hope that that's the case I mean there's there's aspects of the Black Lives Matter movement at the United States the Mitu movement the Greta Greta Thernbergs climate strike movement that have real resonances to to existential philosophy uh in terms of conveying the urgency of our situation and so my sense is that existentialism is at a is is is coming back it's coming back uh in and uh being received in ways that it that it hasn't in the past coming back from textbooks and academia into kind of common dialogue and discourse yeah and also yeah I think coming back from from uh a complacency in the face of neoliberal politics and um uh crass materialism I think that that there's nothing like the recognition that the planet may be uninhabitable in 40 years to jolt us into an awakening and I see this a lot with my students I'm not gonna I'm 51 years old so the the urgency of the climate change isn't going to hit me as viscerally but for my 20 year old students they may be living in a planet that is radically different than the one that I'm living in when they're my age and so when we talk about neolism or the death of God and the search for meaning um the climate change crisis can can uh jolt us into an awareness of those kinds of questions and you're bringing us here nicely back into this discussion that existentialism isn't just theoretical it's not just within our mind but it's within our embodied world as well it's in the physical world as well and yeah what this leads back into is what you were sharing about your own your own uh specialities yeah absolutely and my and my own life I mean it's it's it's shaped me in deep ways in my own life it's pulled me through profound catastrophic events in my life uh near-death events and and uh if anything my relationship to this kind of philosophy is more intimate and profound than it's ever been and it's very much different from the the place that I was when I was an 18 or 20 year old uh philosopher enamored by Nietzsche and the radical ideas because I hadn't lived them I hadn't lived these ideas I hadn't experienced them in the visceral way that you know 30 years of life experience teaches you and so the wisdom of these thinkers has has become even more pronounced as I've gotten older and I don't think that's going to change much I think it's it's going to become more pronounced as I move into my 60s and 70s if I get there if I make it to tomorrow you see it does feel like an endless absolutely endless uh journey this the the discovery and exploration of the existential field I don't I I was going to say I don't know if I love it or I hate it but I think it's definitely that I love it and it's just any person that you speak to has the potential and quite often does add a whole mother open door after door after door and you look through and you think wow there's so much more and I think even the language of love and hate as you know uh is is so is a little bit misleading it's it's not that you love it or hate it is that it matters to you it matters to you deeply and so those simple binaries of good and evil or love and hate they it doesn't capture the ambiguity of of what this field discloses and um all that you can say with sincerity is that this this material means something to me in a deep way uh even if articulating that meaning is always going to be inchoate and unclear to the point that people like ourselves are just so inspired that we dedicate a significant amount of our life to trying to share that or at least invite or as I would say offering we're offering other people the opportunity to to explore these I really like Natalie this idea of existential offering I think there's such a wonderful uh openness about that phrase what can I offer you and and how can I open you up to the relevance and significance of these ideas I think that's a a really neat part of the project thank you I I thought of that when I was when I was sitting during my training and I was just being exposed to all of these different ideas and I was trying to establish which one I'm supposed to resonate with which particular theory and how I'm supposed to take it all on board and it suddenly dawned on me that that's not at least for me that's not what existential philosophies are about they're so magnificently vast and complex and they will have completely different meanings to each person in each moment depending on where their situation is and it each one offer an opportunity and offer a different angle and it's up to us whether we take it or leave it or put it aside for later I agree I agree on that note how would you describe your existential offering as it were um I guess my existential offering would in the in the bluntest possible way recognize that this life is not a dress rehearsal this is the only life you have this day is the only day that is exist that exists right now and remind yourself or be vigilant to the idea that this this is this existence is precarious and it's unstable and it's uncertain and that you can't take things for granted you can't you can't take these relationships for granted you can't take the beauty of a sunset or a rainy afternoon for granted a good meal for granted or a good cup of coffee treasure those moments because they can be snatched away from you at any time and I think recognizing that life is not a dress rehearsal will will bring a measure of intensity and urgency to aspects of our life that we all too often take for granted and why is that intensity and urgency so so important well because it reminds us of how beautiful and precious this life is and and mysterious and gracious this life is and um if if you're happy with your an existence where you're just pulled along by the shallows of everyday life um so much the better for you but my sense is that most of us don't want to live that way we want to live with a sense that this is a life worth living that this is a life that can have deep meaning if we so choose regardless of the career path that we take it can be embodied in our relationships in the care that we have for our our our sick and dying parents the way that we love and take care of our children uh or the environment or the natural world uh and so um my sense is without that measure of intensity and urgency it's not as much of a life worth living unfortunately I pick up on how you're saying I sense I sense I sense and is this what you were referring to in in your in your work earlier when you were saying that this embodied we're embodied beings as well we're phenomenological beings as well we're not just these yeah yeah I mean one of the things one of the great insights of the existentialists is that the human condition is disclosed to us not through theoretical reflection it's disclosed to us through feelings through moods through affective experience and um we the the the argument or the suggestion is that we we feel when we're inauthentic and that feeling is knowledge we know when we're not being true to ourselves we know when we're wearing we're wearing masks and and being self-deceptive how do we know it feels a certain way you see and we are feeling authenticity also feels a certain way uh it we feel a particular kind of mood that's atmospheric and it colors our our our entire life you see it's making me think of how many times we can have this feeling and one that we're not finding pleasant and one that we're wanting to change and we're finding uncomfortable when but we're we're staying we're living with it we can do that for for hours or weeks or months or years we can live with this sense that we our life is not is not being lived and experienced in the way that perhaps it should be but yet we're not changing it and that is that embodied sense of discomfort and i think that you know one of the one of the the underlying themes i think in in almost all existential philosophy is is courage that you have to have the courage or or steadiness to be true to who you are and and whenever you feel yourself get sucked back into a life of self-deception which is always going to happen it's inevitable it's again it's structural to the human condition uh in authenticity to have the courage to to question that temptation uh to challenge it to remind yourself what is at stake in life to remind yourself that this is a day that you may not get that that the future is an illusion you don't get it tomorrow but tomorrow's not guaranteed and so why are you going to go to that cocktail party why are you going to join that committee why are you going to waste that time in a in a conversation that's going to have no bearing on your existence is there is there other better ways to live better ways to spend the very limited time that you have on earth how in those situations do you have the courage to keep going um it's a good question uh i i remind myself every day i try to remind myself with a mantra every day life is short life is short be grateful life is short be grateful i'll say that actually in my car when i'm driving to work and when i'm walking onto campus i'll be remind i'll remind myself be grateful this day this day this is the only day and it's hard sometimes you know you get sucked into the things they sucked into everydayness and and you lose touch with that but i try to develop a kind of practice this is what what Aristotle calls frenesis it's a practical wisdom that becomes habit it becomes part of who you are so you don't have to try anymore to be grateful you don't have to try anymore to to uh uh be aware of your own temporality or your own finitude it it's it just becomes who you are and so you see the sunsets in florida differently you see the blue sky in a different way you see the trees on campus in a different way and um uh that's that's practical wisdom and i hugely appreciate your honesty with that with that question because i think confronting confronting truth confronting life confronting existence can be exhausting and overwhelming and there are moments that we don't just innately have that courage flaring up within us to keep going and to keep exploring but what you're sharing here is that this is not just a passive process this is an active engagement that's right and that's again a central theme in in existentialist philosophy i mean sart and buvor actually call it engage literature that the the writing has to be engaged with the concrete realities of existence and we have to bring that engagement into our own lives so that it's not just something that we scribble down on a page it's something that we embody in in our everyday lives and and it's hard work it's very difficult because self-deception is very easy it's easy to be inauthentic and it's nice it's comforting and and and tranquilizing as heidegger says and also that it you know we we go through that phase where it was respectful to be to tranquilize ourselves it was respectful to switch off our questioning brain and to cue up in the playground and and sit down in the classroom and study something that isn't connecting with you we're trained to do that and you're you're told off if you're not and you're being respectful if you do and then suddenly it all changes again and yeah i agree i agree but thank you so much for sharing today kevin i'm wondering was it a real pleasure to have this conversation and i hope that whoever sees it appreciates it as well and it was really fun for me to have this talk and may hopefully our paths will cross sometime in real life in the future i'm sure we'll make that happen and i'm sure it will inspire i hope so too thank you so much kevin it's my pleasure okay
