0	23520	So welcome, Kevin. Thank you so, so much for coming along today. What an amazing way to
23520	29280	start the week. I really appreciate your time here. So for those who are not familiar with
29280	38640	yourself or with your work, how would you introduce yourself? Well, I am Kevin Aho. I'm a professor
38640	48960	of philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University. I've been here in Florida since 2004 at this
48960	55840	university. And I'm also the chair of the Department of Communication and Philosophy
55840	64000	at the university right now. I did, I had kind of a convoluted journey through graduate school.
64800	70720	I started out at the new school for social research in New York City and then moved to
70720	76800	University of Utah and Salt Lake City and then finished up my PhD at the University of South
76800	85520	Florida in Tampa, where I studied with a very important figure in existential philosophy,
85520	92800	an especially Heidegger, a fellow named Charles Guillaume, who sadly passed away this past summer,
93440	101200	but had a long and influential career and taught a lot of students. And so that's that's the brief
101200	108640	condensed version of who I am. And I consider myself a specialist in existential philosophy,
109520	116960	phenomenology of the body, and areas of existential psychotherapy and phenomenological
116960	125520	psychotherapy. Now, phenomenology of the body is not something that I come across people saying
125520	134240	a lot as their specialties. Yeah, yeah, it's a it's a it's a booming field right now. It's
134240	142240	largely indebted to the renewed interest in the work of Maurice Meryl Ponte and some important
142240	151360	and seminal feminist figures, obviously, Simone de Beauvoir, one and Iris Marion Young, another
151360	159360	figure. And it's simply a recognition that the body is not something we have, and that we're
159360	167200	only contingently connected to. It's who we are, we are our bodies, we exist through our bodies,
167200	173360	we live through the vehicle of our bodies. And so it's an attempt to undermine that classic
173360	180320	Cartesian dualism that the human being is composed of two distinct substances and an immaterial mind
180320	187920	in a causally determined body. And phenomenology undoes that dualism in helpful ways.
192480	199680	So you spoke slightly about your your kind of academic journey into this amazing field of
199680	206880	philosophy and of existentialism. But what drew you to want to specialize in existentialism in
206880	214320	the first place? How did you stumble upon this, this particular? Yeah, it's a good question. I came
214320	222320	from a family of intellectuals. My father was a professor of sociology, but mostly kind of German
222320	230400	social theory and was raised, came of age during the counterculture revolution in the 60s and early
230400	239440	70s, when existentialism was all the rage and everyone was carrying around tattered copies of
239440	250480	Camus and Sartre and Beauvoir. And and my parents met in graduate school. And so I was surrounded
250480	260240	by books growing up. And I in my second semester of college, I was actually an engineering major
260240	266880	in college, believe it or not. And the second semester of college, I read Dostoevsky's The
266880	275680	Brothers Karamazov during the winter break. And the book had a transformative impact on me.
276560	283360	And it raised all of these deep existential questions about the meaning of life, the existence of
283360	293840	God, the problems of nihilism, the experiences of anxiety and the face of death. And it awakened
293840	300720	me to the fact that I've had these experiences. I feel this in my everyday life. And I changed
300720	307840	my major to philosophy and never looked back. And many other aspects of philosophy I find
308000	315440	uninteresting and boring, metaphysics and epistemology, even much of ethics, moral philosophy,
315440	329280	I find boring and turgid. But existentialism always inspired me and shaped me. And it has stayed
329280	339120	with me since I was 18 or 19 years old. And I had powerful experiences in my early adulthood and
339120	346240	late adolescence of hanging out with my high school friends, you know, getting high and having a few
346240	352240	beers under the stars, and talking about the meaning of life. And what is it all about? And who are
352240	359280	we? And why are we here? And I realized that those were the questions of the existentials, right?
359280	366400	Those are deep and important existential questions. And unfortunately, as we move into adulthood and
366400	373760	find our way into careers and family life, we oftentimes lose touch with those important
373760	380320	questions. And we kind of drift along in our existence until there's a crisis or a breakdown.
380320	388000	And suddenly we wake up again to how important existential thinking is. And so that has kind
388000	396560	of been the arc of my life. It's always been shaped and informed by an existential attitude or an
396560	406480	existential orientation. It sounds like you genuinely connected with the kind of existential
406560	412800	questions and never were able to kind of shake them away rather than stumbling across
412800	420080	a textbook in a formalized module and saying, okay, I better learn this theory. You've felt the
420080	428320	questions within you. That was a visceral experience. It wasn't about a vocation. It wasn't
428320	434560	about even getting a job as a philosophy professor. It was about a way of existing. And so I would be
434560	441520	doing existentialism if I was managing a restaurant or working in middle management somewhere for a
441520	446800	company. I would still be watching existential films, listening to existential music,
448080	456240	reading existential poetry and all of the things that move me, as you say, viscerally or in a
456240	466080	mooted way. Because they speak to the concerns at the core of our condition. These are the ultimate
466080	474640	concerns of our lives. And so yeah, they've had a powerful orienting impact on me.
478240	485200	You bring up something for me, which is the fact that you're going through that phase of life when
485200	490400	you're younger and you're chatting with your friends and you're asking these massive, massive
490400	495840	questions, these really deep questions. And then you fade into a life where you're not
495840	500320	what you're not supposed to be asking these questions. I remember for me, I don't know about
500320	507280	you, but it was kind of almost stigmatized to ask why rather than to just follow, to question
507280	512000	these deep meanings rather than to just pick a career and follow it. I don't know if you can relate
512080	520160	to that. Oh, certainly I can. And it's, you know, just because we are kind of sucked into
521040	527840	the shallows of social convention and go with the flow of everyday life, the existentialists
527840	534240	make it clear that that's not a moral failing. It's not as if you're doing something wrong. It's just
534960	541920	part of the inertia of being human, that we're always going to be, Heidegger has this
542640	549840	language of temptation, we're tempted by the they or the public world, because it's comfortable,
549840	558240	it's predictable, it's well ordered, and it covers over the anxiety, that kind of quivering
558240	566640	unease, that all human beings experience an unease that reminds us that there's something wrong
566640	574640	with us, that there's something disconnected or out of sync with us and the world. And it's
574640	578880	because we're conscious, it's because we're self aware that we're aware that we're going to die,
578880	588080	we're aware that God is dead, and there are no moral absolutes. And so I think existentialists
588080	597120	are just deeply attuned to the fragility and weakness of human beings, that we drift to religion,
597120	603200	we drift to comfort, we drift to social norms, because it shelters us and it protects us.
603840	611280	It's not a bad thing, it's just, it's structural to the human condition. But thankfully in life,
611280	617840	we have breakdown experiences, where that comfortable facade collapses and we're forced
617840	625200	to confront ourselves and face who we are. And that's why anxiety conditions, whether you call
625200	630720	it anxiety, if you're Kierkegaard or Nazia, if you're Sard, or absurdity, if you're Camus,
632080	640080	or the horror of the nothing, if you're Nietzsche, all of these experiences are edifying
640080	647440	experiences because they jolt us out of our rootinized drift and force us to face ourselves
647440	654320	and to face our existence. And so the existentialists do something counterintuitive, and that is
655600	660880	they tell us that anxiety is a good thing, it's a teacher, it's not something that should be
660880	666000	medicated necessarily, it's not something that should be controlled with cognitive behavioral
666000	671200	therapy necessarily. That's not to say that those things shouldn't be included in a treatment plan,
671840	677200	but we should listen and attend to those experiences because they're teaching us valuable lessons about
677200	687600	who we are. Because I always have heard that existentialism gets a bad rep for being too focused
687600	693680	on the negative, too focused on the dark, but I, similarly to what you've just said, have never
693680	698640	experienced like that. There's always been a sensation that it acknowledges and explores
698640	704160	the darker side that is inevitably going to be there, whether you're facing it or not.
704160	711840	And actually, if you're able to explore these different philosophies, these different perspectives
711840	717760	on the dark and really confront and really explore what that means for you, you are empowering yourself
717760	723280	in the way that nothing, no denial or no putting it to the side will ever, ever do.
724320	729040	And that's one of the recurring misconceptions about existentialism, that it's a dark,
729680	738000	brooding, navel-gazing philosophy. It's not at all. The idea is when you confront death and face death,
738880	745840	you awaken to the fact that life is not a dress rehearsal, that this is the only life you have
746560	754480	and confronting finitude, facing anxiety, injects a measure of intensity and urgency
754480	760560	and vitality into our existence that otherwise it wouldn't have. And this is why Nietzsche calls
760560	765760	his philosophy a gay science. It's a happy philosophy. It's not a morbid philosophy. It's
765760	771760	a joyful philosophy. And Kierkegaard will say the same thing, right, that when you confront death,
772720	779520	it opens us up to how precious and poignant and fragile every moment is, because it can
779520	786320	be snatched away from us at any time. And so in many ways existentialism, at least for me,
786320	791280	is the most life-affirming of all philosophies. It's not a death-focused philosophy at all. It's
793280	798000	reminding us of how precious each moment is and that we can't take any day for granted.
798640	808720	Now I jumped straight into existential philosophies and I am not as familiar with other philosophies.
808720	815680	So how would you distinguish between what differentiates existential philosophies from
815680	823840	other philosophies? Well, I mean, just in terms of academic specialties, in Anglo-American
823840	831840	philosophy, existentialism is completely marginalized because it doesn't focus on the
831840	839440	core issues of truth and knowledge and the nature of reality and what is the best,
839440	844960	what is good conduct, what ought we to do. Existentialism doesn't care about any of that
844960	851840	generally because the concern is not on philosophical abstractions. What is the
851840	856800	nature of beauty, truth, justice, the good life? No, actually that's not true. They're concerned
856800	862800	with the good life. The existentialist is concerned with what does it mean to be human?
862800	868880	What is existence? And so what the existentialists do is they shift the philosophical orientation
868880	875120	away from theoretical detachment where we theorize about abstract forms and turn our
875120	880960	attention to the concrete flesh and blood particulars of everyday life, which is what
881040	892960	existence engages or is involved in. And so it's a complete reversal of the traditional
892960	900400	philosophical orientation that we inherit from Plato and Aristotle and that gets refined and
900400	909760	consolidated with figures like Descartes and Kant. It's not a philosophy rooted in theoretical
909760	918240	reflection, it's a philosophy rooted in attentiveness to the concreteness of our existence, of our
918240	926960	being. And that means it focuses on the way we live every day, the moods we feel, the affective
926960	933680	experiences that shape us and shock us into awareness like those anxiety moods or nausea moods.
934480	945360	And so it's always been a kind of peripheral fringe philosophy in the UK and the United States,
945360	952160	obviously less so in the Golden Age of French philosophy and German philosophy in the 20s
952160	963360	and 30s and teens. But thankfully that's starting to change. And one of the drivers of this change
963440	971120	is a recognition that because existentialism focuses on concrete existence, it can expand the
971120	979760	philosophical perspective to include voices that have been traditionally marginalized in the
979760	987120	philosophical mainstream. So feminist philosophy, of course, was in many ways inaugurated by Simone
987120	995040	de Beauvoir. Critical race theory was deeply impacted by Frans Fanon who was a student of
995040	1002480	Sartre and Beauvoir's and was influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponte. And so these other forms of
1003120	1011440	philosophical approach that have never had a voice at the table are finally being seen as
1011440	1019360	bona fide philosophical perspectives that in my view are in many ways indebted to existentialism
1020160	1026480	by focusing on the concrete and the particular instead of abstract universal forms or essences.
1028880	1035600	I know this is me speaking from a completely biased perspective but I hear when you say that it
1035600	1044320	makes me find it hard to imagine why other philosophies have the ability to matter if we
1044320	1049920	haven't understood what it is to be ourselves. If we haven't understood the kind of existential
1049920	1056160	aspect of existence, why does it matter what's right or wrong if we don't know what we are?
1056800	1063920	Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I find most of Anglophone philosophy quite boring and uninteresting
1063920	1072080	because of that. And as a teacher, the classes that excite the students and engage the students
1072080	1078240	and inspire the students are existentially themed courses because they're at that stage in life where
1078240	1083760	they're asking those questions. What am I doing? What is it about? Why am I majoring in this and
1083760	1090880	not in that? And how is this going to shape the future of my life? And so when we start talking
1090880	1097840	about Friedrich Nietzsche or Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Saag, the students resonate to these
1097840	1105200	questions because they're feeling them right now at age 18, 19, 20, 21 and they're going to have to
1105200	1114080	confront those really serious concerns. They're not so passionate about abstract metaphysical
1114080	1119760	speculation. Those are interesting and curious thought puzzles but they're curious in the same
1119760	1126240	way that I'm curious about getting good at chess or figuring out the New York Times crossword puzzle.
1127120	1133840	Those thought experiments or philosophical curiosities don't keep me up at night. They don't
1133840	1138880	wake me up at 3 a.m. where I'm jolted awake and I think what's the meaning of my life? That's
1138880	1146080	existentialism. That's more important. Yeah, there's a difference between intellectual
1147040	1154240	fascination, intellectual curiosity and kind of an inherent questioning that you're saying
1154240	1161040	kind of innately surfaces at certain times of life you're saying and in certain experiences,
1161040	1167760	for example, this really life-shattering or life-questioning experiences. Yeah, exactly.
1169440	1174160	And we have been obviously discussing the phenomenon but we have not been defining the
1174240	1181360	phenomenon. If that is possible, how would you define it? Well, existentialism as a technical
1181360	1190640	term is almost beyond a clear definition and it's an ism, as I write in my book, that really
1191760	1198640	is misleading. It's not like rationalism or empiricism or or scientism or naturalism.
1199440	1203520	It doesn't refer to a unified philosophical school
1206000	1212320	and the word wasn't introduced until the 1940s by Gabriel Marcell and
1213280	1220720	Marcell used that word to refer to the philosophies of Sartre and Beauvoir but existentialism as a
1220720	1226400	word didn't exist in the 19th century so Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,
1226480	1235120	the word didn't even exist. But I think to get a sense of the overall contours of what the word
1235120	1246160	refers to, it refers to a philosophical focus on what it means to be human. What does it mean
1246160	1253920	for a human being to exist? And the idea is that we exist in a way that's fundamentally different
1253920	1262480	from the way this water bottle exists or this cell phone exists. We are not substances, we're not
1262480	1271200	static things that are objectively present to be studied. We are activities or processes or
1271200	1281920	happenings so existence is an event for humans. It's an event of self-making or self-fashioning.
1282480	1289120	We make ourselves who we are through the meaning-giving choices that we undertake
1289120	1295120	as our lives unfold. And this is what Sartre means when he says existence precedes essence.
1296080	1303920	There is no pre-given essence that determines who we are. We make ourselves who we are by
1304720	1311840	choices, by actions. And those actions are always constrained by our embodiment,
1311840	1320160	our social historical situation, our gendered or sexual situation. So it's not as if our
1321360	1329920	self-created, the activity of self-creation is completely unhinged. It's not completely undetermined.
1329920	1337280	It's situated and constrained by what the existentialists call facticity, the facticity of
1337280	1347280	who we are. And so what we do as humans is we are in a struggle or a tension between the
1347280	1354320	givens of our situation and our capacity to interpret and give meaning to those givens.
1354320	1361200	And the existentialists call that transcendence. So we're always in this tension between transcendence
1361200	1369840	and facticity. And that struggle is existence itself, right? I'm giving meaning to the fact that
1369840	1377040	I'm a man in the 21st century who's white and middle class and for the time being ambulatory
1377040	1383280	and able-bodied. And I'm going to have to interpret and give meaning to that factical determination
1383280	1390960	as it changes and shifts and is modified throughout the course of my life. And of course what that
1390960	1399200	means is that the process of self-making is finite. It's temporal. It comes to an end. In other words,
1399200	1406640	we make ourselves who we are with the recognition that that process of self-making is finite,
1406640	1414480	that we are beings on the way towards death. And we don't like that. That scares us. So oftentimes
1414480	1422560	we live in a way that is in denial or flight from our own finitude, from our own mortality.
1423120	1429680	And that's why most of our lives are inauthentic, or in the words of Sartre and Beauvoir, in bad faith.
1430240	1436720	We live in a state of self-deception most of our lives. And we think in the course of our lives
1436720	1443920	that there's something real and enduring and lasting about our existence. But the existentialists
1443920	1448160	want to remind us that there is nothing real, enduring or lasting about our existence. Our
1448160	1454000	existence is finite. And that's not a bad thing. It's just part of what it means to be human,
1454000	1461040	and we need to kind of own up to that. And so central to that process of authentic self-creation
1461600	1468640	is a kind of honesty, that we need to be honest with ourselves and cut away all of the layers of
1468640	1477440	self-deception that we carry with ourselves to protect us from the horror of our finitude,
1477440	1483120	the horror of our contingency. So one of the things that the existentialists say is that
1484080	1491360	we exist, but we don't have to exist. There's no reason for us to exist. We just happen to be
1491360	1499120	thrown into existence. And against the backdrop of our thrownness, we now have to make ourselves
1499120	1506320	into who we are. And that's a huge burden. That's the burden of freedom. It's dizzying and anxiety
1506320	1511920	provoking. And we don't like to accept that either. And that's why we like to be told what to do.
1511920	1515680	We like our priests to tell us what to do, our therapists to tell us what to do, our pop
1515680	1521520	psychologists to tell us how to live our lives. We don't want to do it on our own. And of course,
1521520	1528160	what the existentialists want to say is, you're always on your own anyway. You've got to be honest
1528160	1540160	with yourself. So that's the cliff notes version of existentialism. Hard to define, but there are
1540720	1548720	kind of central features built into it. Freedom, authenticity, temporality, all of these things
1548720	1555120	kind of undergird all of the existentialist philosophers. The problem, unfortunately, is that
1556560	1561760	some of the most significant voices in existentialism aren't philosophers at all.
1562480	1569520	They're novelists like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. They're poets like Reiner Maria Rilke. They're
1569520	1578800	filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa. They're playwrights like Sartre and novelists like Beauvoir. And so
1580160	1589440	existentialism expands far beyond the academic world. It's not exclusive to philosophers.
1589680	1597200	It's open to anyone who's sincerely concerned about the human condition and is anxious about
1597200	1602720	what it means to be human and is trying to articulate and express that anxiety or that concern.
1603600	1610160	And there are also religious existentialists and atheistic existentialists. And so not all
1611040	1621920	existentialists are following Nietzsche's maxim that God is dead. Many of the most important
1621920	1627040	existentialists were theistic existentialists like Dostoevsky, like Paul Tillich, like Martin
1627040	1632080	Buber. And there are some existentialists that don't believe in free will, like Nietzsche. He
1632080	1637760	thinks free will is a fiction. It's an illusion. But most existentialists have some conception
1637840	1645600	of freedom, of free will. And so this is why it's so difficult to demarcate the boundaries
1645600	1653600	of what existentialism is. Yet there are these familiar names that are
1654880	1660320	going to generally be coming across when you're studying it, especially from an academic point
1660640	1668880	of view. And it's making me think who, how, how did these particular names get selected and
1668880	1675840	put into the textbooks? And why are they the ones kind of being regurgitated and shared,
1675840	1681200	not that there's anything not completely marvelous about what they're sharing and that they shouldn't
1681200	1689040	be shared? But why them? Why not anyone else? Because they're the ones that do it. They're the
1689040	1696880	ones that engage the human condition in the most powerful and accessible and visceral way.
1697600	1704400	And so other novelists may talk about the human condition in certain ways, but very few do it the
1704400	1710720	way Dostoevsky does it, in crime and punishment or in the Brothers Karamazah. Very few articulate
1710720	1716560	the experience of confronting death like Tolstoy does and the death of Ivan Iliac. Very few capture
1717120	1724720	the despair in the face of the dizzying abyss of existence like Soren Kierkegaard does and
1724720	1733840	sickness unto death. So these are the figures that engage the human condition in the most powerful
1733840	1742160	way. But there are other marginal figures or figures on the periphery that do it in different
1742160	1749440	ways. But in my view, they may not do it as well. And or some may not have been discovered yet,
1749440	1757360	who knows. But when it comes to the major figures, they're major for a reason. Because their legacy
1757360	1766640	is enduring and lasting because they tend to do it better than anyone else. And it being they
1766640	1774160	speak to that humanness within you to that unspeakable part of you, which is just craving
1774160	1781040	stimulation, craving questions, craving answers. And they allow this kind of internal communication
1781040	1788080	with that being. And that's why they're well, it's, it's, I mean, I don't know if it's craving
1788080	1794000	stimulation or craving answers. I mean, one of the things that the existentialist will say is that
1794000	1799280	craving for stimulation is actually a form of denial. We want to be stimulated and distracted
1799280	1805920	from our human condition. And there are no answers to the human condition. What the existentialist
1805920	1811600	want to do is put us in a state of questionability, that there is no answer to the question what it
1811600	1817520	means to be human. You have to find that for yourself. You have to give your life meaning.
1817520	1825040	So there are no, it is not as if the existentialist lays out a guidebook to being who you are.
1825760	1830960	That's the scary part about existentialism. It's up to you to find out what this means.
1830960	1837280	This is why Nietzsche, for instance, is so famous for cautioning his readers. Don't become
1837280	1844640	Nietzscheans. Don't follow me. Follow yourself. You need to, you need to carve out your existence
1844640	1851120	and give meaning to your existence in the way that matters to you. Nietzsche did it for himself,
1851120	1856720	but you're not Nietzsche. You have to do it in your own way. Kierkegaard calls this subjective
1856720	1862000	truth. It's a truth that no one else has access to. It's your truth that belongs to you. And
1863760	1869440	it's going to be inco-parent and unintelligible to anyone else. And that's why it's precious to
1869440	1874400	who you are. So one of the tricky things about existentialism is a philosophy, and actually
1874400	1881680	this is kind of true to philosophy in general. Answers aren't part of the project. The project
1881680	1888480	is to immerse yourself in the questions, or as Rilke says, live the questions, exist the questions,
1889120	1895200	and be comfortable in the mystery and the ambiguity of the human condition. The more we try to find
1895200	1901920	reasons or grounds for our existence, the further away from authenticity we drift. Does that make
1901920	1908960	sense? And that is my observation of what is causing people the deepest pain, is when they are
1909920	1918080	needing that answer to what ultimately can't be answered, because it is just life. It is just your
1918080	1924000	decision. You wake up each day and either do the very much similar thing that you did yesterday,
1924000	1928480	or you be a completely different version of yourself doing a completely different thing,
1929280	1934400	there is just infinite ambiguity if you're willing to experience it.
1935280	1945600	Yeah, and so I think one of the measures of authenticity or being true to ourselves
1946320	1955520	is to learn how to be comfortable with or to dwell in uncertainty, to dwell in mystery and
1955520	1962880	ambiguity, and don't recoil from it or don't try to control it and master it, but to immerse
1962880	1971200	yourself in it. And that is the human condition. It is a fundamentally ambiguous and uncertain
1971760	1978480	predicament. And the more we try to control it and manipulate it and master it, the more anxious
1978480	1985360	we become. And this is one of the key features of it in existential psychotherapy. The more you
1985360	1992720	try to control your anxiety, the more your anxiety takes control of you. The more you befriend your
1992720	1999280	anxiety and welcome your anxiety and dwell in it, the less control it has over you, the less
1999280	2007440	power it has over you. For someone that might be watching this and really sitting there struggling
2007440	2014640	with their mental well-being or with their experience of life, and they were hoping that
2014640	2022400	existential ideas might alleviate some of that, what would you recommend for them in terms of
2022400	2031840	either just exploration or particular sources? Well, it's hard for me to say because I'm not a
2031840	2038080	clinician and I'm not a mental health counselor. And I think it's a case-by-case situation. I think
2039680	2048880	one of the stereotypes of existentialism is that it's anti-psychiatry. And this is an orientation
2048880	2056320	that was really pioneered by figures like Artie Lang, who was deeply inspired by existentialism,
2056320	2062080	especially the work of John Paul Sarge. And the idea is that any medical intervention that
2062960	2073440	blunts or covers over our freedom or our confrontation with our condition is dehumanizing
2073440	2082240	and problematic. I don't think that's true at all. I think some people need pharmaceutical
2082240	2089040	assistance, medication. I think some people need instrumental psychotherapies like cognitive and
2089040	2097360	behavioral therapy. And so my approach to this from a mental health perspective is very much an
2097360	2104800	eclectic approach. You use what works. I think someone in the grips of full-blown panic and anxiety,
2106080	2109760	Nietzsche is not going to help that person. Kierkegaard's not going to help that person. In
2109760	2118240	fact, it could inflame the situation and amplify it. However, if the anxiety is controlled or
2118240	2125040	mediated in some sense with an antidepressant or with some form of cognitive and behavioral therapy,
2125680	2135440	that may allow that suffer to begin the hard work of existential psychotherapy. And so I would
2135440	2143360	certainly not employ existential psychotherapy as a first line of treatment in every situation
2143920	2150640	by any means. But I think existential psychotherapy has to be employed for lasting
2151520	2157760	change, to occur for lasting and significant transformation to happen and growth to happen.
2159760	2165200	And so yeah, I think that's kind of the way I would go about it.
2168240	2175040	Which could almost be summarized as saying work out on a kind of on an individual basis,
2175040	2182800	on a unique basis. And also I would argue in unique to each moment, because so I do work
2183520	2189200	as a practitioner and I'm obviously highly influenced by existential philosophies in my
2189200	2194880	work. But what I'm going to do with a client one day or how we will be together in a session
2194880	2200320	one day is going to be fundamentally different perhaps than the previous week or the next week.
2200400	2206800	And I feel that from my perspective, at least, there's something about having these philosophical
2206800	2214080	ideas, having these concepts, having these key themes, almost within myself as lenses or perspectives
2214080	2222320	to have as an alternative way to look, and especially a lot of it's rooted in not being able
2222320	2229520	to change, not being able to make a change. I think that's right. And I think one of the great
2229520	2238320	insights of existentialism is the recognition that anxiety and despair are not medical conditions.
2238320	2244640	They should be medicalized as discrete medical entities. They are structural to the human
2244640	2251600	condition. They're inescapable. Everyone is going to have powerful and life shattering
2251600	2257440	anxiety moments. And and many, most of us will have them over and over again throughout our lives
2257440	2264000	as we get to go through a divorce or our parents die or we lose our job or we suffer a
2264960	2272480	serious illness. All of those experiences are going to shatter us. And we're going to have
2272480	2279920	to confront ourselves. But to say that that experience of existential shattering or anxiety
2279920	2285200	in the face of our own finitude is a medical condition is really problematic in my view.
2285840	2289680	Because what the egg doesn't mean they shouldn't be treated and assisted with
2289680	2296000	with pharmaceuticals or or or CBT or something like this. What the existentialists want to
2297040	2304480	remind us is that these are instructive edifying opportunities for personal growth and transformation.
2305120	2313120	Right. They're awakenings. And if we just blunt these awakenings with with tranquilizers
2313120	2319920	or or are trained to not attend to them and and and avoid them, you're never going to have those
2319920	2324480	those transformative opportunities that that anxiety can bring to us.
2327120	2331280	Do you feel that there have been moments in your own life when this is applied?
2332160	2342560	Oh, God. Countless times in my life, every major breakdown, every crisis existentialism has helped
2342560	2350960	me. Three years ago, I had a massive heart attack while on a 60 mile bike ride, something I did
2350960	2358960	regularly. I was kind of a fitness advocate and and a health nut. And I had a massive heart attack.
2359040	2367040	And my whole world collapsed. My identity as a professor, my identity as a as a physically fit
2367040	2373360	middle aged man, my identity as a as a partner or in terms of my relationships.
2374240	2383360	And existentialism helped me work through that trauma and and come through the other side, I
2383360	2389920	think, as a better human being with a deeper perspective about life's frailty and precariousness
2390720	2398080	and woke me up to living with a sense of urgency and vitality and intensity that
2398880	2405520	it's you inevitably get sucked away from in the drift of professional life or or family obligations
2405520	2414240	and work obligations and so on. So existentialism has through throughout my life from from 18 years
2414240	2423840	old on, numerous breakdowns, divorce, you know, sicknesses, losses of friends to cancer and illness
2425440	2433520	has has pulled me through and and deepened my life and and opened up opportunities for growth
2433520	2440640	and transformation. And so it has been whether it's it's through existential literature or reading
2440640	2447440	Heidegger again or teaching Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sard in the classroom. It's always been therapeutic
2447440	2456320	for me. I appreciate you sharing and I suppose because I'm socialized to think it I'm almost
2456320	2462400	instinctively when you hear someone's experience of trauma you want to instinctively say I'm so
2462400	2468640	sorry that you had that experience but I'm learning more and more and especially with you sharing this
2468640	2474640	this brilliant this growth beyond and these new insights that you gain from it. There's almost
2474640	2479760	a sense that well I'm not sorry that you had that experience in a way you're saying that it
2479760	2486560	contributed beautifully to your life. And that's actually the the great gift of existential philosophy
2486560	2490880	is that these these traumas and crises I mean you don't want you don't want to romanticize them you
2490880	2496160	don't want to romanticize suffering and that's always a temptation in existential philosophy that
2496160	2501360	he or she who suffers the most is the deepest and the most authentic that's just nonsense and I
2501360	2506960	don't think that's a right an accurate depiction of what the existentious are trying to do. But
2506960	2516160	the recognition that that that trauma and suffering and breakdowns awaken us to life's frailty and
2516240	2524320	its poignancy and remind us not to take our relationships for granted or our day for granted
2524320	2532240	that it could be snuffed out at any time are tremendously valuable life lessons and they
2532240	2537520	improve and enhance our lives they don't diminish it at all they make us in my view better people
2537520	2543280	more compassionate more understanding more sympathetic to the suffering of others and
2543360	2550640	and so so I I think you're right that that cliche I'm so sorry this happened I'm so sorry for your
2550640	2558720	loss those losses are opportunities for growth those those those deaths are our opportunities
2558720	2564800	for transformation and and Kierkegaard is great with this I mean Kierkegaard goes so far as to
2564800	2571840	say God wants you to die God wants you to die to the world because when you die to the world
2571840	2578560	the world comes back to you in a way that's more vibrant and intense and urgent than it was before
2579200	2585440	so so the idea is to die over and over throughout your life and every time you die the world comes
2585440	2592320	back with more vibrancy intensity and poignancy and and during that process you you prepare for
2592320	2599040	your actual death in Rilke's words you learn how to die which is the the most important lesson that
2599040	2608560	a philosopher can teach how can you learn how to die I'm I'm aware that it could be really easy for
2608560	2613120	someone to for someone to sit here and hear this and think it will it's so easy for you guys to
2613120	2620480	speak theoretically about embracing the opportunities that suffering provides but hey I'm sitting here
2620480	2627040	with a real-life experience of suffering and I have no idea how to how how do we do that especially
2627040	2632480	when we haven't had you know the advantage of years of actual philosophical engagement
2633280	2638800	yeah it's a it's a very difficult question I mean some people won't most people most people will live
2640560	2645840	lives of deep suffering and meaninglessness and that's just the part of the predicament of being
2645840	2652800	human many people live sad ordinary lives that are bereft of deep meaning and significance
2653520	2659200	Tolstoy says it great in the in the death of Ivan Iliak he says Ivan Iliak lived an ordinary
2659200	2665200	simple life and therefore it was a life that was most terrible and that's the life that most of us
2665200	2672960	will live and this is why I think Natalie projects like the ones that you're doing which are trying
2672960	2680480	to give voice to this the importance of existentialism are so important education is important good
2680560	2686640	liberal arts humanities education is important reading great literature watching good film
2686640	2693200	listening to good music those are all important edifying experiences that speak to the human
2693200	2700800	condition in so far as those those movies and and pieces of literature and and and pieces of music
2700800	2710400	speak to the human condition and so again you know sadly most of us are going to suffer
2710640	2717440	and and not have the wisdom that the existential tradition can open and open us up to and one
2717440	2723120	of the things that I do in my work is I try to popularize existentialism by writing about it
2723120	2730560	and by giving talks on it and by giving going to conferences and being a Pied Piper to my students
2730560	2737120	about how important these these questions and ideas are and so I try to incorporate that wisdom
2737600	2743200	into everything that I do in my conversations with my friends with my partner with my colleagues
2743200	2750240	reminding them that this this petty squabble about academic bureaucracy doesn't really matter
2750240	2755600	don't get hung up on it because you're going to die and you're going to die at any time and so put
2755600	2761520	yourself put things in perspective what really matters in the grand scheme of things and Irvin
2761520	2767120	Yalam the great existential psychotherapist refers to this as trivializing the trivial
2768080	2774400	we realize that these things that we worry about most of the time in our lives are trivial stupid
2775040	2781360	wastes of time that there are much bigger more significant issues on the table like
2781920	2790080	living a meaningful life and and being a decent human being and how generally does that go down
2790400	2796400	when you're engaging with people who are are living in the trivial who are embracing the
2796400	2801120	trivial conversations and you're like hold up you know that is trivial let's let's talk about
2801120	2805920	something it's a really good question I mean you have to be careful because it's not going to register
2805920	2811040	for most people I mean most people like Kevin he's so dramatic I mean he's such an intellectual
2811040	2817600	he's always talking about these heavy things but if you're if you're sensitive and mindful to the
2817680	2825520	speaking position of other people you can do it in ways that are thoughtful and and sensitive
2826080	2831840	and so you don't want to bludgeon someone with existential philosophy and say wake up wake up
2831840	2837200	you can be thoughtful by asking questions like what does that mean for you why is this worrying
2837200	2842400	you why is this concerning to you with my students it's a little bit different I can be a little bit
2842400	2847120	more blunt because I am a teacher and they're learning this material so I can shove it down
2847120	2851840	their throats whether they like it or not but with my friends and my family and my colleagues
2852560	2858960	you have to be a little bit more indirect and and thoughtful and recognize that these ideas
2858960	2865840	are quite scary and can be terrifying if you've never dipped your toe into existential philosophy
2865840	2874000	before and that most of our culture is built in such a way as to deny these concerns
2874640	2880560	right that that most of our cultural institutions are set up in a way that we don't have to face
2881280	2887200	the the the existential givens right we don't have to face death we don't have to face absurdity we
2887200	2896000	don't have to confront anxiety and and um and so so you you want to be cautious in terms of how
2896000	2901600	you bring this up but but oftentimes it means that I just cut some people out of my life if
2901600	2907440	they're not willing to engage so I I don't have a lot of friends maybe for that reason but it's
2907440	2912640	the same reason why I don't have friends who are Donald Trump supporters I just there's no reason
2912640	2919040	for me to waste my time with someone who is a dogmatic follower of dog Donald Trump I have
2919040	2925520	nothing really to say to them in the same way that it'd be very hard for me to try to gently
2925520	2933680	broach the idea that maybe God is an invention to someone who is deeply ensconced in a religious
2934320	2941680	faith and their identity hinges on the idea that God has to exist it'd be very hard for me to
2941680	2946720	disentangle that person from those deeply held convictions I could suggest some literature
2947440	2952400	maybe some books but it wouldn't be a conversation that I'd be interested in having
2952800	2960880	I remember really early on in my training one of the lecturers must have just supervised some
2960880	2965120	students because it was obviously quite fresh for her but she was saying that they'd conducted
2965120	2975040	their entire thesis on the potentially damaging and and ending results that engaging in existential
2975040	2981360	philosophy can have on interrelationships be that with partners intimate relationships with friends
2981360	2988480	with family members because it you know we speak about you spoke there about choosing to move away
2988480	2994080	but it almost becomes and I've spoken with colleagues it almost becomes intolerable not
2994080	3001120	to think deeply not to see things as trivial when they are trivial yeah I agree and I and I think
3001120	3008960	and I don't want to be harsh about this but um it's okay to cut people out of your life that
3008960	3015760	have no that that aren't that aren't bringing meaning and value to your existence and and
3015760	3021040	with family members it's much more difficult because there are our long-standing connections of
3021040	3029200	intimacy but I I don't have much problem disconnecting from friends that don't really
3030320	3036880	see the relevance of these kinds of questions or concerns and I also have a very hard time with
3036880	3044720	small talk and gossip it makes me very uncomfortable so so going to cocktail parties or where people
3044720	3052400	are just talking about trivial things that makes me quite anxious and unnerved and and I don't like
3052400	3059760	that but if a conversation at a party is involving real serious existential questions I'll be there
3059760	3068400	all night and and I'll be passionate about the conversation and so so um uh it for me it's a
3068400	3076400	temperamental orientation temperamentally I I I I'm very uncomfortable with with with surface
3076400	3082720	conversation it makes me it makes me quite anxious and it's the same thing at faculty meetings or
3082720	3086880	department meetings I'm a department chair so I have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and
3086880	3092880	deal with upper administration those meetings I I can't stand I have a very difficult time
3092880	3100000	sitting through that because I see the the the vast waste of time that these meetings suck up
3100000	3104640	in a life and I think okay there's another two hours of my life that I'll never get back that
3104640	3112320	that didn't contribute anything to my to my sense of who I am and so I think some people maybe you're
3112320	3119520	like this uh Natalie that that temperamentally you're just drawn to these ideas it's not something
3119520	3125520	that you can really help it's just it's it's it's it's part of your your constitution
3127360	3134960	and I can confidently say that you have just validated so many of my peers experiences there
3134960	3140560	too when you say you struggle with small talk and and gossip and and I had wondered if that's
3140560	3145600	just because everyone's just coming to the end of this huge huge doctorate journey which is
3145600	3153840	exhausting and overwhelming in itself but perhaps it is part of this it might be part of a deeper
3155200	3161760	existential orientation and you know again if if if a group of friends are sitting around
3162480	3171200	talking about really important life issues I I'm drawn to that like a laser beam and and I will
3171200	3178560	listen and nod my head and contribute where I can but if the conversation is about politics or sports
3178560	3188000	or redecorating a house or installing a backyard gazebo I or what restaurant is good or or who's
3188560	3195280	coming to town in terms of a band or something I could care less I just I my eyes glaze over
3195280	3200800	I mean I can play the game and put on the mask of sociability as good as anyone but um
3202160	3207840	when I go home I'll feel deflated and upset that I lost a few more hours of my life
3210160	3215600	and I'm not sure if you noticed it but I want to reflect back that you said it's those conversations
3215680	3222720	and those meetings which don't contribute to who I am and that is what is antagonizing and
3222720	3227840	frustrating about them yeah and that's not to say that I don't willfully do it and I know it's
3227840	3232960	important work to keep a university going and I know that we have to put on masks to keep the
3232960	3242240	machinery of society lubricated and well oiled and and it's also not a judgmental thing I may
3242240	3248720	come off like I'm being judgmental it's it's it's it's who I am it's I can't help it and I
3249680	3255360	I think some people love small talk and they love gossip and they love cocktail party
3255360	3261200	conversations it's just something that I can't bear it's very difficult for me it takes a
3261200	3268160	tremendous amount of energy to maintain myself at a three or four hour long dinner party where
3268160	3273840	the conversation is just idle chatter it's I mean I have to have two or three glasses of wine
3273840	3279440	just to take the edge off and and cope and that may that may be revealing more about me than I
3279440	3286800	want to suggest but it's it's who I am yeah I don't think it's it's judgmental that it came
3286800	3292480	across I feel like it was very honest but it makes me realize we don't perhaps often get the
3292480	3301520	opportunity to express in a safe space honestly what does and doesn't work for us in life we are
3301520	3308160	often involved with situations that are just part of the pattern of existence and we we tolerate them
3308160	3314480	and we put our masks on and we we navigate them because we we feel that we have to and I think
3314480	3322160	that's a great point Natalie and I think my my my personal view is that everyone deep down is
3322160	3327920	craving for these conversations these deep serious conversations about the meaning of life
3328480	3334240	but they're scary they're they're frightening conversations because they expose so much that
3334240	3340320	we want to keep hidden but I think all of us it's I think it's it's it's built into the human
3340320	3346880	condition we we we are thirsting for these encounters these deep intimate relational
3346880	3352960	encounters what what Martin Buber calls the IU relation where we're open and exposed to the
3352960	3357920	other person and this is what draws people to therapy this is why people go into to therapy
3357920	3362640	because they want to be heard they want to have to have someone listen to them in a way that's
3362640	3371120	sincere and open and they feel safe in that space in that therapeutic encounter and and that
3371120	3377040	safety oftentimes isn't there at us at a social gathering or at a party but the more intimate
3377040	3382400	that that social gathering gets and the more close knit that community of friends and and
3382400	3388960	relations is the greater the opportunity for deeper conversations and and and more penetrating
3389520	3390160	discourse
3393040	3400640	and I wonder where it is in life that we do become so scared of confronting these questions because
3401280	3407920	if you think about children children are constantly just exploring all of many facets of
3407920	3413840	themselves all the many potentials of what life has to offer and they do it with such
3414560	3421760	just innate fearlessness yeah I think we we it gets socialized out of us I think you're right
3421760	3428160	I think children are always the best philosophers they're always philosophically inquisitive
3428160	3433920	and and even inquisitive about the deepest and scariest questions about death you know what
3433920	3439200	happened to our dog what happened to grandma where do they go after they die why why why
3440000	3449040	and as as as young children get socialized in in in school and in educational institutions
3449040	3455760	in in peer relations they're kind of told you don't ask those questions anymore you do what
3455760	3464800	good boys and girls do and and that's a that's sad that's unfortunate and and so we we lose touch
3464800	3475360	with that wide-eyed openness to the questionability of life that all children have and it gets beaten
3475360	3479840	out of us and then there's moments in I think late adolescence early adulthood when it wake
3479840	3485440	when we're woken up again and that's often is happens when you go off to college when you leave
3485440	3491280	home for the first time right either going to college or go off and and practice a trade at 18
3491280	3499040	or 19 and you leave the home and suddenly those questions come up again who am I what's the meaning
3499040	3506320	of my life and um and and and then we get our degree and we get our job and we start our
3506320	3511920	career we forget those questions until we get our divorce or we we lose our job or we get a
3511920	3519040	critical illness and then we're woken up again and um so I think that that the experience of
3519040	3525120	questionability that children have uh comes back to us at different points in our lives I also think
3525120	3532560	it comes back to us in at the end of life that the older we get the more humble we get the more
3532560	3540000	open we get toward mystery and and questionability and I'm actually finishing a book right now on
3540000	3548400	existentialism and aging and argue that the aging process and the intimacy that aging brings us with
3548400	3554880	grief and loss actually makes us into existentialists I think elder the elderly folk
3555520	3563280	tend to be more receptive to these ideas uh and there's a lot of interesting uh evidence to suggest
3563280	3570640	this that we we actually become existentialists the closer we get to death and the more our future
3570640	3575840	contracts and we realize that we are temporal beings and life is coming to an end
3579360	3584560	you've set my mind off in a thousand different questions that I need to to keep it straight
3586640	3592080	and you're speaking about different literature we've got you know we've got theoretical literature
3592080	3597680	we've got philosophical perhaps novels and you've mentioned poetry and film what about for the
3597680	3604560	person who's sitting there and it's like yeah these these russian or french and western philosophers
3605120	3611280	um that they're not my style like there's no way I could engage with those kind of texts I'm not
3611280	3617360	interested in classical music I'm not a deep person I'm not a hugely academic or intellectual
3618240	3622320	yeah it's a it's a good question I think yeah some people just aren't readers some people aren't
3622320	3630160	intellectually inclined I think one of the great entry ways into existential thinking if you're not
3630320	3639360	a literary type is through film I think there's a lot of really great accessible films that
3640160	3647520	capture the core ideas of existential philosophy and and some of them are blockbusters with some
3647520	3655280	of the great stars in Hollywood and so what what film can do is it can demystify the alienating
3655280	3661920	and intimidating jargon of the existentialists the german terms and the french terms and the
3661920	3669280	technical language that may be a sartre or a bouvoir or a heidegger would employ um and uh
3670160	3676400	I'm thinking of of movies like American Beauty this is the movie by Sam Mendes
3677120	3685680	um The Tree of Life by Terrence Malick um there's a great Nietzschean themed science fiction film
3685680	3694160	called Arrival um uh that was directed by Villeneuve um Akira Kurosawa the great japanese director
3694160	3702560	of course has done so many great existential films the greatest is probably Ikuru um about a man who's
3702640	3708480	who's diagnosed with terminal cancer and he's forced to confront a life that has been largely
3708480	3715600	bereft of meaning and now he's kind of awakened to the urgency of the limited time that he has left
3716240	3722000	and so I think film is a great way to introduce and and these films are cross-cultural it's not
3722000	3729200	as if these are just western filmmakers I mean Ikuru I mean I'm sorry Kurosawa had such a massive
3729200	3736160	impact on western filmmakers that in many ways he was the pioneer not not not hollywood or or
3736160	3744000	french or or american filmmakers and Ingmar Bergman films of course uh anything that Bergman does
3744000	3750400	some Woody Allen films are good although he has demonstrated himself to be a loathsome human being
3751360	3756400	um so that's one way to do it uh is is through indirectly through film
3756400	3764720	and I think that's hugely reassuring and partly what this project is aspiring to do because there
3764720	3772880	isn't for me an obvious go-to place to say I've heard this word this ism as you were speaking
3772880	3779360	about it doesn't it's coming up a lot it seems that it could be something curious but I am not
3779360	3785920	able to read these huge huge tomes I I don't know where to start I don't know where to go
3785920	3792000	and it feels that there's there's there's not just that's kind of stepping stone that opens the door
3792000	3800480	that says actually you know yes okay we there are so many ways to be it highly academic about this
3800480	3806720	and explore it from a highly academic position and and encourage that to be incorporated into
3806720	3812480	different professions and different disciplines but actually we don't have to be so so formal
3812480	3818160	about it too we can sit back at the cinema we can have a conversation with friends we can just
3818160	3824960	look at ourselves and say hey who am I and you could show this interview right I mean this I mean
3824960	3830160	hopefully we're not using too much highfalutin language we're talking in a way that I think
3830160	3836000	everyone could understand and I think even those that aren't that are intimidated by the big novels
3836000	3843840	The Crime and Punishment The Brothers Karamazah many of the most powerful and visceral pieces
3843840	3849920	of existential literature are very short stories the short stories of the death of Yon Ilyak it's
3849920	3857280	you know 50 page story Camus the stranger is a very short story Dostoevsky has a bunch of
3857280	3864480	short stories that are that are powerful and accessible the plays of Jean-Paul Sartre are
3864480	3870960	accessible and pretty easy to follow and so it's not as if you have to to sit down with a thousand
3870960	3878080	page piece of Russian literature to absorb the core ideas you can breeze through you know
3879360	3887040	Camus the stranger at the beach in an afternoon and be jolted into an awareness of of who we are
3887120	3893840	you know and and so there's no reason to be scared of it it's it's accessible in so many
3893840	3899280	different kinds of ways I like how you set the setting there like you can just read a
3899280	3904560	read a nice novel on the beach because you make me realize that it there's almost this sense that
3904560	3912560	philosophy must be done in in a in a dark room with a with a cigar or a brand out in the dark
3912560	3919520	or in the woods or in a classroom but actually I live in Florida I do most of my work at the beach
3919520	3926320	right or outside in the sunshine and and so absolutely yeah we don't have to play that
3926320	3932000	that stereotype of the the serious French intellectual the beret and the black sweater
3932000	3939440	and smoking a cigarette at the coffee shop and it's it's a it can be much more relaxed
3939440	3947920	and and I think it's very accessible and I reckon it was at the time for them as well
3947920	3953680	if half of them were writing at cafes and coffee shops and bars and having these chats and just
3953680	3961120	writing it down scribbling it down and I believe to an exact I mean in in the golden age in the
3961120	3967040	in the 1940s and 50s in France it was everywhere I mean existentialism was in the air and it was
3967600	3973280	in the coffee shops in the in the in the cafe society on the sidewalks but it was also in
3973280	3978320	the air in the United States in that way it was a big driver of the counterculture revolution and
3978960	3989520	and you know Camus and and Sartre and Beauvoir were such important political voices and in speaking to
3990320	3996080	the Vietnam War to to the civil rights movement to the women's movement it was an important part
3996080	4006080	of the new left in in Great Britain and so it was it was in the air it wasn't it wasn't isolated
4006080	4013200	in in academic settings it wasn't there in seminar halls it was it was out in the streets
4013200	4021360	is where existentialism had its had its high point and it'd be wonderful to see that come back in
4021360	4027920	some ways and there are sun glimmers of hope that that's the case I mean there's there's aspects of
4028960	4032640	the Black Lives Matter movement at the United States the Mitu movement
4035440	4043520	the Greta Greta Thernbergs climate strike movement that have real resonances to to existential philosophy
4044160	4051280	uh in terms of conveying the urgency of our situation and so my sense is that existentialism
4051280	4059840	is at a is is is coming back it's coming back uh in and uh being received in ways that it that it
4059840	4067760	hasn't in the past coming back from textbooks and academia into kind of common dialogue and discourse
4068000	4077280	yeah and also yeah I think coming back from from uh a complacency in the face of neoliberal politics
4077280	4086080	and um uh crass materialism I think that that there's nothing like the recognition that the
4086080	4092800	planet may be uninhabitable in 40 years to jolt us into an awakening and I see this a lot with my
4092800	4098320	students I'm not gonna I'm 51 years old so the the urgency of the climate change isn't going to hit
4098320	4104560	me as viscerally but for my 20 year old students they may be living in a planet that is radically
4104560	4110160	different than the one that I'm living in when they're my age and so when we talk about neolism
4110160	4119520	or the death of God and the search for meaning um the climate change crisis can can uh jolt us
4119520	4126400	into an awareness of those kinds of questions and you're bringing us here nicely back into this
4126400	4132080	discussion that existentialism isn't just theoretical it's not just within our mind but it's
4132080	4138480	within our embodied world as well it's in the physical world as well and yeah what this leads
4138480	4147040	back into is what you were sharing about your own your own uh specialities yeah absolutely and my
4147040	4153040	and my own life I mean it's it's it's shaped me in deep ways in my own life it's pulled me through
4153040	4163360	profound catastrophic events in my life uh near-death events and and uh if anything my relationship
4163360	4169440	to this kind of philosophy is more intimate and profound than it's ever been and it's very much
4169440	4176720	different from the the place that I was when I was an 18 or 20 year old uh philosopher enamored by
4176720	4182960	Nietzsche and the radical ideas because I hadn't lived them I hadn't lived these ideas I hadn't
4182960	4189600	experienced them in the visceral way that you know 30 years of life experience teaches you
4189600	4196320	and so the wisdom of these thinkers has has become even more pronounced as I've gotten older
4196320	4200560	and I don't think that's going to change much I think it's it's going to become more pronounced
4200560	4208320	as I move into my 60s and 70s if I get there if I make it to tomorrow you see it does feel like an
4208320	4216880	endless absolutely endless uh journey this the the discovery and exploration of the existential
4216880	4222400	field I don't I I was going to say I don't know if I love it or I hate it but I think it's definitely
4222400	4228400	that I love it and it's just any person that you speak to has the potential and quite often does
4228400	4234080	add a whole mother open door after door after door and you look through and you think wow there's so
4234080	4241840	much more and I think even the language of love and hate as you know uh is is so is a little bit
4241840	4248160	misleading it's it's not that you love it or hate it is that it matters to you it matters to you
4248160	4254480	deeply and so those simple binaries of good and evil or love and hate they it doesn't capture
4254480	4263200	the ambiguity of of what this field discloses and um all that you can say with sincerity is that this
4263200	4271440	this material means something to me in a deep way uh even if articulating that meaning is always
4271440	4278800	going to be inchoate and unclear to the point that people like ourselves are just so inspired
4278800	4284880	that we dedicate a significant amount of our life to trying to share that or at least invite or as
4284880	4291680	I would say offering we're offering other people the opportunity to to explore these I really like
4291680	4298720	Natalie this idea of existential offering I think there's such a wonderful uh openness about that
4299120	4305520	phrase what can I offer you and and how can I open you up to the relevance and significance
4305520	4313280	of these ideas I think that's a a really neat part of the project thank you I I thought of that when
4313280	4318640	I was when I was sitting during my training and I was just being exposed to all of these different
4318640	4325840	ideas and I was trying to establish which one I'm supposed to resonate with which particular theory
4325840	4331200	and how I'm supposed to take it all on board and it suddenly dawned on me that that's not at least
4331200	4339520	for me that's not what existential philosophies are about they're so magnificently vast and complex
4339520	4345920	and they will have completely different meanings to each person in each moment depending on where
4345920	4352720	their situation is and it each one offer an opportunity and offer a different angle and
4352720	4361040	it's up to us whether we take it or leave it or put it aside for later I agree I agree on that note
4361760	4370400	how would you describe your existential offering as it were um I guess my existential offering
4370400	4377920	would in the in the bluntest possible way recognize that this life is not a dress rehearsal
4378560	4385920	this is the only life you have this day is the only day that is exist that exists right now and
4388720	4396080	remind yourself or be vigilant to the idea that this this is this existence is precarious
4396080	4401040	and it's unstable and it's uncertain and that you can't take things for granted
4401040	4406320	you can't you can't take these relationships for granted you can't take the beauty of a sunset
4406320	4411440	or a rainy afternoon for granted a good meal for granted or a good cup of coffee
4412240	4418320	treasure those moments because they can be snatched away from you at any time and I think
4418880	4427440	recognizing that life is not a dress rehearsal will will bring a measure of intensity and urgency
4427440	4430880	to aspects of our life that we all too often take for granted
4430880	4437440	and why is that intensity and urgency so so important
4438960	4446000	well because it reminds us of how beautiful and precious this life is and and mysterious
4446560	4454960	and gracious this life is and um if if you're happy with your an existence where you're just
4454960	4463120	pulled along by the shallows of everyday life um so much the better for you but my sense is that
4463120	4470480	most of us don't want to live that way we want to live with a sense that this is a life worth living
4470480	4476320	that this is a life that can have deep meaning if we so choose regardless of the career path that
4476320	4482320	we take it can be embodied in our relationships in the care that we have for our our our sick and
4482320	4488960	dying parents the way that we love and take care of our children uh or the environment or the natural
4488960	4498880	world uh and so um my sense is without that measure of intensity and urgency it's not as much of a
4498880	4510000	life worth living unfortunately I pick up on how you're saying I sense I sense I sense and is this
4510080	4515680	what you were referring to in in your in your work earlier when you were saying that this embodied
4515680	4524400	we're embodied beings as well we're phenomenological beings as well we're not just these yeah yeah I
4524400	4529840	mean one of the things one of the great insights of the existentialists is that the human condition
4529840	4536000	is disclosed to us not through theoretical reflection it's disclosed to us through feelings
4536000	4545360	through moods through affective experience and um we the the the argument or the suggestion is that
4546080	4552000	we we feel when we're inauthentic and that feeling is knowledge we know when we're not being true to
4552000	4558800	ourselves we know when we're wearing we're wearing masks and and being self-deceptive how do we know
4559680	4567840	it feels a certain way you see and we are feeling authenticity also feels a certain way uh it we
4567840	4575120	feel a particular kind of mood that's atmospheric and it colors our our our entire life
4577280	4584160	you see it's making me think of how many times we can have this feeling and one that we're not
4584640	4588960	finding pleasant and one that we're wanting to change and we're finding uncomfortable when
4588960	4594640	but we're we're staying we're living with it we can do that for for hours or weeks or months or
4594640	4601920	years we can live with this sense that we our life is not is not being lived and experienced in the
4601920	4608240	way that perhaps it should be but yet we're not changing it and that is that embodied sense of
4608320	4615120	discomfort and i think that you know one of the one of the the underlying themes i think in in
4616240	4623440	almost all existential philosophy is is courage that you have to have the courage or or steadiness
4625120	4631600	to be true to who you are and and whenever you feel yourself get sucked back into a life of
4631600	4636240	self-deception which is always going to happen it's inevitable it's again it's structural to the
4636240	4642960	human condition uh in authenticity to have the courage to to question that temptation uh to
4642960	4648720	challenge it to remind yourself what is at stake in life to remind yourself that this is a day that
4648720	4654640	you may not get that that the future is an illusion you don't get it tomorrow but tomorrow's not guaranteed
4654640	4658720	and so why are you going to go to that cocktail party why are you going to join that committee
4658720	4663200	why are you going to waste that time in a in a conversation that's going to have no bearing
4663200	4670000	on your existence is there is there other better ways to live better ways to spend the very limited
4670000	4683120	time that you have on earth how in those situations do you have the courage to keep going um it's a
4683120	4693520	good question uh i i remind myself every day i try to remind myself with a mantra every day
4694160	4700480	life is short life is short be grateful life is short be grateful i'll say that actually in my car
4700480	4705120	when i'm driving to work and when i'm walking onto campus i'll be remind i'll remind myself be
4705120	4711200	grateful this day this day this is the only day and it's hard sometimes you know you get sucked
4711200	4716560	into the things they sucked into everydayness and and you lose touch with that but i try to
4719920	4726320	develop a kind of practice this is what what Aristotle calls frenesis it's a practical wisdom
4726320	4732560	that becomes habit it becomes part of who you are so you don't have to try anymore to be grateful
4732560	4740000	you don't have to try anymore to to uh uh be aware of your own temporality or your own finitude
4740000	4747200	it it's it just becomes who you are and so you see the sunsets in florida differently you see the
4747200	4755360	blue sky in a different way you see the trees on campus in a different way and um uh that's that's
4755360	4764240	practical wisdom and i hugely appreciate your honesty with that with that question because
4764240	4770160	i think confronting confronting truth confronting life confronting existence
4770160	4776640	can be exhausting and overwhelming and there are moments that we don't just innately have
4776640	4782000	that courage flaring up within us to keep going and to keep exploring but what you're
4782960	4789200	sharing here is that this is not just a passive process this is an active engagement
4789440	4796640	that's right and that's again a central theme in in existentialist philosophy i mean
4799840	4806640	sart and buvor actually call it engage literature that the the writing has to be engaged with the
4806640	4814400	concrete realities of existence and we have to bring that engagement into our own lives
4814400	4818720	so that it's not just something that we scribble down on a page it's something that we embody
4819760	4825920	in in our everyday lives and and it's hard work it's very difficult because self-deception is
4825920	4833440	very easy it's easy to be inauthentic and it's nice it's comforting and and and tranquilizing
4833440	4840480	as heidegger says and also that it you know we we go through that phase where it was respectful to
4840480	4845520	be to tranquilize ourselves it was respectful to switch off our questioning brain and to cue
4845520	4849920	up in the playground and and sit down in the classroom and study something that isn't
4850880	4856000	connecting with you we're trained to do that and you're you're told off if you're not and you're
4856000	4864560	being respectful if you do and then suddenly it all changes again and yeah i agree i agree
4866320	4873360	but thank you so much for sharing today kevin i'm wondering was it a real pleasure to have this
4873360	4881040	conversation and i hope that whoever sees it appreciates it as well and it was really
4882160	4886960	fun for me to have this talk and may hopefully our paths will cross sometime in real life
4886960	4892160	in the future i'm sure we'll make that happen and i'm sure it will inspire i hope so too
4892160	4899440	thank you so much kevin it's my pleasure okay we'll talk soon bye bye bye
4903360	4904740	you
