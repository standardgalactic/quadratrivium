Checking Existential Offerings/Professor Kevin Aho ｜ A Philosophy of Absudity & Confronting Personal Truths.txt
 Kevin Kelly, a writer and filmmaker with a background in existential philosophy, discusses the importance of living authentically and the challenges of overcoming self-deception. He emphasizes the significance of having the courage to question and challenge societal norms and to live each day mindfully, acknowledging life's fleeting nature. Kevin shares his personal practice of reminding himself daily to be grateful for the present moment as a way to maintain a sense of awareness and authenticity in his own life.

The conversation highlights the themes of existentialism, the comfort of self-deception, and the difficulty of embracing authenticity. Kevin points out that while society often encourages conformity and tranquilization through distraction or conventional roles, true engagement with existence is a challenging but rewarding endeavor.

The dialogue between Kevin and the interviewer touches on the idea that existentialist thought must be applied actively in one's life, not just theoretically pondered. They both appreciate the importance of this engagement and hope that their conversation inspires others to reflect on their own lives and to live more authentically.

Kevin expresses gratitude for the opportunity to have this conversation and hopes to meet the interviewer in real life in the future, while also acknowledging the enjoyment of the discussion itself. The interview concludes with a sense of camaraderie and the expectation that their paths will cross again, ideally inspiring others who come across their dialogue.
