1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,360
so welcome everybody welcome back to some faces as well it is so so exciting to

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,960
be sharing the space with you again this evening or newly this evening I'm

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,400
really it's the third session today of these kind of existential offerings live

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,760
events and I'm just starting to have it as something that I really really look

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,520
forward to because each session is so different and the discussions always

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,080
leave me with so much to think about and as ever I just want to kind of bring

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,600
in that that that idea that even though we're just squares on each other's

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,880
screens we are real people in real time joining together and sharing this

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,600
experience and it's it's just so special I know that some of the people here have

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,480
bought tickets that are free some of them have donated some of them have spent

11
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,600
money it either way it's just so you know it's so wonderful because what we are

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,960
giving all of us is is our time and that is so valuable and I'm so grateful so

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,320
thank you so much to the people that are live and watching for sharing your time

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,160
and thank you so much for the people that will watch this in the future for

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,560
have using your time this precious time to be engaging with these existential

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,120
ideas and even though we're in the present today we're going right back to

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,040
the past to explore ancient existential ideas with none other than

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,880
Marcos Maria Mendez who is joining us all the way from Argentina so thank you

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Marcos we met in Athens and I remember you were standing there kind of

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,240
improvising your talk passionately about Greek philosophies and how they're still

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,920
relevant today and I just thought right we need to have these ideas spread

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,960
further so this is the reason that Marcos shares the space with us today and I

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,520
won't chatter and take up any more time Marcos I just welcome you and welcome you

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,040
to introduce yourself well thank you it's a wonderful wonderful thing to be

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,640
here and yes in fact we met in Athens and well you might expect a little bit of

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
the same things here because not very much in the preparation of the

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,140
topics but of the let's say culmination of many of the years of work and of

28
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:03,320
study in these things and the basic ideas governing the centers of

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,440
the talk so well thank you all for being here and I'll say hello from Argentina

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,840
the other side of the world so thanks for taking the time to be here with us

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,600
and yeah I'm not very much for introductions I'm let's just say that

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm a clinical psychologist and I have been for the last almost 10 years and I

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:36,520
find that existentialism at least those ideas and those concepts are very

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,080
helpful in the clinical practice in fact at some point I'd say that the

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:51,880
existential dilemmas are so central to the human experience that we can't avoid

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:01,200
them and it's perfectly clear that one or at a certain point we all have to face

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,480
those things so many people come to to the practice and say okay I have this

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:17,280
problem I have this big luggage on my back and I can't get rid of it so the

39
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
basic concept today will be that well these questions they they persist

40
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,440
throughout history and the idea of the existential school as a school of thought

41
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,120
is well let's say has some certain issues and I don't know if you if you're

42
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,520
all familiar with with the idea of existentialism but and I repeat that

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,400
anyone can can interrupt me if the if my words don't come clearly enough the

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,480
idea of existentialism is complex because the the basic thoughts are not

45
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,800
very clear why because we have existentialists that are apes that are

46
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,760
apes existential Christians and agnostics so the basic ideas can be applied to

47
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:26,720
many things the the the school of thought just came to be at least formally with in

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,720
France after the second world war I like that there is a lot of European public

49
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,240
because well you might be all very much in touch with the with the history of

50
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,600
of that maybe not yourself but yes only on the generations before you very

51
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,920
different than the experience we have here in in South America so after the

52
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:04,520
second world war at least in France the ideas just started to be and well I I

53
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,320
think you might have heard of Jean-Paul Sartre he monopolized the idea of the

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,880
existentialist he he just adored the word which is very different from let's say

55
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,440
Albert Camus which hated the word existentialism he defined himself as

56
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,680
absurdism the absurd sorry if my if my pronunciation is I find myself saying

57
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,680
some words for the first time in English because of course I've studied them in

58
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:47,800
in Spanish so I apologize in advance if some of the words don't come up very very very well

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:58,360
so you might have heard of the basic concept of Sartre that the existence

60
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,960
precedes the essence which is in a certain way I'm not trying to make a lecture

61
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,560
about this because there are many far better explanations for this I'm just

62
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,640
trying to introduce the concept so that then we can go towards the antiquity

63
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,480
or the ancient times I think antiquity is just for the furniture right

64
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,520
no okay and the the idea of of the existence precedes the essence counts

65
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,720
in an antagonistic way to the essentialism the the idea that Plato and Aristotle have

66
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,960
that everything has an essence and that everything has the thing that makes the

67
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,920
thing what it is not some other thing so if you if you lost that that would no longer be that thing

68
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,640
the the basic explanation is the knife you can have a handle that's plastic wood

69
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,280
no handle at all but if you take the blade it's no longer a knife so the essence

70
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,640
is that that characteristic which is

71
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:21,880
unsupprable from the thing itself so Sartre says you know that's not it what if what if we just

72
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:30,120
don't have any any essence and we create ourselves which is a way of thinking about it

73
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,920
which is a way that I don't particularly agree and that's the thing I don't agree in a way with

74
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:47,160
one of the most influential existentialists of the world and of history because well Sartre never

75
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,800
never did any clinical practice never studied the development of of the humankind and how we

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:04,520
come from a newborn to to something so there is in a sense a well a school of thought that goes

77
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,080
towards that thing okay no we're just a blind a blank canvas and everything it's supplied which

78
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,880
in a certain way has led to to many of the of the serious aspects of of today this idea that

79
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:30,440
word we're just what we what we choose to be which is maybe not the case we have certain limits and

80
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:41,080
the the development that the development of let's say the cognitive functions are of course

81
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:53,960
rooted on on the body so the the basic idea of Sartre might have been mistaken in a certain way

82
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,240
but but it surely has done some some good things for the for the confrontation of ideas which is in

83
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,600
fact the the basic concept we have here and and that we can talk about all those things

84
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:21,640
so the so the idea would be that that the that the the the existentialists of the post-war

85
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:31,480
world war focused on the let's say phenomenology of the understanding of the humankind trying to

86
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:41,000
incorporate the subjective experience of the of the of the person to the understanding of

87
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,880
reality which is in fact up until today the the basic framework of of existential psychotherapy

88
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,760
phenomenology existential phenomenology so it's a very interesting concept which changed a lot of

89
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:10,280
the of the way we thought of of the humankind and in fact it's well very unique in its perspective

90
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm not saying Sartre just said no so far along he he had many many great great ideas for example

91
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:32,600
the idea of hell which is not a new idea in itself but I don't know and please correct me if I'm not

92
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,480
saying that the title of the name correct and in the right way it's behind closed doors

93
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:50,760
might have been or something like that in Spanish it's no exit in English no exit okay

94
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:00,520
that idea of the Sartre and hell which is not no other thing than the people others which is

95
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,280
very unique and I can understand why he might might be able to to to think that way

96
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,640
but he missed the idea that the others are also the ones that introduce us to the world so this

97
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:26,840
idea that we come in in in a blank canvas is well to say the least naive in fact he even said

98
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:36,120
towards the end of his career and his life that he he gave little importance to the material

99
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:46,600
aspects of of human of human experience which is again a very very same thing to do to be able

100
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:56,360
to see the the errors of our past but the idea would be that these questions the questions of

101
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:05,320
death meaning uh freedom Sartre is very much into into freedom this that the the whole

102
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,880
excess of freedom we have comes with with an angst comes with the suffering which is not

103
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:24,200
of the aspects of of this school of thought so it's all these questions have been since

104
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:34,200
the the beginning is of humankind so the the existentialism in a sense has been around

105
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:45,800
well for as long as we are here the questions are and persist so I thinking about about today

106
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,880
I came up with with with a question myself why did we start calling existentialism at least the

107
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:05,240
formal school of thought after the the world war and I have no good answers sorry but there

108
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:13,960
there is an aspect that that I think it's crucial that it's that the the questions went further away

109
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:25,640
from religion than before so the Greeks at least for our western traditions our focus

110
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,640
much more on the Greeks than let's say on on on some other parts of the world

111
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:42,360
but they they made the same the same questions we do now exactly the same ones

112
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,280
one one could say well we we copied them and and how can it be that we have

113
00:14:50,840 --> 00:15:00,120
haven't got any answers after so so long and and it came to me also a quote from a very good

114
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,680
psycho psychoanalyst and sociologist that's called eric from who said that the

115
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:17,880
that the technology advances much more than the wisdom we have so the wisdom we possess now

116
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,400
is not at all what what we need because well we're making the same questions as Plato we're

117
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:35,960
making the same observations as Aristotle and Socrates so one must wonder if if we will ever

118
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:43,160
if we will ever find the answers and the questions for meaning well what is the meaning of it all

119
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,720
at least my answer is well there is no meaning which might be within the the school of thought

120
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:00,040
of existentialism that the the the branch of nihilism the nihilist nihilists say that well

121
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,400
there is no apparent meaning and there is no god and there is no nothing that that can

122
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,200
actually give the meaning there i would say there is a smaller branch that says positive

123
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,840
nihilism negative nihilism the negative nihilism would be the the character of of the soyelsky

124
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,760
if if there is no god and there is no immortality then what what well then everything is permitted

125
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:33,480
in brother scaramosov but there is also the positive nihilism which is okay there is no

126
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,960
meaning at all we are responsible for creating it we are the ones that that give life meaning

127
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:50,280
which is a powerful thing a very powerful concept to say that we are responsible but it's also a

128
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,560
burden it's also a very very harsh reality that we are responsible for ourselves

129
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:11,640
so well i think that if you're here now might be because you you you find yourself challenging

130
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,720
those ideas you find yourself wondering all of this because let's face it it's not a very popular

131
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,240
subject all of this you don't go to a party and say okay yeah but what what's the meaning of all of

132
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:34,600
this i think okay do you all know we're gonna die someday you won't be very much appreciated in the

133
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:44,440
party so there is a certain element of of uncomfortableness in all of this a very deep

134
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:52,600
uncomfortableness i would say but it's also charged with with the very profound sense of

135
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:03,080
wondering and of course i i say to you to your you can you can ask the questions you need but

136
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:12,600
i think at some point we all have the the the wondering of saying okay but why why is this

137
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,320
the way i live why is this the way it's suffer which is in fact one of the of the tools we use

138
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:28,600
in psychotherapy we we try and and and get the questions with with a certain sense of of weight

139
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:38,680
behind them not just the the hollow words again hollow words the words with with nothing behind

140
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,960
them to to find the person asking the right questions or at least the questions that

141
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,600
well they are able to to handle because it's very difficult to to face yourself with a question that

142
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:08,120
nobody can answer the you and the the ideas and the problems these brings are well

143
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:18,280
i would say eternal but but it's a very a very weird way of of talking about the human experience

144
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,600
because in fact the the human experience is finite so

145
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,800
i'd say they they will accompany the the the experience of for humankind but we individually

146
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:40,120
have a very different way of approaching it so i'll go back to to to the idea of the of the

147
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:53,720
ancients well i also came across i'll i'll take the opportunity to introduce all of the of the

148
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:02,600
english-speaking audience or participants to um maybe the greatest writer of of argentina which

149
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:12,120
is Jorge Luis Borges i don't know if you've known him but he's wonderful it's like reading Edgar

150
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:27,080
Lampeau for for for us by the at the at the last years of his life he was in a project of of having

151
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,240
the the most important hundred books so he took the time to choose each one of them he didn't

152
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:49,240
didn't complete the the all the collection but he introduced in my in my curiosity one of the

153
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:59,800
of the most ancient stories the the epic of Gilgamesh which is a very odd a very odd well choice

154
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,600
but in there it's the epic of Gilgamesh is the Sumerian that's a myth a story about a hero

155
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:19,000
which let's say it simply he he faced a lot of challenges of course but the the most important

156
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,520
aspect is he was searching for immortality and well he didn't make it of course spoilers spoilers

157
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:39,560
for for a very old book but in a certain way we can see the the question of mortality even before

158
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,680
the Greek civilization in fact the epic of Gilgamesh inspired a lot of the Iliad and the Odyssey so

159
00:21:48,440 --> 00:22:00,120
we find there the the well even the flood yes but also the the the work on hell in hell sorry

160
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,520
in hell that the the hero needs to go to hell to find something

161
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,600
Odysseus did it in the Odyssey Gilgamesh did it in in his epic but I'd like to say that

162
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,440
this this is the point there is something there that that goes beyond the the the basic story

163
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,160
the basic narrative which surrounds it to say okay they were wondering what would it be for someone

164
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,880
to look for immortality in a certain poetic way he found it because well we're we're still talking

165
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:45,320
about him so good for him but the the question lies there what is mortality and how can we face it

166
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,480
and we're still looking for answers today there is even a whole branch of psychology that's

167
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:03,000
that that that dedicates itself to the to the people that are dying and well it's very it's very

168
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:16,120
difficult for us to to to symbolize that so we tried a lot in a lot of ways but we are creatures

169
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,720
of meaning we need meaning in our lives

170
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:31,800
the in in greek greece in Athens I mentioned the paraitolia and I don't know if it's

171
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:40,280
perfectly translated english if it's basically that but it's the principle of the brain to look for

172
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:46,440
patterns and to look for meaning things even if if they are not there which might have been a very

173
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:56,120
evolutionary edge for us but it's still here with us that we need to look for meaning I always

174
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,520
at least when I work with teenagers I give the I give them the the idea that color in itself

175
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,640
doesn't exist it's like what are you talking about of course it exists I mean look at look

176
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,560
at all the the colors we have here well in fact color is a construction of the of our brain

177
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:24,360
it's not something let's say objective different animal different eyes see different colors the

178
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,240
colors are the reflection of the light that our eye and our brain are able to produce

179
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:43,480
but color in itself is not a thing which is very weird but which is again a testament of the

180
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,960
evolutionary presence of meaning in in not only in in our lives but but surrounding us

181
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:00,360
so they of course it's the it's the strange explanation but it's in fact the way it is

182
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,160
even if we if our experience is nothing like it so

183
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:16,280
well these ideas go go towards mythology in mythology at least

184
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,960
the one I specialize in which is Greek mythology we find a lot of the of the problems of

185
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:36,040
existentialism so it's like existentialism is a new branch of of philosophy why would it be so

186
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:45,800
present over so many things so so long ago written and it's like well yeah because existentialism

187
00:25:45,800 --> 00:26:00,040
has been around forever and there is a certain strange parallelism in in the idea of psychoanalysis

188
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:09,320
of conscious and conscious and in that's that's very well established in in mythology and philosophy

189
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:17,560
in the ancient world on one hand the idea of rationality as the great means of understanding

190
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:25,560
the universe and ourselves and in a certain way mythology just came around and saying that these

191
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:34,040
are the ways we we understand the world and ourselves so the the great hero of Greek mythology

192
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,600
might be Odysseus the only mortal one the only purely mortal that he suffered a lot and there we

193
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:52,440
find one of the aspects that I think actually defines existentialism that life is is tragedy

194
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,800
and there's nothing we can do about it of course we can we have all the techniques and

195
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:07,720
on all them the the technology that allows us to live quite comfortable we're not very hungry so often

196
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,080
we're not very cold so often we have the entertainment we have medicine yet there's

197
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:25,480
nothing we can do with the existential dilemmas and it comes to to mind now sorry if I if I keep on

198
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:39,000
bringing stuff the the the the soma of all of no sorry all no 1980 no brave new world hoaxly

199
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,320
where the the drug that's just

200
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:52,600
implicated let's say or decreased all the the the suffering in in oneself and it's like

201
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,680
if we could do that if we had a drug which we have plenty of them but none that that are so

202
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:11,400
so at least so effective should we do it should we release the world from the suffering and even

203
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,760
if we if we can wouldn't there be a lot of people that think okay but what if I just

204
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,840
bring this down if I burn this up if I punch this this person so

205
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:39,880
it's another well paradox of existentialism it's suffering something we need to avoid there is

206
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:49,240
something that makes us who we are and in a certain way psychology deals with the suffering

207
00:28:49,240 --> 00:29:00,360
with psychopathology and of course I'd say that again sorry sorry Saturday that that I

208
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,640
that I criticized him so much he he knew nothing of psychopathology I don't know if you're aware

209
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:18,200
that he even tried to introduce a he hated Freud he absolutely detested him and

210
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:29,800
there is a movie in the 1960s Freud the secret passion I think it's called that Sartre wrote the

211
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,400
the first draft of the of the movie well the director said no this this just puts Freud in a

212
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:50,040
in a horrible position why would you do that that script was discarded but he tried to introduce a

213
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:57,160
psychoanalysis even called existential psychoanalysis which denied the idea of the unconscious

214
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:06,280
now the unconscious is still today debated a lot even if we at least here in Argentina

215
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:16,280
psychoanalysis is quite popular and not so in in in Europe or other countries I found myself

216
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:24,840
seeing that in Athens which I later called upon say okay you're leaving behind a very useful tool

217
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:33,160
that might be able to explain a lot of what's going on so the

218
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:43,080
the the ancient idea of of the search for meaning is later present in in religion

219
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,200
that the constitution of of the the big religions we have today as answers

220
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:57,240
for the the the search for meaning what does in a certain way religion do

221
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:04,760
it gives you the the certainty of what happens beyond death wonderful like now you know

222
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:15,080
this is what happens and every religion gives an answer so religion is quite useful in that way

223
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,800
to to to release ourselves from the the despair that can come from us

224
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,640
also gives you okay this is the way you live this is the way you need to to to conduct yourself

225
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:39,080
which is again very useful and even even though in psychoanalysis Freud was very harsh on religion

226
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:47,400
he recognized the the usefulness it had maybe he was too

227
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:57,640
too naive to see that it's not about rationality the the thing of religion it's about much more

228
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,760
and it gives much more even today of course european

229
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:12,440
and it's going a little further away from religion as people are even more educated but

230
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:20,040
the the rest of the world is another experience and we see we see it in the in the conflicts

231
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:30,120
we're having right now at least in the the middle east so these things are still present

232
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:40,520
the war is still present in in the in the in the world we we have it's like no but the the

233
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:47,960
greeks were from war to war well that's not the greeks that's humankind we just go from one thing

234
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,680
to another and we can even count the years in the world that there were no wars at all which are

235
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:04,520
very few so the the existential dilemmas are still here and they have practical

236
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:16,440
aspects to it there is even the the the idea of what do we do with the with the intolerance

237
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:29,000
and you you guys over over europe are much much closer to the wars than i am but there is a specific

238
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,360
aspect of saying okay what do we do do we fight for survival or are we able to to just talk about it

239
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:48,680
what you do and there is no no talk no talk available so there is a in these there are

240
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:58,760
also very practical aspects in fact i think of another another story

241
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:10,520
written by by camus which takes the concept or the concept of sycophers i don't know if if all

242
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,280
of you know who sycophers is but he's a character from greek mythology that that

243
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:25,160
cheated on death on two occasions and after that he was condemned by the gods to

244
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:36,680
to well to tartarus the hell of the of the weak world he was condemned to to carry a huge rock

245
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,160
onto the top of the mountain and at the end of the day exhausted he saw how it rolled over all over

246
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:54,040
again so that he was he had to to go again and again so he was condemned to meaninglessness

247
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,800
he was condemned to the labor and to the effort without any reward at all so

248
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:14,360
camus many many years after takes that story to talk about suicide to talk about meaning

249
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:21,160
and to talk about a very difficult aspect of reality that's saying okay why don't we kill

250
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,480
ourselves so he said all the questions of philosophy are on second place towards the

251
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:36,760
question of suicide because on that we find ourselves asking okay what makes me want to

252
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:45,320
live the life i have so it's a very again don't talk about suicide on parties because that's no

253
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:57,480
it's not an easy an easy subject yet it's a very important subject so it's a very very

254
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:11,080
when the the helpful organization talks about that they they they of course they give them the

255
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:19,480
thing the certain importance yet they struggle to to talk about it and just and to find the

256
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,920
the real reasons why people do it because it's a very difficult aspect and and a very difficult

257
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:37,160
thing to to understand it's a very personal experience so well it's of course alarming that

258
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:45,720
that's almost one million of people are committed suicide a year according to the statistics but

259
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:54,120
it's also a very important thing to talk about because that's the maybe one of the most existential

260
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:03,240
problems we have because it faces us with with with our condition and why would someone choose

261
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:13,320
that there is i remember when i was working at um at the public hospital that i i discussed this

262
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:20,200
with a colleague of mine saying all suicide is psychopathological because of course we can we

263
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:29,160
can see with someone with depression someone maybe with schizophrenia but it's all suicide like that

264
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:41,400
and it's a very at least i haven't come upon the the question any other any other place other

265
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:51,800
other myself but it's um well it's very difficult to face those those problems so

266
00:37:52,840 --> 00:38:00,520
oh we tend to avoid them and we can avoid them particularly in our societies which are

267
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:11,080
meant to distract us there is a very good book of Vargas Llosa sorry another Latin American writer

268
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,400
and it's called the the the civilization of entertainment she's very good

269
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,400
very simple to to read maybe the translation should be should be good enough

270
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:36,920
but we can avoid it for so long for it punches us in the face because because we at least well

271
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,800
not all of us will have to face death at some point maybe not ourselves but yes and the people

272
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:53,320
we love we will have to to deal with suffering one way or another so this idea that the the world

273
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:01,000
decides a nice place where we should be comfortable might be very detrimental for us might be very

274
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:17,400
very very false which in a in a certain way comes to the to the to the to the to the fight

275
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:25,320
of of ideas very barely poorly equipped so

276
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:36,840
well i think of of the of the buddhist one of the of the four noble truths of buddhism

277
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:46,600
life is suffering and that's again we go to the antiquity we go to towards

278
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:55,480
the the these three fathers of thought which were socrates confucius and the buddha

279
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:04,840
which changed the way we understood things but none of them said that life is something

280
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:13,320
nice and something comfortable and something that that's a gift from the gods in fact they

281
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:23,800
they socrates well criticized a lot and and with good with good ideas the socratic method is still

282
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:34,680
present in us in our psychotherapy so the the the ideas of buddha and confucius all come to a

283
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,600
the questions of existentialism what should we do with our life how do we deal with death

284
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:50,600
how do we deal with suffering and are so inextricably linked with the with with ourselves that

285
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:59,240
we find that it's worth exploring all of these things even if we have no answer

286
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:07,720
and of course if you are here you are interested in one way or another for all of this and that

287
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:17,640
the the the the the basic idea of existentialism which in this in this sort of activities and

288
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:26,440
and channels and and the the offerings is a a wonderful place to to explore this and to

289
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,920
at least feel that the suffering we might have is not unique to us because that that's

290
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:44,200
another thing that within the the psychotherapy sphere we try and deal that the person comes

291
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:52,040
saying okay i suffer i suffer specifically my suffering is unique and to a certain point it is

292
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,080
but certain aspects of that are absolutely

293
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,600
shared between us so

294
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,640
my my ideas would be to to

295
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,640
to find the way of of asking this to find and to find places where we can talk about all of this

296
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:30,920
maybe there are some some very good guidance in all of these things and in fact we can even

297
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:40,840
help help other people in this network of existential branching for the for the difficult

298
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:49,240
aspects of life because i guaranteed you know someone who's struggling with all of this if not

299
00:42:49,240 --> 00:43:02,520
yourself and that struggling is in a certain way the the the core aspect of of the greek idea

300
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:09,560
that there's a tragedy that's why they invented tragedy then came the romans that made them the

301
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:16,040
circus with the with the coliseum and the the entertainment of death but the greeks and i

302
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:23,240
think we have a mixture of greek and roman that's why we have i don't know the world cup and that's

303
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,040
fantastic as it is it's so it's purely entertainment and but also we have the tragedy

304
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:38,680
we have the the movies and we have the the the art that connects us with that part of of ourselves

305
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:53,080
so i hope nobody nobody has has fallen into a silent despair but yes that we can we can

306
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:59,320
hear you and see what what you have to say about all of this of course there's a lot to

307
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:08,120
to to learn about ancient times and i think those three figures are a wonderful way of starting

308
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:19,560
i also recommend um uh called jaspers then that he talks about all of these three figures uh no no

309
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:28,680
i think he changes socrates for jesus so he talks about the figure those those three figures us and

310
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:43,160
as um as a way of understanding who we are so uh i think it's uh it's later over there but i hope

311
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:53,640
everyone's uh wondering at least my idea would be that we we share questions not the the answers

312
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,240
because of course this is not a lecture that i have the the absolute truth and in fact it's

313
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:07,800
more of the of the experience we have and the and the the the ways we have of understanding

314
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:19,160
ourselves and our lives and the and the spaces we we uh we're in even if it's work family

315
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:29,080
and the these sort of places but how can we apply certain things of this towards the the

316
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
the concrete aspects of our lives

317
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,520
i think if any if anybody if anybody um

318
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,960
um uh finds finds yourself uh wondering how can we connect over this of course it's a very good

319
00:45:51,960 --> 00:46:01,000
thing if you if you can talk and and say um i hope nobody's uh dizzy with all the the the

320
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,040
concepts and the ideas sorry if i if i branch too much

321
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:13,560
no it was exciting to follow all of the different branches and go on such a journey

322
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,560
in in my own thinking and our own thinking but then throughout history and just um i'm gonna

323
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,800
reiterate what what marcos is saying let's make this a discussion let's make this a questioning

324
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,320
a shared questioning together um and i think the question that comes for me or the kind of

325
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:40,200
discussion that exploration that comes for me is what you say about clients coming to us or

326
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:48,360
people coming to us or even for ourselves that in that moment our suffering feels like the most

327
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:58,520
unique and extreme experience of suffering that could exist and even as therapists even as coaches

328
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:06,360
even as reflective and intelligent beings that know that statistically historically that's not

329
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:15,400
the case but still somehow there's that sense that big sense if we're being approached or

330
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,440
confronting something in the future or in the moment or in the past that's incredibly difficult

331
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:27,800
for us that we are isolated in it um i suppose i don't want to speak for ages i would love for

332
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,720
other people to jump in can i can i ask yeah yeah tony go so lovely to see you and thank you so

333
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:44,520
much for doing these things awesome i mean i've had um i've in my life i've had five suicide

334
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:54,360
friends which i think is an exception of suicide friends and um the impact of that is may and i

335
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:02,120
you know i'm a deep absurdist or existentialist and you know my my question on a daily basis is

336
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:12,200
really is about resilience and opposing forces to this absurdity because i mean if you know i think

337
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:19,960
we all get that it's absurd um i think that you know every time i read lots of stuff i resonate

338
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:26,680
more than you can ever believe but i think the question is how to live an absurdity in a way

339
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:36,680
that um is nourishing and uh as a you know i'm a pathologist by training so so i mean you know

340
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,720
i'm a hard-nosed scientist so the question always is is you know we know we know what we know if you

341
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,080
like the complexity of of of these questions but what's the antidote

342
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,200
two things come come to mind of course sisyphus and and the and the absurd

343
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,840
but

344
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:15,800
the the the existential branch of thought comes a bit against the idea the rationality can can

345
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:22,760
read us of all the problems we have so that that's where the the subjective aspect comes from

346
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:32,760
and in a certain way there is no antidote at least not an antidote that can work for everyone

347
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:43,240
because meaning is a very personal experience so nobody can well you can try and impose meaning

348
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:52,120
on others you can try and say okay look this works for me try it but that doesn't assure you that

349
00:49:52,200 --> 00:50:01,160
that it will work so it's a very very close relationship you have with with suicide the

350
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:11,240
absurd i don't think many people acknowledge the absurdity of all because it's a very difficult

351
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:22,600
thing to to digest it's it's very it leaves us very naked onto the world so that's where the

352
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:30,600
the subjective tools come in at least my faith goes towards the person goes to work towards

353
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:37,160
the individual so one question just because then i'll i'll chat up because i could talk for england

354
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:46,760
um nisha our lovely nisha who we love so much um the famous camel hypothesis you know you know

355
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:54,280
which i i pretty much love actually i i use it every day i mean i suppose my question is is is

356
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:03,240
the camel a desensitized absurdist and tony can i ask you to explain the camel for people that don't

357
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:11,320
well yeah sorry sorry i mean the camel is you know in in um nisha thought and it's quite

358
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:19,320
close to go to actually the the camel um you know he believed that four metamorphosis of man was the

359
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:26,440
camel first then the camel becomes a lion the lion slays the dragon and the dragon becomes the child

360
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:33,800
so he he basically said that uh and i know it's very interesting because you use the word all

361
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:40,840
dyshuxley who i love um i mean and you you use the word who i mean was it all dyshuxley or was it

362
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:47,000
the the other guy who came up with the term the proletariat so let's use the word the proletariat

363
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,600
that nisha came up with the idea the proletariat were camors and that they had desensitized themselves

364
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:00,760
to this absurdity and then in came the lions that were trying to transform who were absolutely

365
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:08,360
naked to that absurdity tried to slay the slay the dragon and then became the child so i mean you

366
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:15,000
know there there is a question i have on a daily basis in my own world of which so many people seem

367
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,960
to be happy and absurdity that distresses me really but i'll shut up on that one maybe otherwise

368
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:31,320
i might talk for england well remember that the the camel needs to give way to the lion the lion

369
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:38,760
then to the child uh we're talking about the spoke saratustra which is a very good book

370
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:48,520
very recommended possible but yeah might might be difficult but but it but but within it the

371
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,280
all the concepts of nature and

372
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:01,960
in a certain way he needs to talks about the camel as as a metaphor for the animal that's

373
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:09,720
that's very very harsh and able to to support a lot of weight in fact that's the the idea

374
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:18,920
that the camel carries the weight of of the hump onto itself which gives him or if sorry

375
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:26,120
the the chance to survive the desert would give him the chance to to to live but then it needs to

376
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:33,720
change uh the the it was a very very accurate idea that the last metamorphosis of the child

377
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:41,480
because the child plays because the child creates and because the child is in a certain way

378
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,680
all potential so the idea of of getting rid of of god was not in in

379
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,520
talking about this idea of god is dead and we have killed him

380
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:08,840
and to be able to create and to create our own morality our own way of living makes us the

381
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:20,280
the ubermanche makes us the ultra ultra man i don't know in english um yeah the ubermanche

382
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:34,440
the ubermanche uh if if um i would say that i i agree in a certain sense with with barter and

383
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:44,840
rassel one of the of the great um the philosophers of great britain uh he says i i think in an

384
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:52,040
in an essay about nature that we should we should always listen to him but be very careful to follow

385
00:54:52,040 --> 00:55:01,400
him because the idea of the government doesn't consider the idea of others with us doesn't

386
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,560
consider the idea that we can build our own morality for ourselves because we we're never

387
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:17,000
on us alone i i go to to add his total again the only ones who don't need others are the beasts

388
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,640
or the gods all of us we need we need the other and that's also the the the idea of

389
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:34,040
but why but why i would love to go to a dinner party with all of you and talk about suicide

390
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:40,280
but why why are we so different to the camel

391
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:51,800
we meaning who this group who are here is a representative of existential

392
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,600
thinkers or behaviors or whatever

393
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:04,360
what makes you think we're we're so different from the camel well maybe we are firing things

394
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:12,520
the reason i i think is because i'm a biologist and i i see that groups of societies have such

395
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,400
clusters of different if you like types who are there with a different job our job is to

396
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:27,240
agitate society really and that's well i'll go i'll go back to the

397
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,160
do you remember the the the cave allegory of Plato yeah yeah the

398
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,960
do you remember why they chose to stay chained and and to see the shadows no because

399
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:54,440
because seeing the truth because facing all these things is extremely difficult and not all of us

400
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:04,760
are prepared and well one would say also with with the haxley idea why would someone

401
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:15,480
uh anesthetize himself and we do it all the time we're not we're not exempt of the suffering

402
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:25,080
these entails so it's a very difficult thing and we try and be children in a certain way in

403
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:34,680
in an extreme way but it's difficult and might be that at some point we are camels and some

404
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:42,200
point we're lions and some point we're children and some points we are we are just too tired to

405
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:56,520
face all of this so um it's it's a a a strange way this idea of of facing all of this that's why

406
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:04,840
well in many ways religion is still very very disseminated across the world

407
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:14,360
um very helpful in many ways because it's uh i would not say impossible but extremely hard

408
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:24,440
to think of everything ourselves we need to rely on the on to to to stand on the shoulders of giants

409
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:31,000
umberto eco has a very good book about that that's called on the shoulders of giants

410
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:38,600
no i need to us because we need we we rely on on on the ones that came before

411
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:46,360
and that's why the idea would be they can still teach us a lot but we need to look further and if

412
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:53,880
we can't see further it's because they made the the much of the hard work i don't know what the

413
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:01,400
world would be without the greeks i think i mean um i can't remember the author but

414
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:11,800
but he talked about the the battle of marathon as uh maybe the the most important event on the

415
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:19,960
history of western civilization because if they if the Athenians had lost that battle the world

416
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:27,240
would be a lot different and democracy would have would have let's say um died in its infancy

417
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:39,320
so uh yeah i i think i got i got carried away but um why people thank you for not to thank you for

418
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:50,120
the dialogue i'd love that no but but the but i i i'd say i find it much more interesting

419
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:58,680
why would someone face these things rather than than be anesthetized it's it's uh i think that

420
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:05,480
question is much more uh much more relevant why would someone choose to face all of this

421
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,840
when they can just immerse themselves in i don't know football politics even religion

422
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:22,440
that gives you the answers there is a in psychoanalysis we we talk about uh sorry if the translation

423
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:31,320
is not correct uh not the fault and how would you say if when something is missing in you

424
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:47,480
um devoid devoid yeah it's not exactly void uh it's like the the castrate castrated when

425
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:59,560
and something is missing let's just call it the the missing fanaticism and and Freud makes a very

426
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:09,720
good case of this fanaticism compensates the missing so you um and and the missing might very well be

427
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:21,000
the meaning in life and that's a a missing that cannot be undone cannot we cannot um we cannot

428
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:32,280
uh successfully um equilibrate equilibrated or balance it so of course the the fanaticism

429
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:44,360
supports in religion remember the thing of of the void it might be the void i have to look

430
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,720
for the translation i've never read Freud in english which would be a very interesting experience

431
01:01:50,440 --> 01:02:02,760
and the the fanaticism is the compensation of that we we we feel that void with with that

432
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:14,520
with our team with our church with our values and much of the artistic aspects of the of the child

433
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:23,960
goes towards that children find themselves playing with with let's say an empty box

434
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:31,080
and they have have a wonderful time but adults we say but it's just a box

435
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:41,160
that doesn't matter the children create in in the void in the absence of and maybe that's

436
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:49,160
where we at least the ones that approach these ideas go towards we create where there is none

437
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:57,560
we we make ourselves answers where there is no answer at all and that's very difficult that's

438
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:09,160
might be uh very very harsh on on or heavy but in a certain way these places are wonderful for that

439
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,960
to say that we all are asking the same questions what can we do with that

440
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:25,160
so i don't know if it's i i don't have a very optimistic answers for this at least not in the

441
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:33,000
in the existential department um but but yeah um i hope it answers a little bit of the question

442
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,840
yeah thank you welcome you're welcome

443
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:48,520
can i ask you something where do you place the human encounter

444
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:59,160
in encounter meeting of two persons the social encounter yeah yeah in in this

445
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:10,200
uh in this difficult process of of trying to deal with existence or yeah

446
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:22,120
or the void or whatever or so yeah you say the child creates in the absence of things you know

447
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:30,280
so and maybe that's easier than than to create by means of the human relationship

448
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,160
that's that's why it's so difficult to relate maybe you know

449
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,120
maybe there's the truth in there or something i don't know so the topic of of human encounter

450
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:51,960
does it has a place in this in this existentialistic position uh yeah

451
01:04:54,280 --> 01:05:08,600
i think the i think it was in the in the 80s or the 70s in tokyo there was um a very big problem

452
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:18,840
with suicides of young men so the government consults with a group of psychologists and the

453
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:27,240
psychologists suggest that uh as the as the means of suicide was the train to jump onto the train

454
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:33,240
that they put mirrors on the other side of the of the train of the of the of the

455
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:43,480
the the place where the train of the rails yeah the idea was that that would give the the man

456
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:53,480
like a shock of narcissism to say okay no i look at myself and and i choose not to jump

457
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:01,960
well that didn't work of course why because the mirror is never the mirror literally

458
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:09,080
the mirror we see ourselves by other relationships we have at the others at the encounters

459
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:20,280
and the it was like a very literal way of understanding humankind

460
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:30,840
so the encounter is not only necessary is the thing that makes us who we are

461
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:38,520
if if nobody was there to receive you when you were a newborn you would die or even if

462
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:50,040
he if they give you the food and the shelter you would still die because i think it's called white

463
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:59,960
death um the the that happened i think it was started in poland uh at a certain war

464
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:08,280
where many of the adults when were killed and many babies were left at the care of very few people

465
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,680
and they gave them the shelter and the warmth and the and the food but they gave them no more

466
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:25,160
attention than they needed there was no let's say sorry for the word erotic eroticization of

467
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:32,920
the subjectivity of the of the psychic apparatus so there wasn't like no will to live

468
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:43,560
so yeah the the encounter is is what makes us who we are that's why sartre says that the hell is

469
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:49,240
others because they are very capable of torturing ourselves but they are also capable of saving

470
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:55,560
and that's where he missed he just saw the the the negative aspect of the encounter

471
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:10,040
and yeah existentialism is always about people never in solitude we we might suffer in solitude

472
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:21,960
but dilemmas are shared the the problems are uh well very much uh faced together that's at least

473
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:29,560
one of the the core ideas of psychotherapy but another an encounter can help you face things

474
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:38,600
that you could not face before that's why they approach us or or anyone and that's a

475
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,240
a very powerful encounter at least when you click when you have the

476
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,400
for chemistry with your with your therapist it's a wonderful experience

477
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:56,040
so yeah the encounter is uh central it's like the antidote we found the antidote

478
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:02,200
it might might be for for tony i like that one

479
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,800
yeah well we need it we need it my friend we need it i begin to like tony yeah

480
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:21,240
well we'll we'll be there together okay well that that's uh well that that came from an encounter

481
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,600
so yeah the the answer in action

482
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,560
and anna says in the chat all we need is love and a smiley face

483
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,880
well yeah

484
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,920
i don't know if he was so catchy all we need is meaning snub so

485
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,680
yeah not so so phonetically attractive

486
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,320
if frankle was in the Beatles that was his thing

487
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:18,520
so uh it's um of course the the ideas would be uh would forth uh very very well in much more

488
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:27,000
time and much more uh uh deep analysis of of the the Greek culture and of the

489
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:35,960
Buddhism and the ideas they have and there is a lot of analysis we can make of all of this

490
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:45,560
even the the bible has a lot of extension uh aspects to it it's after all well very very

491
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:55,960
inspired in in Greek ideas but that's the the the the the book that

492
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:03,960
the western civilization was built upon so of course it's in a certain way

493
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:11,080
filled with ideas we can connect not because of the of the truth of the idea i don't know if

494
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:20,440
i don't believe adam and eve are a literal and a literal story about how we come to be

495
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:27,640
but yes that it has a certain metaphors we must remember that we are symbolic creatures

496
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:35,320
the words we use are metaphors if i speak of a tree the word tree means nothing

497
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,800
if we have the meaning shed that's where the metaphor applies and and we understand each other

498
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:50,120
so through metaphors and through the stories as well as and i think that's the idea of the Greeks

499
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:58,040
they understood that that the metaphors on the on the myth and the philosophy uh could coexist

500
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:09,960
and in fact did in there but and as as tony said well biology and science is so wonderful too

501
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:21,720
the problem is and i find it's a very very funny question for me that can science answer all the

502
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:29,960
questions it's a question that can't be answered but by science because science can't deal with

503
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:39,320
everything i think that's a tremendous question um but i mean one just one one with this thing

504
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:45,160
do you think that many humans are suppressed existentialists

505
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:51,160
what do you mean what what do you mean by suppressed

506
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:59,720
well conformity has has erased their questioning

507
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:09,400
well that's that's education for you formal education because i mean i i have a children's

508
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:17,720
book that my grandchild had and i think that the modern children books are moving away from

509
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:26,680
metaphor to literal so it's a bit like you know oh i i agree and and it's you wonder whether what's

510
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:34,360
going to happen is that we're going to suppress a lot of it in um in banality which i think is a

511
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:49,480
very interesting word well i see it as well i i um in this couple of years of days i saw news

512
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:03,080
that in the simpsons um the new episodes of the simpsons will not have a Homer strangling Bart

513
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:10,760
yeah because oh no you can't show this because the children and i was like

514
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:21,160
that's that's uh an interesting take on that that that that we we lose the idea of that that's

515
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:30,120
a cartoon that's not that the people go struggling people because they see Homer uh so it was like

516
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:36,680
that's like going towards the most literal of the of the readings you can make of that

517
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:45,560
and and in a certain way the most simplistic and superficial idea of that of course it's a

518
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:53,880
it's a funny example but i agree that we are losing metaphor we are losing the idea that words

519
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:03,880
are complex things they're not defined they're not um they're not written in stone like saying

520
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:12,360
okay god means peace well it depends on where you are and what context and what place and and

521
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:22,440
how you use the word so uh yeah i i agree with the diagnosis that we are we are becoming more

522
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:33,320
literal at or at least they they are trying to they like who they are i think it's a lot based on

523
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:43,320
ideology and a way of thinking of people and our children specifically but it happens over there

524
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:56,520
and happens here in in argentina as well uh literality is quite uh i would say it's like they

525
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:04,440
they don't give the child the chance to to fall it's like everything everything is controlled and

526
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:14,440
and uh it's it's um no good that they struggle because when you introduce something to a child

527
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:21,480
well they can repeat the word but they don't quite understand the concept the abstract idea

528
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:30,120
yet uh it's a struggle they have to make to to to keep incorporating things

529
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:41,480
so the the idea of the literality is is very yeah i would say it's poisonous enough

530
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:49,080
as it is to not make people think very very deeply thinking has never been easy

531
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:58,360
has never been economically friendly uh in the in the in the in the sense of the of the brain the

532
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:08,520
brain itself it's quite lazy it tries it tries to deal with with everything even information

533
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:18,760
as as efficiently as possible so it's it is going against the current against the the the the the

534
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:28,120
waves but i think it's a fight that's worth giving to try and think i don't think it's a

535
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:35,240
very good very good pathway not to think about things and not to connect with things because

536
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:42,520
it's not only that you lose the the the capacity to think abstractly of complex ideas but you also

537
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:51,800
lose the ability to connect with the emotions to go within so and and that's even more difficult to

538
01:17:52,680 --> 01:18:03,640
to counter weight and because they they they chop off the the possibility of um well of connecting

539
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:12,440
with with the high emotions and powerful emotions but also with harsh emotions so uh that's part of

540
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:25,560
life the both extremes i hope everyone leaves here with many questions

541
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:39,000
it's it's interesting because we came in thinking about ancient existential thinking and kind of

542
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,400
following it questioning its trajectory but this part of the conversation is quite disturbing to

543
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:53,320
think of where that future will go you know it can we get to the point as if if existential ideas

544
01:18:53,320 --> 01:19:00,920
started at the start of human civilization is the trajectory that we're following that eventually

545
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:07,640
we won't question are we are we questioning less deeply i mean it's it's kind of mind blowing to

546
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:15,480
think that i think generally speaking the the like you've been saying the the value in storytelling

547
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:23,240
the value in myth the value in arts the value in performance all of this has been replaced by other

548
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:32,520
value systems that have just been you know really really shoved into the the faces and the psyches

549
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:39,960
of the population and uh you know it's it's not a comfortable thought it's quite an oppressive

550
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:47,640
thought to think where does that where does that go from here but you you might want to think what

551
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:57,480
what are we doing here today aren't we uh trying to to deal with with some aspects of the of the

552
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:08,280
human reality in a in a deep way and in a deep uh and and uh yeah maybe disturbing idea that's why

553
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:16,520
the the the dystopian authors are so so interesting to me because they show a part of the of the

554
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:25,000
reality which could come to be i mean i i love the t-shirt that's saying of orwell that says

555
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:35,640
i told you so i think that's brilliant i i warned you guys not with with much anticipation

556
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:48,520
and we we have a constantly news about the state of of um double thought i i i i i saw in england

557
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:55,800
those uh interesting news that police goes to your to your place if you don't have the

558
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:02,440
right idea if you protest against something that's not you should not be protested against

559
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:13,800
so it's well that's orwellian all right and and that's why thinking has always been problematic

560
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:25,080
but uh at least in a in a in a community way this is a very powerful thing but also in the

561
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:35,000
in the in the psychotherapy department is okay think about uh about yourself and who you are

562
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:47,080
who you want to be who you can be uh so yeah i don't find that that it's more disturbing now

563
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:53,720
than it was before we've seen atrocities uh all over the the history of humankind

564
01:21:53,720 --> 01:22:05,160
and maybe the the shock comes with the idea that life should be easy peaceful and and with a

565
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:15,160
with a with a soft music behind you know life is and and the events of the world have shown that

566
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:22,600
life is difficult and life is many times unexpected but we need to fight for the

567
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:29,400
the ideas we stand for and for the things that makes us who we are so yeah

568
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,120
of course it's disturbing but it's only disturbing if you look at it

569
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,920
the thing is it's difficult to look and to understand what what do we see that's why people

570
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,680
who was it Pascal

571
01:22:52,920 --> 01:23:02,440
that says something like this like it's easier or i don't know it's easier for

572
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:09,960
for people to to trust what they see in their eyes instead of thinking about it

573
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:17,880
because one is seeing beyond what you see maybe a little bit connected with the

574
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:27,160
literality we talked before so it's always been difficult but it's a fight that

575
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:35,080
uh at least gives meaning at least to me to to keep on with the with the ideas

576
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:43,000
that and that these things deserve the the time and deserve our energy

577
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:54,360
and i think in one way kind of thinking what Tony was saying at the beginning it

578
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:01,080
there's something you know unified there's something almost courageous to be spending

579
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:07,640
your life specifically dedicated to exploring these ideas and you were speaking about this

580
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:12,680
kind of this group of existentialists collecting together today whether that's live or you know

581
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:21,080
in the in the future viewers but it another side of that argument is everyone to to an

582
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:28,600
extent everybody is questioning these ideas in their own way and actually finding a community

583
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:36,360
like we have created and are creating there is there's something a lot easier to be able

584
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:42,920
to to question in this collective community and have the resources that we do and i think

585
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:48,520
you know everybody's thinking but where it's almost easier we're almost fortunate to have

586
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,920
to be thinking about it in this community rather than just flailing around you know

587
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,120
isolatedly and a lot of my clients come to me because they have been questioning these

588
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:06,680
questions alone and it's incredibly scary and painful whether that's finding a community within

589
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,440
an existential philosophy and having those resources or whether that's in music and

590
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:16,680
collaborating in that way or arts in that way but i remember naturally there was one of your

591
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,640
that lovely thing you did was it last year when you interviewed all these people and

592
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:28,120
there was a guy who said um you know that he would go to a dinner party and never leave

593
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:33,640
not leave if we were talking about this subject i can't remember the name of the guy but it but

594
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:41,720
it's very it's almost irony isn't it that we would um we as a group would love a dinner party around

595
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:49,160
this we would drink all night you wouldn't we wouldn't leave whereas most parties i go to

596
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:53,880
i want to be there under 30 seconds and i'm on to delete so isn't it ironic

597
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:09,400
the remember that not everyone is ready for those questions but once you start it's very

598
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:19,960
difficult to believe that once you start is almost like there is a point of no return

599
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:28,840
yeah i love that i love that what what is your drive to continue questioning

600
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,000
my drive

601
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,400
at some point why do you why do you look at the disturbing

602
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:50,280
why do i look at that it's disturbing at the disturbing i mean looking at things

603
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,040
things are disturbing only when you look at it and you said

604
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,280
yeah so what's your drive to open yourself to the disturbing

605
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:10,840
i remember there was a writer that was was asked why does he write

606
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,520
and he answered because i cannot not do it

607
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:27,160
and and and i think once you go towards these questions you can't stop you can't i mean it's

608
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:37,000
very difficult to to uh very difficult or even impossible without any uh huge defense mechanisms

609
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:45,960
might be crippling defense mechanisms to see something to not see something that you saw

610
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:55,960
so um i if i can't i cannot stop looking at things but that doesn't mean that

611
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,440
that i can't appreciate the the wonderful things that are down here look at the the space we have

612
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:09,640
we have today it's a wonderful thing to be able to communicate from two sides of the world

613
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:15,320
and to talk about these things of course they are difficult of course they are uncomfortable

614
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:21,320
but the the alternative is much worse at least for me that's why it's a choice

615
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,800
and it's a difficult choice and it's a choice that might not be for all

616
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:36,920
remember that these things are and and the the struggles we have are the same the same as the

617
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:45,480
ones that uh the Greeks had the the the cave the allegory of the cave is exactly that many

618
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:51,640
will choose to remain in the cave and there is nothing we can do for them because they they

619
01:28:51,640 --> 01:29:01,800
have to choose and that's the freedom that's the the exercise of freedom they have even if it's not

620
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:12,600
for the for the their their benefit that's of course we can we can lament we can we can

621
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:25,240
we can suffer the idea of them of everyone not seeing something we can't impose that thing on

622
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:33,080
them that's why at least in psychotherapy it's no use if someone says oh no you should go to therapy

623
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:39,960
and and and i'll take you because there is not something personal that the person chooses to work

624
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:51,320
there i remember in in the public hospital and we had a specific team that dedicated themselves to

625
01:29:52,280 --> 01:30:00,120
to to traffic yeah so so the people that that came to to renew their licenses need to make a

626
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:10,200
a psychic test and and have a certain space and i would say no i i don't want them because they

627
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,480
are not patients they don't choose to be there they are forced by the circumstances of their work

628
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:23,320
and in fact that's the the case they didn't work in therapy they they just it was just a

629
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:32,200
part of the of the functionality of the the demands that the the the the government made

630
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:40,920
that's why it's first the desire desire to go there desire to work that's a very good first step

631
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,640
to therapy

632
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:56,440
i've got my eye on the time and uh just like you say it's once you start it's very difficult to

633
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:02,040
stop i think we've all proved the case that it's very difficult to stop this and even when we close

634
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:09,160
today today's session we'll all be thinking because we really can't stop um but in terms of actual

635
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:14,920
time we we definitely have to bring it to a close unfortunately but i want to thank absolutely

636
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,680
everybody thank you so much for for taking the time to come and thank you for everyone that

637
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:26,840
contributed either just by your presence or just in the chat or or part of the conversation to make

638
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:32,200
this event what it is it's so nice to have a community i think that's what comes for me today

639
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:38,040
one of the many things it's so amazing to have this community to explore these questions and um

640
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:43,880
it wouldn't exist without everybody that makes it so so thank you so much and of course a huge
