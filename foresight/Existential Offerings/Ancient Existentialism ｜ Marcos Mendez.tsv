0	29360	so welcome everybody welcome back to some faces as well it is so so exciting to
29360	34960	be sharing the space with you again this evening or newly this evening I'm
34960	42400	really it's the third session today of these kind of existential offerings live
42400	46760	events and I'm just starting to have it as something that I really really look
46760	51520	forward to because each session is so different and the discussions always
51520	57080	leave me with so much to think about and as ever I just want to kind of bring
57080	62600	in that that that idea that even though we're just squares on each other's
62600	66880	screens we are real people in real time joining together and sharing this
66880	72600	experience and it's it's just so special I know that some of the people here have
72600	77480	bought tickets that are free some of them have donated some of them have spent
77480	82600	money it either way it's just so you know it's so wonderful because what we are
82600	87960	giving all of us is is our time and that is so valuable and I'm so grateful so
87960	92320	thank you so much to the people that are live and watching for sharing your time
92320	96160	and thank you so much for the people that will watch this in the future for
96160	101560	have using your time this precious time to be engaging with these existential
101560	107120	ideas and even though we're in the present today we're going right back to
107120	113040	the past to explore ancient existential ideas with none other than
113040	118880	Marcos Maria Mendez who is joining us all the way from Argentina so thank you
118880	125280	Marcos we met in Athens and I remember you were standing there kind of
125280	131240	improvising your talk passionately about Greek philosophies and how they're still
131240	136920	relevant today and I just thought right we need to have these ideas spread
136920	141960	further so this is the reason that Marcos shares the space with us today and I
141960	147520	won't chatter and take up any more time Marcos I just welcome you and welcome you
147520	154040	to introduce yourself well thank you it's a wonderful wonderful thing to be
154040	161640	here and yes in fact we met in Athens and well you might expect a little bit of
162000	167280	the same things here because not very much in the preparation of the
167280	175140	topics but of the let's say culmination of many of the years of work and of
175140	183320	study in these things and the basic ideas governing the centers of
183320	190440	the talk so well thank you all for being here and I'll say hello from Argentina
190440	195840	the other side of the world so thanks for taking the time to be here with us
195840	201600	and yeah I'm not very much for introductions I'm let's just say that
201600	207560	I'm a clinical psychologist and I have been for the last almost 10 years and I
207560	216520	find that existentialism at least those ideas and those concepts are very
216560	223080	helpful in the clinical practice in fact at some point I'd say that the
223080	231880	existential dilemmas are so central to the human experience that we can't avoid
231880	241200	them and it's perfectly clear that one or at a certain point we all have to face
241200	247480	those things so many people come to to the practice and say okay I have this
247480	257280	problem I have this big luggage on my back and I can't get rid of it so the
257280	262560	basic concept today will be that well these questions they they persist
262560	268440	throughout history and the idea of the existential school as a school of thought
268440	276120	is well let's say has some certain issues and I don't know if you if you're
276120	283520	all familiar with with the idea of existentialism but and I repeat that
283520	290400	anyone can can interrupt me if the if my words don't come clearly enough the
290400	298480	idea of existentialism is complex because the the basic thoughts are not
298480	304800	very clear why because we have existentialists that are apes that are
304800	314760	apes existential Christians and agnostics so the basic ideas can be applied to
314840	326720	many things the the the school of thought just came to be at least formally with in
326720	333720	France after the second world war I like that there is a lot of European public
333720	339240	because well you might be all very much in touch with the with the history of
339560	346600	of that maybe not yourself but yes only on the generations before you very
346600	352920	different than the experience we have here in in South America so after the
352920	364520	second world war at least in France the ideas just started to be and well I I
365160	372320	think you might have heard of Jean-Paul Sartre he monopolized the idea of the
372320	379880	existentialist he he just adored the word which is very different from let's say
379880	386440	Albert Camus which hated the word existentialism he defined himself as
387240	394680	absurdism the absurd sorry if my if my pronunciation is I find myself saying
394680	398680	some words for the first time in English because of course I've studied them in
398680	407800	in Spanish so I apologize in advance if some of the words don't come up very very very well
408200	418360	so you might have heard of the basic concept of Sartre that the existence
418360	425960	precedes the essence which is in a certain way I'm not trying to make a lecture
425960	430560	about this because there are many far better explanations for this I'm just
430560	435640	trying to introduce the concept so that then we can go towards the antiquity
436600	441480	or the ancient times I think antiquity is just for the furniture right
443560	452520	no okay and the the idea of of the existence precedes the essence counts
454360	461720	in an antagonistic way to the essentialism the the idea that Plato and Aristotle have
461800	467960	that everything has an essence and that everything has the thing that makes the
467960	474920	thing what it is not some other thing so if you if you lost that that would no longer be that thing
475560	481640	the the basic explanation is the knife you can have a handle that's plastic wood
482440	488280	no handle at all but if you take the blade it's no longer a knife so the essence
489240	491640	is that that characteristic which is
493880	501880	unsupprable from the thing itself so Sartre says you know that's not it what if what if we just
502440	510120	don't have any any essence and we create ourselves which is a way of thinking about it
510120	516920	which is a way that I don't particularly agree and that's the thing I don't agree in a way with
516920	527160	one of the most influential existentialists of the world and of history because well Sartre never
527160	533800	never did any clinical practice never studied the development of of the humankind and how we
533800	544520	come from a newborn to to something so there is in a sense a well a school of thought that goes
544600	553080	towards that thing okay no we're just a blind a blank canvas and everything it's supplied which
554760	561880	in a certain way has led to to many of the of the serious aspects of of today this idea that
561880	570440	word we're just what we what we choose to be which is maybe not the case we have certain limits and
571400	581080	the the development that the development of let's say the cognitive functions are of course
582440	593960	rooted on on the body so the the basic idea of Sartre might have been mistaken in a certain way
593960	601240	but but it surely has done some some good things for the for the confrontation of ideas which is in
601240	606600	fact the the basic concept we have here and and that we can talk about all those things
608760	621640	so the so the idea would be that that the that the the the existentialists of the post-war
621640	631480	world war focused on the let's say phenomenology of the understanding of the humankind trying to
631480	641000	incorporate the subjective experience of the of the of the person to the understanding of
641000	649880	reality which is in fact up until today the the basic framework of of existential psychotherapy
649880	658760	phenomenology existential phenomenology so it's a very interesting concept which changed a lot of
658760	670280	the of the way we thought of of the humankind and in fact it's well very unique in its perspective
670680	682840	I'm not saying Sartre just said no so far along he he had many many great great ideas for example
682840	692600	the idea of hell which is not a new idea in itself but I don't know and please correct me if I'm not
693560	699480	saying that the title of the name correct and in the right way it's behind closed doors
700440	710760	might have been or something like that in Spanish it's no exit in English no exit okay
711560	720520	that idea of the Sartre and hell which is not no other thing than the people others which is
721480	728280	very unique and I can understand why he might might be able to to to think that way
729160	735640	but he missed the idea that the others are also the ones that introduce us to the world so this
735640	746840	idea that we come in in in a blank canvas is well to say the least naive in fact he even said
746840	756120	towards the end of his career and his life that he he gave little importance to the material
756120	766600	aspects of of human of human experience which is again a very very same thing to do to be able
766600	776360	to see the the errors of our past but the idea would be that these questions the questions of
777400	785320	death meaning uh freedom Sartre is very much into into freedom this that the the whole
787480	793880	excess of freedom we have comes with with an angst comes with the suffering which is not
793960	804200	of the aspects of of this school of thought so it's all these questions have been since
805080	814200	the the beginning is of humankind so the the existentialism in a sense has been around
815160	825800	well for as long as we are here the questions are and persist so I thinking about about today
825800	833880	I came up with with with a question myself why did we start calling existentialism at least the
833880	845240	formal school of thought after the the world war and I have no good answers sorry but there
845240	853960	there is an aspect that that I think it's crucial that it's that the the questions went further away
853960	865640	from religion than before so the Greeks at least for our western traditions our focus
866280	871640	much more on the Greeks than let's say on on on some other parts of the world
873320	882360	but they they made the same the same questions we do now exactly the same ones
883080	890280	one one could say well we we copied them and and how can it be that we have
890840	900120	haven't got any answers after so so long and and it came to me also a quote from a very good
901880	908680	psycho psychoanalyst and sociologist that's called eric from who said that the
908920	917880	that the technology advances much more than the wisdom we have so the wisdom we possess now
917880	925400	is not at all what what we need because well we're making the same questions as Plato we're
925400	935960	making the same observations as Aristotle and Socrates so one must wonder if if we will ever
935960	943160	if we will ever find the answers and the questions for meaning well what is the meaning of it all
944920	951720	at least my answer is well there is no meaning which might be within the the school of thought
951720	960040	of existentialism that the the the branch of nihilism the nihilist nihilists say that well
960120	965400	there is no apparent meaning and there is no god and there is no nothing that that can
965400	972200	actually give the meaning there i would say there is a smaller branch that says positive
972200	978840	nihilism negative nihilism the negative nihilism would be the the character of of the soyelsky
980120	986760	if if there is no god and there is no immortality then what what well then everything is permitted
986760	993480	in brother scaramosov but there is also the positive nihilism which is okay there is no
993480	1001960	meaning at all we are responsible for creating it we are the ones that that give life meaning
1002600	1010280	which is a powerful thing a very powerful concept to say that we are responsible but it's also a
1010280	1017560	burden it's also a very very harsh reality that we are responsible for ourselves
1019720	1031640	so well i think that if you're here now might be because you you you find yourself challenging
1031640	1039720	those ideas you find yourself wondering all of this because let's face it it's not a very popular
1039720	1045240	subject all of this you don't go to a party and say okay yeah but what what's the meaning of all of
1045240	1054600	this i think okay do you all know we're gonna die someday you won't be very much appreciated in the
1054600	1064440	party so there is a certain element of of uncomfortableness in all of this a very deep
1064440	1072600	uncomfortableness i would say but it's also charged with with the very profound sense of
1072600	1083080	wondering and of course i i say to you to your you can you can ask the questions you need but
1083080	1092600	i think at some point we all have the the the wondering of saying okay but why why is this
1092600	1099320	the way i live why is this the way it's suffer which is in fact one of the of the tools we use
1099320	1108600	in psychotherapy we we try and and and get the questions with with a certain sense of of weight
1108600	1118680	behind them not just the the hollow words again hollow words the words with with nothing behind
1118680	1125960	them to to find the person asking the right questions or at least the questions that
1127480	1134600	well they are able to to handle because it's very difficult to to face yourself with a question that
1135560	1148120	nobody can answer the you and the the ideas and the problems these brings are well
1150360	1158280	i would say eternal but but it's a very a very weird way of of talking about the human experience
1158360	1162600	because in fact the the human experience is finite so
1165000	1171800	i'd say they they will accompany the the the experience of for humankind but we individually
1172360	1180120	have a very different way of approaching it so i'll go back to to to the idea of the of the
1180120	1193720	ancients well i also came across i'll i'll take the opportunity to introduce all of the of the
1193720	1202600	english-speaking audience or participants to um maybe the greatest writer of of argentina which
1202600	1212120	is Jorge Luis Borges i don't know if you've known him but he's wonderful it's like reading Edgar
1212120	1227080	Lampeau for for for us by the at the at the last years of his life he was in a project of of having
1227080	1235240	the the most important hundred books so he took the time to choose each one of them he didn't
1236600	1249240	didn't complete the the all the collection but he introduced in my in my curiosity one of the
1249640	1259800	of the most ancient stories the the epic of Gilgamesh which is a very odd a very odd well choice
1261720	1270600	but in there it's the epic of Gilgamesh is the Sumerian that's a myth a story about a hero
1271320	1279000	which let's say it simply he he faced a lot of challenges of course but the the most important
1279000	1288520	aspect is he was searching for immortality and well he didn't make it of course spoilers spoilers
1288520	1299560	for for a very old book but in a certain way we can see the the question of mortality even before
1299640	1306680	the Greek civilization in fact the epic of Gilgamesh inspired a lot of the Iliad and the Odyssey so
1308440	1320120	we find there the the well even the flood yes but also the the the work on hell in hell sorry
1320680	1326520	in hell that the the hero needs to go to hell to find something
1327560	1334600	Odysseus did it in the Odyssey Gilgamesh did it in in his epic but I'd like to say that
1335240	1342440	this this is the point there is something there that that goes beyond the the the basic story
1342440	1349160	the basic narrative which surrounds it to say okay they were wondering what would it be for someone
1349160	1355880	to look for immortality in a certain poetic way he found it because well we're we're still talking
1355880	1365320	about him so good for him but the the question lies there what is mortality and how can we face it
1366200	1373480	and we're still looking for answers today there is even a whole branch of psychology that's
1374440	1383000	that that that dedicates itself to the to the people that are dying and well it's very it's very
1383000	1396120	difficult for us to to to symbolize that so we tried a lot in a lot of ways but we are creatures
1396200	1399720	of meaning we need meaning in our lives
1403080	1411800	the in in greek greece in Athens I mentioned the paraitolia and I don't know if it's
1412520	1420280	perfectly translated english if it's basically that but it's the principle of the brain to look for
1420280	1426440	patterns and to look for meaning things even if if they are not there which might have been a very
1426440	1436120	evolutionary edge for us but it's still here with us that we need to look for meaning I always
1437000	1444520	at least when I work with teenagers I give the I give them the the idea that color in itself
1444520	1449640	doesn't exist it's like what are you talking about of course it exists I mean look at look
1449640	1455560	at all the the colors we have here well in fact color is a construction of the of our brain
1456200	1464360	it's not something let's say objective different animal different eyes see different colors the
1464360	1471240	colors are the reflection of the light that our eye and our brain are able to produce
1472200	1483480	but color in itself is not a thing which is very weird but which is again a testament of the
1483480	1491960	evolutionary presence of meaning in in not only in in our lives but but surrounding us
1492200	1500360	so they of course it's the it's the strange explanation but it's in fact the way it is
1501320	1507160	even if we if our experience is nothing like it so
1508920	1516280	well these ideas go go towards mythology in mythology at least
1517240	1523960	the one I specialize in which is Greek mythology we find a lot of the of the problems of
1523960	1536040	existentialism so it's like existentialism is a new branch of of philosophy why would it be so
1536040	1545800	present over so many things so so long ago written and it's like well yeah because existentialism
1545800	1560040	has been around forever and there is a certain strange parallelism in in the idea of psychoanalysis
1560040	1569320	of conscious and conscious and in that's that's very well established in in mythology and philosophy
1569320	1577560	in the ancient world on one hand the idea of rationality as the great means of understanding
1577560	1585560	the universe and ourselves and in a certain way mythology just came around and saying that these
1585560	1594040	are the ways we we understand the world and ourselves so the the great hero of Greek mythology
1594040	1602600	might be Odysseus the only mortal one the only purely mortal that he suffered a lot and there we
1602600	1612440	find one of the aspects that I think actually defines existentialism that life is is tragedy
1613000	1619800	and there's nothing we can do about it of course we can we have all the techniques and
1619800	1627720	on all them the the technology that allows us to live quite comfortable we're not very hungry so often
1627720	1635080	we're not very cold so often we have the entertainment we have medicine yet there's
1635080	1645480	nothing we can do with the existential dilemmas and it comes to to mind now sorry if I if I keep on
1645480	1659000	bringing stuff the the the the soma of all of no sorry all no 1980 no brave new world hoaxly
1660920	1663320	where the the drug that's just
1663720	1672600	implicated let's say or decreased all the the the suffering in in oneself and it's like
1673960	1680680	if we could do that if we had a drug which we have plenty of them but none that that are so
1681640	1691400	so at least so effective should we do it should we release the world from the suffering and even
1692120	1698760	if we if we can wouldn't there be a lot of people that think okay but what if I just
1699800	1706840	bring this down if I burn this up if I punch this this person so
1709720	1719880	it's another well paradox of existentialism it's suffering something we need to avoid there is
1719880	1729240	something that makes us who we are and in a certain way psychology deals with the suffering
1729240	1740360	with psychopathology and of course I'd say that again sorry sorry Saturday that that I
1741080	1747640	that I criticized him so much he he knew nothing of psychopathology I don't know if you're aware
1747640	1758200	that he even tried to introduce a he hated Freud he absolutely detested him and
1760840	1769800	there is a movie in the 1960s Freud the secret passion I think it's called that Sartre wrote the
1770760	1777400	the first draft of the of the movie well the director said no this this just puts Freud in a
1777400	1790040	in a horrible position why would you do that that script was discarded but he tried to introduce a
1790040	1797160	psychoanalysis even called existential psychoanalysis which denied the idea of the unconscious
1797160	1806280	now the unconscious is still today debated a lot even if we at least here in Argentina
1806840	1816280	psychoanalysis is quite popular and not so in in in Europe or other countries I found myself
1816280	1824840	seeing that in Athens which I later called upon say okay you're leaving behind a very useful tool
1825800	1833160	that might be able to explain a lot of what's going on so the
1835720	1843080	the the ancient idea of of the search for meaning is later present in in religion
1843080	1848200	that the constitution of of the the big religions we have today as answers
1848440	1857240	for the the the search for meaning what does in a certain way religion do
1858120	1864760	it gives you the the certainty of what happens beyond death wonderful like now you know
1865320	1875080	this is what happens and every religion gives an answer so religion is quite useful in that way
1875880	1881800	to to to release ourselves from the the despair that can come from us
1883320	1889640	also gives you okay this is the way you live this is the way you need to to to conduct yourself
1889640	1899080	which is again very useful and even even though in psychoanalysis Freud was very harsh on religion
1899720	1907400	he recognized the the usefulness it had maybe he was too
1909080	1917640	too naive to see that it's not about rationality the the thing of religion it's about much more
1917640	1922760	and it gives much more even today of course european
1922760	1932440	and it's going a little further away from religion as people are even more educated but
1933560	1940040	the the rest of the world is another experience and we see we see it in the in the conflicts
1940040	1950120	we're having right now at least in the the middle east so these things are still present
1951080	1960520	the war is still present in in the in the in the world we we have it's like no but the the
1960520	1967960	greeks were from war to war well that's not the greeks that's humankind we just go from one thing
1967960	1974680	to another and we can even count the years in the world that there were no wars at all which are
1974680	1984520	very few so the the existential dilemmas are still here and they have practical
1985160	1996440	aspects to it there is even the the the idea of what do we do with the with the intolerance
1997400	2009000	and you you guys over over europe are much much closer to the wars than i am but there is a specific
2009000	2016360	aspect of saying okay what do we do do we fight for survival or are we able to to just talk about it
2017080	2028680	what you do and there is no no talk no talk available so there is a in these there are
2028680	2038760	also very practical aspects in fact i think of another another story
2039320	2050520	written by by camus which takes the concept or the concept of sycophers i don't know if if all
2050520	2056280	of you know who sycophers is but he's a character from greek mythology that that
2057720	2065160	cheated on death on two occasions and after that he was condemned by the gods to
2065160	2076680	to well to tartarus the hell of the of the weak world he was condemned to to carry a huge rock
2077720	2085160	onto the top of the mountain and at the end of the day exhausted he saw how it rolled over all over
2085160	2094040	again so that he was he had to to go again and again so he was condemned to meaninglessness
2095080	2101800	he was condemned to the labor and to the effort without any reward at all so
2105320	2114360	camus many many years after takes that story to talk about suicide to talk about meaning
2114360	2121160	and to talk about a very difficult aspect of reality that's saying okay why don't we kill
2121160	2129480	ourselves so he said all the questions of philosophy are on second place towards the
2129480	2136760	question of suicide because on that we find ourselves asking okay what makes me want to
2136760	2145320	live the life i have so it's a very again don't talk about suicide on parties because that's no
2149560	2157480	it's not an easy an easy subject yet it's a very important subject so it's a very very
2158040	2171080	when the the helpful organization talks about that they they they of course they give them the
2171080	2179480	thing the certain importance yet they struggle to to talk about it and just and to find the
2180440	2186920	the real reasons why people do it because it's a very difficult aspect and and a very difficult
2186920	2197160	thing to to understand it's a very personal experience so well it's of course alarming that
2197160	2205720	that's almost one million of people are committed suicide a year according to the statistics but
2206360	2214120	it's also a very important thing to talk about because that's the maybe one of the most existential
2214760	2223240	problems we have because it faces us with with with our condition and why would someone choose
2223240	2233320	that there is i remember when i was working at um at the public hospital that i i discussed this
2233320	2240200	with a colleague of mine saying all suicide is psychopathological because of course we can we
2241160	2249160	can see with someone with depression someone maybe with schizophrenia but it's all suicide like that
2251640	2261400	and it's a very at least i haven't come upon the the question any other any other place other
2261800	2271800	other myself but it's um well it's very difficult to face those those problems so
2272840	2280520	oh we tend to avoid them and we can avoid them particularly in our societies which are
2282120	2291080	meant to distract us there is a very good book of Vargas Llosa sorry another Latin American writer
2291560	2297400	and it's called the the the civilization of entertainment she's very good
2298680	2303400	very simple to to read maybe the translation should be should be good enough
2306120	2316920	but we can avoid it for so long for it punches us in the face because because we at least well
2317160	2323800	not all of us will have to face death at some point maybe not ourselves but yes and the people
2323800	2333320	we love we will have to to deal with suffering one way or another so this idea that the the world
2333320	2341000	decides a nice place where we should be comfortable might be very detrimental for us might be very
2341000	2357400	very very false which in a in a certain way comes to the to the to the to the to the fight
2357480	2365320	of of ideas very barely poorly equipped so
2368360	2376840	well i think of of the of the buddhist one of the of the four noble truths of buddhism
2377160	2386600	life is suffering and that's again we go to the antiquity we go to towards
2387320	2395480	the the these three fathers of thought which were socrates confucius and the buddha
2396360	2404840	which changed the way we understood things but none of them said that life is something
2405800	2413320	nice and something comfortable and something that that's a gift from the gods in fact they
2413320	2423800	they socrates well criticized a lot and and with good with good ideas the socratic method is still
2423800	2434680	present in us in our psychotherapy so the the the ideas of buddha and confucius all come to a
2434920	2440600	the questions of existentialism what should we do with our life how do we deal with death
2440600	2450600	how do we deal with suffering and are so inextricably linked with the with with ourselves that
2451320	2459240	we find that it's worth exploring all of these things even if we have no answer
2459960	2467720	and of course if you are here you are interested in one way or another for all of this and that
2468600	2477640	the the the the the basic idea of existentialism which in this in this sort of activities and
2477640	2486440	and channels and and the the offerings is a a wonderful place to to explore this and to
2487000	2494920	at least feel that the suffering we might have is not unique to us because that that's
2494920	2504200	another thing that within the the psychotherapy sphere we try and deal that the person comes
2504200	2512040	saying okay i suffer i suffer specifically my suffering is unique and to a certain point it is
2513000	2519080	but certain aspects of that are absolutely
2521480	2524600	shared between us so
2527640	2531640	my my ideas would be to to
2534600	2541640	to find the way of of asking this to find and to find places where we can talk about all of this
2542840	2550920	maybe there are some some very good guidance in all of these things and in fact we can even
2550920	2560840	help help other people in this network of existential branching for the for the difficult
2560840	2569240	aspects of life because i guaranteed you know someone who's struggling with all of this if not
2569240	2582520	yourself and that struggling is in a certain way the the the core aspect of of the greek idea
2582520	2589560	that there's a tragedy that's why they invented tragedy then came the romans that made them the
2589560	2596040	circus with the with the coliseum and the the entertainment of death but the greeks and i
2596040	2603240	think we have a mixture of greek and roman that's why we have i don't know the world cup and that's
2603240	2610040	fantastic as it is it's so it's purely entertainment and but also we have the tragedy
2610040	2618680	we have the the movies and we have the the the art that connects us with that part of of ourselves
2619400	2633080	so i hope nobody nobody has has fallen into a silent despair but yes that we can we can
2633080	2639320	hear you and see what what you have to say about all of this of course there's a lot to
2640280	2648120	to to learn about ancient times and i think those three figures are a wonderful way of starting
2648680	2659560	i also recommend um uh called jaspers then that he talks about all of these three figures uh no no
2659560	2668680	i think he changes socrates for jesus so he talks about the figure those those three figures us and
2669000	2683160	as um as a way of understanding who we are so uh i think it's uh it's later over there but i hope
2684360	2693640	everyone's uh wondering at least my idea would be that we we share questions not the the answers
2693640	2699240	because of course this is not a lecture that i have the the absolute truth and in fact it's
2699880	2707800	more of the of the experience we have and the and the the the ways we have of understanding
2707800	2719160	ourselves and our lives and the and the spaces we we uh we're in even if it's work family
2719720	2729080	and the these sort of places but how can we apply certain things of this towards the the
2730040	2732040	the concrete aspects of our lives
2738600	2742520	i think if any if anybody if anybody um
2743000	2751960	um uh finds finds yourself uh wondering how can we connect over this of course it's a very good
2751960	2761000	thing if you if you can talk and and say um i hope nobody's uh dizzy with all the the the
2761000	2766040	concepts and the ideas sorry if i if i branch too much
2766440	2773560	no it was exciting to follow all of the different branches and go on such a journey
2774520	2781560	in in my own thinking and our own thinking but then throughout history and just um i'm gonna
2781560	2787800	reiterate what what marcos is saying let's make this a discussion let's make this a questioning
2787800	2793320	a shared questioning together um and i think the question that comes for me or the kind of
2793320	2800200	discussion that exploration that comes for me is what you say about clients coming to us or
2800200	2808360	people coming to us or even for ourselves that in that moment our suffering feels like the most
2809160	2818520	unique and extreme experience of suffering that could exist and even as therapists even as coaches
2818520	2826360	even as reflective and intelligent beings that know that statistically historically that's not
2826360	2835400	the case but still somehow there's that sense that big sense if we're being approached or
2835400	2840440	confronting something in the future or in the moment or in the past that's incredibly difficult
2840440	2847800	for us that we are isolated in it um i suppose i don't want to speak for ages i would love for
2847800	2853720	other people to jump in can i can i ask yeah yeah tony go so lovely to see you and thank you so
2853720	2864520	much for doing these things awesome i mean i've had um i've in my life i've had five suicide
2864520	2874360	friends which i think is an exception of suicide friends and um the impact of that is may and i
2874360	2882120	you know i'm a deep absurdist or existentialist and you know my my question on a daily basis is
2882120	2892200	really is about resilience and opposing forces to this absurdity because i mean if you know i think
2892200	2899960	we all get that it's absurd um i think that you know every time i read lots of stuff i resonate
2899960	2906680	more than you can ever believe but i think the question is how to live an absurdity in a way
2906680	2916680	that um is nourishing and uh as a you know i'm a pathologist by training so so i mean you know
2916680	2923720	i'm a hard-nosed scientist so the question always is is you know we know we know what we know if you
2923720	2929080	like the complexity of of of these questions but what's the antidote
2934680	2940200	two things come come to mind of course sisyphus and and the and the absurd
2940280	2942840	but
2945400	2955800	the the the existential branch of thought comes a bit against the idea the rationality can can
2955800	2962760	read us of all the problems we have so that that's where the the subjective aspect comes from
2963560	2972760	and in a certain way there is no antidote at least not an antidote that can work for everyone
2973880	2983240	because meaning is a very personal experience so nobody can well you can try and impose meaning
2983240	2992120	on others you can try and say okay look this works for me try it but that doesn't assure you that
2992200	3001160	that it will work so it's a very very close relationship you have with with suicide the
3001160	3011240	absurd i don't think many people acknowledge the absurdity of all because it's a very difficult
3011240	3022600	thing to to digest it's it's very it leaves us very naked onto the world so that's where the
3022600	3030600	the subjective tools come in at least my faith goes towards the person goes to work towards
3030600	3037160	the individual so one question just because then i'll i'll chat up because i could talk for england
3037160	3046760	um nisha our lovely nisha who we love so much um the famous camel hypothesis you know you know
3046760	3054280	which i i pretty much love actually i i use it every day i mean i suppose my question is is is
3054280	3063240	the camel a desensitized absurdist and tony can i ask you to explain the camel for people that don't
3063720	3071320	well yeah sorry sorry i mean the camel is you know in in um nisha thought and it's quite
3071320	3079320	close to go to actually the the camel um you know he believed that four metamorphosis of man was the
3079320	3086440	camel first then the camel becomes a lion the lion slays the dragon and the dragon becomes the child
3086440	3093800	so he he basically said that uh and i know it's very interesting because you use the word all
3093800	3100840	dyshuxley who i love um i mean and you you use the word who i mean was it all dyshuxley or was it
3100840	3107000	the the other guy who came up with the term the proletariat so let's use the word the proletariat
3107000	3114600	that nisha came up with the idea the proletariat were camors and that they had desensitized themselves
3114600	3120760	to this absurdity and then in came the lions that were trying to transform who were absolutely
3120760	3128360	naked to that absurdity tried to slay the slay the dragon and then became the child so i mean you
3128360	3135000	know there there is a question i have on a daily basis in my own world of which so many people seem
3135000	3141960	to be happy and absurdity that distresses me really but i'll shut up on that one maybe otherwise
3141960	3151320	i might talk for england well remember that the the camel needs to give way to the lion the lion
3151320	3158760	then to the child uh we're talking about the spoke saratustra which is a very good book
3159880	3168520	very recommended possible but yeah might might be difficult but but it but but within it the
3169320	3172280	all the concepts of nature and
3174600	3181960	in a certain way he needs to talks about the camel as as a metaphor for the animal that's
3181960	3189720	that's very very harsh and able to to support a lot of weight in fact that's the the idea
3189720	3198920	that the camel carries the weight of of the hump onto itself which gives him or if sorry
3198920	3206120	the the chance to survive the desert would give him the chance to to to live but then it needs to
3206120	3213720	change uh the the it was a very very accurate idea that the last metamorphosis of the child
3214280	3221480	because the child plays because the child creates and because the child is in a certain way
3225000	3232680	all potential so the idea of of getting rid of of god was not in in
3234440	3238520	talking about this idea of god is dead and we have killed him
3239080	3248840	and to be able to create and to create our own morality our own way of living makes us the
3248840	3260280	the ubermanche makes us the ultra ultra man i don't know in english um yeah the ubermanche
3260280	3274440	the ubermanche uh if if um i would say that i i agree in a certain sense with with barter and
3274440	3284840	rassel one of the of the great um the philosophers of great britain uh he says i i think in an
3284840	3292040	in an essay about nature that we should we should always listen to him but be very careful to follow
3292040	3301400	him because the idea of the government doesn't consider the idea of others with us doesn't
3301400	3307560	consider the idea that we can build our own morality for ourselves because we we're never
3307560	3317000	on us alone i i go to to add his total again the only ones who don't need others are the beasts
3317000	3325640	or the gods all of us we need we need the other and that's also the the the idea of
3326600	3334040	but why but why i would love to go to a dinner party with all of you and talk about suicide
3334040	3340280	but why why are we so different to the camel
3343480	3351800	we meaning who this group who are here is a representative of existential
3352520	3354600	thinkers or behaviors or whatever
3358840	3364360	what makes you think we're we're so different from the camel well maybe we are firing things
3364360	3372520	the reason i i think is because i'm a biologist and i i see that groups of societies have such
3372520	3379400	clusters of different if you like types who are there with a different job our job is to
3380120	3387240	agitate society really and that's well i'll go i'll go back to the
3389160	3395160	do you remember the the the cave allegory of Plato yeah yeah the
3397480	3403960	do you remember why they chose to stay chained and and to see the shadows no because
3404920	3414440	because seeing the truth because facing all these things is extremely difficult and not all of us
3414440	3424760	are prepared and well one would say also with with the haxley idea why would someone
3425720	3435480	uh anesthetize himself and we do it all the time we're not we're not exempt of the suffering
3435480	3445080	these entails so it's a very difficult thing and we try and be children in a certain way in
3445080	3454680	in an extreme way but it's difficult and might be that at some point we are camels and some
3454680	3462200	point we're lions and some point we're children and some points we are we are just too tired to
3462200	3476520	face all of this so um it's it's a a a strange way this idea of of facing all of this that's why
3477240	3484840	well in many ways religion is still very very disseminated across the world
3485000	3494360	um very helpful in many ways because it's uh i would not say impossible but extremely hard
3494360	3504440	to think of everything ourselves we need to rely on the on to to to stand on the shoulders of giants
3505320	3511000	umberto eco has a very good book about that that's called on the shoulders of giants
3511480	3518600	no i need to us because we need we we rely on on on the ones that came before
3519560	3526360	and that's why the idea would be they can still teach us a lot but we need to look further and if
3526360	3533880	we can't see further it's because they made the the much of the hard work i don't know what the
3533960	3541400	world would be without the greeks i think i mean um i can't remember the author but
3542760	3551800	but he talked about the the battle of marathon as uh maybe the the most important event on the
3551800	3559960	history of western civilization because if they if the Athenians had lost that battle the world
3559960	3567240	would be a lot different and democracy would have would have let's say um died in its infancy
3568680	3579320	so uh yeah i i think i got i got carried away but um why people thank you for not to thank you for
3579320	3590120	the dialogue i'd love that no but but the but i i i'd say i find it much more interesting
3590120	3598680	why would someone face these things rather than than be anesthetized it's it's uh i think that
3598680	3605480	question is much more uh much more relevant why would someone choose to face all of this
3606440	3612840	when they can just immerse themselves in i don't know football politics even religion
3613880	3622440	that gives you the answers there is a in psychoanalysis we we talk about uh sorry if the translation
3622440	3631320	is not correct uh not the fault and how would you say if when something is missing in you
3635720	3647480	um devoid devoid yeah it's not exactly void uh it's like the the castrate castrated when
3647480	3659560	and something is missing let's just call it the the missing fanaticism and and Freud makes a very
3659560	3669720	good case of this fanaticism compensates the missing so you um and and the missing might very well be
3669720	3681000	the meaning in life and that's a a missing that cannot be undone cannot we cannot um we cannot
3681560	3692280	uh successfully um equilibrate equilibrated or balance it so of course the the fanaticism
3693960	3704360	supports in religion remember the thing of of the void it might be the void i have to look
3704360	3709720	for the translation i've never read Freud in english which would be a very interesting experience
3710440	3722760	and the the fanaticism is the compensation of that we we we feel that void with with that
3723720	3734520	with our team with our church with our values and much of the artistic aspects of the of the child
3735240	3743960	goes towards that children find themselves playing with with let's say an empty box
3745160	3751080	and they have have a wonderful time but adults we say but it's just a box
3752440	3761160	that doesn't matter the children create in in the void in the absence of and maybe that's
3761160	3769160	where we at least the ones that approach these ideas go towards we create where there is none
3770280	3777560	we we make ourselves answers where there is no answer at all and that's very difficult that's
3778600	3789160	might be uh very very harsh on on or heavy but in a certain way these places are wonderful for that
3790120	3795960	to say that we all are asking the same questions what can we do with that
3797560	3805160	so i don't know if it's i i don't have a very optimistic answers for this at least not in the
3805160	3813000	in the existential department um but but yeah um i hope it answers a little bit of the question
3813640	3818840	yeah thank you welcome you're welcome
3821640	3828520	can i ask you something where do you place the human encounter
3831080	3839160	in encounter meeting of two persons the social encounter yeah yeah in in this
3839880	3850200	uh in this difficult process of of trying to deal with existence or yeah
3852760	3862120	or the void or whatever or so yeah you say the child creates in the absence of things you know
3863080	3870280	so and maybe that's easier than than to create by means of the human relationship
3871480	3875160	that's that's why it's so difficult to relate maybe you know
3877160	3882120	maybe there's the truth in there or something i don't know so the topic of of human encounter
3882120	3891960	does it has a place in this in this existentialistic position uh yeah
3894280	3908600	i think the i think it was in the in the 80s or the 70s in tokyo there was um a very big problem
3908600	3918840	with suicides of young men so the government consults with a group of psychologists and the
3918840	3927240	psychologists suggest that uh as the as the means of suicide was the train to jump onto the train
3928120	3933240	that they put mirrors on the other side of the of the train of the of the of the
3933240	3943480	the the place where the train of the rails yeah the idea was that that would give the the man
3944040	3953480	like a shock of narcissism to say okay no i look at myself and and i choose not to jump
3954920	3961960	well that didn't work of course why because the mirror is never the mirror literally
3963240	3969080	the mirror we see ourselves by other relationships we have at the others at the encounters
3971880	3980280	and the it was like a very literal way of understanding humankind
3982120	3990840	so the encounter is not only necessary is the thing that makes us who we are
3990840	3998520	if if nobody was there to receive you when you were a newborn you would die or even if
3998520	4010040	he if they give you the food and the shelter you would still die because i think it's called white
4010040	4019960	death um the the that happened i think it was started in poland uh at a certain war
4020040	4028280	where many of the adults when were killed and many babies were left at the care of very few people
4028920	4034680	and they gave them the shelter and the warmth and the and the food but they gave them no more
4034680	4045160	attention than they needed there was no let's say sorry for the word erotic eroticization of
4045640	4052920	the subjectivity of the of the psychic apparatus so there wasn't like no will to live
4054440	4063560	so yeah the the encounter is is what makes us who we are that's why sartre says that the hell is
4063560	4069240	others because they are very capable of torturing ourselves but they are also capable of saving
4069320	4075560	and that's where he missed he just saw the the the negative aspect of the encounter
4077080	4090040	and yeah existentialism is always about people never in solitude we we might suffer in solitude
4090040	4101960	but dilemmas are shared the the problems are uh well very much uh faced together that's at least
4101960	4109560	one of the the core ideas of psychotherapy but another an encounter can help you face things
4109560	4118600	that you could not face before that's why they approach us or or anyone and that's a
4119560	4123240	a very powerful encounter at least when you click when you have the
4123240	4127400	for chemistry with your with your therapist it's a wonderful experience
4128760	4136040	so yeah the encounter is uh central it's like the antidote we found the antidote
4136040	4142200	it might might be for for tony i like that one
4144120	4149800	yeah well we need it we need it my friend we need it i begin to like tony yeah
4151880	4161240	well we'll we'll be there together okay well that that's uh well that that came from an encounter
4161240	4164600	so yeah the the answer in action
4171560	4175560	and anna says in the chat all we need is love and a smiley face
4179160	4181880	well yeah
4184840	4188920	i don't know if he was so catchy all we need is meaning snub so
4189160	4194680	yeah not so so phonetically attractive
4196600	4199320	if frankle was in the Beatles that was his thing
4205320	4218520	so uh it's um of course the the ideas would be uh would forth uh very very well in much more
4218520	4227000	time and much more uh uh deep analysis of of the the Greek culture and of the
4227880	4235960	Buddhism and the ideas they have and there is a lot of analysis we can make of all of this
4235960	4245560	even the the bible has a lot of extension uh aspects to it it's after all well very very
4246120	4255960	inspired in in Greek ideas but that's the the the the the book that
4257800	4263960	the western civilization was built upon so of course it's in a certain way
4264920	4271080	filled with ideas we can connect not because of the of the truth of the idea i don't know if
4272040	4280440	i don't believe adam and eve are a literal and a literal story about how we come to be
4280440	4287640	but yes that it has a certain metaphors we must remember that we are symbolic creatures
4288520	4295320	the words we use are metaphors if i speak of a tree the word tree means nothing
4296280	4301800	if we have the meaning shed that's where the metaphor applies and and we understand each other
4302360	4310120	so through metaphors and through the stories as well as and i think that's the idea of the Greeks
4310120	4318040	they understood that that the metaphors on the on the myth and the philosophy uh could coexist
4318920	4329960	and in fact did in there but and as as tony said well biology and science is so wonderful too
4331320	4341720	the problem is and i find it's a very very funny question for me that can science answer all the
4341720	4349960	questions it's a question that can't be answered but by science because science can't deal with
4349960	4359320	everything i think that's a tremendous question um but i mean one just one one with this thing
4360040	4365160	do you think that many humans are suppressed existentialists
4365320	4371160	what do you mean what what do you mean by suppressed
4372360	4379720	well conformity has has erased their questioning
4382920	4389400	well that's that's education for you formal education because i mean i i have a children's
4389400	4397720	book that my grandchild had and i think that the modern children books are moving away from
4397720	4406680	metaphor to literal so it's a bit like you know oh i i agree and and it's you wonder whether what's
4406680	4414360	going to happen is that we're going to suppress a lot of it in um in banality which i think is a
4414360	4429480	very interesting word well i see it as well i i um in this couple of years of days i saw news
4433000	4443080	that in the simpsons um the new episodes of the simpsons will not have a Homer strangling Bart
4444040	4450760	yeah because oh no you can't show this because the children and i was like
4451720	4461160	that's that's uh an interesting take on that that that that we we lose the idea of that that's
4461160	4470120	a cartoon that's not that the people go struggling people because they see Homer uh so it was like
4470760	4476680	that's like going towards the most literal of the of the readings you can make of that
4477560	4485560	and and in a certain way the most simplistic and superficial idea of that of course it's a
4485560	4493880	it's a funny example but i agree that we are losing metaphor we are losing the idea that words
4494520	4503880	are complex things they're not defined they're not um they're not written in stone like saying
4503880	4512360	okay god means peace well it depends on where you are and what context and what place and and
4512360	4522440	how you use the word so uh yeah i i agree with the diagnosis that we are we are becoming more
4522440	4533320	literal at or at least they they are trying to they like who they are i think it's a lot based on
4533320	4543320	ideology and a way of thinking of people and our children specifically but it happens over there
4543320	4556520	and happens here in in argentina as well uh literality is quite uh i would say it's like they
4556520	4564440	they don't give the child the chance to to fall it's like everything everything is controlled and
4564440	4574440	and uh it's it's um no good that they struggle because when you introduce something to a child
4575800	4581480	well they can repeat the word but they don't quite understand the concept the abstract idea
4582840	4590120	yet uh it's a struggle they have to make to to to keep incorporating things
4590360	4601480	so the the idea of the literality is is very yeah i would say it's poisonous enough
4602520	4609080	as it is to not make people think very very deeply thinking has never been easy
4609720	4618360	has never been economically friendly uh in the in the in the in the sense of the of the brain the
4618360	4628520	brain itself it's quite lazy it tries it tries to deal with with everything even information
4629160	4638760	as as efficiently as possible so it's it is going against the current against the the the the the
4638760	4648120	waves but i think it's a fight that's worth giving to try and think i don't think it's a
4648120	4655240	very good very good pathway not to think about things and not to connect with things because
4655240	4662520	it's not only that you lose the the the capacity to think abstractly of complex ideas but you also
4662520	4671800	lose the ability to connect with the emotions to go within so and and that's even more difficult to
4672680	4683640	to counter weight and because they they they chop off the the possibility of um well of connecting
4683640	4692440	with with the high emotions and powerful emotions but also with harsh emotions so uh that's part of
4692440	4705560	life the both extremes i hope everyone leaves here with many questions
4712280	4719000	it's it's interesting because we came in thinking about ancient existential thinking and kind of
4719000	4725400	following it questioning its trajectory but this part of the conversation is quite disturbing to
4725400	4733320	think of where that future will go you know it can we get to the point as if if existential ideas
4733320	4740920	started at the start of human civilization is the trajectory that we're following that eventually
4741720	4747640	we won't question are we are we questioning less deeply i mean it's it's kind of mind blowing to
4747640	4755480	think that i think generally speaking the the like you've been saying the the value in storytelling
4755480	4763240	the value in myth the value in arts the value in performance all of this has been replaced by other
4763240	4772520	value systems that have just been you know really really shoved into the the faces and the psyches
4772520	4779960	of the population and uh you know it's it's not a comfortable thought it's quite an oppressive
4779960	4787640	thought to think where does that where does that go from here but you you might want to think what
4787640	4797480	what are we doing here today aren't we uh trying to to deal with with some aspects of the of the
4797560	4808280	human reality in a in a deep way and in a deep uh and and uh yeah maybe disturbing idea that's why
4808280	4816520	the the the dystopian authors are so so interesting to me because they show a part of the of the
4816520	4825000	reality which could come to be i mean i i love the t-shirt that's saying of orwell that says
4825000	4835640	i told you so i think that's brilliant i i warned you guys not with with much anticipation
4836280	4848520	and we we have a constantly news about the state of of um double thought i i i i i saw in england
4848520	4855800	those uh interesting news that police goes to your to your place if you don't have the
4855800	4862440	right idea if you protest against something that's not you should not be protested against
4863800	4873800	so it's well that's orwellian all right and and that's why thinking has always been problematic
4874360	4885080	but uh at least in a in a in a community way this is a very powerful thing but also in the
4885080	4895000	in the in the psychotherapy department is okay think about uh about yourself and who you are
4895080	4907080	who you want to be who you can be uh so yeah i don't find that that it's more disturbing now
4907080	4913720	than it was before we've seen atrocities uh all over the the history of humankind
4913720	4925160	and maybe the the shock comes with the idea that life should be easy peaceful and and with a
4925160	4935160	with a with a soft music behind you know life is and and the events of the world have shown that
4935720	4942600	life is difficult and life is many times unexpected but we need to fight for the
4943160	4949400	the ideas we stand for and for the things that makes us who we are so yeah
4952360	4956120	of course it's disturbing but it's only disturbing if you look at it
4957000	4964920	the thing is it's difficult to look and to understand what what do we see that's why people
4966520	4968680	who was it Pascal
4972920	4982440	that says something like this like it's easier or i don't know it's easier for
4983160	4989960	for people to to trust what they see in their eyes instead of thinking about it
4990920	4997880	because one is seeing beyond what you see maybe a little bit connected with the
4997880	5007160	literality we talked before so it's always been difficult but it's a fight that
5008120	5015080	uh at least gives meaning at least to me to to keep on with the with the ideas
5016600	5023000	that and that these things deserve the the time and deserve our energy
5028840	5034360	and i think in one way kind of thinking what Tony was saying at the beginning it
5034520	5041080	there's something you know unified there's something almost courageous to be spending
5041080	5047640	your life specifically dedicated to exploring these ideas and you were speaking about this
5047640	5052680	kind of this group of existentialists collecting together today whether that's live or you know
5052680	5061080	in the in the future viewers but it another side of that argument is everyone to to an
5061080	5068600	extent everybody is questioning these ideas in their own way and actually finding a community
5068600	5076360	like we have created and are creating there is there's something a lot easier to be able
5076360	5082920	to to question in this collective community and have the resources that we do and i think
5082920	5088520	you know everybody's thinking but where it's almost easier we're almost fortunate to have
5088520	5092920	to be thinking about it in this community rather than just flailing around you know
5095000	5100120	isolatedly and a lot of my clients come to me because they have been questioning these
5100120	5106680	questions alone and it's incredibly scary and painful whether that's finding a community within
5106680	5110440	an existential philosophy and having those resources or whether that's in music and
5110440	5116680	collaborating in that way or arts in that way but i remember naturally there was one of your
5117000	5121640	that lovely thing you did was it last year when you interviewed all these people and
5121640	5128120	there was a guy who said um you know that he would go to a dinner party and never leave
5128120	5133640	not leave if we were talking about this subject i can't remember the name of the guy but it but
5133640	5141720	it's very it's almost irony isn't it that we would um we as a group would love a dinner party around
5141720	5149160	this we would drink all night you wouldn't we wouldn't leave whereas most parties i go to
5149160	5153880	i want to be there under 30 seconds and i'm on to delete so isn't it ironic
5160280	5169400	the remember that not everyone is ready for those questions but once you start it's very
5169400	5179960	difficult to believe that once you start is almost like there is a point of no return
5180840	5188840	yeah i love that i love that what what is your drive to continue questioning
5188840	5193000	my drive
5197000	5199400	at some point why do you why do you look at the disturbing
5203640	5210280	why do i look at that it's disturbing at the disturbing i mean looking at things
5211000	5214040	things are disturbing only when you look at it and you said
5215000	5220280	yeah so what's your drive to open yourself to the disturbing
5223560	5230840	i remember there was a writer that was was asked why does he write
5232440	5236520	and he answered because i cannot not do it
5236680	5247160	and and and i think once you go towards these questions you can't stop you can't i mean it's
5247160	5257000	very difficult to to uh very difficult or even impossible without any uh huge defense mechanisms
5257800	5265960	might be crippling defense mechanisms to see something to not see something that you saw
5267240	5275960	so um i if i can't i cannot stop looking at things but that doesn't mean that
5277000	5282440	that i can't appreciate the the wonderful things that are down here look at the the space we have
5282440	5289640	we have today it's a wonderful thing to be able to communicate from two sides of the world
5289640	5295320	and to talk about these things of course they are difficult of course they are uncomfortable
5295320	5301320	but the the alternative is much worse at least for me that's why it's a choice
5301880	5305800	and it's a difficult choice and it's a choice that might not be for all
5307240	5316920	remember that these things are and and the the struggles we have are the same the same as the
5316920	5325480	ones that uh the Greeks had the the the cave the allegory of the cave is exactly that many
5325480	5331640	will choose to remain in the cave and there is nothing we can do for them because they they
5331640	5341800	have to choose and that's the freedom that's the the exercise of freedom they have even if it's not
5341800	5352600	for the for the their their benefit that's of course we can we can lament we can we can
5355960	5365240	we can suffer the idea of them of everyone not seeing something we can't impose that thing on
5365240	5373080	them that's why at least in psychotherapy it's no use if someone says oh no you should go to therapy
5373080	5379960	and and and i'll take you because there is not something personal that the person chooses to work
5379960	5391320	there i remember in in the public hospital and we had a specific team that dedicated themselves to
5392280	5400120	to to traffic yeah so so the people that that came to to renew their licenses need to make a
5401080	5410200	a psychic test and and have a certain space and i would say no i i don't want them because they
5410200	5415480	are not patients they don't choose to be there they are forced by the circumstances of their work
5415480	5423320	and in fact that's the the case they didn't work in therapy they they just it was just a
5424920	5432200	part of the of the functionality of the the demands that the the the the government made
5432920	5440920	that's why it's first the desire desire to go there desire to work that's a very good first step
5441000	5441640	to therapy
5449240	5456440	i've got my eye on the time and uh just like you say it's once you start it's very difficult to
5456440	5462040	stop i think we've all proved the case that it's very difficult to stop this and even when we close
5462040	5469160	today today's session we'll all be thinking because we really can't stop um but in terms of actual
5469160	5474920	time we we definitely have to bring it to a close unfortunately but i want to thank absolutely
5474920	5480680	everybody thank you so much for for taking the time to come and thank you for everyone that
5480680	5486840	contributed either just by your presence or just in the chat or or part of the conversation to make
5486840	5492200	this event what it is it's so nice to have a community i think that's what comes for me today
5492200	5498040	one of the many things it's so amazing to have this community to explore these questions and um
5498040	5503880	it wouldn't exist without everybody that makes it so so thank you so much and of course a huge
5503880	5511160	thank you to marcos um from all the way from argentina it feels funny all the way but we're
5511160	5521080	we've all the way but thank you so much um thank you so much thanks thanks everyone for being here
5521080	5528600	thank you hope hope you you live with many questions and of course thanks to natalie for
5528600	5535320	for the space and and to keep on making these these sorts of things that are very helpful
5535320	5542920	so thank you all thank you natalie ciao ciao okay bye ciao bye
5551080	5551960	you
