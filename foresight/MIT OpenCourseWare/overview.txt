1. **Understanding the Question:** When reading a scientific paper, it's important to understand the main question or hypothesis the study is addressing. This is often found in the abstract, but if not, you may need to look through other sections of the paper to grasp it fully.

2. **Design of the Experiment:** The design refers to how the experiment was set up and conducted. It's crucial to understand what was done, which is usually detailed in the methods section. This includes the procedures, conditions, and stimuli used in the study.

3. **Data Analysis:** After the experiment was conducted, the data were analyzed. Look for a section in the paper that explains how this analysis was performed to understand the statistical methods or computational models used to interpret the results.

4. **Results:** The findings of the study are presented and should be clear in the results section. This is where you'll find the conclusions drawn from the data.

5. **Interpretation and Discussion:** Finally, the discussion or interpretation section will explain what the results mean in the context of the research question and existing knowledge in the field.

6. **Ignore Some Details:** While all details are important for conducting the study, when reading a paper for understanding its main points, you can safely ignore some technical jargon or specific measurement units, especially if they are not central to the research's conclusions.

7. **Active Engagement:** To make reading scientific papers more engaging and effective, approach them with questions and an agenda. This active engagement helps you focus on what matters most in the paper.

8. **Seek Help When Needed:** If you're struggling to understand certain aspects of a study, don't hesitate to seek clarification or consult with peers or instructors who can provide guidance.

9. **Practice Makes Perfect:** Reading and interpreting scientific papers is a skill that improves with practice. The more you read, the more comfortable you will become with understanding the design, data analysis, and interpretation of experiments.

Remember, the goal is not to understand every single detail but to grasp the overall purpose, methods, results, and implications of the research.

1. **Non-informative Priors**: These are priors that encode as little information as possible about the parameters, effectively treating all values as equally likely before observing data. In the context of Gaussian distributions, the non-informative prior is the uniform prior over the real line, which corresponds to a normal distribution with an infinite variance (Jeffreys' prior). For Bernoulli distributions, the non-informative prior is the Beta(0.5, 0.5), which treats all probabilities between 0 and 1 as equally likely due to its symmetric form around p = 0.5.

2. **Jeffreys' Priors**: These are a type of non-informative prior that have the desirable property of being invariant under one-to-one transformations of the parameters. This means that if you change the way you parameterize your model, Jeffreys' prior for the original parameters will correspond to Jeffreys' prior for the new parameters, provided there is a one-to-one transformation between them.

3. **Beta(1, 1) Prior**: This is the Beta distribution that represents an uninformative prior for Bernoulli trials because it has the highest entropy among all possible Beta distributions and is symmetric around p = 0.5. It reflects a state of complete ignorance about the parameter.

4. **Beta(0.5, 0.5) Prior**: This prior is also uninformative but specifically for Bernoulli trials. It represents a situation where we believe a coin is fair before any data has been observed.

5. **Informative Priors**: These encode information about the parameters, either based on previous knowledge or expert opinion. They are not non-informative and should be used with caution to avoid overfitting or bias in the posterior distribution.

6. **Posterior Distribution**: The posterior distribution is obtained by combining prior beliefs (prior) with observed data (likelihood) through Bayes' theorem. It represents updated beliefs about the parameters after taking into account the new data. From the posterior, one can calculate point estimates such as the expected value (mean) of the posterior distribution.

7. **Bayesian Confidence Regions**: These are regions derived from the posterior distribution that contain a certain probability of containing the true parameter value. Unlike frequentist confidence intervals, these are coherent with Bayes' theorem and reflect genuine probabilities.

8. **Bayesian Estimation**: This involves estimating the parameters of interest by summarizing the posterior distribution. Common methods include calculating the expected value (mean) or the median of the posterior distribution as point estimates for the parameters.

In summary, non-informative priors are a key component in Bayesian statistics, providing a systematic way to incorporate prior information without biasing the analysis towards preconceived notions. Jeffreys' priors, specifically, offer an elegant solution to prior selection by being invariant under reparameterizations, making them particularly useful when the parameterization is less important than the information content of the data itself.

1. **System Modeling Languages Overview**: The lecture covered an overview of system modeling languages (SMLs), such as Ontology-Based Modelling (OBM), Common Information System Markup Language (CISML), and Modelica, which are used to capture the behavior and structure of complex systems in a rigorous and standardized way.

2. **OPM vs. CISML**: OPM is highly conceptual and focuses on the high-level aspects of the system without specific numerical values. It allows for capturing functional requirements and relationships between different components of a system. CISML, based on UML, provides more detailed descriptions with various diagrams and can be used to flesh out designs in a visual and structured manner.

3. **Modelica**: Modelica is a declarative language that enables the modeling of the physical laws governing a system's behavior. It allows for simulation across different levels of complexity, from basic fluid dynamics to full turbulent simulations.

4. **OpenMedlica**: This is a free tool that supports the Modelica language and is user-friendly, especially when integrated with Mathematica or other platforms. It's one of the practical tools for running models built in Modelica.

5. **Transition from Document-Centric to Model-Centric Engineering**: The lecture emphasized the transition from traditional document-centric engineering practices to a model-centric approach, which is more integrated and less prone to errors and oversights. This shift involves managing all design aspects within executable models that automatically propagate changes.

6. **Next Steps and Assignments**: There's no new assignment this week, but A2, the requirements assignment, is due next week. The upcoming lecture will delve into Modelica and concept generation, tying in with the creative aspects of systems engineering.

7. **Office Hours and Support**: Office hours are available for students to ask questions about assignments or any other topics discussed in class. EPFL staff, including Juana and Lieslu, are also available to assist.

8. **Wrap-Up**: The lecture concluded by reiterating the importance of system modeling languages in modern engineering practices and their role in enabling a more efficient and error-resistant design process. The transition to model-centric engineering is an ongoing evolution that aims to integrate all aspects of system design into a cohesive, executable framework.
