WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
All right, it's 11.05.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.560
I'm going to try to start promptly at 11.05 each time.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.080
So welcome.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.800
Has everybody psyched?

00:17.800 --> 00:20.040
I'm psyched.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.200
This is 9.13, the human brain.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.240
I'm Nancy Canwisher.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.280
I'm the prof for this class.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.080
Unless you were wondering, I have a brain.

00:28.080 --> 00:28.880
And there it is.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.240
That's me with some bits colored in

00:31.240 --> 00:34.840
that you will learn about in this class.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.240
What I'm going to do today is I'm

00:36.240 --> 00:39.720
going to tell you a brief story for around 10 minutes.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.280
And then I'm going to talk about the why, how, and what

00:43.280 --> 00:46.440
of studying the human brain, why it's a cool thing to do,

00:46.440 --> 00:48.360
how you do it, and what in particular we're

00:48.360 --> 00:50.240
going to learn about in here.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.120
And then we'll do some mechanics and details

00:52.120 --> 00:54.560
of the course and allocation of grades and all that.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.800
It's on the syllabus anyway.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.000
Cool?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.640
That's the agenda.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.520
All right.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.360
So let's start with that story.

01:04.360 --> 01:09.840
And for this, I'm going to set up here.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.400
The story isn't that long, but it has

01:11.400 --> 01:13.440
a lot of interesting little weird bits.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.960
So I have cue cards to remind myself of all the bits

01:15.960 --> 01:18.480
I want to remember to say.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.240
So you can put away your phones and your computers,

01:21.240 --> 01:22.480
and you don't need to take notes.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.720
This is just a story.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.400
It's going to foreshadow a lot of the themes in the course,

01:27.400 --> 01:31.320
but it's not stuff you're going to be tested on.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.640
So this is a true story.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.080
And I've changed only a few tiny little bits

01:38.080 --> 01:41.040
to protect the identity of the people involved.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.560
But otherwise, it's an absolutely true story.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.720
It's a story about a scary medical situation

01:47.720 --> 01:50.960
that happened to a friend of mine a few years ago.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.200
But at the same time, it's a story

01:53.200 --> 01:55.520
about the nature of the human mind,

01:55.520 --> 01:59.680
about the organization of the human brain.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.160
And it's also a story about the ability or lack thereof

02:05.160 --> 02:07.880
to recover after brain damage.

02:07.880 --> 02:15.360
It's also, incidentally, a story about resilience, privilege,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.560
expertise, and all of those things

02:17.560 --> 02:23.800
that are characteristic of many people in Cambridge society.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.160
Not so relevant for the course, but all right, here goes.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.160
So a few years ago, a friend of mine

02:32.160 --> 02:34.200
was staying over at my house in Cambridge,

02:34.200 --> 02:37.600
en route to a conference in a nearby state.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.120
And this guy, I'll call him Bob, was a close friend of mine.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.320
I'd known him for years and years.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.560
We talked regularly.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.640
We went on hiking trips together.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.360
We were pretty close.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.040
So he's en route to this conference.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.800
He's staying over at my house the night before.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.920
And the plan was for him to get up early the next morning

02:58.920 --> 03:00.040
and drive to the conference.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.840
So we hung out the night before and chatted.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.440
And the next morning, he's sleeping in the next room

03:05.440 --> 03:06.840
over from mine.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.640
And early in the morning, I hear some shuffling.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.360
I think, yep, OK, Bob is packing to leave.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.000
And thank god, I don't need to get up.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.840
I'm only dimly awake.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.560
And so I'm not paying that much attention.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.400
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle in the background.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.160
And then I hear a crash.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.400
And I think, what the hell is that?

03:29.400 --> 03:32.920
And I get up, and I go into the next room.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.680
And Bob is lying on the floor, not moving.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.280
I say, Bob.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.160
And there's no answer.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.400
And then I shout, Bob.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.240
And there's no answer.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.400
And then I dialed 911.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.280
While we were sitting there waiting for the ambulance

03:50.320 --> 03:53.760
to arrive, Bob starts to wake up.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.200
And he's very woozy, but he's alive.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.800
And he's making a little bit of sense.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.720
And he can't figure out what's going on.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.520
And neither can I.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.040
And so we're talking and chatting.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.680
And he's making a little more sense.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.200
But we still know what's happening.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.640
So then the ambulance arrives incredibly fast.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.120
So like three minutes, boom.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.560
There's three EMTs rushing in the front door, rushing up

04:18.560 --> 04:20.280
to the room where Bob was.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.480
And they take all his vitals.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.080
And they can't find anything wrong.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.000
And so they're really casual.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.640
I guess they confront stuff like this all the time.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
I don't.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.800
Bob doesn't.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.440
But they're very calm about it.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.440
And they're saying, well, you could take him to the hospital

04:36.440 --> 04:38.720
or not.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.560
And I was like, I think we need to know what just happened.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.920
Even though he seems OK, we kind of

04:42.920 --> 04:45.520
need to know what this is all about, don't you think?

04:45.520 --> 04:48.320
They're like, yeah, you could take him to the ER.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.560
And I said, well, do we need to waste ambulance resources?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.720
Or do you think it's safe if I drive him myself,

04:53.720 --> 04:55.400
since there's a hospital not far away?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.760
They said, you could drive him yourself.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.240
So I drive Bob to the Mount Auburn Hospital

05:01.240 --> 05:04.400
ER, which is less than a mile from my house.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.480
And we do the usual ER thing, which is mostly

05:06.480 --> 05:08.320
waiting and waiting and waiting.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.920
But various docs come by.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.360
And they take all these tests.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.520
And they take all these history questions.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.280
And it goes on and on.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.680
And basically, they're just not finding anything.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.600
So after about an hour or two of this,

05:19.600 --> 05:20.640
they're still doing tests.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.080
They don't want to quite let him go yet,

05:22.080 --> 05:23.720
because they don't know what happened.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.720
Everybody's calm about it.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.440
I figure, OK, fine.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.520
I got work to do.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.080
And I tell Bob, text me throughout the day.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.240
And I'll come get you whenever they're ready to release you.

05:37.240 --> 05:41.040
And so I go into work.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.280
But just before I go into work, a thought

05:43.280 --> 05:45.040
flashes through my mind.

05:45.040 --> 05:51.640
And I say to the ER doc, you should check Bob's brain.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.240
And the reason that thought flashed through my mind

05:54.240 --> 05:57.520
is that, actually, I had been worrying about Bob

05:57.520 --> 05:59.040
for a number of years.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.280
And it hadn't quite registered consciously.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.440
I hadn't was kind of too horrifying a thought for me

06:04.440 --> 06:07.080
to really allow myself to realize

06:07.080 --> 06:08.640
I was worried about Bob's brain.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.600
But I was worried about a very particular thing.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.360
And that is that Bob had been showing these weird signs

06:14.360 --> 06:19.520
that he often got lost and didn't know where he was.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.680
And on the one hand, this just didn't make any sense,

06:21.680 --> 06:24.520
because he was fine in every other way.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.280
But it was really pretty striking.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.720
So one time, I was over at Bob's house

06:29.720 --> 06:31.640
with some other friends of ours.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.600
And the friend asked Bob, how do I drive from your house

06:35.600 --> 06:37.080
into Cambridge?

06:37.080 --> 06:39.280
And Bob said, well, you go to the end of the driveway,

06:39.280 --> 06:40.960
and you turn left.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.600
My friend and I looked at each other like, Bob.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.280
What?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.680
And Bob thinks about it for a minute, yeah,

06:47.680 --> 06:50.240
end of the driveway, turn left.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.880
I just had this sinking feeling of dread

06:53.880 --> 06:56.400
in the pit of my stomach.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.120
But we sort of made light of it and made fun of it.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.920
And it went by.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.200
It was like, no, you turn right.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.520
And we gave the directions.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.440
Another time, a friend of mine was driving with Bob

07:06.440 --> 07:08.400
in Bob's hometown.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.800
And noticed that Bob didn't seem to know

07:11.800 --> 07:15.080
how to get to the grocery store in his hometown, where

07:15.080 --> 07:18.040
he'd lived for a really long time.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.320
And a trip he'd made hundreds of times.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.120
Another time, I was at a conference in Germany.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.720
And I saw these arrays of posters of people

07:29.720 --> 07:32.600
presenting usually pretty dry scientific things.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.440
And out of the corner of my eye, I see the title of a poster.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.960
And it says, navigational deficits, colon, and early sign

07:39.960 --> 07:41.400
of Alzheimer's.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.280
And I saw that.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.480
And I just thought, oh.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.280
And I just kind of suppressed the thought.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.960
And I thought, oh my god, Bob wasn't that old.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.480
I know Alzheimer's can very rarely strike early.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.960
I didn't want to think about it.

07:53.960 --> 07:59.160
But it was like rattling around in the back of my consciousness.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.240
So there had been these signs.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.160
But as I say, they didn't make sense.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.960
Because Bob was holding down a very high-powered job.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.120
He was writing beautiful prose.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.240
He was the life of every party he was at.

08:11.240 --> 08:16.800
Witty, funny, everybody's favorite life of the party.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.320
So how could that be?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.320
It just didn't make sense that there would be anything

08:20.320 --> 08:22.080
wrong with Bob's brain.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.920
So I managed for a few years to notice these signs

08:24.920 --> 08:27.080
and ignore them and not pay any attention.

08:33.520 --> 08:40.160
So the killer thing is I should have known better.

08:40.160 --> 08:43.240
My research for the last 20 years

08:43.240 --> 08:45.200
has been on the very fact that there

08:45.200 --> 08:48.760
are different parts of the brain that do different things.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.040
And one of the corollaries of that

08:51.040 --> 08:53.680
is you can have a problem with one of those parts,

08:53.680 --> 08:56.000
and the other parts can work just fine.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.600
And so I, if anyone, should have realized, yes,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.280
there's something really wrong with Bob's navigation

09:02.280 --> 09:03.320
abilities.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.520
And the fact that he's smart, and witty, and funny,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.560
and holding down a high-powered job

09:08.560 --> 09:11.440
doesn't mean there isn't something wrong with his brain,

09:11.440 --> 09:14.080
with a part of his brain.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.920
But I didn't realize that.

09:16.920 --> 09:21.240
But then, as I'm leaving the ER, it kind of all clicked.

09:21.240 --> 09:26.000
And I said to the ER doc, you better check his brain.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.080
I thought Bob was out of earshot when I said that.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.680
He heard it.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.880
He's like, what?

09:29.880 --> 09:32.520
I was like, oh, never mind.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.200
Anyway, the ER doc, with the kind of confidence

09:35.200 --> 09:38.960
that only docs can muster, said, no, not a brain thing.

09:38.960 --> 09:44.120
This is a hard thing, which wasn't exactly reassuring.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.640
But I set aside the brain thought, and I went off to work.

09:51.560 --> 09:57.440
So throughout the day, I texted with Bob a few times.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.200
Things seemed to be fine.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.120
They'd done more tests.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.080
They weren't find anything.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.040
We just got calmer and calmer about it.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.880
I guess sometimes weird stuff happens,

10:05.880 --> 10:08.160
and you just move on.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.520
But then that night, around 7 or 8 at night,

10:11.520 --> 10:14.520
I was over at a friend's house, and the phone rang.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.800
And it was Bob.

10:15.800 --> 10:20.000
I picked it up, and Bob says, get over here.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.200
They found something in my brain.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.720
So I ran out of the house, grabbed my phone,

10:25.720 --> 10:29.720
and as I'm driving to the Mount Auburn ER,

10:29.720 --> 10:34.360
I called my trusty lab tech, an amazing guy who

10:34.360 --> 10:37.160
keeps track of all kinds of things much better than I do.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.880
And I said, I remember that we scanned Bob a bunch of years

10:41.880 --> 10:45.000
ago for a regular experiment in my lab.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.080
And I don't remember.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.280
The date, I don't remember anything about it,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.440
but dig around in the files and see if you can figure it out.

10:52.440 --> 10:56.360
It might be useful to have that scan.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.360
So by the time I get to the ER, my lab tech

10:59.360 --> 11:02.960
has already texted me back and said, found the scans.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.640
I'm putting them in a drop box for you.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.600
So I go into the ER, and there's Bob in the ER doc.

11:09.600 --> 11:15.840
And Bob says to me, do you want to see it?

11:15.840 --> 11:18.440
The ER doc, the radiologist, has already

11:18.440 --> 11:21.040
shown Bob the picture of his brain.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.400
And so they take me in there, and I look at it, and I gulped.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.960
There was a thing the size of a lime smack

11:27.960 --> 11:31.080
in the middle of his brain.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.480
Pretty terrifying.

11:33.480 --> 11:42.400
So this lime in the middle of Bob's brain

11:42.400 --> 11:45.440
was right next to a region that my lab had studied

11:45.440 --> 11:46.680
in great detail.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.720
In fact, my lab had discovered that a brain region,

11:50.720 --> 11:53.240
right next to where that lime was located,

11:53.240 --> 11:57.480
was specifically involved in navigation.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.600
How could I not have put all this together,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.160
but I didn't until that moment?

12:01.160 --> 12:03.000
And I thought, of course.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.840
Of course, there's a thing in his brain,

12:04.840 --> 12:07.920
right next to the perihippocampal place area, which

12:07.920 --> 12:10.600
I discovered, and a nearby related region

12:10.600 --> 12:12.360
called retrospective spoolyneal cortex.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.400
Of course.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.160
And how the hell could I not have known?

12:16.160 --> 12:19.640
But I didn't know.

12:19.640 --> 12:23.760
In that earlier work, it had been nearly 20 years ago,

12:23.760 --> 12:26.280
I had a postdoc named Russell Epstein.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.440
And Russell was a computer vision guy,

12:28.440 --> 12:32.280
and he wanted to understand how we see by writing code

12:32.280 --> 12:34.520
to duplicate the algorithms that he thought

12:34.520 --> 12:38.040
go on in the human brain when we understand visual images.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.760
And that's a very respectable, cool line of work, which

12:40.760 --> 12:43.200
we'll learn a little bit about in here.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.320
And Russell was really a coding guy.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.680
At the time, we were just starting doing brain imaging.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.720
But Russell was like poo-pooing at all.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.000
It's like the flash in the pan.

12:52.000 --> 12:52.920
It's going to go by.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.760
It's trashy.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.920
So you guys get nice blobs on the brain.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.800
I'm not having any of it.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.040
And I kept saying, Russell, you need to get a job.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.880
Just do one experiment so you can show in your job talk

13:03.880 --> 13:05.200
that you can do brain imaging.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.520
It might help you.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.800
You don't need to do a lot of it.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.320
Just do one dumb experiment.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.080
Russell was interested in how we recognize scenes, not

13:13.080 --> 13:14.800
just objects and faces and words,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.200
but how do we know where we are?

13:16.200 --> 13:19.680
And how do we recognize if the scene is a city or a beach

13:19.680 --> 13:21.640
or whatever it is?

13:21.640 --> 13:24.240
I said, OK, Russell, we'll just scan people,

13:24.240 --> 13:26.280
looking at pictures of scenes, and looking

13:26.280 --> 13:28.000
at other kinds of pictures.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.560
And we'll just kind of see if there's

13:29.560 --> 13:32.280
any part of the brain that responds a lot to scenes.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.000
It really was not well thought out.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.960
This is not how you should do an experiment.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.440
It shouldn't be based on political calculations, lack

13:39.440 --> 13:41.080
of theory, any of the above.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.360
But the fact is, that's why we did that experiment.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.560
Russell needed to be able to show a brain image

13:45.560 --> 13:49.280
in his job talk, so we scanned some people looking at scenes.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.360
And the results knocked our socks off.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.480
We found a part of the brain that responds very selectively

13:54.480 --> 13:56.800
when you look at images of scenes,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.120
not when you look at faces, objects, words,

13:59.120 --> 14:01.400
or pretty much anything else.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.840
And so we'll learn more about that later in the course.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.280
We called it the Parahippocampal Place Area,

14:06.280 --> 14:09.240
and that launched a whole major line of work in my lab

14:09.240 --> 14:13.160
and now dozens of other labs around the world.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.720
So backtrack, we'd already found that region.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.440
And here's this lime in my friend Bob's brain

14:18.440 --> 14:21.440
sitting right next to the Parahippocampal Place Area.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.920
So then I remembered, let's look at the scans from my lab

14:33.920 --> 14:36.760
from a few years ago in Bob's brain.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.360
And so I fiddled around and found,

14:39.360 --> 14:42.400
managed to download the files.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.680
And there it was.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.000
You could see that same blob.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
But in the scans from a few years before, it was much smaller.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.160
It was the size of a grape.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.840
And so that told us a bunch of things.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.720
Most importantly, it told us this thing is growing really

14:57.720 --> 14:59.240
slowly.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.360
And that was hugely important because brain tumors

15:02.360 --> 15:05.960
are very bad news, and they usually grow really fast.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.200
And the fact that it grew really slowly

15:08.200 --> 15:12.240
told us that this was not one of the worst, most invasive,

15:12.240 --> 15:13.320
most horrible ones.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.920
It was clearly a problem.

15:14.920 --> 15:21.360
It was big, but at least it wasn't growing hugely fast.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.160
But how poignant that there it was in my own damn data,

15:25.160 --> 15:27.800
and I hadn't seen it in my friend's brain.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.320
Well, I'm not a radiologist.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.520
I'm a basic researcher, and I didn't look,

15:32.520 --> 15:35.040
and I didn't see it.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.840
So indeed, the next day, the docs told us

15:38.840 --> 15:41.880
that they thought this was meningioma, not cancer,

15:41.880 --> 15:44.000
who knew that you could have tumors that weren't cancer,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.720
but you can.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.040
And they still need to come out if they're big enough,

15:48.040 --> 15:49.640
and that's very serious, but it's not

15:49.640 --> 15:54.320
as bad as having a cancer in your brain.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.080
So as we're collecting information,

15:56.080 --> 15:59.040
the next day I'm hanging out in the hospital room,

15:59.040 --> 16:01.960
and there was an amusing moment when one of the residents

16:01.960 --> 16:03.560
came by, and he's taking the history

16:03.560 --> 16:05.120
and asking all the basic questions.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.040
And I said kind of sheepishly because you

16:07.040 --> 16:09.440
don't want to seem like you know more than the residents.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.920
And in fact, I didn't really know more,

16:10.920 --> 16:12.840
but I just thought I'd provide a little information.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.200
And I said, you know, he's actually

16:15.200 --> 16:16.800
had symptoms for a bunch of years,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.200
and there's a region of the brain nearby

16:19.200 --> 16:21.680
that I've actually studied a little bit.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.000
And the residents is like, we know who you are.

16:27.920 --> 16:33.560
So much for my trying to stay under the radar.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.320
That afternoon, I talked to a neurosurgeon friend of mine

16:36.320 --> 16:38.440
because I figured, OK, we need advice.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.640
We need help.

16:39.640 --> 16:45.680
And the neurosurgeon friend said, quote,

16:45.680 --> 16:47.440
it got branded in my brain.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.200
She said, it is of paramount importance

16:50.200 --> 16:52.520
that you find the best neurosurgeon.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.800
It's the difference between whether Bob

16:54.800 --> 16:59.000
dies on the table or goes on to live a normal life.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.880
So this is the privileged part of the story.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.600
I'm not that well connected, but I'm a little bit connected.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.280
And I kind of dug around and did what I could.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.920
And we spent a couple of weeks, and we

17:08.920 --> 17:12.760
found the best neurosurgeon.

17:12.760 --> 17:18.440
And the night before the surgery,

17:18.440 --> 17:20.880
Bob is staying over at my house because the surgery was

17:20.880 --> 17:22.520
in a Boston hospital.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
And I thought, you know, I've been dancing around this

17:24.520 --> 17:26.600
for years, but now, like, it's all out in the open.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.960
We know there's a problem, and I'm going to test him.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.640
I'm going to find out what the hell is going on.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.480
This is, after all, one of the basic forms of data

17:35.480 --> 17:36.880
that we collected in my field.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.720
That is testing people with problems in their brain

17:39.720 --> 17:41.960
to try to figure out what things they can do

17:41.960 --> 17:43.280
and what things they can't do.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.560
It's a way of figuring out what the basic components

17:45.560 --> 17:47.080
of the mind and brain are.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.840
It's actually the oldest, most venerable method in our field,

17:49.840 --> 17:52.640
and it's still a hugely important one.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.280
So I thought, what the hell?

17:54.280 --> 17:57.600
So I said, OK, Bob, draw me a sketch map of the floor

17:57.600 --> 18:00.080
plan of your house.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.200
And so Bob takes a few minutes, and he draws this thing.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.640
And it was shocking.

18:05.640 --> 18:10.240
There weren't even the rooms in a rectilinearly arranged house.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.520
They weren't even aligned.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.240
There was like a soup of lines.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.600
There was no organization from one room to the next.

18:17.600 --> 18:21.040
And Bob kind of realized this kind of isn't right, is it?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.720
But he didn't know how to fix it.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.480
And he said he just couldn't visualize what it looked like

18:25.480 --> 18:29.680
to be in his house, and so he couldn't draw the floor plan.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.120
And I thought, OK, he hasn't been there in a couple of days.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.320
I gave him another piece of paper, and I said, OK,

18:34.320 --> 18:40.000
draw the floor plan of my house, where you are right now.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.800
And so Bob took a couple minutes and delivered a similar mess.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.680
He couldn't even imagine the layout of the room next to him

18:49.680 --> 18:54.280
that he'd been at, been in a few minutes before.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.280
And then, trying to channel my inner neuropsychologist,

18:57.280 --> 19:00.280
I thought, OK, gave him another piece of paper.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.800
And I said, OK, Bob, draw a bicycle.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.880
Why did I choose a bicycle?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.520
Because it's a multi-part object that

19:06.520 --> 19:08.120
has a bunch of different bits that

19:08.120 --> 19:10.400
have a particular relationship to each other,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.240
just as the rooms in a house have a particular spatial

19:13.240 --> 19:14.680
relationship to each other.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.160
And I wanted to know, is his problem specifically

19:17.160 --> 19:21.640
about places, or is it about any complex multi-part thing

19:21.640 --> 19:25.040
that you have to remember the relationships to?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.520
Bob is no artist, to put it mildly,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.640
but his bicycle was clearly recognizable as a bicycle.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.840
It had the two wheels and the right relationship,

19:32.840 --> 19:35.880
and it had all the basic parts in roughly the same,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.520
the right place.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.840
I then had him draw a lobster, another multi-part object,

19:40.840 --> 19:42.840
and also his lobster was not beautiful,

19:42.840 --> 19:46.040
but had everything in the right place.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.600
And so that's very telling.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.360
He had a specific problem in, I don't know, imagining,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.680
reproducing, remembering.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.480
It's not totally clear.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.640
The arrangements of parts in a room,

19:56.640 --> 20:00.680
but not the arrangements of parts in an object.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.720
We'll get back to that more in a few weeks.

20:06.720 --> 20:11.640
So what do I want to say here?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.840
Is that all that?

20:13.840 --> 20:18.040
So the next day, Bob has an 11-hour surgery,

20:18.040 --> 20:21.680
major hardcore extreme neurosurgery.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.040
Remove a huge piece of bone from the back of your head,

20:25.040 --> 20:27.480
pull apart the hemispheres of the brain like this,

20:27.480 --> 20:34.160
go in multiple inches, and remove a lime, like holy crap.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.080
Said lime was right near the vein of Galen.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.720
Galen lived, what, a couple thousand years ago.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.360
The fact that there's a vein of Galen

20:42.360 --> 20:45.680
means it's a big-ass vein, the kind of vein that even Galen

20:45.680 --> 20:49.920
would have found with dissection 2,000 years ago.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.680
This lime was all wrapped around and interleaved

20:52.680 --> 20:54.000
with the vein of Galen.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.400
Not good.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.520
But because we found the best neurosurgeon,

20:58.520 --> 21:01.560
and because we have extreme privilege,

21:01.560 --> 21:05.040
and all the possible medical resources and expertise

21:05.040 --> 21:08.880
you could possibly hope for, Bob sailed through the surgery.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.680
And an hour after the surgery, I'm chatting with him,

21:11.680 --> 21:13.080
and he's making sense.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.240
Amazing, right?

21:16.240 --> 21:22.160
So literally, two days later, they sent him home.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.880
And a few days after that, he's back at work, no problem.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.960
Totally fine.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.760
But now we get to the question you're probably thinking about.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.880
What about his navigational abilities?

21:34.880 --> 21:38.360
The sad answer is, nothing doing.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.880
None of it came back at all.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.880
Thank God for iPhones.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.040
If Bob lived 30 years ago, he wouldn't be able to function.

21:47.040 --> 21:53.560
But he goes everywhere using his iPhone GPS, everywhere.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.680
And this fact that he didn't recover his navigational

21:56.680 --> 22:00.200
abilities is consistent with the whole literature that

22:00.200 --> 22:02.840
we'll consider later in the course.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.680
That often, not always, but often,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.040
if you have brain damage, especially

22:08.040 --> 22:09.960
to some of these very specialized circuits

22:09.960 --> 22:13.520
that we'll talk about, you don't recover later.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.160
If the damage is early, you may well recover.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.160
Children have much more plastic brains

22:18.160 --> 22:20.120
that can adjust after brain damage.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.720
Adults, not so good.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.720
So Bob's doing fine.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.560
That's my story.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.120
Any thoughts or questions?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.120
Yeah?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.640
He can tell the difference from the right to the left,

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
not on the left.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.880
Yes.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.200
Yes.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.840
And it's very interesting.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.840
There are many of his spatial abilities,

22:43.880 --> 22:46.200
that are absolutely intact.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.600
And yet, the ones related to navigation are not.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
Yeah?

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
Yeah.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
Yeah.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
No problem.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.600
But he's always looking at his damn phone to get directions

22:57.600 --> 23:03.200
or to listen to the GPS directions system.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.200
So driving is no problem.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.400
It's another kind of left-right.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.920
The immediate spatial orientation abilities

23:07.920 --> 23:09.280
are absolutely fine.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.600
But knowing where am I now, I don't know.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.360
Fine.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.280
But knowing where am I now and how would I get there from here

23:16.280 --> 23:18.920
is blitzed.

23:18.920 --> 23:19.520
Other questions?

23:19.520 --> 23:20.520
Yeah?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.520
Can you recognize what familiar is?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.200
Great question.

23:24.200 --> 23:24.840
Yes.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.080
He can recognize familiar places.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.040
What he can't do is he can say, oh, right.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.240
That's the front of our house.

23:31.240 --> 23:37.040
Or that's such and such cafe that's near our house.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.120
What he can't do is say, which way would you

23:39.120 --> 23:40.840
turn from there to go home?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.120
Great question.

23:47.120 --> 23:47.960
Great question.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.680
A little bit.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.240
So he can navigate a little bit with his GPS.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.120
And because he's learned certain routes

23:54.120 --> 23:57.000
as a series of almost verbal commands,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.120
like if you're here, turn right, then do, do, do, do,

23:59.120 --> 24:00.760
like that whole kind of thing.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.000
It's not what any of you guys could do.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.760
If you guys are driving around in Cambridge

24:05.760 --> 24:07.960
or walking around campus, remember

24:07.960 --> 24:10.640
where they blocked off this whole middle of campus

24:10.640 --> 24:11.760
a couple of years ago?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.880
It was so irritating.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.200
I would go there and it's like, oh, god.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.080
They blocked it off.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.440
I can't get over to lobby 7.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
Well, you immediately come up with an alternate route.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.240
It's like, OK, I guess we're going to have to do this.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.640
You come up with an alternate route.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.560
This is what a normal navigation system can do.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.800
Bob can't do that at all.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.840
He's like, route blocked?

24:28.840 --> 24:29.520
No idea.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.800
Get out the phone, right?

24:32.800 --> 24:33.300
Yeah?

24:33.300 --> 24:35.580
Does he get at estimating distances?

24:35.580 --> 24:38.940
Does he know something is a certain number of miles away?

24:38.940 --> 24:40.740
Yes.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.980
Yes, he is.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.380
And that's very interesting.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.460
But that seems to be kind of a different thing.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.420
You could think about all the different kinds of cues

24:48.420 --> 24:53.020
you have for distance beyond your kind of literal navigation

24:53.020 --> 24:55.020
skills.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.020
Yeah?

24:56.020 --> 25:00.380
Can you retrace the steps a couple of minutes after?

25:00.380 --> 25:01.660
A little bit.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.700
A couple minutes, yes.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.820
The next day, I mean, it would be kind of like this thing.

25:06.820 --> 25:09.460
It's like, you know, I vaguely remember that I was here.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.820
I turned right, so I better do that again.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.340
Yeah, did you have a question?

25:13.340 --> 25:17.100
Can you navigate within buildings?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.500
No, not very well.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.580
And this is a problem, because iPhones don't usually.

25:21.580 --> 25:25.460
So new hotels, big problem.

25:25.460 --> 25:28.180
Finding the bathroom down the hall or the front door

25:28.180 --> 25:31.300
in a hotel, big problem.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.580
Yeah, I mean, you know, these are problems you can come up

25:34.580 --> 25:37.340
with workarounds, but it's not life-threatening.

25:37.340 --> 25:40.100
But it's extremely inconvenient.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.020
Yeah?

25:41.020 --> 25:44.900
So this is the case that those navigational skills

25:44.900 --> 25:47.860
that he developed longer, a long time ago,

25:47.860 --> 25:48.660
those are stronger.

25:48.660 --> 25:51.580
So he has a harder time developing.

25:51.580 --> 25:53.300
Sorry, I mean, so new hotels are a problem,

25:53.300 --> 25:56.500
but if it's a fixie, it's more familiar like his home.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.900
Is it easier for him to navigate?

25:57.900 --> 25:58.900
It's a great question.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.340
You might think that the kind of navigational maps

26:02.340 --> 26:04.260
you laid down long ago would be intact.

26:04.260 --> 26:07.380
So is it just that you can't learn new ones?

26:07.380 --> 26:10.060
So it's a great question.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.620
The answer is kind of complicated in this case.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.020
For routes that he's memorized, there's

26:16.020 --> 26:18.060
a whole different system for knowing a route

26:18.060 --> 26:21.420
and really having an abstract knowledge of a place that

26:21.420 --> 26:23.380
enables you to devise a new route if something

26:23.380 --> 26:24.620
is blocked on that route.

26:24.620 --> 26:27.660
So for highly over-learned routes, he's OK.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.420
Like he remembers, like this you do.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.220
It's like a sequence.

26:30.220 --> 26:32.460
It's like a memorized motor sequence.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.780
You do A, and then B, and then C, and then D.

26:34.780 --> 26:37.900
So he's OK with those with routes he learned long ago.

26:37.900 --> 26:42.500
But he is not good at coming up with a new route in a place

26:42.500 --> 26:45.900
that he learned long ago.

26:45.900 --> 26:46.300
All right.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.340
We'll take one last question.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.340
Yeah?

26:49.020 --> 26:51.820
Does he have conscious access to past knowledge

26:51.820 --> 26:55.620
that he can't use in the case?

26:55.620 --> 26:58.660
And does he have conscious knowledge that this is the case?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.620
Can he, how does he specify that?

27:00.620 --> 27:03.780
Oh, I'm having trouble figuring this out.

27:03.780 --> 27:04.900
No, he knows.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.820
Well, he knows, because when he tries to figure out

27:06.820 --> 27:08.580
which way to head, he has no idea.

27:08.580 --> 27:12.460
So he's extremely aware of it and very articulate

27:12.460 --> 27:14.060
on precisely what happens.

27:14.060 --> 27:18.300
And so what he says is, like, if he's looking at a place,

27:18.660 --> 27:19.660
here's something he says.

27:19.660 --> 27:20.860
He's looking at a place.

27:20.860 --> 27:22.260
He knows where he is, because there's

27:22.260 --> 27:23.820
all kinds of other bits of information

27:23.820 --> 27:25.940
that tell you where you are, because you intended to go there

27:25.940 --> 27:27.580
and the relevant things are happening and all this.

27:27.580 --> 27:31.220
He knows where he is, and it looks familiar.

27:31.220 --> 27:35.340
If he tries to imagine what's behind him,

27:35.340 --> 27:37.420
he says that he, like, starts to get it,

27:37.420 --> 27:39.180
and it just kind of vaporizes.

27:39.180 --> 27:40.620
He just can't hang on to it.

27:40.620 --> 27:44.420
He can't kind of construct a stable mental image

27:44.420 --> 27:46.500
of nearby places.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.060
So I don't know exactly what that means,

27:48.060 --> 27:50.620
but he's very articulate and can report

27:50.620 --> 27:53.140
what he experiences when he tries

27:53.140 --> 27:55.100
to access this kind of information.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.620
So what you guys, we'll go on, but what I want to say

27:58.620 --> 28:02.540
is what you guys just did is exactly what we do in my field.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.820
We try to take a mental ability and tease it apart

28:05.820 --> 28:08.260
and say, is it exactly this or is it exactly that?

28:08.260 --> 28:11.740
And you guys all just did it beautifully, right?

28:11.740 --> 28:14.620
So a lot of what we do in my field is kind of,

28:14.660 --> 28:18.660
this kind of common sense parsing of mental abilities.

28:18.660 --> 28:21.500
What is a particular mental ability?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.100
How does it relate to some other one?

28:23.100 --> 28:24.300
Are these things separable?

28:24.300 --> 28:26.220
Can you lose one and not the other?

28:26.220 --> 28:29.100
Do they live in different parts of the brain, et cetera?

28:30.260 --> 28:32.260
All right, so that's the story.

28:33.100 --> 28:38.100
I'm gonna cash out some of the particular themes

28:39.580 --> 28:41.540
that came out from this story

28:41.540 --> 28:43.540
that we'll echo through this course.

28:43.540 --> 28:45.060
And the first and most obvious one

28:45.060 --> 28:48.460
is the brain isn't just a big bunch of mush, right?

28:48.460 --> 28:51.460
It has structure, it has organization.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.020
The different bits do different things, okay?

28:55.820 --> 28:59.060
Importantly, when Bob had this big lime in his head,

28:59.060 --> 29:01.540
he didn't just get a little bit stupid.

29:01.540 --> 29:05.180
No, his IQ, if he'd take an IQ test, would be unchanged.

29:05.180 --> 29:08.360
He lost a very specific mental ability, okay?

29:09.340 --> 29:12.020
And that is fascinating,

29:12.020 --> 29:13.860
but it's also good news for science

29:13.860 --> 29:15.500
because often when you try to understand

29:15.500 --> 29:18.100
a complicated thing, a great way to make progress

29:18.100 --> 29:20.220
is to first figure out what the parts are

29:20.220 --> 29:21.540
and then later try to figure out

29:21.540 --> 29:23.160
how does each individual part work

29:23.160 --> 29:24.660
and how do they work together?

29:24.660 --> 29:25.900
But if there's part structure,

29:25.900 --> 29:28.140
there's at least a place to start, okay?

29:29.300 --> 29:33.860
Okay, second theme is that some parts of the brain

29:33.860 --> 29:36.860
do extremely specific things, right?

29:36.860 --> 29:39.180
Not all of them, some of them are quite general

29:39.180 --> 29:41.720
and are engaged in lots of different mental processes,

29:41.720 --> 29:43.760
but some are remarkably specific.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.200
We'll talk a lot about that.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.160
Third big theme, the organization of the brain

29:50.160 --> 29:53.520
echoes the architecture of the mind, okay?

29:55.640 --> 29:58.120
And I would say the fundamental pieces of the brain

29:58.120 --> 30:01.640
are telling us what are fundamental parts of the mind.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.120
And that's why I'm in this field.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.360
That's what I think is cool.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.040
You know, the brain is just like a bunch of cells,

30:06.040 --> 30:07.080
like it's a physical thing.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.740
Who cares about a physical thing?

30:08.740 --> 30:11.780
The reason we care about it is that's where our mind lives.

30:11.780 --> 30:13.140
And if we study that physical thing,

30:13.140 --> 30:15.500
we can learn something about our minds.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.180
And that's pretty cosmic, I think.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.740
So the point of all of this kind of work is not to say,

30:20.740 --> 30:23.380
oh, that mental process is here, not there.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.220
Who cares?

30:24.220 --> 30:25.060
I don't really care.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.980
I mean, at some point you need to have a ballpark sense.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.780
You need to know to study the things.

30:28.780 --> 30:31.620
But the interesting question is not where these things

30:31.620 --> 30:34.060
are in the brain, but which mental processes

30:34.060 --> 30:37.380
have their own specialized machinery and why those?

30:37.700 --> 30:40.020
Yeah.

30:40.020 --> 30:43.460
Another important theme, how do brains change?

30:43.460 --> 30:45.260
Bob didn't recover after his brain

30:45.260 --> 30:47.740
damaged in that very particular mental function

30:47.740 --> 30:49.580
that he lost.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.500
If all of that had happened when he was five years old,

30:52.500 --> 30:54.980
he probably would have.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.180
So how do brains change over normal development?

30:58.180 --> 31:01.140
How do they change from learning and experience?

31:01.140 --> 31:03.780
How do they change after injury?

31:03.780 --> 31:06.980
And the final theme echoed in that story

31:06.980 --> 31:08.700
is there are lots and lots of different ways

31:08.700 --> 31:10.820
to study the brain.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.980
There are the simple behavioral observations.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.300
Bob can't navigate, but he can do everything else.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.100
OK, that's really deep and informative.

31:17.100 --> 31:20.980
Low-tech, but really powerful.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.340
The anatomical brain images that showed where the line was

31:24.340 --> 31:27.300
in Bob's brain, that gives you another kind of information

31:27.300 --> 31:30.340
where's the physical structure of the brain.

31:30.340 --> 31:33.020
The functional images that we had done in my lab

31:33.020 --> 31:36.780
to discover the parahippocampal place area.

31:36.780 --> 31:40.020
And the studies of what mental abilities are preserved

31:40.020 --> 31:42.460
in which are lost and people who have alterations

31:42.460 --> 31:44.020
of their brain.

31:44.020 --> 31:47.180
So those are just a few of the kinds of methods in our field,

31:47.180 --> 31:50.620
each of which tells us about a different kind of thing

31:50.620 --> 31:52.540
about the brain.

31:52.540 --> 31:56.580
So those are the themes I was trying to get at here.

31:56.580 --> 32:00.780
So let's move on to the why, how, and what

32:00.780 --> 32:02.300
of exploring the brain.

32:02.300 --> 32:06.300
I'm going to assign the TAs to get me to shut up at,

32:06.300 --> 32:08.460
let's see, are we're supposed to end at five minutes before the end

32:08.460 --> 32:09.460
of class, is that right?

32:09.460 --> 32:10.540
Is that MIT tradition?

32:10.540 --> 32:20.340
OK, so at, oh my, shockingly soon, 11.45, you're going to know.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.020
Oh, great, thank you.

32:22.020 --> 32:22.580
Thank you.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.980
This is one of the many things TAs are for.

32:24.980 --> 32:27.900
They pick up the hundreds of typos and mindos and all

32:27.900 --> 32:28.380
of that.

32:28.380 --> 32:28.940
Excellent.

32:28.940 --> 32:31.060
I'm thinking, how the hell did I so mis-timed this?

32:31.060 --> 32:31.940
Thank you, Heather.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.900
OK, good, we'll go on.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.660
OK, why should we study the brain?

32:36.660 --> 32:39.340
First most obvious reason, know thyself.

32:39.340 --> 32:42.780
Know what this thing is that's operating in our heads.

32:42.780 --> 32:46.340
This is who you are, right, is your brain.

32:46.340 --> 32:51.900
There are lots of very fine and important organs in the body,

32:51.900 --> 32:54.380
but the brain is special, right?

32:54.380 --> 32:58.500
So a heart is important, you die without it,

32:58.500 --> 33:01.860
but it's the brain that's your identity, right?

33:01.860 --> 33:05.340
So there's a reason that surgeons do heart transplants.

33:05.340 --> 33:06.140
That makes sense.

33:06.140 --> 33:09.460
Something wrong with your heart, you need another heart, OK?

33:09.460 --> 33:11.660
But why don't they do brain transplants?

33:11.660 --> 33:13.420
That wouldn't make sense, right?

33:13.420 --> 33:15.260
If there's something wrong with my brain,

33:15.260 --> 33:17.740
it doesn't make sense to take someone else's brain

33:17.740 --> 33:20.260
and put it in here, because then I'd be that other person.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.540
It doesn't make sense, because the brain is who you are.

33:23.540 --> 33:24.980
OK, so the brain is really special.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.740
It's not just another organ.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.780
That's why a few years ago we had the decade of the brain,

33:30.980 --> 33:33.860
not the decade of the pancreas or the liver or the kidney, right?

33:33.860 --> 33:35.100
People need to study these things.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.060
They need to know how to fix them.

33:37.060 --> 33:41.780
They're important, but they're not as cosmic as the brain, OK?

33:41.780 --> 33:48.500
All right, second reason why we should understand brains,

33:48.500 --> 33:52.220
and that is to understand the limits of human knowledge.

33:52.220 --> 33:54.900
Like the more we understand about the human mind,

33:54.900 --> 34:00.020
the more we can actually evaluate how good our knowledge is.

34:00.020 --> 34:03.420
Are there things that we might not be able to think?

34:03.420 --> 34:05.460
Possible true scientific theories,

34:05.460 --> 34:08.220
we might not be able to understand ever?

34:08.220 --> 34:09.900
You can think of studying the mind

34:09.900 --> 34:12.580
as a kind of empirical epistemology,

34:12.580 --> 34:15.060
a way to actually know about the knower

34:15.060 --> 34:18.900
so we can figure out how good the knowledge is in that knower.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.820
So that's another reason.

34:23.180 --> 34:25.980
A third reason is to advance AI.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.380
And so up until a few years ago, I

34:28.380 --> 34:29.820
used to give lectures on vision,

34:29.820 --> 34:33.460
and they would all start with some version of this.

34:33.460 --> 34:36.540
You guys all have amazing visual abilities

34:36.540 --> 34:38.620
in the back third of your brain that does vision.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.300
You can do all this incredible stuff

34:40.300 --> 34:42.540
that no machine can touch.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.740
That's off to you.

34:43.740 --> 34:46.300
You have an amazing visual system back here,

34:46.300 --> 34:50.180
and those guys in AI, it is mostly guys, guys, gals, whatever,

34:50.180 --> 34:53.580
those people in AI, could only dream

34:53.580 --> 34:55.860
of coming up with algorithms as good as the one that's

34:55.860 --> 34:59.300
running in the back of your head.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.380
You can't quite start the lectures that way anymore.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.020
So if any of you have been living in a cave

35:04.020 --> 35:06.940
and not heard about deep nets, there's

35:06.940 --> 35:09.380
been a massive revolution.

35:09.380 --> 35:12.500
And all of a sudden, deep nets are

35:12.500 --> 35:15.020
doing things that are really close to human abilities,

35:15.020 --> 35:17.020
particularly in vision.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.140
So for example, in visual object recognition,

35:20.140 --> 35:23.180
machines were way far behind human vision

35:23.180 --> 35:28.860
until very recently, especially when this paper here came out,

35:28.860 --> 35:31.700
was published in 2012.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.660
First author, Khrushchevsky, it has now

35:34.660 --> 35:37.540
been cited an astonishing 33,000 times.

35:37.540 --> 35:39.420
Actually, I made this slide a couple of weeks ago.

35:39.420 --> 35:42.060
It's probably been cited 36,000 times by now.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.660
You could look it up on Google Scholar and find out.

35:44.660 --> 35:47.020
That is a huge number of citations.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.020
The influence of this paper is ginormous.

35:49.020 --> 35:51.220
Probably half of you have already heard about this paper.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.180
Raise your hand if you've heard about this paper.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.060
OK, all right.

35:55.060 --> 35:57.420
Major big news.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.220
So what's so important about this paper?

36:00.220 --> 36:02.980
Well, they trained, as probably most of you know,

36:02.980 --> 36:06.820
they trained a deep net on the over a million images

36:06.820 --> 36:11.140
in ImageNet, a massive computer database of images.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.340
And they basically taught it to do object recognition.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.660
And it performed much more accurately

36:16.660 --> 36:21.340
than any previous system, and it approaches human abilities.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.380
So this is major, this is a radical change in the situation

36:24.380 --> 36:26.140
that we were in five years ago.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.780
So things have changed radically.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.820
So just as an example, here's one

36:30.820 --> 36:33.500
of the figures from that seminal paper.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.260
So here is one of the images from ImageNet

36:36.260 --> 36:40.500
that AlexNet, this trained network, was tested on.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.460
And the correct answer, according to ImageNet,

36:42.460 --> 36:44.260
is that that's a mite.

36:44.260 --> 36:45.820
And here's what AlexNet says.

36:45.820 --> 36:48.380
Its number one first answer is mite.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.100
And its second, third, fourth answers

36:50.100 --> 36:52.740
are black widow, cockroach, et cetera.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.100
So pretty damn good.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.980
The mite is even sticking off the edge of the frame,

36:55.980 --> 36:57.060
and it gets it.

36:57.060 --> 37:00.660
Containership, first choice, container ship, pretty good.

37:00.660 --> 37:04.020
Second choice makes sense, lifeboat, not bad.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.460
Look at that, motor scooter.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.420
I can barely even see the motor scooter in there,

37:07.420 --> 37:10.380
but AlexNet, awesome.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.820
Leopard, awesome.

37:12.820 --> 37:15.260
Even when AlexNet makes a mistake,

37:15.260 --> 37:17.540
the mistake is totally understandable.

37:17.540 --> 37:20.820
Like, according to ImageNet, that is a picture of a grill.

37:20.820 --> 37:23.020
And AlexNet calls it a convertible.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.700
I'm siding with AlexNet on this one over ImageNet.

37:26.700 --> 37:30.100
This, the correct answer, is mushroom.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.060
And AlexNet says agaric.

37:32.060 --> 37:33.140
I had to look that up.

37:33.140 --> 37:36.260
It's like a particular kind of mushroom.

37:36.260 --> 37:38.220
This one's pretty funny.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.700
ImageNet says that's pictures of cherry.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.060
There's cherries in the foreground.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.900
But AlexNet says dalmatian.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.540
I'm siding with AlexNet on this.

37:46.540 --> 37:48.580
And Madagascar, cat, et cetera.

37:48.580 --> 37:50.260
So pretty amazing.

37:50.260 --> 37:54.220
And nothing even close to this was possible before 2012.

37:54.220 --> 37:55.580
So this is very recent history.

37:55.580 --> 38:00.140
And it has totally shaken up the field in lots of ways.

38:00.140 --> 38:01.740
And so that's been transformative,

38:01.740 --> 38:03.620
not just for computer science, but it's also

38:03.620 --> 38:07.260
been transformative for cognitive science and neuroscience.

38:07.260 --> 38:10.260
Because now we have algorithms, like here's this deep net,

38:10.260 --> 38:11.860
and it does this thing.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.660
So that's a possible theory of how humans do it.

38:14.660 --> 38:18.140
It's a possible computationally precise theory

38:18.140 --> 38:19.460
of what's going on in here.

38:19.460 --> 38:20.660
And we didn't used to have those.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.820
And now we have those for a number of domains.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.540
And that's shaking up the field.

38:24.540 --> 38:26.220
There will be a whole lecture on deep nets

38:26.220 --> 38:29.060
and how you can use them to think about minds and brains

38:29.060 --> 38:30.660
toward the end of the course, guest lecture

38:30.660 --> 38:33.100
by my postdoc, Katherine Dobbs.

38:33.100 --> 38:36.420
And we'll hear more about that.

38:36.420 --> 38:38.700
But let's first step back a second and say, OK,

38:38.700 --> 38:40.660
do they really perform as well as humans,

38:40.660 --> 38:43.700
even on just object recognition?

38:43.700 --> 38:48.180
Well, what if we tested it on images, not in ImageNet?

38:48.220 --> 38:50.180
ImageNet is a pretty good test, because these things,

38:50.180 --> 38:51.900
as you can see, are highly variable.

38:51.900 --> 38:52.820
They have backgrounds.

38:52.820 --> 38:53.580
They're complicated.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.300
They're real-world images.

38:55.300 --> 38:59.500
But they were photographs taken by people in a particular way

38:59.500 --> 39:01.780
with a particular goal.

39:01.780 --> 39:03.780
And most of the photographs you take, you throw out,

39:03.780 --> 39:05.500
they don't end up in ImageNet.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.940
ImageNet is a weird little idiosyncratic subset

39:08.940 --> 39:11.380
of the kind of visual experience that we have.

39:11.380 --> 39:14.260
So would this really generalize?

39:14.260 --> 39:17.100
So it so happens that Boris Katz and Andrei

39:17.100 --> 39:19.380
Marbu across the street in Seasale

39:19.380 --> 39:21.180
have been doing some very interesting studies.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.260
This stuff isn't published yet, but I got their permission

39:23.260 --> 39:25.420
to tell you about this cool stuff they're doing.

39:25.420 --> 39:27.300
And they're saying, hey, let's test

39:27.300 --> 39:31.180
AlexNet and other similar deep nets since then

39:31.180 --> 39:34.420
on a more realistic, harder version of object recognition

39:34.420 --> 39:37.060
that's more characteristic of what humans do.

39:37.060 --> 39:40.700
And so they're generating this huge data set of stimuli

39:40.700 --> 39:42.260
that they crowdsource.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.980
And so people, workers on Mechanical Turk,

39:43.980 --> 39:45.740
go on there and create images for them.

39:45.780 --> 39:49.420
So they get instructions like, hold a object

39:49.420 --> 39:51.540
in this particular location or at this angle

39:51.540 --> 39:53.860
or move it here and send us the images.

39:53.860 --> 39:57.340
So they are getting, I think, hundreds of thousands of images

39:57.340 --> 39:58.740
to test this on.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.700
And they're much more variable in the location

40:00.700 --> 40:04.220
of the object in the image and its orientation and so forth.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.500
So for example, you guys have no problem

40:06.500 --> 40:07.820
telling what that thing is, but it's

40:07.820 --> 40:10.340
a slightly atypical example.

40:10.340 --> 40:12.580
Likewise, what's the object on the floor there?

40:12.580 --> 40:14.260
You can tell what it is, but it's

40:14.300 --> 40:16.540
slightly atypical example.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.500
And so what Boris and Andre are finding

40:20.500 --> 40:22.380
is that human performance is still pretty good

40:22.380 --> 40:24.100
on these images.

40:24.100 --> 40:27.900
But the deep nets are terrible at this stuff.

40:27.900 --> 40:31.940
So ResNet, one of the more recent ones,

40:31.940 --> 40:34.460
drops from 71% correct on ImageNet

40:34.460 --> 40:38.220
to around 25% correct on these images.

40:38.220 --> 40:41.980
And the other similar, fancy, more recent networks

40:41.980 --> 40:43.860
do similarly badly.

40:43.900 --> 40:50.820
So on the one hand, the deep nets are awesome and transformative.

40:50.820 --> 40:52.300
No question about it.

40:52.300 --> 40:55.460
But on the other hand, despite all the hype,

40:55.460 --> 40:58.540
they're still not quite like human object recognition.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.380
They're a whole lot closer than they used to be,

41:00.380 --> 41:03.860
but they're not really there.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.780
And more generally, what about harder problems

41:06.780 --> 41:10.500
like image understanding, not just labeling and classification,

41:10.500 --> 41:13.100
but understanding what's going on in image?

41:13.100 --> 41:17.300
So you guys have probably seen image captioning bots.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.540
There are lots of these around now.

41:18.540 --> 41:22.340
This kind of hit the scene in 2016

41:22.340 --> 41:25.380
when Google AI came out with a captioning algorithm.

41:25.380 --> 41:27.020
And of course, right around the same time,

41:27.020 --> 41:29.340
Microsoft had a captioning algorithm.

41:29.340 --> 41:30.980
And let's see how they do.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.180
So this is an example.

41:32.180 --> 41:35.060
You give this algorithm this picture here,

41:35.060 --> 41:39.620
and it says that's a dinosaur on top of a surfboard.

41:39.620 --> 41:42.020
That's pretty damn good, right?

41:42.060 --> 41:44.500
OK, wow.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.340
Let's look more generally how well this thing works

41:46.340 --> 41:48.500
at other examples.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.980
It looks at this, and it says, that's

41:49.980 --> 41:52.220
a group of people on the field playing football.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.220
It's like, wow, OK.

41:55.220 --> 41:57.060
A snow-covered field.

41:57.060 --> 41:59.500
Pretty good.

41:59.500 --> 42:03.700
Yu Xiuen and Ding Ning posing for a picture.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.460
I don't know, but these things are very good at face recognition.

42:06.460 --> 42:10.140
That's probably exactly those two people, right?

42:10.140 --> 42:13.220
A car parked in a parking lot.

42:13.220 --> 42:14.700
Pretty good.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.140
A large ship in the water.

42:16.140 --> 42:17.940
Pretty good.

42:17.940 --> 42:20.180
A clock tower lit up at night.

42:20.180 --> 42:23.060
Awesome, right?

42:23.060 --> 42:25.580
A vintage photo of a pond.

42:25.580 --> 42:28.020
Well, the vintage part, I don't know where the pond is.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.260
There's a little water in there.

42:29.260 --> 42:29.820
I don't know.

42:29.820 --> 42:30.500
Not way off.

42:33.020 --> 42:36.060
A group of people that are standing in the grass

42:36.060 --> 42:38.180
near a bridge.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.220
Not really.

42:39.260 --> 42:40.580
There's grass.

42:40.580 --> 42:41.700
There's a bridge, sort of.

42:41.700 --> 42:46.020
There's people, but not really, right?

42:46.020 --> 42:49.100
A group of people standing on top of a boat.

42:49.100 --> 42:49.860
Definitely not.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.020
A building with a cake.

42:55.020 --> 42:55.500
What?

42:57.860 --> 43:00.260
A person holding a cell phone.

43:00.260 --> 43:02.900
Not.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.260
A group of stuffed animals.

43:07.540 --> 43:08.700
I love this one.

43:08.700 --> 43:11.180
A necklace made of bananas.

43:11.180 --> 43:13.620
Wow, we've really landed on Mars here.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.180
A sign sitting on the grass.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.300
Talk about missing the boat.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.700
Now, look at this picture for a second.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.300
Just figure out what's going on here.

43:29.180 --> 43:30.780
Takes a couple seconds.

43:30.780 --> 43:33.260
Everyone got it?

43:33.260 --> 43:35.660
There's a lot going on here.

43:35.660 --> 43:38.140
OK, so this algorithm says, I think

43:38.180 --> 43:40.220
it's a group of people standing next to a man

43:40.220 --> 43:42.660
in a suit and tie.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.180
And the algorithm is correct, but the algorithm

43:45.180 --> 43:49.100
has profoundly missed the boat.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.500
So I'm channeling, actually I stole these slides

43:51.500 --> 43:53.660
from Josh Tenenbaum, but let me channel him for a moment

43:53.660 --> 43:55.460
and say what his big idea is, which I think

43:55.460 --> 43:57.220
is really important.

43:57.220 --> 43:59.460
And that is that both humans and deep nets

43:59.460 --> 44:02.860
are very good at pattern recognition, pattern classification.

44:02.860 --> 44:06.740
This is a cat, or a dog, or a car, or a toaster.

44:06.740 --> 44:09.580
What they're not good at, what humans are good at,

44:09.580 --> 44:12.180
but the deep nets are not, is building models

44:12.180 --> 44:14.380
to understand the world.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.020
And so when you look at this picture,

44:16.020 --> 44:17.300
there are all kinds of things that

44:17.300 --> 44:19.940
are crucial for really understanding at a deep level

44:19.940 --> 44:21.620
what's going on in here.

44:21.620 --> 44:25.420
We need to know what some people here know,

44:25.420 --> 44:28.740
but the guy on the scale does not know.

44:28.740 --> 44:32.100
Namely, even if you don't recognize that that's James

44:32.100 --> 44:36.260
Comey, I think it is, here's Obama with his foot on the scale.

44:36.260 --> 44:39.260
You need to know that people find it embarrassing

44:39.260 --> 44:40.780
if they weigh too much.

44:40.780 --> 44:43.900
You need to know that he can't see that Obama's doing it.

44:43.900 --> 44:46.740
You need to know that they can see it, even though he can't.

44:46.740 --> 44:49.020
And that's kind of the essence of humor.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.980
There's just a whole universe of rich structural information

44:52.980 --> 44:55.140
going in here that is part of what it means

44:55.140 --> 44:57.300
to understand this picture.

44:57.300 --> 45:02.740
And no deep net is even close to doing that kind of thing.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.420
OK?

45:04.420 --> 45:08.740
So bottom line of all this is, or let me just go on more

45:08.740 --> 45:14.340
generally, AI systems can't navigate new situations,

45:14.340 --> 45:19.020
infer what others believe, use language to communicate,

45:19.020 --> 45:22.740
write poetry and music to express how they feel,

45:22.740 --> 45:26.780
or create math to build bridges, devices,

45:26.780 --> 45:29.020
and lifesaving medicines.

45:29.020 --> 45:31.300
That's a quote from our leader, Jim DeCarlo,

45:31.300 --> 45:34.020
head of this department, published and wired a year ago

45:34.020 --> 45:37.780
in a beautiful article on the limitations of deep nets.

45:37.780 --> 45:41.540
But more generally, the point is that, yes, AI is taking

45:41.540 --> 45:43.780
a massive leap now when we're right in the middle of it,

45:43.780 --> 45:46.380
and it's super exciting, and it's helpful to neuroscience

45:46.380 --> 45:48.700
and cognitive science.

45:48.700 --> 45:51.700
But AI has a lot to learn from us, too.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.340
A lot to learn from what's going on in here

45:53.340 --> 45:56.460
and how this thing works that those AI systems still

45:56.460 --> 45:58.220
can't touch.

45:58.220 --> 45:58.940
OK.

45:58.940 --> 46:01.340
So all of that was my third reason for studying.

46:01.340 --> 46:04.020
We're still in the Y. Are we studying the human brain?

46:04.020 --> 46:05.980
The fourth reason to study the human brain

46:05.980 --> 46:08.140
is the one most compelling to me,

46:08.140 --> 46:11.820
and that is that it is just simply the greatest intellectual

46:11.820 --> 46:14.220
quest of all time.

46:14.220 --> 46:16.300
We could fight about cosmology.

46:16.300 --> 46:18.340
I'm not going to fight with you about anything else.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.020
I don't think there's any contest.

46:20.020 --> 46:22.700
It's the greatest intellectual quest of all time.

46:22.700 --> 46:24.700
And that's why I'm in it, and that's why I hope

46:24.700 --> 46:27.020
it'll be fun for you.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.820
OK, that was the Y. How are we going

46:29.820 --> 46:31.660
to study the human brain?

46:31.660 --> 46:33.060
So here's this thing.

46:33.060 --> 46:34.740
How are we going to figure out how it works?

46:34.740 --> 46:36.020
It's kind of daunting.

46:36.020 --> 46:38.060
It's not totally obvious.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.580
The first thing to realize is that there

46:39.580 --> 46:42.420
are lots of levels of organization in this thing,

46:42.420 --> 46:44.620
and hence, lots of ways of studying it.

46:44.620 --> 46:47.100
We could look at molecules and their interactions,

46:47.100 --> 46:49.340
lots of people in this building do that.

46:49.340 --> 46:52.460
We could look at properties of individual neurons.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.780
We could look at circuits of neurons interacting

46:54.780 --> 46:56.500
with each other.

46:56.500 --> 46:58.620
We could look at entire brain regions

46:58.620 --> 47:00.340
and what their functions are.

47:00.340 --> 47:03.060
We could look at networks of multiple brain regions

47:03.060 --> 47:05.700
interacting with each other.

47:05.700 --> 47:08.980
And so all of those things are possible.

47:08.980 --> 47:10.860
But actually, what we're going to do in the course

47:10.860 --> 47:13.060
is none of those things in particular.

47:13.060 --> 47:15.860
Instead, we're going to ask a somewhat different question.

47:15.860 --> 47:20.340
And that question is, how does the brain give rise to the mind?

47:20.340 --> 47:22.420
And to understand that question, we're

47:22.420 --> 47:25.380
going to do more at this level and less at the upper levels.

47:25.900 --> 47:28.220
OK?

47:28.220 --> 47:30.980
So to answer this question, we need to start with the mind.

47:30.980 --> 47:32.380
We need to, if we're going to understand,

47:32.380 --> 47:34.420
how does this thing produce a mind,

47:34.420 --> 47:36.300
we need to first figure out, what is a mind?

47:36.300 --> 47:38.500
What do we know about minds?

47:38.500 --> 47:40.620
OK?

47:40.620 --> 47:43.140
And so we need to start with the various mental functions

47:43.140 --> 47:46.460
that minds carry out, things like perception, vision,

47:46.460 --> 47:50.900
hearing, aspects of cognition, like understanding language,

47:50.900 --> 47:54.580
thinking about people, thinking about things, et cetera.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.820
OK?

47:55.820 --> 47:59.740
And so for each mental function, what we're going to do in here

47:59.740 --> 48:03.060
is start by trying to understand how it works in minds,

48:03.060 --> 48:05.180
as well as we can, or what it is that we're

48:05.180 --> 48:07.460
trying to understand that minds can do.

48:07.460 --> 48:09.260
What is computed and how?

48:09.260 --> 48:11.220
And then we're going to look at its brain basis

48:11.220 --> 48:12.660
and try to figure out what we can

48:12.660 --> 48:15.140
figure out about how that mental function is implemented

48:15.140 --> 48:16.380
in a brain.

48:16.380 --> 48:19.140
So the first question we'll ask for all of these domains

48:19.140 --> 48:22.820
is, is there specialized machinery to do that thing?

48:22.820 --> 48:24.380
And then we'll ask, what information

48:24.380 --> 48:27.140
is represented in the relevant parts of the brain?

48:27.140 --> 48:30.060
And when is that information represented?

48:30.060 --> 48:31.220
OK?

48:31.220 --> 48:32.780
And how?

48:32.780 --> 48:35.500
OK, so how are we going to answer those questions?

48:35.500 --> 48:38.060
Well, there's lots and lots of methods in our field.

48:38.060 --> 48:38.860
OK?

48:38.860 --> 48:42.140
And so the first set of methods, if we want to understand minds,

48:42.140 --> 48:44.740
the first set of methods are the basic stuff

48:44.740 --> 48:46.900
of cognitive science, psychophysics.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.580
That means showing people visual stimuli

48:49.580 --> 48:52.420
or playing them sounds and asking them what they see or hear.

48:52.420 --> 48:55.700
Nice and low-tech, but lots has been learned from those methods.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.740
You collect reaction time and accuracy,

48:57.740 --> 48:59.660
and it's amazing how much you can learn

48:59.660 --> 49:03.620
from these methods that have been around for 100 years or more.

49:03.620 --> 49:06.580
Perceptual illusions are similarly very informative

49:06.580 --> 49:08.300
about how minds work.

49:08.300 --> 49:12.260
Now, let me say an important thing that arises here.

49:12.260 --> 49:14.220
Last year was the first time I taught this course,

49:14.220 --> 49:15.780
and I would say it went so-so.

49:15.780 --> 49:18.580
I'm aiming for it to be much better this year.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.100
And one of the ways I'm trying to do that

49:20.100 --> 49:23.700
is to be responsive to the student evals I got last year,

49:23.700 --> 49:26.100
which were not fabulous across the board,

49:26.100 --> 49:27.380
hurt my feelings badly.

49:27.380 --> 49:30.180
But once I got over myself, I decided to just listen to them

49:30.180 --> 49:31.540
and try to fix it.

49:31.540 --> 49:34.300
And one way to fix it is to be honest with you today about what

49:34.300 --> 49:35.980
this course is going to cover.

49:35.980 --> 49:43.060
So in my evals, student 50458, bless them, offered this comment.

49:43.060 --> 49:45.180
This class was not sold in the correct way.

49:45.180 --> 49:46.660
It should not be called the human brain,

49:46.660 --> 49:49.020
because it was basically just a cognitive science not a brain

49:49.020 --> 49:49.520
class.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.480
I expected to learn very different material.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.040
So I don't know who the student is.

49:54.040 --> 49:58.120
I wish I could apologize to them, but I will say to you,

49:58.120 --> 50:02.720
sorry, student 50458, sorry to make that clear.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.920
The fundamental reason the brain is cool

50:04.920 --> 50:07.240
is that it gives rise to the mind.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.280
And that means that studying the biological properties

50:10.280 --> 50:12.680
of the brain without considering the mental functions

50:12.680 --> 50:15.440
it implements, it'd be kind of like trying

50:15.440 --> 50:17.320
to study the physical properties of a book

50:17.320 --> 50:20.480
without considering the meaning of its text.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.240
So we're going to spend a lot of time

50:22.240 --> 50:23.920
doing cognitive science in here.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.080
And if you had a different impression, sorry about that,

50:27.080 --> 50:29.040
but that's what we're doing here.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.040
OK?

50:30.040 --> 50:30.720
All right.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.160
So how are we going to answer this up?

50:32.160 --> 50:34.280
Lots of cognitive science.

50:34.280 --> 50:37.120
So how are we going to look at the brain basis?

50:37.120 --> 50:39.320
Well, we're going to look at neuropsychology patients,

50:39.320 --> 50:41.360
people like Bob, who have damage to the brain

50:41.360 --> 50:43.960
and what functions get preserved and lost.

50:43.960 --> 50:47.160
We'll look at a lot of studies with functional MRI,

50:47.200 --> 50:49.120
neurophysiology, where you can record

50:49.120 --> 50:52.040
from individual neurons in animal brains

50:52.040 --> 50:55.320
and in rare cases, even in human brains,

50:55.320 --> 50:56.920
under clinical situations where they

50:56.920 --> 51:00.720
need to have electrodes in their brain anyway for neurosurgery.

51:00.720 --> 51:05.800
We'll look at EEG, recorded from electrodes on the scalp.

51:05.800 --> 51:08.280
And MEG, recording from magnetic fields,

51:08.280 --> 51:11.360
from squids placed next to the scalp.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.160
We'll look at connectivity measures

51:13.160 --> 51:16.720
with a method called diffusion tractography, et cetera.

51:16.720 --> 51:18.760
So lots of methods.

51:18.760 --> 51:21.920
And so which mental functions will we cover?

51:21.920 --> 51:23.680
Well, to tell you about that, I need

51:23.680 --> 51:25.880
to tell you about the huge progress that

51:25.880 --> 51:28.480
has happened in our field in the last 20 years.

51:28.480 --> 51:28.880
OK?

51:28.880 --> 51:31.320
All of this is quite recent.

51:31.320 --> 51:34.640
And so let's back up to 1990.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.440
Here is approximately what we knew

51:36.440 --> 51:39.800
about the organization of the human brain in 1990.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.840
The black ovals are the bits that

51:41.840 --> 51:44.160
are primary sensory and motor regions

51:44.160 --> 51:47.800
that have been known for a long time, even by 1990.

51:47.800 --> 51:49.160
And the colored bits are the bits

51:49.160 --> 51:52.280
where we had some idea that face recognition might go on

51:52.280 --> 51:55.480
somewhere in the back end of the bottom of the right hemisphere

51:55.480 --> 51:58.160
because of people who had damage back there and lost

51:58.160 --> 52:01.760
their face recognition ability, sometimes preserving

52:01.760 --> 52:05.440
their ability to visually recognize words and scenes

52:05.440 --> 52:08.760
and objects, only losing their ability to recognize faces.

52:08.760 --> 52:10.080
OK?

52:10.080 --> 52:13.360
The language regions we had known about for nearly 200 years

52:13.360 --> 52:15.280
were Broca and Wernicke and others

52:15.280 --> 52:17.880
who had studied patients with damage in those regions

52:17.880 --> 52:20.920
and noted that they had problems with language function.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.920
And similarly, many people had reported

52:22.920 --> 52:25.640
that if you have damage up here in the prideelobes,

52:25.640 --> 52:28.520
you sometimes lose your ability to direct your attention

52:28.520 --> 52:30.720
to different places in the visual scene.

52:30.720 --> 52:35.720
So that was approximately what was known in 1990.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.280
And here's what we know now.

52:38.280 --> 52:43.040
We now know, thanks largely to functional MRI,

52:43.080 --> 52:47.440
that for dozens of regions in the brain, in every one of you,

52:47.440 --> 52:51.520
we have a pretty good idea of the function of that region.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.480
This is major progress, right?

52:53.480 --> 52:57.120
This is a kind of rough sketch of the organization

52:57.120 --> 52:59.320
of the human mind and brain that we have now

52:59.320 --> 53:01.400
that we didn't have 20 years ago.

53:01.400 --> 53:04.480
And that's awesome.

53:04.480 --> 53:08.000
And so that has made possible a lot of progress

53:08.000 --> 53:09.640
building with other methods.

53:09.640 --> 53:12.840
And so what we'll study in this course

53:12.840 --> 53:15.000
is we'll focus on those mental functions

53:15.000 --> 53:18.040
where the brain bases are best understood.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.000
And that will include things like the visual perception

53:21.000 --> 53:24.280
of color, shape, and motion, visual recognition

53:24.280 --> 53:28.040
of faces, places, bodies, and words, and scenes.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.800
Didn't make it on the slide.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.560
Oh, yes, it did.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.880
Perceiving scenes and navigating.

53:33.880 --> 53:36.200
Understanding numbers.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.720
Yes, there's a whole lot about the brain

53:37.720 --> 53:39.560
bases of understanding numbers.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.920
Perceiving speech and perceiving music.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.000
Understanding language.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.720
Understanding other people and their minds.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.280
So those are the kinds of topics

53:50.280 --> 53:52.840
where there's been a lot of progress recently

53:52.840 --> 53:55.600
in understanding the brain bases of those mental functions.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.840
And so those are the ones we'll focus on.

53:57.840 --> 54:00.120
And that means there's going to be a lot on perception,

54:00.120 --> 54:03.960
high level vision, and high level audition.

54:03.960 --> 54:07.200
Because that's one where a lot of progress has been made,

54:07.200 --> 54:09.080
and it's also a lot of the cortex, right?

54:09.080 --> 54:11.280
As I mentioned a moment ago, the whole back third of your brain

54:11.280 --> 54:13.760
does vision, construed broadly.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.160
And so some people might say, why

54:15.160 --> 54:16.400
should spend all this time in vision?

54:16.400 --> 54:18.200
Well, it's like a big part of what your brain does.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.720
We are very visual animals, so we'll

54:19.720 --> 54:23.000
spend a lot of time on vision.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.280
OK, and so for each of these functions,

54:26.280 --> 54:30.280
we will ask, to what extent is this mental function implemented

54:30.280 --> 54:33.600
in its own specialized brain machinery?

54:33.600 --> 54:35.480
Are there multiple different brain regions

54:35.480 --> 54:38.320
that carry out that function?

54:38.320 --> 54:39.480
What does each one do?

54:39.480 --> 54:42.840
Is there a division of labor between those different regions?

54:42.840 --> 54:46.720
How does that system arise in development?

54:46.720 --> 54:49.840
How does it have homologs in other species?

54:49.840 --> 54:54.440
Are these things uniquely human, or which of them are?

54:54.440 --> 54:57.240
And also, along the way, other side cool questions

54:57.240 --> 54:59.320
that will come up.

54:59.320 --> 55:02.000
What if anything is special about the human brain?

55:02.000 --> 55:07.440
How come we are taking over and largely destroying the planet?

55:07.440 --> 55:10.080
And other species are not, right?

55:10.080 --> 55:11.680
Besides destroying the planet, we're

55:11.680 --> 55:14.280
doing some other cool things, like inventing science

55:14.280 --> 55:17.840
and engineering and medicine and architecture and poetry

55:17.840 --> 55:19.880
and literature and all these other music,

55:19.880 --> 55:23.200
all these other awesome things that other species aren't doing.

55:23.200 --> 55:27.040
How come our brains are doing that and other species aren't?

55:27.040 --> 55:28.960
Where does knowledge come from?

55:28.960 --> 55:30.960
You guys know all this stuff.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.400
How much of that stuff was wired in at birth?

55:33.400 --> 55:36.160
And how much of it did you get from experience?

55:39.200 --> 55:41.960
How much can our minds and brains change over time?

55:41.960 --> 55:44.200
Can we go study a new thing and get a whole new brain

55:44.200 --> 55:45.280
region for that thing?

55:48.640 --> 55:52.000
Can we change the basic structure just by training

55:52.000 --> 55:53.960
or after brain damage?

55:53.960 --> 55:56.920
Can we think without language?

55:56.920 --> 55:59.640
How many of you have wondered about that question?

55:59.640 --> 56:02.000
Yeah, really basic question.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.600
Anya's answering it.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.640
Anya and some others.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.720
But Anya's doing a lot to answer that question.

56:06.720 --> 56:09.040
There are actually empirical answers

56:09.040 --> 56:10.920
to these longstanding deep questions

56:10.920 --> 56:12.520
that everyone wonders about.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.120
That's pretty cool.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.680
Somebody back there asked a while ago about awareness.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.480
Can we think, perceive, understand without awareness?

56:21.480 --> 56:24.200
How much can go on, like in the basement of the brain,

56:24.200 --> 56:26.320
when we don't even know what's going on down there?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.000
We'll consider all of these other cool questions.

56:29.000 --> 56:29.600
OK.

56:29.600 --> 56:33.320
There's a bunch of things we won't cover in this course

56:33.320 --> 56:35.880
for various reasons that could have been in here and just

56:35.880 --> 56:36.280
aren't.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.720
There's only so much time.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.240
Motor control, it's really important

56:39.240 --> 56:40.880
to know how you do things like pick up

56:40.880 --> 56:43.240
objects and plan actions.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.200
And we're just not covering that.

56:46.200 --> 56:49.160
Something had to go.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.440
Subcortical function, this is a very corticocentric course.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.840
Most of the course will deal with the cortex.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.360
That's where most of conscious thinking and reasoning

56:57.360 --> 56:58.800
and cognition happens.

56:58.800 --> 57:00.920
There's a lot of good stuff down in the basement of the brain,

57:00.920 --> 57:03.600
and it's going to get pretty short shrift.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.440
Not for any good reason, just what it is.

57:06.440 --> 57:08.080
Decision making, important field,

57:08.080 --> 57:10.320
not getting much coverage in here.

57:10.320 --> 57:13.000
Importantly, circuit level mechanisms,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.320
explanations of cognition.

57:15.320 --> 57:17.800
If you think that we're going to understand not only what it

57:17.800 --> 57:19.880
means to understand the meaning of a sentence,

57:19.880 --> 57:22.840
but that I'm going to give you a wiring diagram of the neurons

57:22.840 --> 57:25.520
that implement that function, sorry to be

57:25.520 --> 57:28.720
the bearer of bad news, but nobody has a freaking clue

57:28.760 --> 57:30.480
how you could get a bunch of neurons

57:30.480 --> 57:32.800
to understand the meaning of a sentence.

57:32.800 --> 57:34.040
So that's exciting.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.240
That means there's a field for you guys to waltz into.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.720
And probably in your lifetimes, people

57:37.720 --> 57:40.200
will start to crack these things.

57:40.200 --> 57:42.760
But just to know what we're headed into,

57:42.760 --> 57:45.920
rarely, for almost no high-level mental functions,

57:45.920 --> 57:49.920
do we have anything like a wiring diagram level

57:49.920 --> 57:54.560
understanding of any perceptual or cognitive function.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.040
So that's not in the cards for this course,

57:56.040 --> 57:59.280
because it doesn't exist in the field.

57:59.280 --> 58:00.640
OK, for that kind of thing, there

58:00.640 --> 58:02.440
are cases where you can make progress.

58:02.440 --> 58:05.520
You can understand, say, fear conditioning in a mouse.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.720
Like, those circuits are being cracked wide open

58:08.720 --> 58:11.000
by people in this building, people all around the world

58:11.000 --> 58:13.080
with spectacular precision.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.160
They know the specific classes of neurons,

58:15.160 --> 58:16.400
their connectivity.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.120
They know every damn thing about them.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.960
But it's like, how does a mouse learn

58:19.960 --> 58:22.400
that this thing is to be afraid of this thing?

58:22.400 --> 58:23.560
OK, that's important.

58:23.560 --> 58:28.680
But for more complex aspects of cognition in humans,

58:28.680 --> 58:30.880
we can't usually have that kind of circuit level

58:30.880 --> 58:32.720
understanding.

58:32.720 --> 58:34.760
Lots of other things that will get short shrift.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.600
Memory, not for any good reason.

58:36.600 --> 58:40.080
I mean, there's a lot of coverage of memory in 900 and 901.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.440
And it's just somehow I've a blind spot for understanding.

58:42.440 --> 58:44.920
I've heard knowing how to talk interestingly about memory.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.960
So I'm not going to give you a boring lecture on memory.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.400
Instead, I'm not going to give you any lecture on memory

58:49.400 --> 58:52.480
till I learn how to talk about it interestingly.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.400
Reinforcement learning and reward systems,

58:54.400 --> 58:55.840
I'm going to try to pull some of that in.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.280
But it's not going to be a major focus,

58:57.280 --> 58:59.960
even though it's a really important part of cognition.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.960
Attention, there might be some at the end.

59:01.960 --> 59:04.160
OK?

59:04.160 --> 59:09.280
OK, how many of you have taken 900?

59:09.280 --> 59:12.600
OK, looks like a little over a half.

59:12.600 --> 59:17.280
OK, how many have taken 901?

59:17.280 --> 59:18.400
Yeah, a little over a half.

59:18.400 --> 59:19.280
OK, good.

59:19.280 --> 59:24.120
So if you have great, good for you,

59:24.120 --> 59:26.680
this course is designed as a tier two course for people

59:26.680 --> 59:28.920
who have taken 900 or 901.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.120
If you haven't, you're probably OK,

59:31.120 --> 59:33.520
but you might need to do a little extra work.

59:33.520 --> 59:37.960
And so I've already posted online and in the syllabus

59:37.960 --> 59:40.960
information about actually a lecture I gave a year ago

59:40.960 --> 59:43.120
on some of the background stuff that is no longer taught

59:43.120 --> 59:43.680
in this course.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.920
People hated it when I taught them stuff they'd already

59:45.960 --> 59:49.640
encountered before, so I'm trying to minimize that.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.200
And so that's a backup for those of you

59:51.200 --> 59:52.400
who haven't taken these courses.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.840
If you're worried about this, chat with me afterwards.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.800
I think it will be OK.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.400
Just count on doing a little bit of extra work, not much.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.120
OK, for those of us who have taken it,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.720
there's going to be a little bit of overlap.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.080
It's simply impossible to have zero overlap.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.080
I mean, what does John Gabrielli in 900 and Mark Baer in 901 do?

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.720
They survey the whole broad field,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.400
and they pick the coolest stuff out of every little bit,

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.400
and they teach it to you exactly as they should.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.480
But that means that when I come along and try to say,

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.040
I'm going to do a more intensive coverage of the coolest

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.640
things, there's going to be a teeny bit of overlap.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.200
But I'll try to not make it too much, OK?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.640
Just because the coolest stuff is the coolest stuff, right?

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.480
Also, the spin and the goals of this course

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.360
are quite different from both 900 and 901.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.400
You will have to memorize a few things, but not much.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.160
My real goal in this course is to have you understand things,

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.560
not memorize a sea of disjointed facts, OK?

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.280
So a little more on the goals.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.360
Really, what I want you to get out of this course

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.760
is to appreciate the big questions in the field,

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.680
and what is at stake theoretically in each.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.080
I want you to understand the methods

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.640
in human cognitive neuroscience, what each one can tell you,

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.480
what it can't, how different combinations of methods

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.520
can work synergistically and complementarily

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.800
to answer different facets of a question.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.680
I do want you to gain some actual knowledge

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.320
about some of the domains of cognition,

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.480
where we've learned a bunch, both at the cognitive level

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.360
and the brain level.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.880
Things like face recognition, navigation, language

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.160
understanding, music, stuff like that.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.880
And crucially, I want you guys to be

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.000
able to read current papers in the field.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So if you look in the syllabus, the first few papers

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.680
are like 20 years old, but it's going to accelerate quickly,

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.440
and you'll be reading papers.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.840
I'm trying to choose mostly papers published in the last year

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.520
or two, OK?

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.600
I'm trying to take you straight to the cutting edge

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.080
of the field, OK?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:52.840
Yeah?

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.360
Are the papers going to be like people straight out of research

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.200
labs, or are they going to be like the annual research labs?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.080
No, straight out of research labs.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.920
You're going to read the real deal, not someone else's

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.760
blurry, they just read the abstracts

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.520
and put in some stuff in the review article.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.720
No, you're going to read the actual paper.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.120
That's the whole deal, yep.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.000
OK, so those are the goals.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.320
Good?

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.360
A few things, why no textbook?

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.400
This field is moving too fast for a textbook,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.160
plus I have strong opinions, and I don't like any of the textbooks.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.440
So any textbook is out of date.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.080
We're going to be reading hot stuff that's hot off the press,

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.440
and so there's no that's not in the textbooks yet,

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.560
and so we're skipping that, and you're

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.680
going to go straight to original research articles.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.240
So we'll be occasional review articles where relevant,

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240
but mostly part of the agenda of this course

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.240
is to teach you to be not afraid of and able to read

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.760
current articles in the field.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.800
All right, you've all been waiting for this.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.400
OK, details on the grading, pretty standard,

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.920
midterm 25% of the class of the grade, final 25%.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.680
It will be cumulative, but weighted toward the second half.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.120
There's going to be a lot of reading and writing assignments.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.800
Approximately two papers to read per week,

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.440
and for usually one of those papers per week,

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.400
you will have a very short written assignment in which

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.760
usually I ask a few simple questions and maybe one

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.200
like paragraph level think question.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.320
The essence of these tasks is not the written assignment

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.720
itself, the essence of the task is to understand the paper.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.800
If you've understood the paper as you read it,

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.760
then you should be able to answer those questions

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.880
pretty straightforwardly.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.760
And let me just say that understanding a scientific paper

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.680
is not trivial.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.840
When I read a scientific paper right in my area

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.080
where I have all of the background, it takes me hours.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.280
Hours.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.360
There may be five pages.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.360
It still takes me hours.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.800
It's just how it is.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.400
So when I assign a paper and you say, oh, it's only three pages.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.920
I could do that in 20 minutes.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.600
Oh, no, you can't.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.120
No, you can't.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.440
And that's part of what I want you to learn how to do

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.800
is how to really read and understand the scientific

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.680
paper, allocate the time it takes to really get it.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.440
So that's a big part of the agenda in this task.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.560
All the stuff, the assignments and the submission

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.120
of the assignments will all happen on Stellar.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120
Your first written response to a paper

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.240
is due February 12 at 6 PM on Stellar.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.560
But there are other readings that are assigned before that.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.800
A note about the schedule.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.560
I struggled a lot trying to both have the assignments happen

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.400
when you have already learned enough in lectures

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.000
to know how to do it, but have it close enough

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.280
to the topic at hand so it didn't seem like no longer relevant.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.000
That's hard to do both of those things.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.320
So the compromise is all of the assignments

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.360
are due at 6 PM the night before the class in which they're

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.200
assigned.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.240
And so if you see that it's assigned on the 13th,

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.120
if it's listed on the lecture for the 13th, check carefully.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.560
It's probably due the night of the,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.920
I'm getting this wrong, the 12th, the night before.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.200
And that's so that we in the TAs can look at it,

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.960
figure out what you understood, what you didn't,

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.400
and how to incorporate and explain whatever you didn't

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.840
get in the next lecture.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.800
All right, quizzes.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.960
I haven't done this before.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.760
No thing I'm going to try.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.360
There are going to be about eight of these.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.560
They're going to be very brief.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.880
They're going to happen at the end of class, in class.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.280
And you will do them on your computer or your iPhone

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.400
using Google Forms.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.400
If anybody doesn't have a computer or an iPhone,

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.520
they can bring to class the days of those quizzes.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.240
Let us know after class, and we'll come up with a solution.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.200
OK?

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.640
And the idea of these is not to fish out an obscure fact that

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.800
was in one of the reading assignments and ding you on it.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.760
Like, I'm not interested in that.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.120
The goal of this is just to keep you up to date,

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.480
keep you doing the readings, keep you up with the material.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.360
And if you basically are understanding what you're

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.520
reading and understanding the lecture material,

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.280
maybe you glance at it briefly before you

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.400
should do final inquisits.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400
They're just kind of reality checks, right,

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.440
for us to know what people are getting and not.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.920
OK?

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.200
OK, first quiz is February 20th, blah, blah.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.240
There is one longer written assignment

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.200
that is not due with the usual schedule of all the other things

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.080
to do near the end.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.800
And in that one, you will actually

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.080
design an experiment in a particular area.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.400
And that will be, I don't know yet, three to five pages,

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.160
something like that.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.880
We'll give you more details on exactly how

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.920
you want to organize this.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.960
And it will be very specific, like state

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.760
your exact hypothesis, state your exact experimental design,

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.320
et cetera.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.840
And you'll get practice with those things in advance.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.000
All right, so those are the grading and requirements.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.080
And you have this all in the syllabus in front of you.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.840
This is the lineup of topics.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.080
But very briefly, let me try to give you the arc of the class.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.920
So this is the introduction.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.080
Next time, we're going to do just a teeny bit of neuroanatomy.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.360
There will be a teeny bit of overlap with 900 and 901 there.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.080
I'm going to whip through it in very superficial form.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.120
I'm doing that largely because on the following class,

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.240
we have an amazing privilege, which

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.840
is that one of the greatest neuroscientists alive today,

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.040
Anne Graybill, will be doing an actual brain dissection

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.240
right here in this class, right in front of you.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.800
It's going to be awesome.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.880
I can't wait.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.160
It's an incredible privilege.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.920
It will be a real human brain, and you guys will be here

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.520
with all her apparatus, and you guys

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.080
will be clustered around.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.640
And if it's this many, God help us,

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.120
but we'll figure out how to make it work.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.240
I may, let me just say, if there are listeners in here,

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.280
I may have to tell listeners they can't come,

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.680
because it's very sensitive about not having too many people.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680
So stay tuned on that.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.840
I haven't quite decided yet.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.200
Depends how many people are taking the class.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.080
But it's going to be amazing.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.280
And I want to remind you of just some basics.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.600
So you're not asking her, like, what is the hippocampus?

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.320
I know you should all know that, but we'll just do bare basics.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.760
OK, and then we'll have the dissection.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.720
That will be great.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.560
And also, another thing to say is,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.640
I mentioned that the subcortical regions are

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.280
going to get short shrift in this class.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.760
That's true.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.040
But a lot of what you see in the dissection

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.360
is the subcortical stuff, right?

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.000
Cortex is great, but it kind of all looks the same.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You kind of can't say, oh, that's this region.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.720
That's the other region.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.000
You can, but it doesn't look any different from any other region.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.360
So that's where the subcortical stuff will happen.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.800
OK, so then I'm going to do a couple of lectures

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:19.000
that focus on high-level vision, perceiving motion and color

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.920
and shape and faces and scenes and bodies and stuff like that.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.200
And we will use those both to teach you that content

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.240
and also to teach you the vast array of methods

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.800
in this field, OK?

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.320
We will then have a lecture on the kind of debates

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.680
about the organization of visual cortex in humans.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.040
I have a particular view.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.720
I'm very fond of views that some patches of cortex

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.040
are very, very functionally specific.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.320
Not everyone believes that.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.840
So I have signed readings of people who have different views.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840
And we will consider that.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.160
I will try to expose you to the alternate views

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.480
and tell you why I'm teaching, why I still believe mine,

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.520
but why other smart people believe different things, right?

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.600
OK, we will then move up the system from perception.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.600
And we will spend two meetings talking about scene perception

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.920
and navigation.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.320
You've got a hint about what an interesting area this is

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.680
from the story of Bob.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.560
We'll consider more what we've learned

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.160
from studies of patients with brain damage,

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.320
from functional MRI, from physiology and animals,

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.160
from cognitive science, from the whole glorious menagerie

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.600
of methods, to understand navigation.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.040
It's a really fascinating area.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.800
In the two lectures after that, we'll consider development.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.440
How do you wire up a brain?

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.120
How much is present at birth?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.960
What is specified in the genes?

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.600
What is learned?

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.960
And a lot of that will focus on the navigation system

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.840
and the face system, simply because that's

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.280
where there's a lot known.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.680
We'll consider some other things.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.840
But those are two areas where there's

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.360
super exciting work from just the last three or four years.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.680
And so that's what we'll focus on there.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.120
I'm then going to do a lecture on brains in blind people.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.040
How are they different?

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.080
How are they the same?

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.680
What does that tell us?

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.080
And then you have the midterm.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.320
Then we're going to move on and consider number.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.240
How do you instantly know that that's three fingers

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.400
and that's two without having to do anything

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.240
all that complicated?

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.400
And if I had 25 fingers and held them up,

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.840
you would immediately get a sense

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.440
that it was about 25.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.200
You might not know if it was 22 or 28,

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.640
but you would know it was about 25.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.240
And there are particular brain regions

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.800
that compute that for you, and we will consider all of that.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.600
And there's a very rich array of information

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.760
from studies of infant cognition, from animal behavior,

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.640
from brain imaging, from brain damage,

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.000
from single unit physiology, and from computation,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.160
all of which inform our understanding of number.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.280
Those are my favorite lectures, where

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.640
we can take one domain of cognition

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.800
and inform it with all of the methods.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.840
And numbers are a really great example.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.840
Then we'll talk a little bit about, well, what

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.560
have my TAs said?

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.600
Call it neuroeconomics.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.280
It will sound good.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.600
But actually, what I'm going to try to do

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.840
is sort of neuroeconomics.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.960
But it will be about pleasure and pain and reward

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.320
and how we think about those things.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.240
And then, that's down to April 3.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.680
Just as a side note, all of these things

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.240
are things that are pretty similar between humans

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.520
and at least primates.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.960
And some of them are shared with rodents.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.560
And most of the things after that

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.280
are things that are really uniquely human.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.400
So we'll be really moving away with less available animal

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.200
literature to inform the stuff we're looking at,

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.120
because animals can't do these things.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.320
And so necessarily far from the details

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.760
of individual neurons and circuits,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.000
but there's still lots cool that can

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.240
be said about how you understand speech,

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.040
how you appreciate music.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.200
There will be a guest lecture just for fun

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.480
on Brain Machine Interface by Michael Cohen, who's

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.160
working in my lab now and who has a great lecture on this topic.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.840
Then we'll spend a couple lectures on language,

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.160
how you understand and produce language

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.360
and what the relevant brain regions are,

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.080
what we know about it from cognition

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.360
and lots of other methods, and what

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.360
the relationship is between language and thought.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.720
Then we'll think about how we think about other people.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.400
This is called theory of mind, how

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.920
I can look out at this lecture and try to evaluate

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.200
from your facial expression.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.840
Are they bored, sleepy, overworked, fascinated,

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.400
excited, all of this kind of stuff

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.080
that all of us do moment to moment in any conversation

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.720
and that, yes, lectures are doing all the time,

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.600
even if I know that you guys have too much work

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.560
and that's why you're sleepy and I shouldn't take it personally.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.440
I'm still noticing.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.960
Anyway, then we'll go on and consider brain networks.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.800
So of course, brain function doesn't happen

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.360
in just a single region, even if we spend a lot of time

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.280
studying individual regions.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.080
There's considerable work trying to figure out

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.800
which sets of regions work together

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.240
and how could we discover that and what

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.040
are those broader networks of brain regions.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.880
And then on May 6th, you will have

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.600
turned in your longer written assignment

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.880
designing your own experiment.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.440
And then on May 6th, we will work together

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.160
in groups to refine those experiments

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.000
and really hash out the details so you actually

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.640
know how to design an experiment.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.200
And then we will have this guest lecture

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.880
from my postdoc, Katharina Dobbs, on deep nets

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.320
and what they can tell us about cognition and brains.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.680
And then we'll talk about attention awareness.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.040
And then I'm not totally sure what

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.240
we're going to do in the last class,

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.720
I'm voting for, is it the amazing TAs?

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.600
Each give a short talk on the cool stuff they're doing.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.560
But that's under discussion.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.600
OK, that's the arc of the class.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.080
Questions?

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:40.900
All clear?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.640
Great.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.040
Well, if I have five more minutes,

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.840
maybe I'll do one other little thing.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.920
Let me try this.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.960
You asked, I'm going to try to learn everybody's names,

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.920
but I'm not doing that yet.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.120
Because some of you might not show up

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.840
and I will have wasted a whole piece of my brain

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.920
encoding it now, just kidding.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920
But anyway, I remember that you asked,

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.240
you're going to read current papers.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.760
Yes, and you're right, it's daunting.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.680
But let me just say a little bit about how to read papers.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.760
This is not a stats course, and we haven't prerequisited stats.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.480
Neither is it a course on the physics of MRI.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.520
So there will be parts of every MRI paper

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.120
that have a lot of gobbledygook.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.000
We scan with this scanning procedure.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.640
We use this kind of scanner, and this kind of blah, blah,

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.080
blah, lots of gobbledygook.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.160
You guys don't need to worry about that.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.880
About the stats, it's kind of a judgment call.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.720
Everyone in here should have an idea of what a P level means.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.960
And I hope a sense of what a T test is and an ANOVA.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.280
If you don't, I should probably tell you that offline,

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.680
because that's pretty basic.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.520
But what a correlation is.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.440
Beyond that, just use your intuitions about those things.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.680
And this is not a course about understanding

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.520
the details of the stats in each experiment.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.600
It just isn't room to cover all that in the substance

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.280
of the studies as well.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.440
So when you read a paper, for example, here's a paper,

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.760
a very old paper, you come across this,

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.640
and it's like, OK, here are all these words.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.880
And it goes on for 20 pages, and like, how do you even dig in?

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.240
Well, the way to dig in is to start

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.040
by saying, what question is being asked in this paper?

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.800
If the paper is well written, you'll

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.680
be able to find that in the abstract, blah, blah, blah,

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.440
to study the effect of face inversion

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.240
on the human fusiform face area.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.720
OK, we'll talk about that more later.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.560
But if you fish through the abstract,

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.440
you should be able to find what question is being asked,

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.280
and it's the first thing you should figure out about a paper.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.600
You don't necessarily read a paper,

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.080
start beginning through the end.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.000
I think it's better to start with this list of questions

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.280
in your head, and look for the answers to those questions.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.800
Second question, what do they find?

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.120
If the abstract is well written,

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.600
you can find that in the abstract as well.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.840
Signal intensity from the fusiform face area

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.360
was reduced when grayscale faces were presented upside down.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.040
OK, kind of boring, but there it is.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.720
That's a finding of this paper.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.960
OK, what is the interpretation?

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.840
Like, in other words, who cares?

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.320
Like, who cares about this?

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.480
OK, if you look in here in the abstract,

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.680
FFA responds to faces per se, rather than to the low level

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.040
features present in faces.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.880
OK, we'll talk more about what that means.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.240
You guys have an assignment about that,

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.840
probably several assignments about that kind of question.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.880
Next question you want to ask yourself

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.200
is, what is the design of this experiment?

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.040
Often for this, you have to go beyond the abstract.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.840
And I should say, for even these earlier questions,

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
sometimes you won't find them in the abstract.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.400
That just means the abstract is not well written.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.840
But that exists.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.240
OK, to get the design, like, what exactly did they do?

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:51.280
Usually you have to fit in what exactly was done,

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.440
and how were the data analyzed?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.800
You need to fish farther.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.880
You need to fish around other parts of the paper.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.920
And of course, all of those questions.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.760
OK, so I just said, OK, what question?

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.360
And I circled this part.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.800
But there are many levels to what question.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.000
So you can get more on, why is that inverted question

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.480
important?

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.880
You look through, usually, in the introduction to the paper.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.440
Does the FFA respond to faces per se,

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.400
or to a confounding visual feature, which

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.640
tends to be present in faces?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.120
Second, is it true that inverted faces cannot engage

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.320
face-specific mechanisms?

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.080
Blah, blah, blah.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.720
So that gives you a little more background

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.080
on what the question is, right?

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.360
There are different levels and depths, OK?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.360
So these are all things you want to be looking for

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.880
when you read a paper.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880
What exactly was done?

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.920
We measured MRI responses in the FFA

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.640
to upright and inverted faces, right?

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.960
I don't expect you to understand all this.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.280
You're just giving you schematically how you proceed

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.720
when you're reading a paper, OK?

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.480
More on the interpretation, or who cares, right?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.880
This result would show that face-specific mechanisms

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.320
are engaged only or predominantly by upright faces,

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
blah, blah, blah, right?

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.040
You can fish through for those things.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.720
Point is to have those questions in your head

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.360
when you read a paper, OK?

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.520
It's much more easy and engaging to read something

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.400
if you have an agenda when you read it.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.000
And so your agenda in reading scientific papers

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.880
is to answer those questions for yourself, right?

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.720
More stuff, what was the design and logic?

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.120
Often that's deep in the methods.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.560
You have to fish around and find it.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.560
There will be some set of conditions and designs.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.520
We'll talk more about all this kind of stuff,

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.600
what exactly was done, blah, blah, more details.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.600
And this is my example of the kind of gobbledygook

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.960
that you can ignore, OK?

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.160
So subjects were scanned on a 1 and 1 1⁄2 T scanner.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.400
And there are all these, like this here's

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.000
the example of said gobbledygook.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.240
You can ignore this in this class, right?

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.520
Every method will have different kinds of gobbledygook.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.880
This is MRI gobbledygook.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.080
You can ignore it, OK?

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.960
It matters a lot, but not here, OK?

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.360
What else?

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.200
How are the data analyzed?

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.480
If you look in the sometimes there's

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.160
a data analysis section or a result section or a method

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.120
section that will tell you, you can find that, figure it out,

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.240
OK?

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240
What was the finding?

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.520
Here's more on the finding.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.560
Again, you just fish through for these things.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.440
So the point is just, when you're reading a paper,

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.760
it's not necessarily, what I do is I read the title,

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.280
I read the abstract.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.400
And then I start answering those questions for myself.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.560
And sometimes at that point, I'm skipping to figures,

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.200
I'm skipping to methods.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.480
Any of that is fine, OK?

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.160
So don't feel like you need to understand each word, especially

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.480
deep in the methods.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.520
I don't know, is that helpful at all?

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.480
We'll try it, and you guys will give me feedback.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.480
And if it works, great.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.200
And if not, we'll do more on how to read papers.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.640
All right, it's 12.25.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.800
See you on Monday.
