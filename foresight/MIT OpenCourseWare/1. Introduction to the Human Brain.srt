1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
All right, it's 11.05.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,560
I'm going to try to start promptly at 11.05 each time.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,080
So welcome.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,800
Has everybody psyched?

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm psyched.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,200
This is 9.13, the human brain.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm Nancy Canwisher.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,280
I'm the prof for this class.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,080
Unless you were wondering, I have a brain.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,880
And there it is.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,240
That's me with some bits colored in

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,840
that you will learn about in this class.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
What I'm going to do today is I'm

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,720
going to tell you a brief story for around 10 minutes.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,280
And then I'm going to talk about the why, how, and what

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,440
of studying the human brain, why it's a cool thing to do,

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
how you do it, and what in particular we're

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,240
going to learn about in here.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,120
And then we'll do some mechanics and details

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,560
of the course and allocation of grades and all that.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,800
It's on the syllabus anyway.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Cool?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
That's the agenda.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,520
All right.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,360
So let's start with that story.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,840
And for this, I'm going to set up here.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
The story isn't that long, but it has

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,440
a lot of interesting little weird bits.

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,960
So I have cue cards to remind myself of all the bits

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,480
I want to remember to say.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,240
So you can put away your phones and your computers,

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,480
and you don't need to take notes.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,720
This is just a story.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,400
It's going to foreshadow a lot of the themes in the course,

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,320
but it's not stuff you're going to be tested on.

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,640
So this is a true story.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,080
And I've changed only a few tiny little bits

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,040
to protect the identity of the people involved.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
But otherwise, it's an absolutely true story.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,720
It's a story about a scary medical situation

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,960
that happened to a friend of mine a few years ago.

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
But at the same time, it's a story

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
about the nature of the human mind,

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
about the organization of the human brain.

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,160
And it's also a story about the ability or lack thereof

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,880
to recover after brain damage.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,360
It's also, incidentally, a story about resilience, privilege,

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
expertise, and all of those things

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,800
that are characteristic of many people in Cambridge society.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Not so relevant for the course, but all right, here goes.

51
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,160
So a few years ago, a friend of mine

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,200
was staying over at my house in Cambridge,

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,600
en route to a conference in a nearby state.

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,120
And this guy, I'll call him Bob, was a close friend of mine.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,320
I'd known him for years and years.

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
We talked regularly.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
We went on hiking trips together.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,360
We were pretty close.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,040
So he's en route to this conference.

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,800
He's staying over at my house the night before.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
And the plan was for him to get up early the next morning

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
and drive to the conference.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,840
So we hung out the night before and chatted.

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,440
And the next morning, he's sleeping in the next room

65
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
over from mine.

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,640
And early in the morning, I hear some shuffling.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,360
I think, yep, OK, Bob is packing to leave.

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,000
And thank god, I don't need to get up.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm only dimly awake.

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
And so I'm not paying that much attention.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle in the background.

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
And then I hear a crash.

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,400
And I think, what the hell is that?

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,920
And I get up, and I go into the next room.

75
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,680
And Bob is lying on the floor, not moving.

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
I say, Bob.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,160
And there's no answer.

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,400
And then I shout, Bob.

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,240
And there's no answer.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
And then I dialed 911.

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,280
While we were sitting there waiting for the ambulance

82
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,760
to arrive, Bob starts to wake up.

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,200
And he's very woozy, but he's alive.

84
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
And he's making a little bit of sense.

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,720
And he can't figure out what's going on.

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
And neither can I.

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,040
And so we're talking and chatting.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
And he's making a little more sense.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,200
But we still know what's happening.

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,640
So then the ambulance arrives incredibly fast.

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,120
So like three minutes, boom.

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
There's three EMTs rushing in the front door, rushing up

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
to the room where Bob was.

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,480
And they take all his vitals.

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,080
And they can't find anything wrong.

96
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000
And so they're really casual.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,640
I guess they confront stuff like this all the time.

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't.

99
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Bob doesn't.

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,440
But they're very calm about it.

101
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
And they're saying, well, you could take him to the hospital

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,720
or not.

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,560
And I was like, I think we need to know what just happened.

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,920
Even though he seems OK, we kind of

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,520
need to know what this is all about, don't you think?

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
They're like, yeah, you could take him to the ER.

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,560
And I said, well, do we need to waste ambulance resources?

108
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,720
Or do you think it's safe if I drive him myself,

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
since there's a hospital not far away?

110
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,760
They said, you could drive him yourself.

111
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,240
So I drive Bob to the Mount Auburn Hospital

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,400
ER, which is less than a mile from my house.

113
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,480
And we do the usual ER thing, which is mostly

114
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,320
waiting and waiting and waiting.

115
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,920
But various docs come by.

116
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
And they take all these tests.

117
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
And they take all these history questions.

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,280
And it goes on and on.

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,680
And basically, they're just not finding anything.

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
So after about an hour or two of this,

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
they're still doing tests.

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
They don't want to quite let him go yet,

123
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,720
because they don't know what happened.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Everybody's calm about it.

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
I figure, OK, fine.

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
I got work to do.

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,080
And I tell Bob, text me throughout the day.

128
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,240
And I'll come get you whenever they're ready to release you.

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,040
And so I go into work.

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,280
But just before I go into work, a thought

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,040
flashes through my mind.

132
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,640
And I say to the ER doc, you should check Bob's brain.

133
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,240
And the reason that thought flashed through my mind

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
is that, actually, I had been worrying about Bob

135
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,040
for a number of years.

136
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,280
And it hadn't quite registered consciously.

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,440
I hadn't was kind of too horrifying a thought for me

138
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,080
to really allow myself to realize

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
I was worried about Bob's brain.

140
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,600
But I was worried about a very particular thing.

141
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,360
And that is that Bob had been showing these weird signs

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,520
that he often got lost and didn't know where he was.

143
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
And on the one hand, this just didn't make any sense,

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,520
because he was fine in every other way.

145
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
But it was really pretty striking.

146
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,720
So one time, I was over at Bob's house

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,640
with some other friends of ours.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,600
And the friend asked Bob, how do I drive from your house

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,080
into Cambridge?

150
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,280
And Bob said, well, you go to the end of the driveway,

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
and you turn left.

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,600
My friend and I looked at each other like, Bob.

153
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,280
What?

154
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,680
And Bob thinks about it for a minute, yeah,

155
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
end of the driveway, turn left.

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,880
I just had this sinking feeling of dread

157
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,400
in the pit of my stomach.

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
But we sort of made light of it and made fun of it.

159
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
And it went by.

160
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
It was like, no, you turn right.

161
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,520
And we gave the directions.

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,440
Another time, a friend of mine was driving with Bob

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,400
in Bob's hometown.

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,800
And noticed that Bob didn't seem to know

165
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,080
how to get to the grocery store in his hometown, where

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,040
he'd lived for a really long time.

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,320
And a trip he'd made hundreds of times.

168
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Another time, I was at a conference in Germany.

169
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,720
And I saw these arrays of posters of people

170
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,600
presenting usually pretty dry scientific things.

171
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,440
And out of the corner of my eye, I see the title of a poster.

172
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,960
And it says, navigational deficits, colon, and early sign

173
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,400
of Alzheimer's.

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,280
And I saw that.

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,480
And I just thought, oh.

176
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,280
And I just kind of suppressed the thought.

177
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,960
And I thought, oh my god, Bob wasn't that old.

178
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,480
I know Alzheimer's can very rarely strike early.

179
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,960
I didn't want to think about it.

180
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,160
But it was like rattling around in the back of my consciousness.

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,240
So there had been these signs.

182
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,160
But as I say, they didn't make sense.

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Because Bob was holding down a very high-powered job.

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
He was writing beautiful prose.

185
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,240
He was the life of every party he was at.

186
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Witty, funny, everybody's favorite life of the party.

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,320
So how could that be?

188
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
It just didn't make sense that there would be anything

189
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,080
wrong with Bob's brain.

190
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,920
So I managed for a few years to notice these signs

191
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,080
and ignore them and not pay any attention.

192
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,160
So the killer thing is I should have known better.

193
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,240
My research for the last 20 years

194
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,200
has been on the very fact that there

195
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,760
are different parts of the brain that do different things.

196
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,040
And one of the corollaries of that

197
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
is you can have a problem with one of those parts,

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
and the other parts can work just fine.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
And so I, if anyone, should have realized, yes,

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,280
there's something really wrong with Bob's navigation

201
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,320
abilities.

202
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,520
And the fact that he's smart, and witty, and funny,

203
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,560
and holding down a high-powered job

204
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
doesn't mean there isn't something wrong with his brain,

205
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
with a part of his brain.

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,920
But I didn't realize that.

207
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,240
But then, as I'm leaving the ER, it kind of all clicked.

208
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,000
And I said to the ER doc, you better check his brain.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
I thought Bob was out of earshot when I said that.

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,680
He heard it.

211
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
He's like, what?

212
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,520
I was like, oh, never mind.

213
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,200
Anyway, the ER doc, with the kind of confidence

214
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,960
that only docs can muster, said, no, not a brain thing.

215
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,120
This is a hard thing, which wasn't exactly reassuring.

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,640
But I set aside the brain thought, and I went off to work.

217
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,440
So throughout the day, I texted with Bob a few times.

218
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
Things seemed to be fine.

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
They'd done more tests.

220
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,080
They weren't find anything.

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,040
We just got calmer and calmer about it.

222
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,880
I guess sometimes weird stuff happens,

223
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,160
and you just move on.

224
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,520
But then that night, around 7 or 8 at night,

225
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I was over at a friend's house, and the phone rang.

226
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,800
And it was Bob.

227
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,000
I picked it up, and Bob says, get over here.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
They found something in my brain.

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,720
So I ran out of the house, grabbed my phone,

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
and as I'm driving to the Mount Auburn ER,

231
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,360
I called my trusty lab tech, an amazing guy who

232
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,160
keeps track of all kinds of things much better than I do.

233
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,880
And I said, I remember that we scanned Bob a bunch of years

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,000
ago for a regular experiment in my lab.

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,080
And I don't remember.

236
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,280
The date, I don't remember anything about it,

237
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,440
but dig around in the files and see if you can figure it out.

238
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,360
It might be useful to have that scan.

239
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,360
So by the time I get to the ER, my lab tech

240
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,960
has already texted me back and said, found the scans.

241
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm putting them in a drop box for you.

242
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,600
So I go into the ER, and there's Bob in the ER doc.

243
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,840
And Bob says to me, do you want to see it?

244
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
The ER doc, the radiologist, has already

245
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,040
shown Bob the picture of his brain.

246
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,400
And so they take me in there, and I look at it, and I gulped.

247
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,960
There was a thing the size of a lime smack

248
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,080
in the middle of his brain.

249
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,480
Pretty terrifying.

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:42,400
So this lime in the middle of Bob's brain

251
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,440
was right next to a region that my lab had studied

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,680
in great detail.

253
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,720
In fact, my lab had discovered that a brain region,

254
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,240
right next to where that lime was located,

255
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,480
was specifically involved in navigation.

256
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,600
How could I not have put all this together,

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
but I didn't until that moment?

258
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,000
And I thought, of course.

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Of course, there's a thing in his brain,

260
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,920
right next to the perihippocampal place area, which

261
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,600
I discovered, and a nearby related region

262
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,360
called retrospective spoolyneal cortex.

263
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,400
Of course.

264
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,160
And how the hell could I not have known?

265
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,640
But I didn't know.

266
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,760
In that earlier work, it had been nearly 20 years ago,

267
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,280
I had a postdoc named Russell Epstein.

268
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,440
And Russell was a computer vision guy,

269
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,280
and he wanted to understand how we see by writing code

270
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
to duplicate the algorithms that he thought

271
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,040
go on in the human brain when we understand visual images.

272
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,760
And that's a very respectable, cool line of work, which

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,200
we'll learn a little bit about in here.

274
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,320
And Russell was really a coding guy.

275
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
At the time, we were just starting doing brain imaging.

276
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,720
But Russell was like poo-pooing at all.

277
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
It's like the flash in the pan.

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,920
It's going to go by.

279
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,760
It's trashy.

280
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
So you guys get nice blobs on the brain.

281
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm not having any of it.

282
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,040
And I kept saying, Russell, you need to get a job.

283
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Just do one experiment so you can show in your job talk

284
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,200
that you can do brain imaging.

285
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,520
It might help you.

286
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
You don't need to do a lot of it.

287
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,320
Just do one dumb experiment.

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Russell was interested in how we recognize scenes, not

289
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,800
just objects and faces and words,

290
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
but how do we know where we are?

291
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,680
And how do we recognize if the scene is a city or a beach

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,640
or whatever it is?

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,240
I said, OK, Russell, we'll just scan people,

294
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,280
looking at pictures of scenes, and looking

295
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,000
at other kinds of pictures.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,560
And we'll just kind of see if there's

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,280
any part of the brain that responds a lot to scenes.

298
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,000
It really was not well thought out.

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,960
This is not how you should do an experiment.

300
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,440
It shouldn't be based on political calculations, lack

301
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
of theory, any of the above.

302
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,360
But the fact is, that's why we did that experiment.

303
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Russell needed to be able to show a brain image

304
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,280
in his job talk, so we scanned some people looking at scenes.

305
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,360
And the results knocked our socks off.

306
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
We found a part of the brain that responds very selectively

307
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,800
when you look at images of scenes,

308
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
not when you look at faces, objects, words,

309
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,400
or pretty much anything else.

310
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,840
And so we'll learn more about that later in the course.

311
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,280
We called it the Parahippocampal Place Area,

312
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,240
and that launched a whole major line of work in my lab

313
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,160
and now dozens of other labs around the world.

314
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,720
So backtrack, we'd already found that region.

315
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,440
And here's this lime in my friend Bob's brain

316
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
sitting right next to the Parahippocampal Place Area.

317
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,920
So then I remembered, let's look at the scans from my lab

318
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,760
from a few years ago in Bob's brain.

319
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,360
And so I fiddled around and found,

320
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,400
managed to download the files.

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,680
And there it was.

322
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
You could see that same blob.

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But in the scans from a few years before, it was much smaller.

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,160
It was the size of a grape.

325
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,840
And so that told us a bunch of things.

326
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,720
Most importantly, it told us this thing is growing really

327
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
slowly.

328
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,360
And that was hugely important because brain tumors

329
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,960
are very bad news, and they usually grow really fast.

330
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,200
And the fact that it grew really slowly

331
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,240
told us that this was not one of the worst, most invasive,

332
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
most horrible ones.

333
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,920
It was clearly a problem.

334
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,360
It was big, but at least it wasn't growing hugely fast.

335
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,160
But how poignant that there it was in my own damn data,

336
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,800
and I hadn't seen it in my friend's brain.

337
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,320
Well, I'm not a radiologist.

338
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm a basic researcher, and I didn't look,

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,040
and I didn't see it.

340
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,840
So indeed, the next day, the docs told us

341
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,880
that they thought this was meningioma, not cancer,

342
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,000
who knew that you could have tumors that weren't cancer,

343
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,720
but you can.

344
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,040
And they still need to come out if they're big enough,

345
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
and that's very serious, but it's not

346
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,320
as bad as having a cancer in your brain.

347
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,080
So as we're collecting information,

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,040
the next day I'm hanging out in the hospital room,

349
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,960
and there was an amusing moment when one of the residents

350
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
came by, and he's taking the history

351
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,120
and asking all the basic questions.

352
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
And I said kind of sheepishly because you

353
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
don't want to seem like you know more than the residents.

354
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,920
And in fact, I didn't really know more,

355
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,840
but I just thought I'd provide a little information.

356
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,200
And I said, you know, he's actually

357
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
had symptoms for a bunch of years,

358
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,200
and there's a region of the brain nearby

359
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,680
that I've actually studied a little bit.

360
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,000
And the residents is like, we know who you are.

361
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,560
So much for my trying to stay under the radar.

362
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,320
That afternoon, I talked to a neurosurgeon friend of mine

363
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,440
because I figured, OK, we need advice.

364
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,640
We need help.

365
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,680
And the neurosurgeon friend said, quote,

366
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
it got branded in my brain.

367
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,200
She said, it is of paramount importance

368
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,520
that you find the best neurosurgeon.

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,800
It's the difference between whether Bob

370
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,000
dies on the table or goes on to live a normal life.

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,880
So this is the privileged part of the story.

372
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm not that well connected, but I'm a little bit connected.

373
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,280
And I kind of dug around and did what I could.

374
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,920
And we spent a couple of weeks, and we

375
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,760
found the best neurosurgeon.

376
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,440
And the night before the surgery,

377
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,880
Bob is staying over at my house because the surgery was

378
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,520
in a Boston hospital.

379
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
And I thought, you know, I've been dancing around this

380
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,600
for years, but now, like, it's all out in the open.

381
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,960
We know there's a problem, and I'm going to test him.

382
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,640
I'm going to find out what the hell is going on.

383
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,480
This is, after all, one of the basic forms of data

384
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,880
that we collected in my field.

385
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,720
That is testing people with problems in their brain

386
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,960
to try to figure out what things they can do

387
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,280
and what things they can't do.

388
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,560
It's a way of figuring out what the basic components

389
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,080
of the mind and brain are.

390
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,840
It's actually the oldest, most venerable method in our field,

391
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
and it's still a hugely important one.

392
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,280
So I thought, what the hell?

393
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,600
So I said, OK, Bob, draw me a sketch map of the floor

394
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,080
plan of your house.

395
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
And so Bob takes a few minutes, and he draws this thing.

396
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,640
And it was shocking.

397
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,240
There weren't even the rooms in a rectilinearly arranged house.

398
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,520
They weren't even aligned.

399
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,240
There was like a soup of lines.

400
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
There was no organization from one room to the next.

401
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,040
And Bob kind of realized this kind of isn't right, is it?

402
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,720
But he didn't know how to fix it.

403
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,480
And he said he just couldn't visualize what it looked like

404
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,680
to be in his house, and so he couldn't draw the floor plan.

405
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,120
And I thought, OK, he hasn't been there in a couple of days.

406
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,320
I gave him another piece of paper, and I said, OK,

407
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,000
draw the floor plan of my house, where you are right now.

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,800
And so Bob took a couple minutes and delivered a similar mess.

409
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,680
He couldn't even imagine the layout of the room next to him

410
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,280
that he'd been at, been in a few minutes before.

411
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
And then, trying to channel my inner neuropsychologist,

412
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
I thought, OK, gave him another piece of paper.

413
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,800
And I said, OK, Bob, draw a bicycle.

414
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
Why did I choose a bicycle?

415
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,520
Because it's a multi-part object that

416
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
has a bunch of different bits that

417
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,400
have a particular relationship to each other,

418
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,240
just as the rooms in a house have a particular spatial

419
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,680
relationship to each other.

420
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,160
And I wanted to know, is his problem specifically

421
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,640
about places, or is it about any complex multi-part thing

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,040
that you have to remember the relationships to?

423
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,520
Bob is no artist, to put it mildly,

424
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
but his bicycle was clearly recognizable as a bicycle.

425
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,840
It had the two wheels and the right relationship,

426
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,880
and it had all the basic parts in roughly the same,

427
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
the right place.

428
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,840
I then had him draw a lobster, another multi-part object,

429
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
and also his lobster was not beautiful,

430
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,040
but had everything in the right place.

431
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,600
And so that's very telling.

432
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,360
He had a specific problem in, I don't know, imagining,

433
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,680
reproducing, remembering.

434
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,480
It's not totally clear.

435
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
The arrangements of parts in a room,

436
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,680
but not the arrangements of parts in an object.

437
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,720
We'll get back to that more in a few weeks.

438
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,640
So what do I want to say here?

439
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,840
Is that all that?

440
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,040
So the next day, Bob has an 11-hour surgery,

441
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,680
major hardcore extreme neurosurgery.

442
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,040
Remove a huge piece of bone from the back of your head,

443
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,480
pull apart the hemispheres of the brain like this,

444
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,160
go in multiple inches, and remove a lime, like holy crap.

445
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,080
Said lime was right near the vein of Galen.

446
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
Galen lived, what, a couple thousand years ago.

447
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,360
The fact that there's a vein of Galen

448
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,680
means it's a big-ass vein, the kind of vein that even Galen

449
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,920
would have found with dissection 2,000 years ago.

450
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,680
This lime was all wrapped around and interleaved

451
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,000
with the vein of Galen.

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Not good.

453
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,520
But because we found the best neurosurgeon,

454
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,560
and because we have extreme privilege,

455
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,040
and all the possible medical resources and expertise

456
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,880
you could possibly hope for, Bob sailed through the surgery.

457
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,680
And an hour after the surgery, I'm chatting with him,

458
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
and he's making sense.

459
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,240
Amazing, right?

460
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,160
So literally, two days later, they sent him home.

461
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,880
And a few days after that, he's back at work, no problem.

462
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
Totally fine.

463
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,760
But now we get to the question you're probably thinking about.

464
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,880
What about his navigational abilities?

465
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,360
The sad answer is, nothing doing.

466
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,880
None of it came back at all.

467
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Thank God for iPhones.

468
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,040
If Bob lived 30 years ago, he wouldn't be able to function.

469
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,560
But he goes everywhere using his iPhone GPS, everywhere.

470
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,680
And this fact that he didn't recover his navigational

471
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,200
abilities is consistent with the whole literature that

472
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,840
we'll consider later in the course.

473
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,680
That often, not always, but often,

474
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,040
if you have brain damage, especially

475
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,960
to some of these very specialized circuits

476
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,520
that we'll talk about, you don't recover later.

477
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
If the damage is early, you may well recover.

478
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,160
Children have much more plastic brains

479
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,120
that can adjust after brain damage.

480
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Adults, not so good.

481
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,720
So Bob's doing fine.

482
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,560
That's my story.

483
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,120
Any thoughts or questions?

484
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Yeah?

485
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,640
He can tell the difference from the right to the left,

486
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
not on the left.

487
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes.

488
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
Yes.

489
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,840
And it's very interesting.

490
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
There are many of his spatial abilities,

491
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,200
that are absolutely intact.

492
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,600
And yet, the ones related to navigation are not.

493
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Yeah?

494
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah.

495
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Yeah.

496
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
No problem.

497
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
But he's always looking at his damn phone to get directions

498
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,200
or to listen to the GPS directions system.

499
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
So driving is no problem.

500
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
It's another kind of left-right.

501
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,920
The immediate spatial orientation abilities

502
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
are absolutely fine.

503
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
But knowing where am I now, I don't know.

504
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,360
Fine.

505
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,280
But knowing where am I now and how would I get there from here

506
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,920
is blitzed.

507
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,520
Other questions?

508
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Yeah?

509
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Can you recognize what familiar is?

510
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,200
Great question.

511
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,840
Yes.

512
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,080
He can recognize familiar places.

513
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,040
What he can't do is he can say, oh, right.

514
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,240
That's the front of our house.

515
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,040
Or that's such and such cafe that's near our house.

516
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,120
What he can't do is say, which way would you

517
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,840
turn from there to go home?

518
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,120
Great question.

519
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,960
Great question.

520
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,680
A little bit.

521
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,240
So he can navigate a little bit with his GPS.

522
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,120
And because he's learned certain routes

523
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,000
as a series of almost verbal commands,

524
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,120
like if you're here, turn right, then do, do, do, do,

525
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,760
like that whole kind of thing.

526
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,000
It's not what any of you guys could do.

527
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,760
If you guys are driving around in Cambridge

528
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,960
or walking around campus, remember

529
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,640
where they blocked off this whole middle of campus

530
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
a couple of years ago?

531
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
It was so irritating.

532
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,200
I would go there and it's like, oh, god.

533
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,080
They blocked it off.

534
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,440
I can't get over to lobby 7.

535
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Well, you immediately come up with an alternate route.

536
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
It's like, OK, I guess we're going to have to do this.

537
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
You come up with an alternate route.

538
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,560
This is what a normal navigation system can do.

539
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
Bob can't do that at all.

540
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,840
He's like, route blocked?

541
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,520
No idea.

542
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,800
Get out the phone, right?

543
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,300
Yeah?

544
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,580
Does he get at estimating distances?

545
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,940
Does he know something is a certain number of miles away?

546
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,740
Yes.

547
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,980
Yes, he is.

548
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,380
And that's very interesting.

549
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,460
But that seems to be kind of a different thing.

550
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,420
You could think about all the different kinds of cues

551
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,020
you have for distance beyond your kind of literal navigation

552
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
skills.

553
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Yeah?

554
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,380
Can you retrace the steps a couple of minutes after?

555
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,660
A little bit.

556
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
A couple minutes, yes.

557
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,820
The next day, I mean, it would be kind of like this thing.

558
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,460
It's like, you know, I vaguely remember that I was here.

559
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,820
I turned right, so I better do that again.

560
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
Yeah, did you have a question?

561
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,100
Can you navigate within buildings?

562
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,500
No, not very well.

563
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,580
And this is a problem, because iPhones don't usually.

564
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,460
So new hotels, big problem.

565
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,180
Finding the bathroom down the hall or the front door

566
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,300
in a hotel, big problem.

567
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,580
Yeah, I mean, you know, these are problems you can come up

568
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,340
with workarounds, but it's not life-threatening.

569
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,100
But it's extremely inconvenient.

570
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,020
Yeah?

571
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,900
So this is the case that those navigational skills

572
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,860
that he developed longer, a long time ago,

573
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,660
those are stronger.

574
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,580
So he has a harder time developing.

575
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,300
Sorry, I mean, so new hotels are a problem,

576
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,500
but if it's a fixie, it's more familiar like his home.

577
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
Is it easier for him to navigate?

578
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
It's a great question.

579
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,340
You might think that the kind of navigational maps

580
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,260
you laid down long ago would be intact.

581
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,380
So is it just that you can't learn new ones?

582
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,060
So it's a great question.

583
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,620
The answer is kind of complicated in this case.

584
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,020
For routes that he's memorized, there's

585
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,060
a whole different system for knowing a route

586
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,420
and really having an abstract knowledge of a place that

587
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,380
enables you to devise a new route if something

588
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,620
is blocked on that route.

589
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,660
So for highly over-learned routes, he's OK.

590
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,420
Like he remembers, like this you do.

591
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,220
It's like a sequence.

592
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,460
It's like a memorized motor sequence.

593
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,780
You do A, and then B, and then C, and then D.

594
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,900
So he's OK with those with routes he learned long ago.

595
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,500
But he is not good at coming up with a new route in a place

596
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,900
that he learned long ago.

597
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,300
All right.

598
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,340
We'll take one last question.

599
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Yeah?

600
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,820
Does he have conscious access to past knowledge

601
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,620
that he can't use in the case?

602
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,660
And does he have conscious knowledge that this is the case?

603
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,620
Can he, how does he specify that?

604
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,780
Oh, I'm having trouble figuring this out.

605
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,900
No, he knows.

606
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,820
Well, he knows, because when he tries to figure out

607
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,580
which way to head, he has no idea.

608
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,460
So he's extremely aware of it and very articulate

609
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,060
on precisely what happens.

610
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,300
And so what he says is, like, if he's looking at a place,

611
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
here's something he says.

612
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,860
He's looking at a place.

613
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,260
He knows where he is, because there's

614
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,820
all kinds of other bits of information

615
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,940
that tell you where you are, because you intended to go there

616
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,580
and the relevant things are happening and all this.

617
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,220
He knows where he is, and it looks familiar.

618
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,340
If he tries to imagine what's behind him,

619
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,420
he says that he, like, starts to get it,

620
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,180
and it just kind of vaporizes.

621
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,620
He just can't hang on to it.

622
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,420
He can't kind of construct a stable mental image

623
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,500
of nearby places.

624
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,060
So I don't know exactly what that means,

625
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,620
but he's very articulate and can report

626
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,140
what he experiences when he tries

627
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,100
to access this kind of information.

628
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,620
So what you guys, we'll go on, but what I want to say

629
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,540
is what you guys just did is exactly what we do in my field.

630
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,820
We try to take a mental ability and tease it apart

631
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,260
and say, is it exactly this or is it exactly that?

632
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,740
And you guys all just did it beautifully, right?

633
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,620
So a lot of what we do in my field is kind of,

634
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,660
this kind of common sense parsing of mental abilities.

635
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,500
What is a particular mental ability?

636
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,100
How does it relate to some other one?

637
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,300
Are these things separable?

638
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,220
Can you lose one and not the other?

639
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,100
Do they live in different parts of the brain, et cetera?

640
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
All right, so that's the story.

641
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,100
I'm gonna cash out some of the particular themes

642
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,540
that came out from this story

643
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
that we'll echo through this course.

644
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,060
And the first and most obvious one

645
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,460
is the brain isn't just a big bunch of mush, right?

646
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,460
It has structure, it has organization.

647
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,020
The different bits do different things, okay?

648
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,060
Importantly, when Bob had this big lime in his head,

649
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,540
he didn't just get a little bit stupid.

650
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,180
No, his IQ, if he'd take an IQ test, would be unchanged.

651
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,360
He lost a very specific mental ability, okay?

652
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,020
And that is fascinating,

653
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,860
but it's also good news for science

654
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,500
because often when you try to understand

655
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,100
a complicated thing, a great way to make progress

656
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,220
is to first figure out what the parts are

657
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,540
and then later try to figure out

658
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,160
how does each individual part work

659
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,660
and how do they work together?

660
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,900
But if there's part structure,

661
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,140
there's at least a place to start, okay?

662
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,860
Okay, second theme is that some parts of the brain

663
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
do extremely specific things, right?

664
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,180
Not all of them, some of them are quite general

665
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,720
and are engaged in lots of different mental processes,

666
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,760
but some are remarkably specific.

667
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
We'll talk a lot about that.

668
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,160
Third big theme, the organization of the brain

669
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,520
echoes the architecture of the mind, okay?

670
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,120
And I would say the fundamental pieces of the brain

671
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,640
are telling us what are fundamental parts of the mind.

672
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,120
And that's why I'm in this field.

673
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,360
That's what I think is cool.

674
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,040
You know, the brain is just like a bunch of cells,

675
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,080
like it's a physical thing.

676
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,740
Who cares about a physical thing?

677
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,780
The reason we care about it is that's where our mind lives.

678
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,140
And if we study that physical thing,

679
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,500
we can learn something about our minds.

680
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,180
And that's pretty cosmic, I think.

681
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,740
So the point of all of this kind of work is not to say,

682
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,380
oh, that mental process is here, not there.

683
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
Who cares?

684
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,060
I don't really care.

685
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,980
I mean, at some point you need to have a ballpark sense.

686
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
You need to know to study the things.

687
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,620
But the interesting question is not where these things

688
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,060
are in the brain, but which mental processes

689
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,380
have their own specialized machinery and why those?

690
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,020
Yeah.

691
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,460
Another important theme, how do brains change?

692
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,260
Bob didn't recover after his brain

693
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,740
damaged in that very particular mental function

694
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,580
that he lost.

695
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,500
If all of that had happened when he was five years old,

696
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,980
he probably would have.

697
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,180
So how do brains change over normal development?

698
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,140
How do they change from learning and experience?

699
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,780
How do they change after injury?

700
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,980
And the final theme echoed in that story

701
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,700
is there are lots and lots of different ways

702
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,820
to study the brain.

703
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,980
There are the simple behavioral observations.

704
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,300
Bob can't navigate, but he can do everything else.

705
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,100
OK, that's really deep and informative.

706
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,980
Low-tech, but really powerful.

707
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,340
The anatomical brain images that showed where the line was

708
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,300
in Bob's brain, that gives you another kind of information

709
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,340
where's the physical structure of the brain.

710
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,020
The functional images that we had done in my lab

711
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,780
to discover the parahippocampal place area.

712
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,020
And the studies of what mental abilities are preserved

713
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,460
in which are lost and people who have alterations

714
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,020
of their brain.

715
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,180
So those are just a few of the kinds of methods in our field,

716
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,620
each of which tells us about a different kind of thing

717
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,540
about the brain.

718
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,580
So those are the themes I was trying to get at here.

719
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,780
So let's move on to the why, how, and what

720
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,300
of exploring the brain.

721
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I'm going to assign the TAs to get me to shut up at,

722
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,460
let's see, are we're supposed to end at five minutes before the end

723
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
of class, is that right?

724
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,540
Is that MIT tradition?

725
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:20,340
OK, so at, oh my, shockingly soon, 11.45, you're going to know.

726
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,020
Oh, great, thank you.

727
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,580
Thank you.

728
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,980
This is one of the many things TAs are for.

729
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,900
They pick up the hundreds of typos and mindos and all

730
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,380
of that.

731
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,940
Excellent.

732
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,060
I'm thinking, how the hell did I so mis-timed this?

733
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,940
Thank you, Heather.

734
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,900
OK, good, we'll go on.

735
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,660
OK, why should we study the brain?

736
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,340
First most obvious reason, know thyself.

737
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,780
Know what this thing is that's operating in our heads.

738
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,340
This is who you are, right, is your brain.

739
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,900
There are lots of very fine and important organs in the body,

740
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,380
but the brain is special, right?

741
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,500
So a heart is important, you die without it,

742
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,860
but it's the brain that's your identity, right?

743
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,340
So there's a reason that surgeons do heart transplants.

744
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,140
That makes sense.

745
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,460
Something wrong with your heart, you need another heart, OK?

746
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,660
But why don't they do brain transplants?

747
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,420
That wouldn't make sense, right?

748
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,260
If there's something wrong with my brain,

749
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,740
it doesn't make sense to take someone else's brain

750
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,260
and put it in here, because then I'd be that other person.

751
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,540
It doesn't make sense, because the brain is who you are.

752
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,980
OK, so the brain is really special.

753
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,740
It's not just another organ.

754
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,780
That's why a few years ago we had the decade of the brain,

755
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,860
not the decade of the pancreas or the liver or the kidney, right?

756
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,100
People need to study these things.

757
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,060
They need to know how to fix them.

758
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,780
They're important, but they're not as cosmic as the brain, OK?

759
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:48,500
All right, second reason why we should understand brains,

760
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,220
and that is to understand the limits of human knowledge.

761
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,900
Like the more we understand about the human mind,

762
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,020
the more we can actually evaluate how good our knowledge is.

763
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,420
Are there things that we might not be able to think?

764
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,460
Possible true scientific theories,

765
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,220
we might not be able to understand ever?

766
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,900
You can think of studying the mind

767
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,580
as a kind of empirical epistemology,

768
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,060
a way to actually know about the knower

769
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,900
so we can figure out how good the knowledge is in that knower.

770
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,820
So that's another reason.

771
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,980
A third reason is to advance AI.

772
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,380
And so up until a few years ago, I

773
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,820
used to give lectures on vision,

774
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,460
and they would all start with some version of this.

775
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,540
You guys all have amazing visual abilities

776
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,620
in the back third of your brain that does vision.

777
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,300
You can do all this incredible stuff

778
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,540
that no machine can touch.

779
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
That's off to you.

780
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,300
You have an amazing visual system back here,

781
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,180
and those guys in AI, it is mostly guys, guys, gals, whatever,

782
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,580
those people in AI, could only dream

783
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,860
of coming up with algorithms as good as the one that's

784
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,300
running in the back of your head.

785
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,380
You can't quite start the lectures that way anymore.

786
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,020
So if any of you have been living in a cave

787
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,940
and not heard about deep nets, there's

788
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,380
been a massive revolution.

789
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,500
And all of a sudden, deep nets are

790
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,020
doing things that are really close to human abilities,

791
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
particularly in vision.

792
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,140
So for example, in visual object recognition,

793
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,180
machines were way far behind human vision

794
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,860
until very recently, especially when this paper here came out,

795
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,700
was published in 2012.

796
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,660
First author, Khrushchevsky, it has now

797
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,540
been cited an astonishing 33,000 times.

798
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,420
Actually, I made this slide a couple of weeks ago.

799
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,060
It's probably been cited 36,000 times by now.

800
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,660
You could look it up on Google Scholar and find out.

801
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,020
That is a huge number of citations.

802
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
The influence of this paper is ginormous.

803
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,220
Probably half of you have already heard about this paper.

804
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,180
Raise your hand if you've heard about this paper.

805
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,060
OK, all right.

806
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,420
Major big news.

807
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,220
So what's so important about this paper?

808
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,980
Well, they trained, as probably most of you know,

809
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,820
they trained a deep net on the over a million images

810
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,140
in ImageNet, a massive computer database of images.

811
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,340
And they basically taught it to do object recognition.

812
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,660
And it performed much more accurately

813
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,340
than any previous system, and it approaches human abilities.

814
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,380
So this is major, this is a radical change in the situation

815
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,140
that we were in five years ago.

816
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,780
So things have changed radically.

817
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,820
So just as an example, here's one

818
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,500
of the figures from that seminal paper.

819
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,260
So here is one of the images from ImageNet

820
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,500
that AlexNet, this trained network, was tested on.

821
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,460
And the correct answer, according to ImageNet,

822
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,260
is that that's a mite.

823
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,820
And here's what AlexNet says.

824
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,380
Its number one first answer is mite.

825
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,100
And its second, third, fourth answers

826
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,740
are black widow, cockroach, et cetera.

827
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,100
So pretty damn good.

828
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,980
The mite is even sticking off the edge of the frame,

829
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,060
and it gets it.

830
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,660
Containership, first choice, container ship, pretty good.

831
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,020
Second choice makes sense, lifeboat, not bad.

832
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,460
Look at that, motor scooter.

833
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,420
I can barely even see the motor scooter in there,

834
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,380
but AlexNet, awesome.

835
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,820
Leopard, awesome.

836
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,260
Even when AlexNet makes a mistake,

837
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,540
the mistake is totally understandable.

838
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,820
Like, according to ImageNet, that is a picture of a grill.

839
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,020
And AlexNet calls it a convertible.

840
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,700
I'm siding with AlexNet on this one over ImageNet.

841
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,100
This, the correct answer, is mushroom.

842
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,060
And AlexNet says agaric.

843
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,140
I had to look that up.

844
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,260
It's like a particular kind of mushroom.

845
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,220
This one's pretty funny.

846
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,700
ImageNet says that's pictures of cherry.

847
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,060
There's cherries in the foreground.

848
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,900
But AlexNet says dalmatian.

849
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,540
I'm siding with AlexNet on this.

850
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,580
And Madagascar, cat, et cetera.

851
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,260
So pretty amazing.

852
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,220
And nothing even close to this was possible before 2012.

853
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,580
So this is very recent history.

854
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,140
And it has totally shaken up the field in lots of ways.

855
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,740
And so that's been transformative,

856
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,620
not just for computer science, but it's also

857
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,260
been transformative for cognitive science and neuroscience.

858
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,260
Because now we have algorithms, like here's this deep net,

859
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,860
and it does this thing.

860
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,660
So that's a possible theory of how humans do it.

861
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,140
It's a possible computationally precise theory

862
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,460
of what's going on in here.

863
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,660
And we didn't used to have those.

864
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,820
And now we have those for a number of domains.

865
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,540
And that's shaking up the field.

866
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,220
There will be a whole lecture on deep nets

867
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,060
and how you can use them to think about minds and brains

868
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,660
toward the end of the course, guest lecture

869
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,100
by my postdoc, Katherine Dobbs.

870
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,420
And we'll hear more about that.

871
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,700
But let's first step back a second and say, OK,

872
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,660
do they really perform as well as humans,

873
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,700
even on just object recognition?

874
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,180
Well, what if we tested it on images, not in ImageNet?

875
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,180
ImageNet is a pretty good test, because these things,

876
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,900
as you can see, are highly variable.

877
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,820
They have backgrounds.

878
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,580
They're complicated.

879
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,300
They're real-world images.

880
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,500
But they were photographs taken by people in a particular way

881
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,780
with a particular goal.

882
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,780
And most of the photographs you take, you throw out,

883
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,500
they don't end up in ImageNet.

884
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,940
ImageNet is a weird little idiosyncratic subset

885
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,380
of the kind of visual experience that we have.

886
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,260
So would this really generalize?

887
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,100
So it so happens that Boris Katz and Andrei

888
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,380
Marbu across the street in Seasale

889
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,180
have been doing some very interesting studies.

890
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,260
This stuff isn't published yet, but I got their permission

891
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,420
to tell you about this cool stuff they're doing.

892
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,300
And they're saying, hey, let's test

893
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,180
AlexNet and other similar deep nets since then

894
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,420
on a more realistic, harder version of object recognition

895
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,060
that's more characteristic of what humans do.

896
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,700
And so they're generating this huge data set of stimuli

897
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,260
that they crowdsource.

898
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,980
And so people, workers on Mechanical Turk,

899
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,740
go on there and create images for them.

900
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,420
So they get instructions like, hold a object

901
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,540
in this particular location or at this angle

902
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,860
or move it here and send us the images.

903
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,340
So they are getting, I think, hundreds of thousands of images

904
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,740
to test this on.

905
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,700
And they're much more variable in the location

906
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,220
of the object in the image and its orientation and so forth.

907
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,500
So for example, you guys have no problem

908
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,820
telling what that thing is, but it's

909
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,340
a slightly atypical example.

910
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,580
Likewise, what's the object on the floor there?

911
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,260
You can tell what it is, but it's

912
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,540
slightly atypical example.

913
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,500
And so what Boris and Andre are finding

914
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,380
is that human performance is still pretty good

915
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,100
on these images.

916
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,900
But the deep nets are terrible at this stuff.

917
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,940
So ResNet, one of the more recent ones,

918
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,460
drops from 71% correct on ImageNet

919
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,220
to around 25% correct on these images.

920
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,980
And the other similar, fancy, more recent networks

921
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,860
do similarly badly.

922
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:50,820
So on the one hand, the deep nets are awesome and transformative.

923
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,300
No question about it.

924
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,460
But on the other hand, despite all the hype,

925
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,540
they're still not quite like human object recognition.

926
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,380
They're a whole lot closer than they used to be,

927
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,860
but they're not really there.

928
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,780
And more generally, what about harder problems

929
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,500
like image understanding, not just labeling and classification,

930
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,100
but understanding what's going on in image?

931
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,300
So you guys have probably seen image captioning bots.

932
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,540
There are lots of these around now.

933
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,340
This kind of hit the scene in 2016

934
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,380
when Google AI came out with a captioning algorithm.

935
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,020
And of course, right around the same time,

936
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,340
Microsoft had a captioning algorithm.

937
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,980
And let's see how they do.

938
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,180
So this is an example.

939
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,060
You give this algorithm this picture here,

940
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,620
and it says that's a dinosaur on top of a surfboard.

941
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,020
That's pretty damn good, right?

942
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,500
OK, wow.

943
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,340
Let's look more generally how well this thing works

944
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,500
at other examples.

945
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,980
It looks at this, and it says, that's

946
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,220
a group of people on the field playing football.

947
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,220
It's like, wow, OK.

948
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,060
A snow-covered field.

949
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,500
Pretty good.

950
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,700
Yu Xiuen and Ding Ning posing for a picture.

951
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,460
I don't know, but these things are very good at face recognition.

952
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,140
That's probably exactly those two people, right?

953
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,220
A car parked in a parking lot.

954
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,700
Pretty good.

955
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,140
A large ship in the water.

956
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,940
Pretty good.

957
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,180
A clock tower lit up at night.

958
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,060
Awesome, right?

959
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,580
A vintage photo of a pond.

960
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,020
Well, the vintage part, I don't know where the pond is.

961
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,260
There's a little water in there.

962
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,820
I don't know.

963
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,500
Not way off.

964
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,060
A group of people that are standing in the grass

965
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,180
near a bridge.

966
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,220
Not really.

967
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,580
There's grass.

968
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,700
There's a bridge, sort of.

969
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,020
There's people, but not really, right?

970
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,100
A group of people standing on top of a boat.

971
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,860
Definitely not.

972
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,020
A building with a cake.

973
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,500
What?

974
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,260
A person holding a cell phone.

975
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,900
Not.

976
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,260
A group of stuffed animals.

977
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,700
I love this one.

978
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,180
A necklace made of bananas.

979
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,620
Wow, we've really landed on Mars here.

980
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,180
A sign sitting on the grass.

981
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,300
Talk about missing the boat.

982
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,700
Now, look at this picture for a second.

983
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,300
Just figure out what's going on here.

984
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,780
Takes a couple seconds.

985
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,260
Everyone got it?

986
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,660
There's a lot going on here.

987
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,140
OK, so this algorithm says, I think

988
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,220
it's a group of people standing next to a man

989
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,660
in a suit and tie.

990
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,180
And the algorithm is correct, but the algorithm

991
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,100
has profoundly missed the boat.

992
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,500
So I'm channeling, actually I stole these slides

993
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,660
from Josh Tenenbaum, but let me channel him for a moment

994
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,460
and say what his big idea is, which I think

995
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,220
is really important.

996
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,460
And that is that both humans and deep nets

997
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,860
are very good at pattern recognition, pattern classification.

998
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,740
This is a cat, or a dog, or a car, or a toaster.

999
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,580
What they're not good at, what humans are good at,

1000
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,180
but the deep nets are not, is building models

1001
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,380
to understand the world.

1002
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,020
And so when you look at this picture,

1003
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,300
there are all kinds of things that

1004
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,940
are crucial for really understanding at a deep level

1005
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,620
what's going on in here.

1006
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,420
We need to know what some people here know,

1007
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,740
but the guy on the scale does not know.

1008
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,100
Namely, even if you don't recognize that that's James

1009
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,260
Comey, I think it is, here's Obama with his foot on the scale.

1010
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,260
You need to know that people find it embarrassing

1011
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,780
if they weigh too much.

1012
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,900
You need to know that he can't see that Obama's doing it.

1013
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,740
You need to know that they can see it, even though he can't.

1014
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,020
And that's kind of the essence of humor.

1015
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,980
There's just a whole universe of rich structural information

1016
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,140
going in here that is part of what it means

1017
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,300
to understand this picture.

1018
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,740
And no deep net is even close to doing that kind of thing.

1019
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,420
OK?

1020
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,740
So bottom line of all this is, or let me just go on more

1021
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,340
generally, AI systems can't navigate new situations,

1022
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,020
infer what others believe, use language to communicate,

1023
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,740
write poetry and music to express how they feel,

1024
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,780
or create math to build bridges, devices,

1025
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,020
and lifesaving medicines.

1026
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,300
That's a quote from our leader, Jim DeCarlo,

1027
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,020
head of this department, published and wired a year ago

1028
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,780
in a beautiful article on the limitations of deep nets.

1029
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,540
But more generally, the point is that, yes, AI is taking

1030
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,780
a massive leap now when we're right in the middle of it,

1031
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,380
and it's super exciting, and it's helpful to neuroscience

1032
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,700
and cognitive science.

1033
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,700
But AI has a lot to learn from us, too.

1034
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,340
A lot to learn from what's going on in here

1035
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,460
and how this thing works that those AI systems still

1036
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,220
can't touch.

1037
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,940
OK.

1038
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,340
So all of that was my third reason for studying.

1039
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,020
We're still in the Y. Are we studying the human brain?

1040
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,980
The fourth reason to study the human brain

1041
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,140
is the one most compelling to me,

1042
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,820
and that is that it is just simply the greatest intellectual

1043
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,220
quest of all time.

1044
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,300
We could fight about cosmology.

1045
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,340
I'm not going to fight with you about anything else.

1046
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,020
I don't think there's any contest.

1047
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,700
It's the greatest intellectual quest of all time.

1048
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
And that's why I'm in it, and that's why I hope

1049
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,020
it'll be fun for you.

1050
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,820
OK, that was the Y. How are we going

1051
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,660
to study the human brain?

1052
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,060
So here's this thing.

1053
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,740
How are we going to figure out how it works?

1054
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,020
It's kind of daunting.

1055
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,060
It's not totally obvious.

1056
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,580
The first thing to realize is that there

1057
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,420
are lots of levels of organization in this thing,

1058
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,620
and hence, lots of ways of studying it.

1059
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,100
We could look at molecules and their interactions,

1060
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,340
lots of people in this building do that.

1061
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,460
We could look at properties of individual neurons.

1062
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,780
We could look at circuits of neurons interacting

1063
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,500
with each other.

1064
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,620
We could look at entire brain regions

1065
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,340
and what their functions are.

1066
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,060
We could look at networks of multiple brain regions

1067
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,700
interacting with each other.

1068
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,980
And so all of those things are possible.

1069
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,860
But actually, what we're going to do in the course

1070
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,060
is none of those things in particular.

1071
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,860
Instead, we're going to ask a somewhat different question.

1072
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,340
And that question is, how does the brain give rise to the mind?

1073
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,420
And to understand that question, we're

1074
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,380
going to do more at this level and less at the upper levels.

1075
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,220
OK?

1076
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,980
So to answer this question, we need to start with the mind.

1077
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,380
We need to, if we're going to understand,

1078
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,420
how does this thing produce a mind,

1079
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,300
we need to first figure out, what is a mind?

1080
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,500
What do we know about minds?

1081
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,620
OK?

1082
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,140
And so we need to start with the various mental functions

1083
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,460
that minds carry out, things like perception, vision,

1084
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,900
hearing, aspects of cognition, like understanding language,

1085
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,580
thinking about people, thinking about things, et cetera.

1086
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,820
OK?

1087
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,740
And so for each mental function, what we're going to do in here

1088
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,060
is start by trying to understand how it works in minds,

1089
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,180
as well as we can, or what it is that we're

1090
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,460
trying to understand that minds can do.

1091
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,260
What is computed and how?

1092
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,220
And then we're going to look at its brain basis

1093
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,660
and try to figure out what we can

1094
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,140
figure out about how that mental function is implemented

1095
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,380
in a brain.

1096
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,140
So the first question we'll ask for all of these domains

1097
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,820
is, is there specialized machinery to do that thing?

1098
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,380
And then we'll ask, what information

1099
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,140
is represented in the relevant parts of the brain?

1100
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,060
And when is that information represented?

1101
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,220
OK?

1102
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,780
And how?

1103
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,500
OK, so how are we going to answer those questions?

1104
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,060
Well, there's lots and lots of methods in our field.

1105
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,860
OK?

1106
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,140
And so the first set of methods, if we want to understand minds,

1107
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,740
the first set of methods are the basic stuff

1108
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,900
of cognitive science, psychophysics.

1109
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,580
That means showing people visual stimuli

1110
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,420
or playing them sounds and asking them what they see or hear.

1111
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,700
Nice and low-tech, but lots has been learned from those methods.

1112
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,740
You collect reaction time and accuracy,

1113
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,660
and it's amazing how much you can learn

1114
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,620
from these methods that have been around for 100 years or more.

1115
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,580
Perceptual illusions are similarly very informative

1116
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,300
about how minds work.

1117
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,260
Now, let me say an important thing that arises here.

1118
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,220
Last year was the first time I taught this course,

1119
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,780
and I would say it went so-so.

1120
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm aiming for it to be much better this year.

1121
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,100
And one of the ways I'm trying to do that

1122
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,700
is to be responsive to the student evals I got last year,

1123
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,100
which were not fabulous across the board,

1124
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,380
hurt my feelings badly.

1125
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,180
But once I got over myself, I decided to just listen to them

1126
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,540
and try to fix it.

1127
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,300
And one way to fix it is to be honest with you today about what

1128
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,980
this course is going to cover.

1129
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:43,060
So in my evals, student 50458, bless them, offered this comment.

1130
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,180
This class was not sold in the correct way.

1131
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,660
It should not be called the human brain,

1132
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,020
because it was basically just a cognitive science not a brain

1133
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,520
class.

1134
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,480
I expected to learn very different material.

1135
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,040
So I don't know who the student is.

1136
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,120
I wish I could apologize to them, but I will say to you,

1137
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,720
sorry, student 50458, sorry to make that clear.

1138
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,920
The fundamental reason the brain is cool

1139
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,240
is that it gives rise to the mind.

1140
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,280
And that means that studying the biological properties

1141
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,680
of the brain without considering the mental functions

1142
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,440
it implements, it'd be kind of like trying

1143
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,320
to study the physical properties of a book

1144
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,480
without considering the meaning of its text.

1145
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,240
So we're going to spend a lot of time

1146
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,920
doing cognitive science in here.

1147
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,080
And if you had a different impression, sorry about that,

1148
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,040
but that's what we're doing here.

1149
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,040
OK?

1150
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,720
All right.

1151
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,160
So how are we going to answer this up?

1152
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,280
Lots of cognitive science.

1153
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,120
So how are we going to look at the brain basis?

1154
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,320
Well, we're going to look at neuropsychology patients,

1155
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,360
people like Bob, who have damage to the brain

1156
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,960
and what functions get preserved and lost.

1157
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,160
We'll look at a lot of studies with functional MRI,

1158
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,120
neurophysiology, where you can record

1159
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,040
from individual neurons in animal brains

1160
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,320
and in rare cases, even in human brains,

1161
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,920
under clinical situations where they

1162
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,720
need to have electrodes in their brain anyway for neurosurgery.

1163
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,800
We'll look at EEG, recorded from electrodes on the scalp.

1164
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,280
And MEG, recording from magnetic fields,

1165
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,360
from squids placed next to the scalp.

1166
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,160
We'll look at connectivity measures

1167
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,720
with a method called diffusion tractography, et cetera.

1168
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,760
So lots of methods.

1169
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,920
And so which mental functions will we cover?

1170
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,680
Well, to tell you about that, I need

1171
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,880
to tell you about the huge progress that

1172
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,480
has happened in our field in the last 20 years.

1173
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:28,880
OK?

1174
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,320
All of this is quite recent.

1175
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,640
And so let's back up to 1990.

1176
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,440
Here is approximately what we knew

1177
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,800
about the organization of the human brain in 1990.

1178
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,840
The black ovals are the bits that

1179
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,160
are primary sensory and motor regions

1180
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,800
that have been known for a long time, even by 1990.

1181
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,160
And the colored bits are the bits

1182
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,280
where we had some idea that face recognition might go on

1183
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,480
somewhere in the back end of the bottom of the right hemisphere

1184
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,160
because of people who had damage back there and lost

1185
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,760
their face recognition ability, sometimes preserving

1186
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,440
their ability to visually recognize words and scenes

1187
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,760
and objects, only losing their ability to recognize faces.

1188
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,080
OK?

1189
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,360
The language regions we had known about for nearly 200 years

1190
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,280
were Broca and Wernicke and others

1191
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,880
who had studied patients with damage in those regions

1192
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,920
and noted that they had problems with language function.

1193
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
And similarly, many people had reported

1194
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,640
that if you have damage up here in the prideelobes,

1195
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,520
you sometimes lose your ability to direct your attention

1196
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,720
to different places in the visual scene.

1197
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,720
So that was approximately what was known in 1990.

1198
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,280
And here's what we know now.

1199
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,040
We now know, thanks largely to functional MRI,

1200
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,440
that for dozens of regions in the brain, in every one of you,

1201
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,520
we have a pretty good idea of the function of that region.

1202
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,480
This is major progress, right?

1203
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,120
This is a kind of rough sketch of the organization

1204
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,320
of the human mind and brain that we have now

1205
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,400
that we didn't have 20 years ago.

1206
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,480
And that's awesome.

1207
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
And so that has made possible a lot of progress

1208
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,640
building with other methods.

1209
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,840
And so what we'll study in this course

1210
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,000
is we'll focus on those mental functions

1211
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,040
where the brain bases are best understood.

1212
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,000
And that will include things like the visual perception

1213
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,280
of color, shape, and motion, visual recognition

1214
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,040
of faces, places, bodies, and words, and scenes.

1215
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,800
Didn't make it on the slide.

1216
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,560
Oh, yes, it did.

1217
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,880
Perceiving scenes and navigating.

1218
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,200
Understanding numbers.

1219
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,720
Yes, there's a whole lot about the brain

1220
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,560
bases of understanding numbers.

1221
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,920
Perceiving speech and perceiving music.

1222
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,000
Understanding language.

1223
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,720
Understanding other people and their minds.

1224
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,280
So those are the kinds of topics

1225
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,840
where there's been a lot of progress recently

1226
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,600
in understanding the brain bases of those mental functions.

1227
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,840
And so those are the ones we'll focus on.

1228
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,120
And that means there's going to be a lot on perception,

1229
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,960
high level vision, and high level audition.

1230
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,200
Because that's one where a lot of progress has been made,

1231
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,080
and it's also a lot of the cortex, right?

1232
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,280
As I mentioned a moment ago, the whole back third of your brain

1233
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,760
does vision, construed broadly.

1234
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,160
And so some people might say, why

1235
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,400
should spend all this time in vision?

1236
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,200
Well, it's like a big part of what your brain does.

1237
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,720
We are very visual animals, so we'll

1238
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,000
spend a lot of time on vision.

1239
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,280
OK, and so for each of these functions,

1240
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,280
we will ask, to what extent is this mental function implemented

1241
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,600
in its own specialized brain machinery?

1242
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,480
Are there multiple different brain regions

1243
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,320
that carry out that function?

1244
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,480
What does each one do?

1245
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,840
Is there a division of labor between those different regions?

1246
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,720
How does that system arise in development?

1247
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,840
How does it have homologs in other species?

1248
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,440
Are these things uniquely human, or which of them are?

1249
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,240
And also, along the way, other side cool questions

1250
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,320
that will come up.

1251
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,000
What if anything is special about the human brain?

1252
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,440
How come we are taking over and largely destroying the planet?

1253
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,080
And other species are not, right?

1254
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,680
Besides destroying the planet, we're

1255
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,280
doing some other cool things, like inventing science

1256
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,840
and engineering and medicine and architecture and poetry

1257
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,880
and literature and all these other music,

1258
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,200
all these other awesome things that other species aren't doing.

1259
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,040
How come our brains are doing that and other species aren't?

1260
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,960
Where does knowledge come from?

1261
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
You guys know all this stuff.

1262
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,400
How much of that stuff was wired in at birth?

1263
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,160
And how much of it did you get from experience?

1264
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,960
How much can our minds and brains change over time?

1265
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,200
Can we go study a new thing and get a whole new brain

1266
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,280
region for that thing?

1267
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,000
Can we change the basic structure just by training

1268
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,960
or after brain damage?

1269
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,920
Can we think without language?

1270
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,640
How many of you have wondered about that question?

1271
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, really basic question.

1272
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,600
Anya's answering it.

1273
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,640
Anya and some others.

1274
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,720
But Anya's doing a lot to answer that question.

1275
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,040
There are actually empirical answers

1276
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,920
to these longstanding deep questions

1277
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,520
that everyone wonders about.

1278
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,120
That's pretty cool.

1279
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,680
Somebody back there asked a while ago about awareness.

1280
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,480
Can we think, perceive, understand without awareness?

1281
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,200
How much can go on, like in the basement of the brain,

1282
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,320
when we don't even know what's going on down there?

1283
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,000
We'll consider all of these other cool questions.

1284
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,600
OK.

1285
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,320
There's a bunch of things we won't cover in this course

1286
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,880
for various reasons that could have been in here and just

1287
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,280
aren't.

1288
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,720
There's only so much time.

1289
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,240
Motor control, it's really important

1290
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,880
to know how you do things like pick up

1291
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,240
objects and plan actions.

1292
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,200
And we're just not covering that.

1293
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,160
Something had to go.

1294
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,440
Subcortical function, this is a very corticocentric course.

1295
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,840
Most of the course will deal with the cortex.

1296
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,360
That's where most of conscious thinking and reasoning

1297
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,800
and cognition happens.

1298
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,920
There's a lot of good stuff down in the basement of the brain,

1299
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,600
and it's going to get pretty short shrift.

1300
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,440
Not for any good reason, just what it is.

1301
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,080
Decision making, important field,

1302
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,320
not getting much coverage in here.

1303
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,000
Importantly, circuit level mechanisms,

1304
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,320
explanations of cognition.

1305
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,800
If you think that we're going to understand not only what it

1306
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,880
means to understand the meaning of a sentence,

1307
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,840
but that I'm going to give you a wiring diagram of the neurons

1308
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,520
that implement that function, sorry to be

1309
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,720
the bearer of bad news, but nobody has a freaking clue

1310
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,480
how you could get a bunch of neurons

1311
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,800
to understand the meaning of a sentence.

1312
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,040
So that's exciting.

1313
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,240
That means there's a field for you guys to waltz into.

1314
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,720
And probably in your lifetimes, people

1315
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,200
will start to crack these things.

1316
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,760
But just to know what we're headed into,

1317
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,920
rarely, for almost no high-level mental functions,

1318
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
do we have anything like a wiring diagram level

1319
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,560
understanding of any perceptual or cognitive function.

1320
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,040
So that's not in the cards for this course,

1321
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,280
because it doesn't exist in the field.

1322
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,640
OK, for that kind of thing, there

1323
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,440
are cases where you can make progress.

1324
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,520
You can understand, say, fear conditioning in a mouse.

1325
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,720
Like, those circuits are being cracked wide open

1326
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,000
by people in this building, people all around the world

1327
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,080
with spectacular precision.

1328
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,160
They know the specific classes of neurons,

1329
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,400
their connectivity.

1330
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,120
They know every damn thing about them.

1331
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,960
But it's like, how does a mouse learn

1332
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,400
that this thing is to be afraid of this thing?

1333
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,560
OK, that's important.

1334
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,680
But for more complex aspects of cognition in humans,

1335
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,880
we can't usually have that kind of circuit level

1336
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,720
understanding.

1337
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,760
Lots of other things that will get short shrift.

1338
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,600
Memory, not for any good reason.

1339
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,080
I mean, there's a lot of coverage of memory in 900 and 901.

1340
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,440
And it's just somehow I've a blind spot for understanding.

1341
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,920
I've heard knowing how to talk interestingly about memory.

1342
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,960
So I'm not going to give you a boring lecture on memory.

1343
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,400
Instead, I'm not going to give you any lecture on memory

1344
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,480
till I learn how to talk about it interestingly.

1345
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,400
Reinforcement learning and reward systems,

1346
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,840
I'm going to try to pull some of that in.

1347
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,280
But it's not going to be a major focus,

1348
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,960
even though it's a really important part of cognition.

1349
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Attention, there might be some at the end.

1350
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,160
OK?

1351
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,280
OK, how many of you have taken 900?

1352
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,600
OK, looks like a little over a half.

1353
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,280
OK, how many have taken 901?

1354
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,400
Yeah, a little over a half.

1355
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,280
OK, good.

1356
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,120
So if you have great, good for you,

1357
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,680
this course is designed as a tier two course for people

1358
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,920
who have taken 900 or 901.

1359
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,120
If you haven't, you're probably OK,

1360
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,520
but you might need to do a little extra work.

1361
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,960
And so I've already posted online and in the syllabus

1362
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,960
information about actually a lecture I gave a year ago

1363
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,120
on some of the background stuff that is no longer taught

1364
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,680
in this course.

1365
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,920
People hated it when I taught them stuff they'd already

1366
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,640
encountered before, so I'm trying to minimize that.

1367
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,200
And so that's a backup for those of you

1368
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,400
who haven't taken these courses.

1369
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,840
If you're worried about this, chat with me afterwards.

1370
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,800
I think it will be OK.

1371
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Just count on doing a little bit of extra work, not much.

1372
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,120
OK, for those of us who have taken it,

1373
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,720
there's going to be a little bit of overlap.

1374
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,080
It's simply impossible to have zero overlap.

1375
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,080
I mean, what does John Gabrielli in 900 and Mark Baer in 901 do?

1376
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,720
They survey the whole broad field,

1377
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,400
and they pick the coolest stuff out of every little bit,

1378
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
and they teach it to you exactly as they should.

1379
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,480
But that means that when I come along and try to say,

1380
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,040
I'm going to do a more intensive coverage of the coolest

1381
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,640
things, there's going to be a teeny bit of overlap.

1382
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,200
But I'll try to not make it too much, OK?

1383
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,640
Just because the coolest stuff is the coolest stuff, right?

1384
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,480
Also, the spin and the goals of this course

1385
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,360
are quite different from both 900 and 901.

1386
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,400
You will have to memorize a few things, but not much.

1387
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,160
My real goal in this course is to have you understand things,

1388
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,560
not memorize a sea of disjointed facts, OK?

1389
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,280
So a little more on the goals.

1390
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,360
Really, what I want you to get out of this course

1391
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,760
is to appreciate the big questions in the field,

1392
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,680
and what is at stake theoretically in each.

1393
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,080
I want you to understand the methods

1394
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,640
in human cognitive neuroscience, what each one can tell you,

1395
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,480
what it can't, how different combinations of methods

1396
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,520
can work synergistically and complementarily

1397
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,800
to answer different facets of a question.

1398
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,680
I do want you to gain some actual knowledge

1399
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,320
about some of the domains of cognition,

1400
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,480
where we've learned a bunch, both at the cognitive level

1401
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,360
and the brain level.

1402
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,880
Things like face recognition, navigation, language

1403
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,160
understanding, music, stuff like that.

1404
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,880
And crucially, I want you guys to be

1405
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,000
able to read current papers in the field.

1406
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So if you look in the syllabus, the first few papers

1407
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,680
are like 20 years old, but it's going to accelerate quickly,

1408
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,440
and you'll be reading papers.

1409
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,840
I'm trying to choose mostly papers published in the last year

1410
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,520
or two, OK?

1411
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,600
I'm trying to take you straight to the cutting edge

1412
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,080
of the field, OK?

1413
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,840
Yeah?

1414
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,360
Are the papers going to be like people straight out of research

1415
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,200
labs, or are they going to be like the annual research labs?

1416
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,080
No, straight out of research labs.

1417
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,920
You're going to read the real deal, not someone else's

1418
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,760
blurry, they just read the abstracts

1419
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,520
and put in some stuff in the review article.

1420
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,720
No, you're going to read the actual paper.

1421
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,120
That's the whole deal, yep.

1422
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,000
OK, so those are the goals.

1423
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,320
Good?

1424
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,360
A few things, why no textbook?

1425
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,400
This field is moving too fast for a textbook,

1426
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,160
plus I have strong opinions, and I don't like any of the textbooks.

1427
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,440
So any textbook is out of date.

1428
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,080
We're going to be reading hot stuff that's hot off the press,

1429
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,440
and so there's no that's not in the textbooks yet,

1430
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,560
and so we're skipping that, and you're

1431
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,680
going to go straight to original research articles.

1432
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,240
So we'll be occasional review articles where relevant,

1433
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,240
but mostly part of the agenda of this course

1434
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,240
is to teach you to be not afraid of and able to read

1435
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,760
current articles in the field.

1436
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,800
All right, you've all been waiting for this.

1437
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,400
OK, details on the grading, pretty standard,

1438
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,920
midterm 25% of the class of the grade, final 25%.

1439
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,680
It will be cumulative, but weighted toward the second half.

1440
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,120
There's going to be a lot of reading and writing assignments.

1441
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,800
Approximately two papers to read per week,

1442
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,440
and for usually one of those papers per week,

1443
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,400
you will have a very short written assignment in which

1444
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,760
usually I ask a few simple questions and maybe one

1445
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,200
like paragraph level think question.

1446
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,320
The essence of these tasks is not the written assignment

1447
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,720
itself, the essence of the task is to understand the paper.

1448
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,800
If you've understood the paper as you read it,

1449
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,760
then you should be able to answer those questions

1450
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,880
pretty straightforwardly.

1451
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,760
And let me just say that understanding a scientific paper

1452
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,680
is not trivial.

1453
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,840
When I read a scientific paper right in my area

1454
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,080
where I have all of the background, it takes me hours.

1455
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,280
Hours.

1456
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,360
There may be five pages.

1457
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,360
It still takes me hours.

1458
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,800
It's just how it is.

1459
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,400
So when I assign a paper and you say, oh, it's only three pages.

1460
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,920
I could do that in 20 minutes.

1461
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,600
Oh, no, you can't.

1462
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,120
No, you can't.

1463
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,440
And that's part of what I want you to learn how to do

1464
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,800
is how to really read and understand the scientific

1465
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,680
paper, allocate the time it takes to really get it.

1466
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,440
So that's a big part of the agenda in this task.

1467
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,560
All the stuff, the assignments and the submission

1468
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,120
of the assignments will all happen on Stellar.

1469
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,120
Your first written response to a paper

1470
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,240
is due February 12 at 6 PM on Stellar.

1471
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,560
But there are other readings that are assigned before that.

1472
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,800
A note about the schedule.

1473
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,560
I struggled a lot trying to both have the assignments happen

1474
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,400
when you have already learned enough in lectures

1475
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,000
to know how to do it, but have it close enough

1476
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,280
to the topic at hand so it didn't seem like no longer relevant.

1477
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,000
That's hard to do both of those things.

1478
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,320
So the compromise is all of the assignments

1479
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,360
are due at 6 PM the night before the class in which they're

1480
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,200
assigned.

1481
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,240
And so if you see that it's assigned on the 13th,

1482
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,120
if it's listed on the lecture for the 13th, check carefully.

1483
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,560
It's probably due the night of the,

1484
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,920
I'm getting this wrong, the 12th, the night before.

1485
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,200
And that's so that we in the TAs can look at it,

1486
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,960
figure out what you understood, what you didn't,

1487
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,400
and how to incorporate and explain whatever you didn't

1488
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,840
get in the next lecture.

1489
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,800
All right, quizzes.

1490
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,960
I haven't done this before.

1491
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,760
No thing I'm going to try.

1492
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,360
There are going to be about eight of these.

1493
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,560
They're going to be very brief.

1494
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,880
They're going to happen at the end of class, in class.

1495
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,280
And you will do them on your computer or your iPhone

1496
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,400
using Google Forms.

1497
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
If anybody doesn't have a computer or an iPhone,

1498
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,520
they can bring to class the days of those quizzes.

1499
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,240
Let us know after class, and we'll come up with a solution.

1500
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,200
OK?

1501
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,640
And the idea of these is not to fish out an obscure fact that

1502
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,800
was in one of the reading assignments and ding you on it.

1503
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,760
Like, I'm not interested in that.

1504
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,120
The goal of this is just to keep you up to date,

1505
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,480
keep you doing the readings, keep you up with the material.

1506
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,360
And if you basically are understanding what you're

1507
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,520
reading and understanding the lecture material,

1508
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,280
maybe you glance at it briefly before you

1509
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,400
should do final inquisits.

1510
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
They're just kind of reality checks, right,

1511
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,440
for us to know what people are getting and not.

1512
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,920
OK?

1513
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,200
OK, first quiz is February 20th, blah, blah.

1514
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,240
There is one longer written assignment

1515
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,200
that is not due with the usual schedule of all the other things

1516
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,080
to do near the end.

1517
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,800
And in that one, you will actually

1518
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,080
design an experiment in a particular area.

1519
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,400
And that will be, I don't know yet, three to five pages,

1520
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,160
something like that.

1521
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,880
We'll give you more details on exactly how

1522
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,920
you want to organize this.

1523
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,960
And it will be very specific, like state

1524
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,760
your exact hypothesis, state your exact experimental design,

1525
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,320
et cetera.

1526
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,840
And you'll get practice with those things in advance.

1527
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,000
All right, so those are the grading and requirements.

1528
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,080
And you have this all in the syllabus in front of you.

1529
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,840
This is the lineup of topics.

1530
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,080
But very briefly, let me try to give you the arc of the class.

1531
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,920
So this is the introduction.

1532
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,080
Next time, we're going to do just a teeny bit of neuroanatomy.

1533
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,360
There will be a teeny bit of overlap with 900 and 901 there.

1534
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,080
I'm going to whip through it in very superficial form.

1535
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,120
I'm doing that largely because on the following class,

1536
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,240
we have an amazing privilege, which

1537
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,840
is that one of the greatest neuroscientists alive today,

1538
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,040
Anne Graybill, will be doing an actual brain dissection

1539
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,240
right here in this class, right in front of you.

1540
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,800
It's going to be awesome.

1541
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,880
I can't wait.

1542
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,160
It's an incredible privilege.

1543
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,920
It will be a real human brain, and you guys will be here

1544
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,520
with all her apparatus, and you guys

1545
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,080
will be clustered around.

1546
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,640
And if it's this many, God help us,

1547
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,120
but we'll figure out how to make it work.

1548
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,240
I may, let me just say, if there are listeners in here,

1549
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,280
I may have to tell listeners they can't come,

1550
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,680
because it's very sensitive about not having too many people.

1551
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,680
So stay tuned on that.

1552
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,840
I haven't quite decided yet.

1553
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,200
Depends how many people are taking the class.

1554
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,080
But it's going to be amazing.

1555
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,280
And I want to remind you of just some basics.

1556
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,600
So you're not asking her, like, what is the hippocampus?

1557
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,320
I know you should all know that, but we'll just do bare basics.

1558
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,760
OK, and then we'll have the dissection.

1559
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,720
That will be great.

1560
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,560
And also, another thing to say is,

1561
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,640
I mentioned that the subcortical regions are

1562
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,280
going to get short shrift in this class.

1563
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,760
That's true.

1564
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,040
But a lot of what you see in the dissection

1565
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,360
is the subcortical stuff, right?

1566
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,000
Cortex is great, but it kind of all looks the same.

1567
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
You kind of can't say, oh, that's this region.

1568
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,720
That's the other region.

1569
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,000
You can, but it doesn't look any different from any other region.

1570
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,360
So that's where the subcortical stuff will happen.

1571
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,800
OK, so then I'm going to do a couple of lectures

1572
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,000
that focus on high-level vision, perceiving motion and color

1573
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,920
and shape and faces and scenes and bodies and stuff like that.

1574
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,200
And we will use those both to teach you that content

1575
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,240
and also to teach you the vast array of methods

1576
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,800
in this field, OK?

1577
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,320
We will then have a lecture on the kind of debates

1578
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,680
about the organization of visual cortex in humans.

1579
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,040
I have a particular view.

1580
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,720
I'm very fond of views that some patches of cortex

1581
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,040
are very, very functionally specific.

1582
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,320
Not everyone believes that.

1583
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,840
So I have signed readings of people who have different views.

1584
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
And we will consider that.

1585
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,160
I will try to expose you to the alternate views

1586
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,480
and tell you why I'm teaching, why I still believe mine,

1587
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,520
but why other smart people believe different things, right?

1588
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,600
OK, we will then move up the system from perception.

1589
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,600
And we will spend two meetings talking about scene perception

1590
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,920
and navigation.

1591
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,320
You've got a hint about what an interesting area this is

1592
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,680
from the story of Bob.

1593
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,560
We'll consider more what we've learned

1594
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,160
from studies of patients with brain damage,

1595
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,320
from functional MRI, from physiology and animals,

1596
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,160
from cognitive science, from the whole glorious menagerie

1597
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,600
of methods, to understand navigation.

1598
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,040
It's a really fascinating area.

1599
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,800
In the two lectures after that, we'll consider development.

1600
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,440
How do you wire up a brain?

1601
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,120
How much is present at birth?

1602
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,960
What is specified in the genes?

1603
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,600
What is learned?

1604
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,960
And a lot of that will focus on the navigation system

1605
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,840
and the face system, simply because that's

1606
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,280
where there's a lot known.

1607
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,680
We'll consider some other things.

1608
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,840
But those are two areas where there's

1609
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,360
super exciting work from just the last three or four years.

1610
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,680
And so that's what we'll focus on there.

1611
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,120
I'm then going to do a lecture on brains in blind people.

1612
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,040
How are they different?

1613
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,080
How are they the same?

1614
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,680
What does that tell us?

1615
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,080
And then you have the midterm.

1616
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,320
Then we're going to move on and consider number.

1617
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,240
How do you instantly know that that's three fingers

1618
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,400
and that's two without having to do anything

1619
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,240
all that complicated?

1620
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,400
And if I had 25 fingers and held them up,

1621
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,840
you would immediately get a sense

1622
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,440
that it was about 25.

1623
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,200
You might not know if it was 22 or 28,

1624
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,640
but you would know it was about 25.

1625
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,240
And there are particular brain regions

1626
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,800
that compute that for you, and we will consider all of that.

1627
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,600
And there's a very rich array of information

1628
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,760
from studies of infant cognition, from animal behavior,

1629
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,640
from brain imaging, from brain damage,

1630
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,000
from single unit physiology, and from computation,

1631
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,160
all of which inform our understanding of number.

1632
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,280
Those are my favorite lectures, where

1633
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,640
we can take one domain of cognition

1634
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,800
and inform it with all of the methods.

1635
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,840
And numbers are a really great example.

1636
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,840
Then we'll talk a little bit about, well, what

1637
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,560
have my TAs said?

1638
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,600
Call it neuroeconomics.

1639
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,280
It will sound good.

1640
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,600
But actually, what I'm going to try to do

1641
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,840
is sort of neuroeconomics.

1642
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,960
But it will be about pleasure and pain and reward

1643
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,320
and how we think about those things.

1644
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,240
And then, that's down to April 3.

1645
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,680
Just as a side note, all of these things

1646
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,240
are things that are pretty similar between humans

1647
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,520
and at least primates.

1648
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,960
And some of them are shared with rodents.

1649
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,560
And most of the things after that

1650
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,280
are things that are really uniquely human.

1651
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,400
So we'll be really moving away with less available animal

1652
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,200
literature to inform the stuff we're looking at,

1653
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,120
because animals can't do these things.

1654
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,320
And so necessarily far from the details

1655
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,760
of individual neurons and circuits,

1656
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,000
but there's still lots cool that can

1657
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,240
be said about how you understand speech,

1658
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,040
how you appreciate music.

1659
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,200
There will be a guest lecture just for fun

1660
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,480
on Brain Machine Interface by Michael Cohen, who's

1661
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,160
working in my lab now and who has a great lecture on this topic.

1662
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,840
Then we'll spend a couple lectures on language,

1663
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,160
how you understand and produce language

1664
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,360
and what the relevant brain regions are,

1665
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,080
what we know about it from cognition

1666
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,360
and lots of other methods, and what

1667
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:08,360
the relationship is between language and thought.

1668
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,720
Then we'll think about how we think about other people.

1669
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,400
This is called theory of mind, how

1670
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,920
I can look out at this lecture and try to evaluate

1671
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,200
from your facial expression.

1672
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,840
Are they bored, sleepy, overworked, fascinated,

1673
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,400
excited, all of this kind of stuff

1674
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,080
that all of us do moment to moment in any conversation

1675
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,720
and that, yes, lectures are doing all the time,

1676
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,600
even if I know that you guys have too much work

1677
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,560
and that's why you're sleepy and I shouldn't take it personally.

1678
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,440
I'm still noticing.

1679
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,960
Anyway, then we'll go on and consider brain networks.

1680
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,800
So of course, brain function doesn't happen

1681
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,360
in just a single region, even if we spend a lot of time

1682
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,280
studying individual regions.

1683
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,080
There's considerable work trying to figure out

1684
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,800
which sets of regions work together

1685
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,240
and how could we discover that and what

1686
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,040
are those broader networks of brain regions.

1687
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,880
And then on May 6th, you will have

1688
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,600
turned in your longer written assignment

1689
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,880
designing your own experiment.

1690
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,440
And then on May 6th, we will work together

1691
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,160
in groups to refine those experiments

1692
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,000
and really hash out the details so you actually

1693
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,640
know how to design an experiment.

1694
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,200
And then we will have this guest lecture

1695
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,880
from my postdoc, Katharina Dobbs, on deep nets

1696
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,320
and what they can tell us about cognition and brains.

1697
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,680
And then we'll talk about attention awareness.

1698
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,040
And then I'm not totally sure what

1699
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,240
we're going to do in the last class,

1700
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,720
I'm voting for, is it the amazing TAs?

1701
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,600
Each give a short talk on the cool stuff they're doing.

1702
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,560
But that's under discussion.

1703
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,600
OK, that's the arc of the class.

1704
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,080
Questions?

1705
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:40,900
All clear?

1706
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,640
Great.

1707
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,040
Well, if I have five more minutes,

1708
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,840
maybe I'll do one other little thing.

1709
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,920
Let me try this.

1710
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,960
You asked, I'm going to try to learn everybody's names,

1711
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,920
but I'm not doing that yet.

1712
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,120
Because some of you might not show up

1713
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,840
and I will have wasted a whole piece of my brain

1714
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,920
encoding it now, just kidding.

1715
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
But anyway, I remember that you asked,

1716
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,240
you're going to read current papers.

1717
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,760
Yes, and you're right, it's daunting.

1718
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,680
But let me just say a little bit about how to read papers.

1719
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,760
This is not a stats course, and we haven't prerequisited stats.

1720
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,480
Neither is it a course on the physics of MRI.

1721
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,520
So there will be parts of every MRI paper

1722
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,120
that have a lot of gobbledygook.

1723
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,000
We scan with this scanning procedure.

1724
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,640
We use this kind of scanner, and this kind of blah, blah,

1725
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,080
blah, lots of gobbledygook.

1726
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,160
You guys don't need to worry about that.

1727
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,880
About the stats, it's kind of a judgment call.

1728
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,720
Everyone in here should have an idea of what a P level means.

1729
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,960
And I hope a sense of what a T test is and an ANOVA.

1730
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,280
If you don't, I should probably tell you that offline,

1731
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,680
because that's pretty basic.

1732
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,520
But what a correlation is.

1733
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,440
Beyond that, just use your intuitions about those things.

1734
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,680
And this is not a course about understanding

1735
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,520
the details of the stats in each experiment.

1736
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,600
It just isn't room to cover all that in the substance

1737
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,280
of the studies as well.

1738
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:03,440
So when you read a paper, for example, here's a paper,

1739
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,760
a very old paper, you come across this,

1740
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,640
and it's like, OK, here are all these words.

1741
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,880
And it goes on for 20 pages, and like, how do you even dig in?

1742
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,240
Well, the way to dig in is to start

1743
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,040
by saying, what question is being asked in this paper?

1744
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,800
If the paper is well written, you'll

1745
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,680
be able to find that in the abstract, blah, blah, blah,

1746
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,440
to study the effect of face inversion

1747
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,240
on the human fusiform face area.

1748
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,720
OK, we'll talk about that more later.

1749
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,560
But if you fish through the abstract,

1750
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,440
you should be able to find what question is being asked,

1751
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:35,280
and it's the first thing you should figure out about a paper.

1752
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,600
You don't necessarily read a paper,

1753
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,080
start beginning through the end.

1754
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,000
I think it's better to start with this list of questions

1755
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,280
in your head, and look for the answers to those questions.

1756
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,800
Second question, what do they find?

1757
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,120
If the abstract is well written,

1758
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,600
you can find that in the abstract as well.

1759
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,840
Signal intensity from the fusiform face area

1760
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,360
was reduced when grayscale faces were presented upside down.

1761
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,040
OK, kind of boring, but there it is.

1762
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,720
That's a finding of this paper.

1763
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,960
OK, what is the interpretation?

1764
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,840
Like, in other words, who cares?

1765
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,320
Like, who cares about this?

1766
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,480
OK, if you look in here in the abstract,

1767
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,680
FFA responds to faces per se, rather than to the low level

1768
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,040
features present in faces.

1769
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,880
OK, we'll talk more about what that means.

1770
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,240
You guys have an assignment about that,

1771
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,840
probably several assignments about that kind of question.

1772
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,880
Next question you want to ask yourself

1773
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,200
is, what is the design of this experiment?

1774
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,040
Often for this, you have to go beyond the abstract.

1775
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,840
And I should say, for even these earlier questions,

1776
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
sometimes you won't find them in the abstract.

1777
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,400
That just means the abstract is not well written.

1778
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,840
But that exists.

1779
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,240
OK, to get the design, like, what exactly did they do?

1780
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,280
Usually you have to fit in what exactly was done,

1781
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,440
and how were the data analyzed?

1782
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,800
You need to fish farther.

1783
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,880
You need to fish around other parts of the paper.

1784
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,920
And of course, all of those questions.

1785
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,760
OK, so I just said, OK, what question?

1786
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,360
And I circled this part.

1787
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,800
But there are many levels to what question.

1788
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,000
So you can get more on, why is that inverted question

1789
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,480
important?

1790
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,880
You look through, usually, in the introduction to the paper.

1791
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,440
Does the FFA respond to faces per se,

1792
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,400
or to a confounding visual feature, which

1793
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,640
tends to be present in faces?

1794
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,120
Second, is it true that inverted faces cannot engage

1795
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,320
face-specific mechanisms?

1796
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,080
Blah, blah, blah.

1797
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,720
So that gives you a little more background

1798
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,080
on what the question is, right?

1799
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,360
There are different levels and depths, OK?

1800
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,360
So these are all things you want to be looking for

1801
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,880
when you read a paper.

1802
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,880
What exactly was done?

1803
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,920
We measured MRI responses in the FFA

1804
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,640
to upright and inverted faces, right?

1805
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,960
I don't expect you to understand all this.

1806
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,280
You're just giving you schematically how you proceed

1807
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,720
when you're reading a paper, OK?

1808
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,480
More on the interpretation, or who cares, right?

1809
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,880
This result would show that face-specific mechanisms

1810
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,320
are engaged only or predominantly by upright faces,

1811
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
blah, blah, blah, right?

1812
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,040
You can fish through for those things.

1813
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,720
Point is to have those questions in your head

1814
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,360
when you read a paper, OK?

1815
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,520
It's much more easy and engaging to read something

1816
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,400
if you have an agenda when you read it.

1817
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,000
And so your agenda in reading scientific papers

1818
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,880
is to answer those questions for yourself, right?

1819
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,720
More stuff, what was the design and logic?

1820
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,120
Often that's deep in the methods.

1821
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,560
You have to fish around and find it.

1822
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,560
There will be some set of conditions and designs.

1823
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,520
We'll talk more about all this kind of stuff,

1824
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,600
what exactly was done, blah, blah, more details.

1825
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,600
And this is my example of the kind of gobbledygook

1826
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,960
that you can ignore, OK?

1827
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,160
So subjects were scanned on a 1 and 1 1⁄2 T scanner.

1828
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,400
And there are all these, like this here's

1829
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,000
the example of said gobbledygook.

1830
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,240
You can ignore this in this class, right?

1831
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,520
Every method will have different kinds of gobbledygook.

1832
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,880
This is MRI gobbledygook.

1833
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,080
You can ignore it, OK?

1834
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,960
It matters a lot, but not here, OK?

1835
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,360
What else?

1836
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,200
How are the data analyzed?

1837
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,480
If you look in the sometimes there's

1838
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,160
a data analysis section or a result section or a method

1839
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,120
section that will tell you, you can find that, figure it out,

1840
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,240
OK?

1841
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,240
What was the finding?

1842
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,520
Here's more on the finding.

1843
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,560
Again, you just fish through for these things.

1844
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,440
So the point is just, when you're reading a paper,

1845
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,760
it's not necessarily, what I do is I read the title,

1846
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,280
I read the abstract.

1847
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,400
And then I start answering those questions for myself.

1848
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,560
And sometimes at that point, I'm skipping to figures,

1849
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,200
I'm skipping to methods.

1850
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,480
Any of that is fine, OK?

1851
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,160
So don't feel like you need to understand each word, especially

1852
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,480
deep in the methods.

1853
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,520
I don't know, is that helpful at all?

1854
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,480
We'll try it, and you guys will give me feedback.

1855
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,480
And if it works, great.

1856
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,200
And if not, we'll do more on how to read papers.

1857
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,640
All right, it's 12.25.

1858
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,800
See you on Monday.
