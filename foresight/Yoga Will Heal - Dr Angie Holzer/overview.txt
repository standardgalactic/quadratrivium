1. Genes do not directly cause mental health conditions; they are influenced by the environment. Genes can be turned on and off by environmental factors, which affect how development occurs.

2. A significant cause of both physical and mental illness is a loss of authenticity, which can be an adaptive response to an abnormal or traumatic early environment. This disconnection from oneself can lead to stress and distress.

3. Health is associated with wholeness, and the capacity for healing is inherent in all of us as organisms. It is a fundamental part of our nature that can be obscured but never destroyed.

4. Trauma refers to the psychological and emotional impact of an event on an individual, not just the event itself. Healing from trauma is possible because it is not a fixed state but a response to what happened to us.

5. The messages or beliefs we internalize from our environment, such as feelings of unworthiness or the need to constantly prove ourselves, are not inherent truths but rather conclusions drawn from past experiences. These messages can be re-evaluated and changed as we understand they were adaptive responses to trauma at a time when we felt helpless.

6. Healing involves reconnecting with our authentic self, which may have been suppressed due to past trauma. By doing so, we can address the imprints and residues of what happened to us and move towards a state of wholeness and health.
