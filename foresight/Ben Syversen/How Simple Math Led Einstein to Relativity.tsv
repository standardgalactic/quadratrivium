0	7000	On November 7, 1919, Albert Einstein became a household name seemingly overnight when
7000	13160	data collected during a solar eclipse matched the predictions of his theory of general relativity.
13160	20120	The stars in the sky, those eternal points of light, they had moved precisely how he
20120	23560	said they would, and it changed physics forever.
23560	27720	Einstein's crowning achievement came after years of false starts and failures, but he
27720	32160	had started with the same methods that he used to reach his other great breakthroughs,
32160	36880	dreaming up elegant thought experiments based around a few simple assumptions, uniting
36880	40680	ancient mathematical methods with cutting-edge science.
40680	45240	This approach cut to the core of who Einstein had been since childhood.
45240	49000	At 12 years old, he had a taste of this creative problem-solving.
49000	55240	His uncle showed him a 4,000-year-old formula, and by using intuition and visual logic, Einstein
55240	57640	found his own proof of the theorem.
57640	62120	What he didn't know at the time was that this ancient math formula and the methods
62120	67320	that he used to make his argument would later lead him to shake the very foundations of
67320	74080	what mankind thought it knew about the universe.
74080	78800	This magazine from 1949 has an essay that Einstein wrote when he was 67.
78800	80480	He'd had a momentous life.
80480	85560	He talks about his great discoveries, but he actually starts with memories from childhood.
85560	89680	And the things that stuck with him tell us something fundamental about how Einstein saw
89680	94560	the world as an adult and the methods that he used to reach his great breakthroughs.
94560	98720	One of these moments came when he was 12, and his uncle Jacob showed him the Pythagorean
98720	100320	theorem for the first time.
100320	101880	You might remember this from school.
101880	106080	If you take a right triangle and label the two smaller sides A and B, and the bigger
106080	111600	side C, then this equation says that the sum of the squares of the two smaller lengths
111680	116480	we can draw actual squares to visualize that is equal to the square of the larger length.
116480	120480	In other words, A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
120480	123600	This is a bedrock formula for nearly all of math.
123600	127880	It's named for Pythagoras of Samos, an ancient Greek mathematician, but it was discovered
127880	132120	separately by a number of different cultures throughout history, and it was known for at
132120	134960	least a thousand years before Pythagoras.
134960	139600	These days we still use it all the time because it's such a fundamental way to calculate distance.
139600	144120	The same basic formula even works for three dimensions, and one of Einstein's great theories
144120	149120	is mathematically represented by a modified four-dimensional version of this formula.
153120	157320	Once Einstein learned this formula from his uncle, he wanted to show that it was true.
157320	162480	In his essay, he writes that, after much effort, I succeeded in proving this theorem on the
162480	165440	basis of the similarity of triangles.
165440	170720	Einstein never publicly described this proof himself, but he supposedly showed it to one
170720	176720	of his assistants years later, and the story made its way into this book from 1991.
176720	179800	So let's imagine what this would look like to a 12-year-old Einstein.
179800	183360	Einstein always had a knack for describing things visually, and this early example is
183360	184360	no different.
184360	188240	The goal here would be to show that the two smaller squares somehow fit together and take
188240	191560	up the same amount of area as the larger square.
191560	194240	There's a sense of proportionality to this figure.
194240	198000	Different parts look like scaled up or down versions of other parts.
198000	200240	And that ends up being the key to the whole thing.
200240	204480	Einstein found two different types of proportionality that he was able to bring together into his
204480	205480	final explanation.
205480	207040	Here's the first.
207040	210440	Instead of trying to fit these little squares inside of the biggest square, why don't we
210440	211680	just cut them?
211680	214800	If I cut them all in half, then I get three triangles.
214800	219000	Since I just halved everything, finding a way to fit the two smaller triangles inside
219000	222600	the big one would be equivalent to our original problem.
222600	225240	If I wanted to, I could even cut them in half again.
225240	228160	Now each triangle is a quarter of the original size.
228160	233520	But since everything is still proportional, I can still get back to my original squares
233520	236240	just by multiplying everything by four.
236240	240120	By this logic, I could cut the squares into any shape I want, as long as it's still
240120	243600	a scaled copy of the same shape in each square.
243600	246440	If I wanted to, I could cut them into rubber duckies.
246440	250680	I wouldn't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square my ducky is, but I could
250680	254760	say that I'm multiplying everything by some number D for ducky.
254760	259680	Again, if I can show that the two smaller duckies fit inside the bigger ducky, then
259680	261440	I'd be good to go.
261440	265680	But cutting the squares into duckies, it doesn't actually make our job any easier.
265680	270880	So Einstein also recognized a second type of proportionality in this figure.
270880	273760	He drew a single line down the middle of the triangle.
273760	279680	Now he has two new smaller triangles that are themselves, each proportional to the original.
279680	283360	We know for sure that they're proportional, because first of all, all three of them have
283360	284760	90 degree angles.
284760	288760	We can also see that the triangle on the left shares one of its angles with the original
288760	293200	big triangle, and the triangle on the right shares one of its angles with the big triangle
293200	294200	too.
294200	297400	In each case, we have two pairs of congruent angles.
297400	302120	So we know that the third angle also has to be congruent, because the sum of the angles
302120	305720	inside of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
305720	310260	If all three of these triangles are proportional, well, going back to the first idea, that would
310260	314200	mean that I'm allowed to cut them into my squares.
314200	318880	Once again, I don't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square they are.
318880	322440	That would be different depending on the exact shape of my right triangle.
322440	327520	But I could say that I multiply by a number T for triangle in the same way that I multiplied
327520	330280	by D for my rubber ducky shape.
330280	334840	So now, all I would have to do would be to show that the area of the two small triangles
334840	337280	adds up to the area of the big triangle.
337280	340420	And of course we know that's true, because that's where we started.
340420	345960	So since T times a squared plus T times b squared equals T times c squared, it's also
345960	351240	true that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
351240	353760	This must have been an exciting thing for 12 year old Einstein.
353760	357360	By just scaling something proportionally, and then cutting the shapes up and putting
357360	362120	the pieces together again like a puzzle, he's shown with certainty that this thing is true.
362120	366760	What he was going to learn just a little later was that he was actually using a loose version
366760	370960	of something called the axiomatic method, which is thousands of years old.
370960	375800	The idea is that we start with a few basic concepts that we accept to be true, called
375800	381060	axioms or postulates, and then we build on top of them brick by logical brick.
381060	384200	We have these basic, basic axioms.
384200	388560	And if you believe these basic axioms by pure logic, you can construct these amazing facts
388560	392680	that you're like, really, that's true, and you're like, here's why.
392680	398280	Here's the completely rigorous sequence of logical steps that will convince you that
398280	400480	this fact is true.
400480	406040	In Einstein's case, he wrote that it seemed to me evident that the relations of the sides
406040	411040	of the right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of the acute
411040	412720	angles.
412720	417920	Something which did not in similar fashion seem to be evident appeared to me to be in
417920	419960	need of any proof at all.
419960	424320	It sounds like he accepted some of what he just described about proportionality as being
424320	427760	true without proof and then built his argument from there.
427760	431600	Soon, Einstein was given a book of Euclidean geometry.
431600	436440	Seeing page after page of this axiomatic method in action was such a revelation that
436440	440320	he called the book holy when he remembered it years later.
440320	445780	This idea of using the axiomatic method to discover new knowledge and the sense of trying
445780	451080	to get to the most fundamental understanding of things were like guiding lights for Einstein
451080	455200	for many years to come.
455200	458840	Einstein always had a talent for math and science, but when he was young, following
458840	463400	his curiosity, took priority over pleasing his teachers.
463400	468160	He'd push back against his teachers at his regimented German high school and by college,
468160	470680	he would often skip math class altogether.
470680	474880	To pass his college math tests, he'd copy notes from his friend Marcel Grossman.
474880	479200	One of his professors at the time, Hermann Mankowski, later remembered that Einstein
479200	481680	was like a lazy dog in his class.
481680	486240	After Einstein learned calculus as a teenager, I get the sense that he kind of said what
486240	489440	I hear a lot of other students say, which is, when am I ever going to use this math
489440	490840	again in my life?
490840	495840	As far as those classes that Einstein didn't think were worth his time, differential equations,
495840	500640	geometry of numbers, and others, he was at least partly right.
500640	505060	In just a few years, Einstein would completely change the world without really using that
505060	508040	math that he was supposed to have learned in college.
508040	513860	But before long, he once again crossed paths with both Mankowski and Grossman and finally
513860	519160	come to appreciate the power of this advanced math that he had previously ignored.
519160	524240	Much later, Einstein wrote that, it was not clear to me as a student that a more profound
524240	529520	knowledge of the basic principles of physics was tied up with the most intricate mathematical
529520	530880	methods.
530880	536280	By the time Einstein graduated college in August of 1900, he was ranked fourth out of
536280	539240	a class of five people.
539240	541240	After college, Einstein struggled.
541240	545640	He spent a couple of years failing to get a job and also failing to write a science
545640	548280	paper good enough to earn him his PhD.
548280	553640	But in 1902, Grossman got his dad to call in a favor and help Einstein get a job as
553680	558080	a clerk at the lowest level of the Swiss Patent Office.
558080	562120	The job was boring and the hours made it so that Einstein couldn't get to the library
562120	564880	before it closed to do research.
564880	571520	But by 1905, practically out of nowhere, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including
571520	576320	one that's considered the origin of quantum physics and another on what's now known
576320	578820	as special relativity.
578820	584220	These papers, taken together, form the basis of modern physics and 1905 has come to be
584220	587260	known as Einstein's Miracle Year.
587260	589420	But these were not like typical physics papers.
589420	594100	For starters, Einstein didn't base his arguments on any experiments or even really cite much
594100	596060	of anybody else's work.
596060	600020	And not only that, the math didn't really go above a high school level.
600020	604140	Instead, he relied on the approach that he was so excited to discover back when he was
604140	607140	12, the axiomatic method.
607860	612420	In his paper on special relativity, after pointing out a puzzling contradiction in the
612420	616900	current science of electromagnetism, he makes his argument for a solution.
616900	623060	First, he proposes two ideas that he says he's going to accept as postulates or axioms.
623060	627980	From there, he writes a logical argument that leads to a radical rethinking of concepts
627980	632900	like time and distance, upending what had been accepted as fundamental laws of physics
632900	635300	since the time of Isaac Newton.
635300	640540	His first axiom was that the same physical laws apply to any frame of reference, including
640540	643380	the laws of optics and electricity.
643380	647540	In other words, there's no experiment that you could do that would let you make a distinction
647540	651860	between being at rest and being in perfectly uniform motion.
651860	655380	If you're flying in an airplane with the window shades down, pretend that we can't
655380	659420	hear the engine, then there's literally no difference between your state of motion when
659420	663660	the plane is flying and a different state of motion, for example, when the plane is
663660	665020	sitting on the tarmac.
665020	669100	By this logic, there's no such thing as absolute rest.
669100	674740	All we can do is talk about different objects moving relative to different reference points.
674740	678220	His second axiom seems like it contradicts the first.
678220	682740	It says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all frames of reference.
682740	687140	In other words, no matter how fast you're moving, it'll always look like a light beam
687140	690020	is traveling at the exact same speed.
690020	693340	Building on these two axioms, he goes through a thought experiment involving a series of
693340	696700	logical steps for measuring time and distance.
696700	700140	By the end, he's made the case for some pretty wild things.
700140	704220	He says that when you travel close to the speed of light, your length contracts in the
704220	710500	direction of your motion and time moves more slowly as measured by an outside observer.
710500	716420	Not only that, but the apparent fact of two events happening simultaneously is not absolute
716420	720300	and instead depends on the state of motion of the observer.
720300	724660	This leads to all kinds of surprising results and apparent paradoxes.
724660	729460	The YouTube channel Floathead Physics has made a whole series of great videos explaining
729460	733180	some of these results of special relativity.
733180	735340	Surprising things like what's known as the Twin's Paradox.
735340	742980	I'll put a link in the description to a few of my favorites.
742980	746900	It's fair to say that the ideas in these papers were completely revolutionary.
746900	750620	Even though there were other people thinking about this stuff, nobody else was radical
750620	755380	enough to take them all the way to their logical conclusions and throw out so much of what
755380	759020	they thought they knew about the universe in the process.
759020	764700	For example, Arie Poincaré, one of the titans of late 19th century math and physics, questioned
764700	769380	the absolute nature of time and made important steps towards special relativity before Einstein
769380	770380	did.
770380	775180	But even by the time of his death in 1912, he still hadn't come around to Einstein's
775180	782020	full theory of special relativity, insisting instead that absolute rest and absolute simultaneity
782020	787240	did exist relative to an undetectable cosmic substance known as the aether.
787240	790780	After Einstein published these papers, his life didn't change much.
790780	795300	It still took him three more years to get a university job, but gradually, some influential
795300	799100	thinkers picked up on his work and started building on his theories.
799100	803420	One person who took special relativity and ran with it was none other than Einstein's
803540	806180	old math teacher, Hermann Minkowski.
806180	811140	Minkowski found a way to connect Einstein's ideas to formal mathematics through the concept
811140	813500	of a four-dimensional spacetime.
813500	814500	So what's a distance?
814500	815740	A distance is a sum of squares.
815740	819300	Because of the Pythagorean theorem, a distance is a sum of squares.
819300	822740	So let's say we have three variables, x, y, and z.
822740	826060	And what we're used to is, if I have some point out here, I can express it in some number
826060	828900	of x's, some number of y's, and some number of z's.
828900	830900	And that'll find me this point in space.
830900	834820	If we square those three values, add them together, and then take the square root of
834820	839620	the sum, then we'd be using the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting
839620	840780	point.
840780	844460	And then Minkowski comes along and says, OK, but here's a way to make spacetime work.
844460	850340	When you add that extra dimension of time, you sum the squares of the space dimensions
850340	854680	and you subtract a square of the time dimension to measure distance.
854680	857580	It makes special relativity into a geometric space.
857580	862300	Minkowski's new system allowed him to mathematically model the predictions of special relativity,
862300	866780	where the behavior of light forms the boundary for the possible motion of all other objects
866780	868300	in the universe.
868300	873180	Since what we're describing as distance now includes the measurement of time, this value
873180	877080	is often referred to as a spacetime interval.
877080	883340	The geometry that special relativity predicts is the geometry that's of the cone where
883340	885420	the distances are all zero.
885420	890020	Let's make an analogy to three dimensions so we can see why this forms a cone.
890020	896100	The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals the distance
896100	897100	squared.
897100	902860	But what happens if we describe light's behavior by making the z dimension negative and the
902860	904700	distance equal to zero?
904700	909460	Well, now we can move things around to get x squared plus y squared equals z squared.
909460	913680	We can think of this as all the points on x and y that are a distance z from the origin.
913680	915960	In other words, it's the points on a circle.
915960	919640	So when z gets bigger, the circle gets bigger, and when it gets smaller, the circle gets
919640	920640	smaller.
920640	926280	What we end up with is a cone where the edges make a 45 degree angle with the z axis.
926280	930880	So Einstein's special relativity, again, we start with the axiom that the speed of light
930880	936600	is constant, and we derive all these crazy things about time and distance and so on.
936600	943760	When Minkowski says, you can realize those things by placing them in this geometry where
943760	947440	you get to subtract one of the squares when you're computing distances.
947440	952320	This formula gives a geometric interpretation of what's known as Lorenz transformations,
952320	956920	the equations that allow you to calculate the changes to time and distance that occur
956920	960080	for an object moving close to the speed of light.
960080	964960	The motion of a photon of light always has a space-time interval equal to zero, while
964960	970440	any other object moving below the speed of light has a non-zero space-time interval,
970440	975160	which all inertial observers will measure as being the same value.
975160	981200	It's this one cone, and he's saying the whole world lives in this cone, space-time.
981200	983320	Einstein initially did not like this idea.
983320	987920	He called it superfluous erudition, and said that since the mathematicians have grabbed
987920	992920	hold of the relativity theory, I no longer understand it myself.
992920	996960	Einstein thought this fancy new math obscured the beautiful physics.
996960	1001840	But Minkowski's explanation of the four-dimensional cone wasn't just fancy math for the sake
1001840	1003520	of being complicated.
1003520	1007760	It actually unlocked new conclusions from special relativity that weren't apparent
1007760	1009760	in Einstein's original version.
1009760	1015080	In the end, the idea of space-time has become so closely associated with special relativity
1015080	1020200	that people mistakenly assume that it came from Einstein himself.
1020200	1024080	Einstein would eventually realize just how much he needed this fancy math to keep developing
1024080	1029520	his relativity theories, because special relativity had a fundamental limitation.
1029520	1034760	It only described completely uniform motion, so Einstein still needed a way to talk about
1034760	1037600	things like acceleration and rotation.
1037600	1042080	Not only that, but there was an even bigger problem with Newton's laws of gravity.
1042080	1046640	You have two objects with two masses, there's a universal gravitational constant, and they
1046640	1047640	pull each other.
1047640	1054840	The force that one exerts on the other is inverse distance squared, this is the inverse
1054840	1056000	square law.
1056000	1062560	But then special theory of relativity says distance is not absolute.
1062560	1068080	Oh crap, we have a huge problem.
1068080	1073520	How do we do gravity if distance is in the eye of the beholder?
1073600	1077880	Because distance is measured by time, and there's this duality between time and distance.
1077880	1085600	And so can it be that the force acting on this thing depends on where you're standing
1085600	1087240	and looking at them?
1087240	1093120	So this is the sort of thing that Einstein's special theory breaks.
1093120	1094120	It breaks gravity.
1094120	1098240	This was when Einstein came upon what he later called the happiest thought of his life.
1098240	1101840	He imagined a painter falling from the side of a building.
1101840	1106160	While the man is in free fall, if we ignore the air blowing past him, his experience would
1106160	1111640	be completely identical to a man floating in a rocket ship in outer space with zero
1111640	1112640	gravity.
1112640	1114240	Einstein grabbed onto this idea.
1114240	1118920	What if acceleration and gravity were in some fundamental way the same thing, two sides
1118920	1120160	of the same coin?
1120160	1125080	With that idea in place, Einstein once again set out to construct an argument, brick by
1125080	1129360	logical brick, that led him to some surprising results.
1129360	1135240	And then he's able to extrapolate from that, this beautiful theory of general relativity.
1135240	1140120	And it predicts that light will be bent around a star, except you can't ever look at the
1140120	1143840	sun to see that happening unless the sun is blocked out by something so that you can
1143840	1145720	see the stars behind it.
1145720	1147960	So we wait for the eclipse.
1147960	1152160	Einstein put out a call to astronomers that they should use a solar eclipse as a chance
1152160	1156960	to record whether the apparent position of stars is changed when their light rays pass
1156960	1158600	near the sun to get to us.
1158840	1162920	But in the meantime, Einstein still needed to come up with a formal system for doing
1162920	1166600	calculations under his new conception of the universe.
1166600	1170840	The equations should predict exactly how much the light rays would bend, and they should
1170840	1176480	also explain why Mercury's orbit deviates ever so slightly from its expected elliptical
1176480	1177640	path.
1177640	1181360	To get there, he needed a type of mathematics that could deal precisely with quantities
1181360	1183960	that changed in complicated ways.
1183960	1187880	Traditional calculus can do this when we're looking at motion within a flat grid, what
1187960	1193040	we call Euclidean geometry, but describing the complexities of the universe was going
1193040	1196240	to take something more powerful and more flexible.
1196240	1199360	So he called up his old friend Marcel Grossman again.
1199360	1205680	By now, Grossman had become an expert in exactly the kind of sophisticated non-Euclidean geometry
1205680	1207880	that Einstein needed for his work.
1207880	1212240	He thought that Einstein might be able to realize his theory with the help of ideas
1212240	1216760	developed by mathematician Bernhard Riemann half a century earlier.
1216760	1219600	Let's do a little crash course in Riemannian geometry.
1219600	1222760	The fundamental question is what is distance?
1222760	1227640	And the right way to think about distance, and this is what Riemann understood, is imagine
1227640	1234280	like a Pringles chip and a tiny little ant on that Pringles chip.
1234280	1238960	And that ant wants to go somewhere, but of course it can't jump across the Pringles chip.
1238960	1243240	It has to go down into the chip and then up to the other side or maybe down this way and
1243240	1247160	up and around, however the ant has to get there, it's going to get there.
1247160	1250160	And the amount of steps that it takes is the distance.
1250160	1255800	If she smells something over there, she's not going to go like this because the shortest
1255800	1257720	path that turns out is like that.
1257720	1262280	And so that's exactly what Riemann was envisioning.
1262280	1266920	And what he said is at every single point in your space, let's think of surfaces, okay,
1266920	1268280	so we have this Pringles chip.
1268280	1273840	At every point in the Pringles chip, there's a set of tangent vectors, directions in which
1273840	1274840	you can go.
1274840	1277120	Okay, so that gives you a set of possible directions.
1277120	1282400	And then a geodesic, a shortest path, so you can sort of count the number of steps that
1282400	1284480	the ant took to get from here to here.
1284480	1288400	And then you can think about all possible paths the ant could have taken.
1288400	1292080	And the geodesic is the path that minimizes the total number of steps.
1292080	1295120	Riemann's mathematics makes this correct infinitesimally.
1295120	1298440	Riemann had devised a system where not only could the distance be measured differently
1298440	1303440	at every point, but the math can account for as many different variables as you need.
1303440	1309160	And he realized that once he started using these algebraic methods for writing what it
1309160	1313120	means to be a three-dimensional manifold, well, you have x1, x2, x3.
1313120	1318360	He's like, wait a second, x4, x5, x17.
1318360	1320760	Nothing is stopping me from doing this in general dimension.
1320760	1322440	And this really blew people's mind.
1322440	1323960	They're like, what do you mean 17 dimension?
1324200	1325400	And he's like, no, don't worry about it.
1325400	1326400	It's just algebra.
1326400	1330200	I can make a 17-tuple of numbers, right?
1330200	1334680	We have temperature, pressure, wind speed, whatever.
1334680	1339560	We have all kinds of different ways of describing the situation at a point.
1339560	1344000	Well, I shouldn't things be multi-dimensional beyond three dimensions.
1344000	1348360	Einstein and Grossman worked to bring these concepts together with Mankowski's four-dimensional
1348360	1352560	cone method, where the square of the time dimension was subtracted.
1352560	1354280	That is what general relativity is.
1354280	1358760	It's this way of measuring distances where instead of summing squares, you sum three
1358760	1362000	of the squares and subtract the fourth square.
1362000	1367240	But you do this differently at every point, depending on the mass.
1367240	1371280	Einstein dove into this formal mathematical approach that he had previously turned up
1371280	1372520	his nose to.
1372520	1376360	He was finally starting to appreciate the power that this kind of math had to discover
1376360	1378520	new insights about the universe.
1378520	1383440	He wrote to a colleague, I have gained enormous respect for mathematics, whose more subtle
1383440	1388400	parts I considered until now in my ignorance as pure luxury.
1388400	1392000	But Einstein wasn't completely converted over to this fancy math just yet.
1392000	1397160	In his multi-year quest for the equations of general relativity, he also tried strategies
1397160	1400520	based around his intuitions for the laws of physics.
1400520	1404640	He hoped that he could still use the kind of simple axiomatic thinking that had worked
1404640	1406800	so well for him in the past.
1406800	1411440	At one point in 1912, Einstein and Grossman had arrived at some formulas that turned out
1411440	1417400	to be very close to what would ultimately be Einstein's final version of general relativity.
1417400	1419240	But Einstein threw it out.
1419240	1423200	He was having trouble understanding how to make the formulas co-variant.
1423200	1428280	In other words, since relativity implies that there's no one definitive frame of reference,
1428280	1433360	any relativity formula has to give the same result no matter what frame of reference or
1433360	1435600	coordinate system you use.
1435600	1440040	Unfortunately the math behind this gets quite complicated, and apparently it was even too
1440040	1442840	complicated for Einstein himself at the time.
1442840	1445400	So Einstein threw out the fancy Riemannian math.
1445400	1450880	He hoped that he could still use his uncanny intuition for the physical laws of the universe
1450880	1454240	to work out his theory of general relativity.
1454240	1460520	Soon he had a new set of formulas which he published as what he called an outline paper.
1460520	1466080	The formulas in this paper have since been described as having no clear geometric meaning.
1466080	1469560	It seemed almost like Einstein had tried to just throw something together after getting
1469560	1472520	too frustrated with the difficult math.
1472520	1477040	After publishing this paper, he struggled for close to three years to refine the formulas
1477040	1481760	and get them to work, but eventually he found a clear-cut mistake.
1481760	1485960	As soon as he saw it, he dug out his old notebooks where he was using the Riemannian approach
1485960	1488200	and got back to work with those.
1488280	1490520	By now, the clock was ticking.
1490520	1495880	An influential mathematician in Göttingen named David Hilbert was working to develop
1495880	1500480	his own gravitational field equations based on Einstein's theories.
1500480	1502520	Einstein and Hilbert were kindred spirits.
1502520	1507280	Hilbert had published a book with a new set of geometric axioms that fixed some of the
1507280	1512160	flaws in Euclid's work, and he and Einstein had a mutual respect for each other's intellectual
1512160	1516240	independence and shared pacifism during the height of World War I.
1516440	1519880	But Einstein didn't want to be beaten to the punch with his own theory just yet.
1519880	1524200	The race to finish his general relativity formulas was the most intense four weeks of
1524200	1525200	his life.
1525200	1530640	Finally, he knew he had it when his equations predicted Mercury's strange orbit perfectly.
1530640	1535200	Exhausted and in constant stomach pain, he delivered his finished theory across four
1535200	1537880	presentations in November of 1915.
1537880	1542360	Hilbert submitted his paper at virtually the same time, but later added a correction that
1542360	1546880	brought his work in line with Einstein's, and he graciously deferred credit to Einstein
1546880	1552560	for both the original theory and for being the first to arrive at the correct mathematics.
1552560	1557200	The next great test of Einstein's theory would be to find out whether his predictions
1557200	1561600	about what would happen to the stars during a solar eclipse would come true.
1561600	1566880	His final equations predicted that the displacement would be twice as large as the prediction
1566880	1572800	that comes from Newton's equations if light is assumed to be made of particles with mass.
1572800	1577560	Einstein's general relativity paper managed to make its way across the English Channel
1577560	1582480	during the height of World War I to a British astronomer named Sir Arthur Eddington.
1582480	1587040	Eddington was a fellow pacifist and hoped that science could be used to bridge the divisions
1587040	1591760	of the Great War if a British team were to validate a German theory.
1591760	1597760	Eddington assembled two teams to photograph an eclipse that was coming on May 29, 1919.
1597760	1603540	By then, the war had finally ended, and one team headed to Sobral, Brazil, while Eddington
1603540	1609200	traveled with the other team to the island of Príncipe off the western coast of Africa.
1609200	1613400	Both teams managed to take photographs of the moment, but it took several months of
1613400	1618880	analysis back in England before Eddington was ready to announce his results.
1618880	1622040	Einstein waited nervously in Berlin to hear the news.
1622040	1627340	By September, word had come through that the data was looking good, but it wasn't until
1627340	1633760	a public presentation at the London Astronomical Society on November 6th that the world would
1633760	1635720	find out.
1635720	1639520	The next day, the Times of London printed the triumphant headline,
1639520	1644360	Revolution in Science, New Theory of the Universe, Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.
1644360	1658440	And like that, Einstein was famous.
1658440	1662680	The reason it was so wild is Einstein moves the heavens.
1662680	1665120	He's fighting the gods just like the Greeks are fighting the gods.
1665120	1670200	For a world still processing the trauma from one of the deadliest wars in human history,
1670200	1675200	the idea of a German Jew and a British Quaker working together to advance humanity's shared
1675200	1680200	understanding of the universe was a much needed moment of triumph.
1680200	1685040	Relativity became a symbol of this new modern world, and Einstein was that world's first
1685040	1686960	celebrity scientist.
1686960	1691400	More predictions of general relativity have since been verified, including some that Einstein
1691400	1696960	initially didn't even believe himself, such as the existence of black holes.
1696960	1702640	Not only that, the equations of general relativity are crucial for modern technology like GPS,
1702640	1708360	because the clocks aboard the satellites can't synchronize with the Earth without it.
1708360	1713400	For Einstein, his almost childlike intuition that there's an underlying structure to the
1713400	1719840	entire universe, and his lifelong reliance on axiomatic arguments needed to team up with
1719840	1725800	some of the most cutting edge abstract math available in order to get to his new comprehensive
1725880	1728160	understanding of the universe.
1728160	1730240	I want to come back to Riemann for a second.
1730240	1734080	Do you think he would have been surprised to find out that this math that he made was
1734080	1736400	what Einstein needed for general relativity?
1736400	1740080	Yes, I think that would be very much a surprise to Riemann.
1740080	1744680	I'm curious if you have a different reaction, but to me, I just kind of feel this sense
1744680	1752180	of like amazement that there was this math that Riemann made for math's sake, and it
1752180	1759580	ended up being the exact thing that Einstein needed to like figure out the secrets of the
1759580	1761100	universe basically.
1761100	1762900	This happens all the time.
1762900	1763980	This is why we exist.
1763980	1766660	This is I think why I have a job.
1766660	1769820	Because humanity has realized that you leave the mathematicians alone, they'll come up
1769820	1774840	with some cockamamie 17 dimensional curved space theory that nobody will give a damn
1774840	1780300	about for 60 years until someone comes along and says, wait a second, this is exactly the
1780300	1783140	mathematics I need to do general relativity.
1783140	1784140	It's amazing.
1784140	1785140	It's amazing.
1785140	1789740	It's amazing that the world is so well governed by mathematical laws, or approximated, shall
1789740	1790740	we say.
1790740	1793540	Not governed by, but approximated by mathematical laws.
1793540	1797060	Years later, Einstein received a fan letter from a young student.
1797060	1799660	She wrote that she was worried about her math class.
1799660	1802580	I have to work longer in it than most of my friends.
1802580	1804620	I worry, perhaps too much.
1804620	1809040	A few days later, Einstein sent her a gracious reply.
1809040	1813560	He wrote, do not worry about your problems with mathematics, because I can assure you
1813560	1815920	that mine are still greater.
