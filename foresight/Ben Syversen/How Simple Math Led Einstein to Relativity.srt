00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
On November 7, 1919, Albert Einstein became a household name seemingly overnight when

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,160
data collected during a solar eclipse matched the predictions of his theory of general relativity.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,120
The stars in the sky, those eternal points of light, they had moved precisely how he

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,560
said they would, and it changed physics forever.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,720
Einstein's crowning achievement came after years of false starts and failures, but he

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,160
had started with the same methods that he used to reach his other great breakthroughs,

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
dreaming up elegant thought experiments based around a few simple assumptions, uniting

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,680
ancient mathematical methods with cutting-edge science.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,240
This approach cut to the core of who Einstein had been since childhood.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,000
At 12 years old, he had a taste of this creative problem-solving.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,240
His uncle showed him a 4,000-year-old formula, and by using intuition and visual logic, Einstein

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,640
found his own proof of the theorem.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,120
What he didn't know at the time was that this ancient math formula and the methods

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,320
that he used to make his argument would later lead him to shake the very foundations of

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,080
what mankind thought it knew about the universe.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,800
This magazine from 1949 has an essay that Einstein wrote when he was 67.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,480
He'd had a momentous life.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,560
He talks about his great discoveries, but he actually starts with memories from childhood.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,680
And the things that stuck with him tell us something fundamental about how Einstein saw

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
the world as an adult and the methods that he used to reach his great breakthroughs.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,720
One of these moments came when he was 12, and his uncle Jacob showed him the Pythagorean

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
theorem for the first time.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,880
You might remember this from school.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,080
If you take a right triangle and label the two smaller sides A and B, and the bigger

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,600
side C, then this equation says that the sum of the squares of the two smaller lengths

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,480
we can draw actual squares to visualize that is equal to the square of the larger length.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,480
In other words, A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,600
This is a bedrock formula for nearly all of math.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,880
It's named for Pythagoras of Samos, an ancient Greek mathematician, but it was discovered

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,120
separately by a number of different cultures throughout history, and it was known for at

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,960
least a thousand years before Pythagoras.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,600
These days we still use it all the time because it's such a fundamental way to calculate distance.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,120
The same basic formula even works for three dimensions, and one of Einstein's great theories

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,120
is mathematically represented by a modified four-dimensional version of this formula.

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,320
Once Einstein learned this formula from his uncle, he wanted to show that it was true.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,480
In his essay, he writes that, after much effort, I succeeded in proving this theorem on the

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
basis of the similarity of triangles.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Einstein never publicly described this proof himself, but he supposedly showed it to one

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,720
of his assistants years later, and the story made its way into this book from 1991.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,800
So let's imagine what this would look like to a 12-year-old Einstein.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Einstein always had a knack for describing things visually, and this early example is

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
no different.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,240
The goal here would be to show that the two smaller squares somehow fit together and take

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,560
up the same amount of area as the larger square.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,240
There's a sense of proportionality to this figure.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,000
Different parts look like scaled up or down versions of other parts.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
And that ends up being the key to the whole thing.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,480
Einstein found two different types of proportionality that he was able to bring together into his

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
final explanation.

50
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Here's the first.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,440
Instead of trying to fit these little squares inside of the biggest square, why don't we

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,680
just cut them?

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,800
If I cut them all in half, then I get three triangles.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,000
Since I just halved everything, finding a way to fit the two smaller triangles inside

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,600
the big one would be equivalent to our original problem.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,240
If I wanted to, I could even cut them in half again.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,160
Now each triangle is a quarter of the original size.

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,520
But since everything is still proportional, I can still get back to my original squares

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
just by multiplying everything by four.

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,120
By this logic, I could cut the squares into any shape I want, as long as it's still

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,600
a scaled copy of the same shape in each square.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,440
If I wanted to, I could cut them into rubber duckies.

63
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,680
I wouldn't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square my ducky is, but I could

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,760
say that I'm multiplying everything by some number D for ducky.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Again, if I can show that the two smaller duckies fit inside the bigger ducky, then

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
I'd be good to go.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,680
But cutting the squares into duckies, it doesn't actually make our job any easier.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,880
So Einstein also recognized a second type of proportionality in this figure.

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,760
He drew a single line down the middle of the triangle.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,680
Now he has two new smaller triangles that are themselves, each proportional to the original.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
We know for sure that they're proportional, because first of all, all three of them have

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,760
90 degree angles.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,760
We can also see that the triangle on the left shares one of its angles with the original

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,200
big triangle, and the triangle on the right shares one of its angles with the big triangle

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
too.

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,400
In each case, we have two pairs of congruent angles.

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,120
So we know that the third angle also has to be congruent, because the sum of the angles

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,720
inside of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,260
If all three of these triangles are proportional, well, going back to the first idea, that would

80
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,200
mean that I'm allowed to cut them into my squares.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,880
Once again, I don't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square they are.

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,440
That would be different depending on the exact shape of my right triangle.

83
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,520
But I could say that I multiply by a number T for triangle in the same way that I multiplied

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,280
by D for my rubber ducky shape.

85
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,840
So now, all I would have to do would be to show that the area of the two small triangles

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,280
adds up to the area of the big triangle.

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,420
And of course we know that's true, because that's where we started.

88
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,960
So since T times a squared plus T times b squared equals T times c squared, it's also

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,240
true that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

90
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,760
This must have been an exciting thing for 12 year old Einstein.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,360
By just scaling something proportionally, and then cutting the shapes up and putting

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,120
the pieces together again like a puzzle, he's shown with certainty that this thing is true.

93
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,760
What he was going to learn just a little later was that he was actually using a loose version

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,960
of something called the axiomatic method, which is thousands of years old.

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,800
The idea is that we start with a few basic concepts that we accept to be true, called

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,060
axioms or postulates, and then we build on top of them brick by logical brick.

97
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,200
We have these basic, basic axioms.

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,560
And if you believe these basic axioms by pure logic, you can construct these amazing facts

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,680
that you're like, really, that's true, and you're like, here's why.

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,280
Here's the completely rigorous sequence of logical steps that will convince you that

101
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,480
this fact is true.

102
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,040
In Einstein's case, he wrote that it seemed to me evident that the relations of the sides

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
of the right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of the acute

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
angles.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Something which did not in similar fashion seem to be evident appeared to me to be in

106
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,960
need of any proof at all.

107
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,320
It sounds like he accepted some of what he just described about proportionality as being

108
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,760
true without proof and then built his argument from there.

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,600
Soon, Einstein was given a book of Euclidean geometry.

110
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Seeing page after page of this axiomatic method in action was such a revelation that

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,320
he called the book holy when he remembered it years later.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,780
This idea of using the axiomatic method to discover new knowledge and the sense of trying

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,080
to get to the most fundamental understanding of things were like guiding lights for Einstein

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,200
for many years to come.

115
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,840
Einstein always had a talent for math and science, but when he was young, following

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,400
his curiosity, took priority over pleasing his teachers.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,160
He'd push back against his teachers at his regimented German high school and by college,

118
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,680
he would often skip math class altogether.

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,880
To pass his college math tests, he'd copy notes from his friend Marcel Grossman.

120
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,200
One of his professors at the time, Hermann Mankowski, later remembered that Einstein

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
was like a lazy dog in his class.

122
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
After Einstein learned calculus as a teenager, I get the sense that he kind of said what

123
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,440
I hear a lot of other students say, which is, when am I ever going to use this math

124
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,840
again in my life?

125
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
As far as those classes that Einstein didn't think were worth his time, differential equations,

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,640
geometry of numbers, and others, he was at least partly right.

127
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,060
In just a few years, Einstein would completely change the world without really using that

128
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,040
math that he was supposed to have learned in college.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,860
But before long, he once again crossed paths with both Mankowski and Grossman and finally

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,160
come to appreciate the power of this advanced math that he had previously ignored.

131
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,240
Much later, Einstein wrote that, it was not clear to me as a student that a more profound

132
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,520
knowledge of the basic principles of physics was tied up with the most intricate mathematical

133
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,880
methods.

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,280
By the time Einstein graduated college in August of 1900, he was ranked fourth out of

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,240
a class of five people.

136
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
After college, Einstein struggled.

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,640
He spent a couple of years failing to get a job and also failing to write a science

138
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,280
paper good enough to earn him his PhD.

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,640
But in 1902, Grossman got his dad to call in a favor and help Einstein get a job as

140
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,080
a clerk at the lowest level of the Swiss Patent Office.

141
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,120
The job was boring and the hours made it so that Einstein couldn't get to the library

142
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,880
before it closed to do research.

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,520
But by 1905, practically out of nowhere, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including

144
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,320
one that's considered the origin of quantum physics and another on what's now known

145
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,820
as special relativity.

146
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,220
These papers, taken together, form the basis of modern physics and 1905 has come to be

147
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,260
known as Einstein's Miracle Year.

148
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,420
But these were not like typical physics papers.

149
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,100
For starters, Einstein didn't base his arguments on any experiments or even really cite much

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,060
of anybody else's work.

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,020
And not only that, the math didn't really go above a high school level.

152
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,140
Instead, he relied on the approach that he was so excited to discover back when he was

153
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,140
12, the axiomatic method.

154
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,420
In his paper on special relativity, after pointing out a puzzling contradiction in the

155
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,900
current science of electromagnetism, he makes his argument for a solution.

156
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:23,060
First, he proposes two ideas that he says he's going to accept as postulates or axioms.

157
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,980
From there, he writes a logical argument that leads to a radical rethinking of concepts

158
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,900
like time and distance, upending what had been accepted as fundamental laws of physics

159
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,300
since the time of Isaac Newton.

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,540
His first axiom was that the same physical laws apply to any frame of reference, including

161
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,380
the laws of optics and electricity.

162
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,540
In other words, there's no experiment that you could do that would let you make a distinction

163
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,860
between being at rest and being in perfectly uniform motion.

164
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,380
If you're flying in an airplane with the window shades down, pretend that we can't

165
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,420
hear the engine, then there's literally no difference between your state of motion when

166
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,660
the plane is flying and a different state of motion, for example, when the plane is

167
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,020
sitting on the tarmac.

168
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,100
By this logic, there's no such thing as absolute rest.

169
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,740
All we can do is talk about different objects moving relative to different reference points.

170
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,220
His second axiom seems like it contradicts the first.

171
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,740
It says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all frames of reference.

172
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,140
In other words, no matter how fast you're moving, it'll always look like a light beam

173
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,020
is traveling at the exact same speed.

174
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,340
Building on these two axioms, he goes through a thought experiment involving a series of

175
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,700
logical steps for measuring time and distance.

176
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,140
By the end, he's made the case for some pretty wild things.

177
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,220
He says that when you travel close to the speed of light, your length contracts in the

178
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,500
direction of your motion and time moves more slowly as measured by an outside observer.

179
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,420
Not only that, but the apparent fact of two events happening simultaneously is not absolute

180
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,300
and instead depends on the state of motion of the observer.

181
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,660
This leads to all kinds of surprising results and apparent paradoxes.

182
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,460
The YouTube channel Floathead Physics has made a whole series of great videos explaining

183
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,180
some of these results of special relativity.

184
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,340
Surprising things like what's known as the Twin's Paradox.

185
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:22,980
I'll put a link in the description to a few of my favorites.

186
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,900
It's fair to say that the ideas in these papers were completely revolutionary.

187
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,620
Even though there were other people thinking about this stuff, nobody else was radical

188
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,380
enough to take them all the way to their logical conclusions and throw out so much of what

189
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,020
they thought they knew about the universe in the process.

190
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,700
For example, Arie Poincaré, one of the titans of late 19th century math and physics, questioned

191
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,380
the absolute nature of time and made important steps towards special relativity before Einstein

192
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
did.

193
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,180
But even by the time of his death in 1912, he still hadn't come around to Einstein's

194
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,020
full theory of special relativity, insisting instead that absolute rest and absolute simultaneity

195
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,240
did exist relative to an undetectable cosmic substance known as the aether.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,780
After Einstein published these papers, his life didn't change much.

197
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,300
It still took him three more years to get a university job, but gradually, some influential

198
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,100
thinkers picked up on his work and started building on his theories.

199
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,420
One person who took special relativity and ran with it was none other than Einstein's

200
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,180
old math teacher, Hermann Minkowski.

201
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,140
Minkowski found a way to connect Einstein's ideas to formal mathematics through the concept

202
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,500
of a four-dimensional spacetime.

203
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
So what's a distance?

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,740
A distance is a sum of squares.

205
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,300
Because of the Pythagorean theorem, a distance is a sum of squares.

206
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,740
So let's say we have three variables, x, y, and z.

207
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,060
And what we're used to is, if I have some point out here, I can express it in some number

208
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,900
of x's, some number of y's, and some number of z's.

209
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
And that'll find me this point in space.

210
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,820
If we square those three values, add them together, and then take the square root of

211
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,620
the sum, then we'd be using the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting

212
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,780
point.

213
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,460
And then Minkowski comes along and says, OK, but here's a way to make spacetime work.

214
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,340
When you add that extra dimension of time, you sum the squares of the space dimensions

215
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,680
and you subtract a square of the time dimension to measure distance.

216
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,580
It makes special relativity into a geometric space.

217
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,300
Minkowski's new system allowed him to mathematically model the predictions of special relativity,

218
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,780
where the behavior of light forms the boundary for the possible motion of all other objects

219
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,300
in the universe.

220
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,180
Since what we're describing as distance now includes the measurement of time, this value

221
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,080
is often referred to as a spacetime interval.

222
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,340
The geometry that special relativity predicts is the geometry that's of the cone where

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,420
the distances are all zero.

224
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,020
Let's make an analogy to three dimensions so we can see why this forms a cone.

225
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,100
The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals the distance

226
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
squared.

227
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,860
But what happens if we describe light's behavior by making the z dimension negative and the

228
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,700
distance equal to zero?

229
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,460
Well, now we can move things around to get x squared plus y squared equals z squared.

230
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,680
We can think of this as all the points on x and y that are a distance z from the origin.

231
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,960
In other words, it's the points on a circle.

232
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,640
So when z gets bigger, the circle gets bigger, and when it gets smaller, the circle gets

233
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
smaller.

234
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,280
What we end up with is a cone where the edges make a 45 degree angle with the z axis.

235
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,880
So Einstein's special relativity, again, we start with the axiom that the speed of light

236
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,600
is constant, and we derive all these crazy things about time and distance and so on.

237
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,760
When Minkowski says, you can realize those things by placing them in this geometry where

238
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,440
you get to subtract one of the squares when you're computing distances.

239
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,320
This formula gives a geometric interpretation of what's known as Lorenz transformations,

240
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,920
the equations that allow you to calculate the changes to time and distance that occur

241
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,080
for an object moving close to the speed of light.

242
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,960
The motion of a photon of light always has a space-time interval equal to zero, while

243
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,440
any other object moving below the speed of light has a non-zero space-time interval,

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,160
which all inertial observers will measure as being the same value.

245
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,200
It's this one cone, and he's saying the whole world lives in this cone, space-time.

246
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,320
Einstein initially did not like this idea.

247
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,920
He called it superfluous erudition, and said that since the mathematicians have grabbed

248
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,920
hold of the relativity theory, I no longer understand it myself.

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,960
Einstein thought this fancy new math obscured the beautiful physics.

250
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,840
But Minkowski's explanation of the four-dimensional cone wasn't just fancy math for the sake

251
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,520
of being complicated.

252
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,760
It actually unlocked new conclusions from special relativity that weren't apparent

253
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
in Einstein's original version.

254
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,080
In the end, the idea of space-time has become so closely associated with special relativity

255
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,200
that people mistakenly assume that it came from Einstein himself.

256
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,080
Einstein would eventually realize just how much he needed this fancy math to keep developing

257
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,520
his relativity theories, because special relativity had a fundamental limitation.

258
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,760
It only described completely uniform motion, so Einstein still needed a way to talk about

259
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,600
things like acceleration and rotation.

260
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,080
Not only that, but there was an even bigger problem with Newton's laws of gravity.

261
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,640
You have two objects with two masses, there's a universal gravitational constant, and they

262
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
pull each other.

263
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,840
The force that one exerts on the other is inverse distance squared, this is the inverse

264
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,000
square law.

265
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,560
But then special theory of relativity says distance is not absolute.

266
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,080
Oh crap, we have a huge problem.

267
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,520
How do we do gravity if distance is in the eye of the beholder?

268
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,880
Because distance is measured by time, and there's this duality between time and distance.

269
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:05,600
And so can it be that the force acting on this thing depends on where you're standing

270
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,240
and looking at them?

271
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,120
So this is the sort of thing that Einstein's special theory breaks.

272
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
It breaks gravity.

273
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,240
This was when Einstein came upon what he later called the happiest thought of his life.

274
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
He imagined a painter falling from the side of a building.

275
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,160
While the man is in free fall, if we ignore the air blowing past him, his experience would

276
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,640
be completely identical to a man floating in a rocket ship in outer space with zero

277
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
gravity.

278
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
Einstein grabbed onto this idea.

279
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,920
What if acceleration and gravity were in some fundamental way the same thing, two sides

280
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,160
of the same coin?

281
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,080
With that idea in place, Einstein once again set out to construct an argument, brick by

282
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,360
logical brick, that led him to some surprising results.

283
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,240
And then he's able to extrapolate from that, this beautiful theory of general relativity.

284
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,120
And it predicts that light will be bent around a star, except you can't ever look at the

285
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,840
sun to see that happening unless the sun is blocked out by something so that you can

286
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,720
see the stars behind it.

287
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,960
So we wait for the eclipse.

288
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,160
Einstein put out a call to astronomers that they should use a solar eclipse as a chance

289
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,960
to record whether the apparent position of stars is changed when their light rays pass

290
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,600
near the sun to get to us.

291
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,920
But in the meantime, Einstein still needed to come up with a formal system for doing

292
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,600
calculations under his new conception of the universe.

293
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,840
The equations should predict exactly how much the light rays would bend, and they should

294
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,480
also explain why Mercury's orbit deviates ever so slightly from its expected elliptical

295
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
path.

296
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,360
To get there, he needed a type of mathematics that could deal precisely with quantities

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,960
that changed in complicated ways.

298
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Traditional calculus can do this when we're looking at motion within a flat grid, what

299
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,040
we call Euclidean geometry, but describing the complexities of the universe was going

300
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,240
to take something more powerful and more flexible.

301
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,360
So he called up his old friend Marcel Grossman again.

302
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,680
By now, Grossman had become an expert in exactly the kind of sophisticated non-Euclidean geometry

303
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
that Einstein needed for his work.

304
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,240
He thought that Einstein might be able to realize his theory with the help of ideas

305
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,760
developed by mathematician Bernhard Riemann half a century earlier.

306
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,600
Let's do a little crash course in Riemannian geometry.

307
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,760
The fundamental question is what is distance?

308
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,640
And the right way to think about distance, and this is what Riemann understood, is imagine

309
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,280
like a Pringles chip and a tiny little ant on that Pringles chip.

310
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,960
And that ant wants to go somewhere, but of course it can't jump across the Pringles chip.

311
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,240
It has to go down into the chip and then up to the other side or maybe down this way and

312
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,160
up and around, however the ant has to get there, it's going to get there.

313
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,160
And the amount of steps that it takes is the distance.

314
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,800
If she smells something over there, she's not going to go like this because the shortest

315
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,720
path that turns out is like that.

316
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,280
And so that's exactly what Riemann was envisioning.

317
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,920
And what he said is at every single point in your space, let's think of surfaces, okay,

318
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
so we have this Pringles chip.

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,840
At every point in the Pringles chip, there's a set of tangent vectors, directions in which

320
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
you can go.

321
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Okay, so that gives you a set of possible directions.

322
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,400
And then a geodesic, a shortest path, so you can sort of count the number of steps that

323
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
the ant took to get from here to here.

324
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,400
And then you can think about all possible paths the ant could have taken.

325
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,080
And the geodesic is the path that minimizes the total number of steps.

326
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,120
Riemann's mathematics makes this correct infinitesimally.

327
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,440
Riemann had devised a system where not only could the distance be measured differently

328
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,440
at every point, but the math can account for as many different variables as you need.

329
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,160
And he realized that once he started using these algebraic methods for writing what it

330
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,120
means to be a three-dimensional manifold, well, you have x1, x2, x3.

331
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,360
He's like, wait a second, x4, x5, x17.

332
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,760
Nothing is stopping me from doing this in general dimension.

333
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,440
And this really blew people's mind.

334
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,960
They're like, what do you mean 17 dimension?

335
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
And he's like, no, don't worry about it.

336
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
It's just algebra.

337
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,200
I can make a 17-tuple of numbers, right?

338
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,680
We have temperature, pressure, wind speed, whatever.

339
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,560
We have all kinds of different ways of describing the situation at a point.

340
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,000
Well, I shouldn't things be multi-dimensional beyond three dimensions.

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,360
Einstein and Grossman worked to bring these concepts together with Mankowski's four-dimensional

342
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,560
cone method, where the square of the time dimension was subtracted.

343
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
That is what general relativity is.

344
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,760
It's this way of measuring distances where instead of summing squares, you sum three

345
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,000
of the squares and subtract the fourth square.

346
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,240
But you do this differently at every point, depending on the mass.

347
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,280
Einstein dove into this formal mathematical approach that he had previously turned up

348
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
his nose to.

349
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,360
He was finally starting to appreciate the power that this kind of math had to discover

350
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,520
new insights about the universe.

351
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,440
He wrote to a colleague, I have gained enormous respect for mathematics, whose more subtle

352
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
parts I considered until now in my ignorance as pure luxury.

353
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
But Einstein wasn't completely converted over to this fancy math just yet.

354
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,160
In his multi-year quest for the equations of general relativity, he also tried strategies

355
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,520
based around his intuitions for the laws of physics.

356
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,640
He hoped that he could still use the kind of simple axiomatic thinking that had worked

357
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,800
so well for him in the past.

358
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,440
At one point in 1912, Einstein and Grossman had arrived at some formulas that turned out

359
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,400
to be very close to what would ultimately be Einstein's final version of general relativity.

360
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,240
But Einstein threw it out.

361
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,200
He was having trouble understanding how to make the formulas co-variant.

362
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,280
In other words, since relativity implies that there's no one definitive frame of reference,

363
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,360
any relativity formula has to give the same result no matter what frame of reference or

364
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
coordinate system you use.

365
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,040
Unfortunately the math behind this gets quite complicated, and apparently it was even too

366
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,840
complicated for Einstein himself at the time.

367
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,400
So Einstein threw out the fancy Riemannian math.

368
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,880
He hoped that he could still use his uncanny intuition for the physical laws of the universe

369
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
to work out his theory of general relativity.

370
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,520
Soon he had a new set of formulas which he published as what he called an outline paper.

371
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,080
The formulas in this paper have since been described as having no clear geometric meaning.

372
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,560
It seemed almost like Einstein had tried to just throw something together after getting

373
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,520
too frustrated with the difficult math.

374
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,040
After publishing this paper, he struggled for close to three years to refine the formulas

375
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,760
and get them to work, but eventually he found a clear-cut mistake.

376
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,960
As soon as he saw it, he dug out his old notebooks where he was using the Riemannian approach

377
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,200
and got back to work with those.

378
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,520
By now, the clock was ticking.

379
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,880
An influential mathematician in Göttingen named David Hilbert was working to develop

380
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,480
his own gravitational field equations based on Einstein's theories.

381
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,520
Einstein and Hilbert were kindred spirits.

382
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,280
Hilbert had published a book with a new set of geometric axioms that fixed some of the

383
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,160
flaws in Euclid's work, and he and Einstein had a mutual respect for each other's intellectual

384
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,240
independence and shared pacifism during the height of World War I.

385
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,880
But Einstein didn't want to be beaten to the punch with his own theory just yet.

386
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,200
The race to finish his general relativity formulas was the most intense four weeks of

387
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
his life.

388
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,640
Finally, he knew he had it when his equations predicted Mercury's strange orbit perfectly.

389
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
Exhausted and in constant stomach pain, he delivered his finished theory across four

390
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,880
presentations in November of 1915.

391
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,360
Hilbert submitted his paper at virtually the same time, but later added a correction that

392
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,880
brought his work in line with Einstein's, and he graciously deferred credit to Einstein

393
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,560
for both the original theory and for being the first to arrive at the correct mathematics.

394
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,200
The next great test of Einstein's theory would be to find out whether his predictions

395
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
about what would happen to the stars during a solar eclipse would come true.

396
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,880
His final equations predicted that the displacement would be twice as large as the prediction

397
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,800
that comes from Newton's equations if light is assumed to be made of particles with mass.

398
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,560
Einstein's general relativity paper managed to make its way across the English Channel

399
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,480
during the height of World War I to a British astronomer named Sir Arthur Eddington.

400
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,040
Eddington was a fellow pacifist and hoped that science could be used to bridge the divisions

401
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,760
of the Great War if a British team were to validate a German theory.

402
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Eddington assembled two teams to photograph an eclipse that was coming on May 29, 1919.

403
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,540
By then, the war had finally ended, and one team headed to Sobral, Brazil, while Eddington

404
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,200
traveled with the other team to the island of Príncipe off the western coast of Africa.

405
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,400
Both teams managed to take photographs of the moment, but it took several months of

406
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,880
analysis back in England before Eddington was ready to announce his results.

407
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,040
Einstein waited nervously in Berlin to hear the news.

408
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,340
By September, word had come through that the data was looking good, but it wasn't until

409
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,760
a public presentation at the London Astronomical Society on November 6th that the world would

410
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,720
find out.

411
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,520
The next day, the Times of London printed the triumphant headline,

412
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,360
Revolution in Science, New Theory of the Universe, Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.

413
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:38,440
And like that, Einstein was famous.

414
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,680
The reason it was so wild is Einstein moves the heavens.

415
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,120
He's fighting the gods just like the Greeks are fighting the gods.

416
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,200
For a world still processing the trauma from one of the deadliest wars in human history,

417
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,200
the idea of a German Jew and a British Quaker working together to advance humanity's shared

418
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,200
understanding of the universe was a much needed moment of triumph.

419
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,040
Relativity became a symbol of this new modern world, and Einstein was that world's first

420
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,960
celebrity scientist.

421
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,400
More predictions of general relativity have since been verified, including some that Einstein

422
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,960
initially didn't even believe himself, such as the existence of black holes.

423
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,640
Not only that, the equations of general relativity are crucial for modern technology like GPS,

424
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,360
because the clocks aboard the satellites can't synchronize with the Earth without it.

425
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,400
For Einstein, his almost childlike intuition that there's an underlying structure to the

426
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,840
entire universe, and his lifelong reliance on axiomatic arguments needed to team up with

427
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,800
some of the most cutting edge abstract math available in order to get to his new comprehensive

428
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,160
understanding of the universe.

429
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,240
I want to come back to Riemann for a second.

430
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,080
Do you think he would have been surprised to find out that this math that he made was

431
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,400
what Einstein needed for general relativity?

432
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,080
Yes, I think that would be very much a surprise to Riemann.

433
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,680
I'm curious if you have a different reaction, but to me, I just kind of feel this sense

434
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:12,180
of like amazement that there was this math that Riemann made for math's sake, and it

435
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:19,580
ended up being the exact thing that Einstein needed to like figure out the secrets of the

436
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,100
universe basically.

437
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,900
This happens all the time.

438
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,980
This is why we exist.

439
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,660
This is I think why I have a job.

440
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,820
Because humanity has realized that you leave the mathematicians alone, they'll come up

441
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,840
with some cockamamie 17 dimensional curved space theory that nobody will give a damn

442
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,300
about for 60 years until someone comes along and says, wait a second, this is exactly the

443
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,140
mathematics I need to do general relativity.

444
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
It's amazing.

445
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
It's amazing.

446
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,740
It's amazing that the world is so well governed by mathematical laws, or approximated, shall

447
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
we say.

448
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,540
Not governed by, but approximated by mathematical laws.

449
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,060
Years later, Einstein received a fan letter from a young student.

450
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,660
She wrote that she was worried about her math class.

451
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,580
I have to work longer in it than most of my friends.

452
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,620
I worry, perhaps too much.

453
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,040
A few days later, Einstein sent her a gracious reply.

454
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,560
He wrote, do not worry about your problems with mathematics, because I can assure you

455
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,920
that mine are still greater.
