00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
On November 7, 1919, Albert Einstein became a household name seemingly overnight when

00:07.000 --> 00:13.160
data collected during a solar eclipse matched the predictions of his theory of general relativity.

00:13.160 --> 00:20.120
The stars in the sky, those eternal points of light, they had moved precisely how he

00:20.120 --> 00:23.560
said they would, and it changed physics forever.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.720
Einstein's crowning achievement came after years of false starts and failures, but he

00:27.720 --> 00:32.160
had started with the same methods that he used to reach his other great breakthroughs,

00:32.160 --> 00:36.880
dreaming up elegant thought experiments based around a few simple assumptions, uniting

00:36.880 --> 00:40.680
ancient mathematical methods with cutting-edge science.

00:40.680 --> 00:45.240
This approach cut to the core of who Einstein had been since childhood.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.000
At 12 years old, he had a taste of this creative problem-solving.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.240
His uncle showed him a 4,000-year-old formula, and by using intuition and visual logic, Einstein

00:55.240 --> 00:57.640
found his own proof of the theorem.

00:57.640 --> 01:02.120
What he didn't know at the time was that this ancient math formula and the methods

01:02.120 --> 01:07.320
that he used to make his argument would later lead him to shake the very foundations of

01:07.320 --> 01:14.080
what mankind thought it knew about the universe.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.800
This magazine from 1949 has an essay that Einstein wrote when he was 67.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.480
He'd had a momentous life.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.560
He talks about his great discoveries, but he actually starts with memories from childhood.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.680
And the things that stuck with him tell us something fundamental about how Einstein saw

01:29.680 --> 01:34.560
the world as an adult and the methods that he used to reach his great breakthroughs.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.720
One of these moments came when he was 12, and his uncle Jacob showed him the Pythagorean

01:38.720 --> 01:40.320
theorem for the first time.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.880
You might remember this from school.

01:41.880 --> 01:46.080
If you take a right triangle and label the two smaller sides A and B, and the bigger

01:46.080 --> 01:51.600
side C, then this equation says that the sum of the squares of the two smaller lengths

01:51.680 --> 01:56.480
we can draw actual squares to visualize that is equal to the square of the larger length.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.480
In other words, A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.600
This is a bedrock formula for nearly all of math.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.880
It's named for Pythagoras of Samos, an ancient Greek mathematician, but it was discovered

02:07.880 --> 02:12.120
separately by a number of different cultures throughout history, and it was known for at

02:12.120 --> 02:14.960
least a thousand years before Pythagoras.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.600
These days we still use it all the time because it's such a fundamental way to calculate distance.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.120
The same basic formula even works for three dimensions, and one of Einstein's great theories

02:24.120 --> 02:29.120
is mathematically represented by a modified four-dimensional version of this formula.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.320
Once Einstein learned this formula from his uncle, he wanted to show that it was true.

02:37.320 --> 02:42.480
In his essay, he writes that, after much effort, I succeeded in proving this theorem on the

02:42.480 --> 02:45.440
basis of the similarity of triangles.

02:45.440 --> 02:50.720
Einstein never publicly described this proof himself, but he supposedly showed it to one

02:50.720 --> 02:56.720
of his assistants years later, and the story made its way into this book from 1991.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.800
So let's imagine what this would look like to a 12-year-old Einstein.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.360
Einstein always had a knack for describing things visually, and this early example is

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
no different.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.240
The goal here would be to show that the two smaller squares somehow fit together and take

03:08.240 --> 03:11.560
up the same amount of area as the larger square.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.240
There's a sense of proportionality to this figure.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.000
Different parts look like scaled up or down versions of other parts.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.240
And that ends up being the key to the whole thing.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.480
Einstein found two different types of proportionality that he was able to bring together into his

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
final explanation.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.040
Here's the first.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.440
Instead of trying to fit these little squares inside of the biggest square, why don't we

03:30.440 --> 03:31.680
just cut them?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.800
If I cut them all in half, then I get three triangles.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.000
Since I just halved everything, finding a way to fit the two smaller triangles inside

03:39.000 --> 03:42.600
the big one would be equivalent to our original problem.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.240
If I wanted to, I could even cut them in half again.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.160
Now each triangle is a quarter of the original size.

03:48.160 --> 03:53.520
But since everything is still proportional, I can still get back to my original squares

03:53.520 --> 03:56.240
just by multiplying everything by four.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.120
By this logic, I could cut the squares into any shape I want, as long as it's still

04:00.120 --> 04:03.600
a scaled copy of the same shape in each square.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.440
If I wanted to, I could cut them into rubber duckies.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.680
I wouldn't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square my ducky is, but I could

04:10.680 --> 04:14.760
say that I'm multiplying everything by some number D for ducky.

04:14.760 --> 04:19.680
Again, if I can show that the two smaller duckies fit inside the bigger ducky, then

04:19.680 --> 04:21.440
I'd be good to go.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.680
But cutting the squares into duckies, it doesn't actually make our job any easier.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.880
So Einstein also recognized a second type of proportionality in this figure.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.760
He drew a single line down the middle of the triangle.

04:33.760 --> 04:39.680
Now he has two new smaller triangles that are themselves, each proportional to the original.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.360
We know for sure that they're proportional, because first of all, all three of them have

04:43.360 --> 04:44.760
90 degree angles.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.760
We can also see that the triangle on the left shares one of its angles with the original

04:48.760 --> 04:53.200
big triangle, and the triangle on the right shares one of its angles with the big triangle

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
too.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.400
In each case, we have two pairs of congruent angles.

04:57.400 --> 05:02.120
So we know that the third angle also has to be congruent, because the sum of the angles

05:02.120 --> 05:05.720
inside of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.260
If all three of these triangles are proportional, well, going back to the first idea, that would

05:10.260 --> 05:14.200
mean that I'm allowed to cut them into my squares.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.880
Once again, I don't necessarily know what fraction of the entire square they are.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.440
That would be different depending on the exact shape of my right triangle.

05:22.440 --> 05:27.520
But I could say that I multiply by a number T for triangle in the same way that I multiplied

05:27.520 --> 05:30.280
by D for my rubber ducky shape.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.840
So now, all I would have to do would be to show that the area of the two small triangles

05:34.840 --> 05:37.280
adds up to the area of the big triangle.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.420
And of course we know that's true, because that's where we started.

05:40.420 --> 05:45.960
So since T times a squared plus T times b squared equals T times c squared, it's also

05:45.960 --> 05:51.240
true that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.760
This must have been an exciting thing for 12 year old Einstein.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.360
By just scaling something proportionally, and then cutting the shapes up and putting

05:57.360 --> 06:02.120
the pieces together again like a puzzle, he's shown with certainty that this thing is true.

06:02.120 --> 06:06.760
What he was going to learn just a little later was that he was actually using a loose version

06:06.760 --> 06:10.960
of something called the axiomatic method, which is thousands of years old.

06:10.960 --> 06:15.800
The idea is that we start with a few basic concepts that we accept to be true, called

06:15.800 --> 06:21.060
axioms or postulates, and then we build on top of them brick by logical brick.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.200
We have these basic, basic axioms.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.560
And if you believe these basic axioms by pure logic, you can construct these amazing facts

06:28.560 --> 06:32.680
that you're like, really, that's true, and you're like, here's why.

06:32.680 --> 06:38.280
Here's the completely rigorous sequence of logical steps that will convince you that

06:38.280 --> 06:40.480
this fact is true.

06:40.480 --> 06:46.040
In Einstein's case, he wrote that it seemed to me evident that the relations of the sides

06:46.040 --> 06:51.040
of the right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of the acute

06:51.040 --> 06:52.720
angles.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.920
Something which did not in similar fashion seem to be evident appeared to me to be in

06:57.920 --> 06:59.960
need of any proof at all.

06:59.960 --> 07:04.320
It sounds like he accepted some of what he just described about proportionality as being

07:04.320 --> 07:07.760
true without proof and then built his argument from there.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.600
Soon, Einstein was given a book of Euclidean geometry.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.440
Seeing page after page of this axiomatic method in action was such a revelation that

07:16.440 --> 07:20.320
he called the book holy when he remembered it years later.

07:20.320 --> 07:25.780
This idea of using the axiomatic method to discover new knowledge and the sense of trying

07:25.780 --> 07:31.080
to get to the most fundamental understanding of things were like guiding lights for Einstein

07:31.080 --> 07:35.200
for many years to come.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.840
Einstein always had a talent for math and science, but when he was young, following

07:38.840 --> 07:43.400
his curiosity, took priority over pleasing his teachers.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.160
He'd push back against his teachers at his regimented German high school and by college,

07:48.160 --> 07:50.680
he would often skip math class altogether.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.880
To pass his college math tests, he'd copy notes from his friend Marcel Grossman.

07:54.880 --> 07:59.200
One of his professors at the time, Hermann Mankowski, later remembered that Einstein

07:59.200 --> 08:01.680
was like a lazy dog in his class.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.240
After Einstein learned calculus as a teenager, I get the sense that he kind of said what

08:06.240 --> 08:09.440
I hear a lot of other students say, which is, when am I ever going to use this math

08:09.440 --> 08:10.840
again in my life?

08:10.840 --> 08:15.840
As far as those classes that Einstein didn't think were worth his time, differential equations,

08:15.840 --> 08:20.640
geometry of numbers, and others, he was at least partly right.

08:20.640 --> 08:25.060
In just a few years, Einstein would completely change the world without really using that

08:25.060 --> 08:28.040
math that he was supposed to have learned in college.

08:28.040 --> 08:33.860
But before long, he once again crossed paths with both Mankowski and Grossman and finally

08:33.860 --> 08:39.160
come to appreciate the power of this advanced math that he had previously ignored.

08:39.160 --> 08:44.240
Much later, Einstein wrote that, it was not clear to me as a student that a more profound

08:44.240 --> 08:49.520
knowledge of the basic principles of physics was tied up with the most intricate mathematical

08:49.520 --> 08:50.880
methods.

08:50.880 --> 08:56.280
By the time Einstein graduated college in August of 1900, he was ranked fourth out of

08:56.280 --> 08:59.240
a class of five people.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.240
After college, Einstein struggled.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.640
He spent a couple of years failing to get a job and also failing to write a science

09:05.640 --> 09:08.280
paper good enough to earn him his PhD.

09:08.280 --> 09:13.640
But in 1902, Grossman got his dad to call in a favor and help Einstein get a job as

09:13.680 --> 09:18.080
a clerk at the lowest level of the Swiss Patent Office.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.120
The job was boring and the hours made it so that Einstein couldn't get to the library

09:22.120 --> 09:24.880
before it closed to do research.

09:24.880 --> 09:31.520
But by 1905, practically out of nowhere, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including

09:31.520 --> 09:36.320
one that's considered the origin of quantum physics and another on what's now known

09:36.320 --> 09:38.820
as special relativity.

09:38.820 --> 09:44.220
These papers, taken together, form the basis of modern physics and 1905 has come to be

09:44.220 --> 09:47.260
known as Einstein's Miracle Year.

09:47.260 --> 09:49.420
But these were not like typical physics papers.

09:49.420 --> 09:54.100
For starters, Einstein didn't base his arguments on any experiments or even really cite much

09:54.100 --> 09:56.060
of anybody else's work.

09:56.060 --> 10:00.020
And not only that, the math didn't really go above a high school level.

10:00.020 --> 10:04.140
Instead, he relied on the approach that he was so excited to discover back when he was

10:04.140 --> 10:07.140
12, the axiomatic method.

10:07.860 --> 10:12.420
In his paper on special relativity, after pointing out a puzzling contradiction in the

10:12.420 --> 10:16.900
current science of electromagnetism, he makes his argument for a solution.

10:16.900 --> 10:23.060
First, he proposes two ideas that he says he's going to accept as postulates or axioms.

10:23.060 --> 10:27.980
From there, he writes a logical argument that leads to a radical rethinking of concepts

10:27.980 --> 10:32.900
like time and distance, upending what had been accepted as fundamental laws of physics

10:32.900 --> 10:35.300
since the time of Isaac Newton.

10:35.300 --> 10:40.540
His first axiom was that the same physical laws apply to any frame of reference, including

10:40.540 --> 10:43.380
the laws of optics and electricity.

10:43.380 --> 10:47.540
In other words, there's no experiment that you could do that would let you make a distinction

10:47.540 --> 10:51.860
between being at rest and being in perfectly uniform motion.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.380
If you're flying in an airplane with the window shades down, pretend that we can't

10:55.380 --> 10:59.420
hear the engine, then there's literally no difference between your state of motion when

10:59.420 --> 11:03.660
the plane is flying and a different state of motion, for example, when the plane is

11:03.660 --> 11:05.020
sitting on the tarmac.

11:05.020 --> 11:09.100
By this logic, there's no such thing as absolute rest.

11:09.100 --> 11:14.740
All we can do is talk about different objects moving relative to different reference points.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.220
His second axiom seems like it contradicts the first.

11:18.220 --> 11:22.740
It says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all frames of reference.

11:22.740 --> 11:27.140
In other words, no matter how fast you're moving, it'll always look like a light beam

11:27.140 --> 11:30.020
is traveling at the exact same speed.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.340
Building on these two axioms, he goes through a thought experiment involving a series of

11:33.340 --> 11:36.700
logical steps for measuring time and distance.

11:36.700 --> 11:40.140
By the end, he's made the case for some pretty wild things.

11:40.140 --> 11:44.220
He says that when you travel close to the speed of light, your length contracts in the

11:44.220 --> 11:50.500
direction of your motion and time moves more slowly as measured by an outside observer.

11:50.500 --> 11:56.420
Not only that, but the apparent fact of two events happening simultaneously is not absolute

11:56.420 --> 12:00.300
and instead depends on the state of motion of the observer.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.660
This leads to all kinds of surprising results and apparent paradoxes.

12:04.660 --> 12:09.460
The YouTube channel Floathead Physics has made a whole series of great videos explaining

12:09.460 --> 12:13.180
some of these results of special relativity.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.340
Surprising things like what's known as the Twin's Paradox.

12:15.340 --> 12:22.980
I'll put a link in the description to a few of my favorites.

12:22.980 --> 12:26.900
It's fair to say that the ideas in these papers were completely revolutionary.

12:26.900 --> 12:30.620
Even though there were other people thinking about this stuff, nobody else was radical

12:30.620 --> 12:35.380
enough to take them all the way to their logical conclusions and throw out so much of what

12:35.380 --> 12:39.020
they thought they knew about the universe in the process.

12:39.020 --> 12:44.700
For example, Arie Poincaré, one of the titans of late 19th century math and physics, questioned

12:44.700 --> 12:49.380
the absolute nature of time and made important steps towards special relativity before Einstein

12:49.380 --> 12:50.380
did.

12:50.380 --> 12:55.180
But even by the time of his death in 1912, he still hadn't come around to Einstein's

12:55.180 --> 13:02.020
full theory of special relativity, insisting instead that absolute rest and absolute simultaneity

13:02.020 --> 13:07.240
did exist relative to an undetectable cosmic substance known as the aether.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.780
After Einstein published these papers, his life didn't change much.

13:10.780 --> 13:15.300
It still took him three more years to get a university job, but gradually, some influential

13:15.300 --> 13:19.100
thinkers picked up on his work and started building on his theories.

13:19.100 --> 13:23.420
One person who took special relativity and ran with it was none other than Einstein's

13:23.540 --> 13:26.180
old math teacher, Hermann Minkowski.

13:26.180 --> 13:31.140
Minkowski found a way to connect Einstein's ideas to formal mathematics through the concept

13:31.140 --> 13:33.500
of a four-dimensional spacetime.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
So what's a distance?

13:34.500 --> 13:35.740
A distance is a sum of squares.

13:35.740 --> 13:39.300
Because of the Pythagorean theorem, a distance is a sum of squares.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.740
So let's say we have three variables, x, y, and z.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.060
And what we're used to is, if I have some point out here, I can express it in some number

13:46.060 --> 13:48.900
of x's, some number of y's, and some number of z's.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.900
And that'll find me this point in space.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.820
If we square those three values, add them together, and then take the square root of

13:54.820 --> 13:59.620
the sum, then we'd be using the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting

13:59.620 --> 14:00.780
point.

14:00.780 --> 14:04.460
And then Minkowski comes along and says, OK, but here's a way to make spacetime work.

14:04.460 --> 14:10.340
When you add that extra dimension of time, you sum the squares of the space dimensions

14:10.340 --> 14:14.680
and you subtract a square of the time dimension to measure distance.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.580
It makes special relativity into a geometric space.

14:17.580 --> 14:22.300
Minkowski's new system allowed him to mathematically model the predictions of special relativity,

14:22.300 --> 14:26.780
where the behavior of light forms the boundary for the possible motion of all other objects

14:26.780 --> 14:28.300
in the universe.

14:28.300 --> 14:33.180
Since what we're describing as distance now includes the measurement of time, this value

14:33.180 --> 14:37.080
is often referred to as a spacetime interval.

14:37.080 --> 14:43.340
The geometry that special relativity predicts is the geometry that's of the cone where

14:43.340 --> 14:45.420
the distances are all zero.

14:45.420 --> 14:50.020
Let's make an analogy to three dimensions so we can see why this forms a cone.

14:50.020 --> 14:56.100
The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals the distance

14:56.100 --> 14:57.100
squared.

14:57.100 --> 15:02.860
But what happens if we describe light's behavior by making the z dimension negative and the

15:02.860 --> 15:04.700
distance equal to zero?

15:04.700 --> 15:09.460
Well, now we can move things around to get x squared plus y squared equals z squared.

15:09.460 --> 15:13.680
We can think of this as all the points on x and y that are a distance z from the origin.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.960
In other words, it's the points on a circle.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.640
So when z gets bigger, the circle gets bigger, and when it gets smaller, the circle gets

15:19.640 --> 15:20.640
smaller.

15:20.640 --> 15:26.280
What we end up with is a cone where the edges make a 45 degree angle with the z axis.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.880
So Einstein's special relativity, again, we start with the axiom that the speed of light

15:30.880 --> 15:36.600
is constant, and we derive all these crazy things about time and distance and so on.

15:36.600 --> 15:43.760
When Minkowski says, you can realize those things by placing them in this geometry where

15:43.760 --> 15:47.440
you get to subtract one of the squares when you're computing distances.

15:47.440 --> 15:52.320
This formula gives a geometric interpretation of what's known as Lorenz transformations,

15:52.320 --> 15:56.920
the equations that allow you to calculate the changes to time and distance that occur

15:56.920 --> 16:00.080
for an object moving close to the speed of light.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.960
The motion of a photon of light always has a space-time interval equal to zero, while

16:04.960 --> 16:10.440
any other object moving below the speed of light has a non-zero space-time interval,

16:10.440 --> 16:15.160
which all inertial observers will measure as being the same value.

16:15.160 --> 16:21.200
It's this one cone, and he's saying the whole world lives in this cone, space-time.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.320
Einstein initially did not like this idea.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.920
He called it superfluous erudition, and said that since the mathematicians have grabbed

16:27.920 --> 16:32.920
hold of the relativity theory, I no longer understand it myself.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.960
Einstein thought this fancy new math obscured the beautiful physics.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.840
But Minkowski's explanation of the four-dimensional cone wasn't just fancy math for the sake

16:41.840 --> 16:43.520
of being complicated.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.760
It actually unlocked new conclusions from special relativity that weren't apparent

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
in Einstein's original version.

16:49.760 --> 16:55.080
In the end, the idea of space-time has become so closely associated with special relativity

16:55.080 --> 17:00.200
that people mistakenly assume that it came from Einstein himself.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.080
Einstein would eventually realize just how much he needed this fancy math to keep developing

17:04.080 --> 17:09.520
his relativity theories, because special relativity had a fundamental limitation.

17:09.520 --> 17:14.760
It only described completely uniform motion, so Einstein still needed a way to talk about

17:14.760 --> 17:17.600
things like acceleration and rotation.

17:17.600 --> 17:22.080
Not only that, but there was an even bigger problem with Newton's laws of gravity.

17:22.080 --> 17:26.640
You have two objects with two masses, there's a universal gravitational constant, and they

17:26.640 --> 17:27.640
pull each other.

17:27.640 --> 17:34.840
The force that one exerts on the other is inverse distance squared, this is the inverse

17:34.840 --> 17:36.000
square law.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.560
But then special theory of relativity says distance is not absolute.

17:42.560 --> 17:48.080
Oh crap, we have a huge problem.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.520
How do we do gravity if distance is in the eye of the beholder?

17:53.600 --> 17:57.880
Because distance is measured by time, and there's this duality between time and distance.

17:57.880 --> 18:05.600
And so can it be that the force acting on this thing depends on where you're standing

18:05.600 --> 18:07.240
and looking at them?

18:07.240 --> 18:13.120
So this is the sort of thing that Einstein's special theory breaks.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
It breaks gravity.

18:14.120 --> 18:18.240
This was when Einstein came upon what he later called the happiest thought of his life.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.840
He imagined a painter falling from the side of a building.

18:21.840 --> 18:26.160
While the man is in free fall, if we ignore the air blowing past him, his experience would

18:26.160 --> 18:31.640
be completely identical to a man floating in a rocket ship in outer space with zero

18:31.640 --> 18:32.640
gravity.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.240
Einstein grabbed onto this idea.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.920
What if acceleration and gravity were in some fundamental way the same thing, two sides

18:38.920 --> 18:40.160
of the same coin?

18:40.160 --> 18:45.080
With that idea in place, Einstein once again set out to construct an argument, brick by

18:45.080 --> 18:49.360
logical brick, that led him to some surprising results.

18:49.360 --> 18:55.240
And then he's able to extrapolate from that, this beautiful theory of general relativity.

18:55.240 --> 19:00.120
And it predicts that light will be bent around a star, except you can't ever look at the

19:00.120 --> 19:03.840
sun to see that happening unless the sun is blocked out by something so that you can

19:03.840 --> 19:05.720
see the stars behind it.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.960
So we wait for the eclipse.

19:07.960 --> 19:12.160
Einstein put out a call to astronomers that they should use a solar eclipse as a chance

19:12.160 --> 19:16.960
to record whether the apparent position of stars is changed when their light rays pass

19:16.960 --> 19:18.600
near the sun to get to us.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.920
But in the meantime, Einstein still needed to come up with a formal system for doing

19:22.920 --> 19:26.600
calculations under his new conception of the universe.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.840
The equations should predict exactly how much the light rays would bend, and they should

19:30.840 --> 19:36.480
also explain why Mercury's orbit deviates ever so slightly from its expected elliptical

19:36.480 --> 19:37.640
path.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.360
To get there, he needed a type of mathematics that could deal precisely with quantities

19:41.360 --> 19:43.960
that changed in complicated ways.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.880
Traditional calculus can do this when we're looking at motion within a flat grid, what

19:47.960 --> 19:53.040
we call Euclidean geometry, but describing the complexities of the universe was going

19:53.040 --> 19:56.240
to take something more powerful and more flexible.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.360
So he called up his old friend Marcel Grossman again.

19:59.360 --> 20:05.680
By now, Grossman had become an expert in exactly the kind of sophisticated non-Euclidean geometry

20:05.680 --> 20:07.880
that Einstein needed for his work.

20:07.880 --> 20:12.240
He thought that Einstein might be able to realize his theory with the help of ideas

20:12.240 --> 20:16.760
developed by mathematician Bernhard Riemann half a century earlier.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.600
Let's do a little crash course in Riemannian geometry.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.760
The fundamental question is what is distance?

20:22.760 --> 20:27.640
And the right way to think about distance, and this is what Riemann understood, is imagine

20:27.640 --> 20:34.280
like a Pringles chip and a tiny little ant on that Pringles chip.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.960
And that ant wants to go somewhere, but of course it can't jump across the Pringles chip.

20:38.960 --> 20:43.240
It has to go down into the chip and then up to the other side or maybe down this way and

20:43.240 --> 20:47.160
up and around, however the ant has to get there, it's going to get there.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.160
And the amount of steps that it takes is the distance.

20:50.160 --> 20:55.800
If she smells something over there, she's not going to go like this because the shortest

20:55.800 --> 20:57.720
path that turns out is like that.

20:57.720 --> 21:02.280
And so that's exactly what Riemann was envisioning.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.920
And what he said is at every single point in your space, let's think of surfaces, okay,

21:06.920 --> 21:08.280
so we have this Pringles chip.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.840
At every point in the Pringles chip, there's a set of tangent vectors, directions in which

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
you can go.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.120
Okay, so that gives you a set of possible directions.

21:17.120 --> 21:22.400
And then a geodesic, a shortest path, so you can sort of count the number of steps that

21:22.400 --> 21:24.480
the ant took to get from here to here.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.400
And then you can think about all possible paths the ant could have taken.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.080
And the geodesic is the path that minimizes the total number of steps.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.120
Riemann's mathematics makes this correct infinitesimally.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.440
Riemann had devised a system where not only could the distance be measured differently

21:38.440 --> 21:43.440
at every point, but the math can account for as many different variables as you need.

21:43.440 --> 21:49.160
And he realized that once he started using these algebraic methods for writing what it

21:49.160 --> 21:53.120
means to be a three-dimensional manifold, well, you have x1, x2, x3.

21:53.120 --> 21:58.360
He's like, wait a second, x4, x5, x17.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.760
Nothing is stopping me from doing this in general dimension.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.440
And this really blew people's mind.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.960
They're like, what do you mean 17 dimension?

22:04.200 --> 22:05.400
And he's like, no, don't worry about it.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
It's just algebra.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.200
I can make a 17-tuple of numbers, right?

22:10.200 --> 22:14.680
We have temperature, pressure, wind speed, whatever.

22:14.680 --> 22:19.560
We have all kinds of different ways of describing the situation at a point.

22:19.560 --> 22:24.000
Well, I shouldn't things be multi-dimensional beyond three dimensions.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.360
Einstein and Grossman worked to bring these concepts together with Mankowski's four-dimensional

22:28.360 --> 22:32.560
cone method, where the square of the time dimension was subtracted.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.280
That is what general relativity is.

22:34.280 --> 22:38.760
It's this way of measuring distances where instead of summing squares, you sum three

22:38.760 --> 22:42.000
of the squares and subtract the fourth square.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.240
But you do this differently at every point, depending on the mass.

22:47.240 --> 22:51.280
Einstein dove into this formal mathematical approach that he had previously turned up

22:51.280 --> 22:52.520
his nose to.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.360
He was finally starting to appreciate the power that this kind of math had to discover

22:56.360 --> 22:58.520
new insights about the universe.

22:58.520 --> 23:03.440
He wrote to a colleague, I have gained enormous respect for mathematics, whose more subtle

23:03.440 --> 23:08.400
parts I considered until now in my ignorance as pure luxury.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.000
But Einstein wasn't completely converted over to this fancy math just yet.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.160
In his multi-year quest for the equations of general relativity, he also tried strategies

23:17.160 --> 23:20.520
based around his intuitions for the laws of physics.

23:20.520 --> 23:24.640
He hoped that he could still use the kind of simple axiomatic thinking that had worked

23:24.640 --> 23:26.800
so well for him in the past.

23:26.800 --> 23:31.440
At one point in 1912, Einstein and Grossman had arrived at some formulas that turned out

23:31.440 --> 23:37.400
to be very close to what would ultimately be Einstein's final version of general relativity.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.240
But Einstein threw it out.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.200
He was having trouble understanding how to make the formulas co-variant.

23:43.200 --> 23:48.280
In other words, since relativity implies that there's no one definitive frame of reference,

23:48.280 --> 23:53.360
any relativity formula has to give the same result no matter what frame of reference or

23:53.360 --> 23:55.600
coordinate system you use.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.040
Unfortunately the math behind this gets quite complicated, and apparently it was even too

24:00.040 --> 24:02.840
complicated for Einstein himself at the time.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.400
So Einstein threw out the fancy Riemannian math.

24:05.400 --> 24:10.880
He hoped that he could still use his uncanny intuition for the physical laws of the universe

24:10.880 --> 24:14.240
to work out his theory of general relativity.

24:14.240 --> 24:20.520
Soon he had a new set of formulas which he published as what he called an outline paper.

24:20.520 --> 24:26.080
The formulas in this paper have since been described as having no clear geometric meaning.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.560
It seemed almost like Einstein had tried to just throw something together after getting

24:29.560 --> 24:32.520
too frustrated with the difficult math.

24:32.520 --> 24:37.040
After publishing this paper, he struggled for close to three years to refine the formulas

24:37.040 --> 24:41.760
and get them to work, but eventually he found a clear-cut mistake.

24:41.760 --> 24:45.960
As soon as he saw it, he dug out his old notebooks where he was using the Riemannian approach

24:45.960 --> 24:48.200
and got back to work with those.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.520
By now, the clock was ticking.

24:50.520 --> 24:55.880
An influential mathematician in Göttingen named David Hilbert was working to develop

24:55.880 --> 25:00.480
his own gravitational field equations based on Einstein's theories.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.520
Einstein and Hilbert were kindred spirits.

25:02.520 --> 25:07.280
Hilbert had published a book with a new set of geometric axioms that fixed some of the

25:07.280 --> 25:12.160
flaws in Euclid's work, and he and Einstein had a mutual respect for each other's intellectual

25:12.160 --> 25:16.240
independence and shared pacifism during the height of World War I.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.880
But Einstein didn't want to be beaten to the punch with his own theory just yet.

25:19.880 --> 25:24.200
The race to finish his general relativity formulas was the most intense four weeks of

25:24.200 --> 25:25.200
his life.

25:25.200 --> 25:30.640
Finally, he knew he had it when his equations predicted Mercury's strange orbit perfectly.

25:30.640 --> 25:35.200
Exhausted and in constant stomach pain, he delivered his finished theory across four

25:35.200 --> 25:37.880
presentations in November of 1915.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.360
Hilbert submitted his paper at virtually the same time, but later added a correction that

25:42.360 --> 25:46.880
brought his work in line with Einstein's, and he graciously deferred credit to Einstein

25:46.880 --> 25:52.560
for both the original theory and for being the first to arrive at the correct mathematics.

25:52.560 --> 25:57.200
The next great test of Einstein's theory would be to find out whether his predictions

25:57.200 --> 26:01.600
about what would happen to the stars during a solar eclipse would come true.

26:01.600 --> 26:06.880
His final equations predicted that the displacement would be twice as large as the prediction

26:06.880 --> 26:12.800
that comes from Newton's equations if light is assumed to be made of particles with mass.

26:12.800 --> 26:17.560
Einstein's general relativity paper managed to make its way across the English Channel

26:17.560 --> 26:22.480
during the height of World War I to a British astronomer named Sir Arthur Eddington.

26:22.480 --> 26:27.040
Eddington was a fellow pacifist and hoped that science could be used to bridge the divisions

26:27.040 --> 26:31.760
of the Great War if a British team were to validate a German theory.

26:31.760 --> 26:37.760
Eddington assembled two teams to photograph an eclipse that was coming on May 29, 1919.

26:37.760 --> 26:43.540
By then, the war had finally ended, and one team headed to Sobral, Brazil, while Eddington

26:43.540 --> 26:49.200
traveled with the other team to the island of Príncipe off the western coast of Africa.

26:49.200 --> 26:53.400
Both teams managed to take photographs of the moment, but it took several months of

26:53.400 --> 26:58.880
analysis back in England before Eddington was ready to announce his results.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.040
Einstein waited nervously in Berlin to hear the news.

27:02.040 --> 27:07.340
By September, word had come through that the data was looking good, but it wasn't until

27:07.340 --> 27:13.760
a public presentation at the London Astronomical Society on November 6th that the world would

27:13.760 --> 27:15.720
find out.

27:15.720 --> 27:19.520
The next day, the Times of London printed the triumphant headline,

27:19.520 --> 27:24.360
Revolution in Science, New Theory of the Universe, Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.

27:24.360 --> 27:38.440
And like that, Einstein was famous.

27:38.440 --> 27:42.680
The reason it was so wild is Einstein moves the heavens.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.120
He's fighting the gods just like the Greeks are fighting the gods.

27:45.120 --> 27:50.200
For a world still processing the trauma from one of the deadliest wars in human history,

27:50.200 --> 27:55.200
the idea of a German Jew and a British Quaker working together to advance humanity's shared

27:55.200 --> 28:00.200
understanding of the universe was a much needed moment of triumph.

28:00.200 --> 28:05.040
Relativity became a symbol of this new modern world, and Einstein was that world's first

28:05.040 --> 28:06.960
celebrity scientist.

28:06.960 --> 28:11.400
More predictions of general relativity have since been verified, including some that Einstein

28:11.400 --> 28:16.960
initially didn't even believe himself, such as the existence of black holes.

28:16.960 --> 28:22.640
Not only that, the equations of general relativity are crucial for modern technology like GPS,

28:22.640 --> 28:28.360
because the clocks aboard the satellites can't synchronize with the Earth without it.

28:28.360 --> 28:33.400
For Einstein, his almost childlike intuition that there's an underlying structure to the

28:33.400 --> 28:39.840
entire universe, and his lifelong reliance on axiomatic arguments needed to team up with

28:39.840 --> 28:45.800
some of the most cutting edge abstract math available in order to get to his new comprehensive

28:45.880 --> 28:48.160
understanding of the universe.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.240
I want to come back to Riemann for a second.

28:50.240 --> 28:54.080
Do you think he would have been surprised to find out that this math that he made was

28:54.080 --> 28:56.400
what Einstein needed for general relativity?

28:56.400 --> 29:00.080
Yes, I think that would be very much a surprise to Riemann.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.680
I'm curious if you have a different reaction, but to me, I just kind of feel this sense

29:04.680 --> 29:12.180
of like amazement that there was this math that Riemann made for math's sake, and it

29:12.180 --> 29:19.580
ended up being the exact thing that Einstein needed to like figure out the secrets of the

29:19.580 --> 29:21.100
universe basically.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.900
This happens all the time.

29:22.900 --> 29:23.980
This is why we exist.

29:23.980 --> 29:26.660
This is I think why I have a job.

29:26.660 --> 29:29.820
Because humanity has realized that you leave the mathematicians alone, they'll come up

29:29.820 --> 29:34.840
with some cockamamie 17 dimensional curved space theory that nobody will give a damn

29:34.840 --> 29:40.300
about for 60 years until someone comes along and says, wait a second, this is exactly the

29:40.300 --> 29:43.140
mathematics I need to do general relativity.

29:43.140 --> 29:44.140
It's amazing.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.140
It's amazing.

29:45.140 --> 29:49.740
It's amazing that the world is so well governed by mathematical laws, or approximated, shall

29:49.740 --> 29:50.740
we say.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.540
Not governed by, but approximated by mathematical laws.

29:53.540 --> 29:57.060
Years later, Einstein received a fan letter from a young student.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.660
She wrote that she was worried about her math class.

29:59.660 --> 30:02.580
I have to work longer in it than most of my friends.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.620
I worry, perhaps too much.

30:04.620 --> 30:09.040
A few days later, Einstein sent her a gracious reply.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.560
He wrote, do not worry about your problems with mathematics, because I can assure you

30:13.560 --> 30:15.920
that mine are still greater.
