0	4160	If you actually look at the story of Jesus, it's an insane story because even if you know
4160	11040	traditional storytelling, it's like you don't have stories where someone is like a warrior and a king
11040	16720	and a shepherd and a worker and a monk and he's like all these categories jammed into this one
16720	22160	story like this doesn't make sense but that's the point. Grab all these story structures, these
22160	25760	aspects of the gods. It's interesting because a lot of the people that have tried to criticize
25760	30960	Christianity will say well Jesus is just a copy on all these old gods and it's like yeah I mean
30960	36880	all of them like every single one of them like he's all these weird things that would never
36880	41600	for a pagan be brought together and so it's like that's it so it's like you look at the image of
41600	49760	that person on the throne and it's like it's that that condensation and then that person he is the
49840	55600	source but he also ends up being the judge because he's the standard by which all the
55600	59760	multiple aspects get compared to or the through line.
