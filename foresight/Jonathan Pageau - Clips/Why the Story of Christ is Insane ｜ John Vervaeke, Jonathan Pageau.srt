00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
If you actually look at the story of Jesus, it's an insane story because even if you know

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,040
traditional storytelling, it's like you don't have stories where someone is like a warrior and a king

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,720
and a shepherd and a worker and a monk and he's like all these categories jammed into this one

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,160
story like this doesn't make sense but that's the point. Grab all these story structures, these

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
aspects of the gods. It's interesting because a lot of the people that have tried to criticize

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,960
Christianity will say well Jesus is just a copy on all these old gods and it's like yeah I mean

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,880
all of them like every single one of them like he's all these weird things that would never

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
for a pagan be brought together and so it's like that's it so it's like you look at the image of

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,760
that person on the throne and it's like it's that that condensation and then that person he is the

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,600
source but he also ends up being the judge because he's the standard by which all the

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,760
multiple aspects get compared to or the through line.
