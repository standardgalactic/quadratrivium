If you actually look at the story of Jesus, it's an insane story because even if you know

00:04.160 --> 00:11.040
traditional storytelling, it's like you don't have stories where someone is like a warrior and a king

00:11.040 --> 00:16.720
and a shepherd and a worker and a monk and he's like all these categories jammed into this one

00:16.720 --> 00:22.160
story like this doesn't make sense but that's the point. Grab all these story structures, these

00:22.160 --> 00:25.760
aspects of the gods. It's interesting because a lot of the people that have tried to criticize

00:25.760 --> 00:30.960
Christianity will say well Jesus is just a copy on all these old gods and it's like yeah I mean

00:30.960 --> 00:36.880
all of them like every single one of them like he's all these weird things that would never

00:36.880 --> 00:41.600
for a pagan be brought together and so it's like that's it so it's like you look at the image of

00:41.600 --> 00:49.760
that person on the throne and it's like it's that that condensation and then that person he is the

00:49.840 --> 00:55.600
source but he also ends up being the judge because he's the standard by which all the

00:55.600 --> 00:59.760
multiple aspects get compared to or the through line.
