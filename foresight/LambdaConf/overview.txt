 In JavaScript, the `===` operator is used for strict equality comparison between two values—one of which must be the specified value and the other must be of the same type (the same value and same type). On the other hand, the `==` operator performs a type-coercion equality comparison. It converts both operands to a common value type before making the comparison.

Here's a summary of the differences:

1. **Strict Equality (`===`)**: The two values must be of the same type and must be equal. For example, `0 === false` will return `false` because 0 is not the same type as `false`.

2. **Equality with Type Coercion (`==`)**: The two values may be of different types, and if so, JavaScript attempts to convert both values into a common value type before making the comparison. For example, `0 == false` will return `true` because JavaScript coerces both values into boolean contexts where they are treated as `false` (falsy) and `true` (truthy), respectively.

In your original question about applying an `and` function with a partially applied `true`, you were discussing a concept from functional programming where functions can be composed and manipulated as first-class citizens. In JavaScript, everything is indeed an expression, including numbers, strings, and even functions themselves. The language treats all these entities similarly in terms of how they can be used within expressions and function calls.
