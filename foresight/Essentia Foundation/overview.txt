Checking Essentia Foundation/Spacetime is just a headsetï¼š An interview with Donald Hoffman.txt
 In this conversation, Bernardo Kastrup discusses his philosophical views and the influence of his upbringing on his perspective. His father, who was a fundamental Protestant minister, had mixed feelings about Bernardo's work, particularly because it suggested that consciousness is fundamental to reality, which aligned with some of his religious beliefs. However, their views diverged significantly when it came to the nature of God and creation.

Bernardo explains that while he respects the framework of scientific models like evolution and the age of the Earth within their context, he believes that from an ultimate standpoint, these notions are projections or artifacts of our perception and thus are not strictly true outside the context of their own assumptions.

He emphasizes the importance of using new and deeper pointers in understanding consciousness, suggesting that a combination of spiritual insights and scientific rigor can lead to a more nuanced and evolving understanding of reality. Bernardo argues that mathematics, particularly his work on the implication that space-time is not fundamental but an emergent phenomenon, serves as a powerful tool to challenge dogmatic views in both science and spirituality.

He invites a deeper integration of mathematical insights into spiritual discussions, proposing that such sermons would be highly beneficial for personal growth and the avoidance of dogmatism. The conversation touches on the nature of reality, the evolution of understanding, and the interplay between science and spirituality in exploring the depths of consciousness.
