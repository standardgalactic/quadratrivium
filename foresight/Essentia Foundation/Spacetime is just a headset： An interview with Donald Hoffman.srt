1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Space-time is just our headset, but we lose ourselves in the game.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,960
And we take the game as the reality.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,960
For Essencia Foundation, I had the honor of sitting down with one of my absolute intellectual

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,200
heroes, cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, to discuss the nature of reality.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,920
Before I share our full conversation, here are some of the highlights.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,560
I'll say this, there is no physicalist theory that has at any time proposed a specific conscious

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,280
experience that they can explain.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,920
There's not one on the table.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,120
The distinction that we make between conscious and unconscious, and between living and non-living,

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,000
is not a principle distinction.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,760
It's a mistake.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,360
It's a rookie mistake that we make by mistaking our space-time headset for the final truth.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,440
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:12,160
How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,560
Were you happy with the movie The Matrix, what it did sort of culturally with that metaphor?

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,600
The Matrix really does open people's minds up to the possibility that what they're experiencing

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,600
is just a simulation, right?

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Now in The Matrix, though, once you pop out of the simulation, there's another space-time

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
world.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:42,800
So when Neo takes off the headset, he's back in the space-time world.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,320
So it's Trinity and everybody, they're all in the space-time world.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,160
So what I'm saying is even more radical, that whatever is beyond space-time is utterly

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,080
unlike space and time.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,080
But this is like fundamental stuff, right?

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
This is the real cool stuff.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,920
We are still thinking of traveling in space-time, and we have all these space-time fantasies.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Most of the galaxies that we can see, we could never go to.

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Space is expanding so quickly that we could never get to them through space, moving at

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
the speed of light.

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
So there's all this real estate out there that we can see that's waving at us and saying,

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,920
nanny, nanny, you can never get here.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,520
Well, that's if you go through space-time.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,000
But if space-time is just a headset, think about the options that come, you don't have

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to go through space-time.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
You could go around space-time.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,080
When we let go of the physicalist framework, we say, no, I am consciousness.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
I transcend this.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,600
Death is just stepping out of this headset.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,840
In other words, we're wired up to take the headset seriously, and so consciousness wired

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,640
itself up to take the headset seriously.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,480
But part of the waking up process is to step back and go, oh, wow, okay, oh, no, no.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm not a little thing inside the headset.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
The headset is inside of me.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm eventually going to take the headset off.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
So I can have a looser relationship with all this stuff.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,520
I don't need to get that big house to be something.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,080
I don't need to have that big scientific paper.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't need to be acknowledged.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,480
Has it done this for you, Donald?

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
Has it done this for you, what you're now saying?

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,760
Yeah, sort of this realization in your personal life?

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,240
It's interesting.

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,000
It does it for me when I am conscious.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay, great.

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,760
Donald, I'm really, really happy that we can do this.

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,720
So nice to have you on the other side and sitting here.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Thank you very much, Hansen.

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,280
It's a very kind of you to invite me.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,240
Yeah, we just spoke about your background.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,840
I thought if it's okay with you to start a bit on a personal note, could you tell a little

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,160
bit about your background and your upbringing?

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,840
Well, I was born in an army hospital in San Antonio, Texas.

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
My dad was a GI.

64
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
He was just trying to find himself.

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,200
We went into the army, newly wed, and I was born nine months later.

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:19,080
So they were both just like 21 and trying to figure things out, and they were having

67
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,360
a hard time making ends meet.

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,720
They didn't have enough money to eat at the end of the month, so it was quite something.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,760
But six months after I was born, they moved to California.

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,200
So I basically was raised in Southern California all of my life, and he was an engineer, and

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,800
my mom, she had a bachelor's in biology, and she ended up doing some computer programming

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
when I was about 10 years old.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,040
She was one of the early programmers and sort of got me interested in computers.

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
My dad was an engineer.

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,480
He had a master's in chemistry and worked at various high tech companies that were at

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,440
the early stages of building storage devices for computers and so forth.

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:11,560
And then he became a Christian when I was 10 or 11 years old, and that changed things

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,060
quite a bit.

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:22,320
My parents both jumped into it pretty heavily, and by the time I was in my mid to late teens,

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,800
he was an associate pastor at a church and went on for decades afterwards to be a pastor.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,960
So I was really, from about age 10 on, really raised pretty heavily in a fundamentalist

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,920
Christian Protestant kind of background.

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,560
So it was pretty intense, and of course, well, in my case, I was the oldest.

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
I didn't rebel.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
I went along.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
It took me a long time to get a perspective, to be able to step back and start to get a

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
perspective on it.

88
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:07,960
My younger brother rebelled earlier, and my sister has never rebelled to this day.

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,400
And did you ever personally believe, did you have the faith as well as a teenager?

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,920
Well, yeah, I believed in God, and my thoughts about that have changed over the years with

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,520
what that word actually means, but there is a sense in which I still think that consciousness

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,960
is fundamental, and the grandfather in a chair with a long white beard is not what I think

93
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
of when I think of consciousness.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,240
So it had a big influence on me, both positive and negative.

95
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,480
It really made me think about things beyond space and time, but I think it made me think

96
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,040
about them in not very functional ways.

97
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,880
And so I had to step back and really sort out what were, I mean, there are beautiful

98
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
things when Jesus says, love your neighbor as yourself.

99
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,040
That's, I mean, there's many, many beautiful things, but it's a mixed bag.

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:14,080
And so we each have to sort out that mixed bag and take what is really good and try to

101
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,960
be kind to everybody in the process.

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,520
But I think it's so great that your work offers, in a sense, I think a refuge.

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,760
I mean, that it is to me, alongside with people like Bernardo and more people who think consciousness

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,080
might be fundamental.

105
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,800
So I think that's really great that you're offering that intellectually through science

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
to people.

107
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,680
And a question I had has to do with the, I hear you say a lot in interviews that you

108
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,400
want to make things mathematically rigorous, right?

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,840
And I am not a mathematician.

110
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,720
Understanding of math does not sort of extend beyond high school.

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,880
And what exactly, if you had to define, and that's maybe a two, a weird or broad question,

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,640
but what is math exactly?

113
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Is it sort of a symbolic representation of reality?

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
I mean, that's what I now think.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,680
But how would you define mathematics?

116
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,640
So mathematics is the way of getting rid of fuzzy thinking and hand waving and therefore

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
the dogmatism that can come with it.

118
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,960
Because I know what's right.

119
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Because if you try to come at me with some argument, then I'll just sort of change my

120
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,560
view enough so that, but if I put it down in an equation, then it's hard for me to dodge

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
and weave.

122
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,640
It's not impossible, but it makes it much, much harder to dodge and weave.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,000
So mathematics is infinitely complicated.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,480
This is a Girdel, Kurt Girdel in 1930, 1931, when he was a young man, like 25 years old,

125
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,120
proved perhaps one of the greatest intellectual achievements in all of human history.

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,520
It was called Girdel's incompleteness theorem.

127
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Without going into the details, it entails that there's no end to the exploration of

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,120
mathematical structure.

129
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
In some sense, it seems to me that it entails that you can't be omniscient about mathematics

130
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
because it just really, we'll put it this way, the kind of omniscience involved would

131
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,640
be stunning omniscience.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,560
It would have to, I would have to, is beyond my conception of the kind of omniscience that

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,640
would be needed to have a full comprehension of the math.

134
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,480
Finally, any finite formal system is, Girdel shows us, merely a scratch on the surface

135
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,640
of this infinite depth of mathematics.

136
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,280
And so that means that math is a two-edged sword here.

137
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,600
On the one hand, it cuts through our dogmatism and our fuzzy thinking.

138
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,840
And so it's absolutely essential.

139
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,400
Because one thing we know about human nature is that we're dogmatic.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,640
We know what we know, and we know that the other guy's wrong, and we're not in conversations

141
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,680
typically to learn, we're in conversations to show other people that we're right and

142
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,960
they're wrong, with happy exceptions.

143
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,560
But with mathematics, when you're forced to state your ideas with mathematical precision,

144
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
there's no hiding, right?

145
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,200
And when I say, for example, that I think that consciousness is fundamental, and then

146
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,640
I say, and here's what I claim the structure of consciousness is.

147
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
And so I write down some math.

148
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,600
Now I get the other, so that's the first side of the sword, and it's wonderful, right?

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,360
It really cuts through dogmatism and fuzzy thinking and dodging and weaving.

150
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,560
On the other hand, Girdel has told us that essentially there's infinite wisdom beyond

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,040
any formal theory that you could write down.

152
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,320
Yeah, by proven by math itself, that's so astonishing.

153
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
It's proven by mathematics.

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:57,720
It's really, truly stunning that the mathematics itself gives us the insight that no mathematics

155
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,720
that we could do is ever the whole truth, and in fact, that there's essentially unbounded

156
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,520
intelligence of mathematics beyond what you could do with what, and who knows, and mathematics

157
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,480
isn't the whole world, but that's just part of it, certainly part of reality.

158
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,320
And so already we know that reality transcends any mathematical theory, so that also entails

159
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,080
that there can be no scientific theory of everything.

160
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,920
And yeah, yeah, it makes us humble, right, Girdel made us humble.

161
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,880
It's very, very humbling, and so what we have then, so someone might say, well, just throw

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,040
up your hands, you know, let's just party and, you know, we can't know it all, then

163
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
why know anything?

164
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,840
And I think that that's the wrong attitude, it's not my attitude anyway.

165
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:56,000
It is, we do have this wonderful tool, and we do find that it is incredibly effective.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,560
Eugene Wigner has said that the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural

167
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,680
sciences, he was amazed at it, and a lot of us agree.

168
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,880
It's truly stunning that using Newton, Newton's equations, we can send rockets to planets,

169
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,480
and it works quite well.

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,000
And with Einstein's equations, we get even, you know, greater fidelity, and with quantum

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,640
theory, you know, well Maxwell's equations and quantum theory, we're talking literally

172
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,080
on opposite sides of the world using technology that would not be possible without the mathematics,

173
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,120
absolutely not.

174
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:38,800
And so the mathematics is at once empowering, and it avoids dogmatism, and it really then

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,040
is humbling.

176
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,200
Once you really understand it, it's truly humbling, and so, and I think for me, it then

177
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,560
is a pointer to a way of thinking about what is consciousness about.

178
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,800
If consciousness is all there is, then mathematical structure is only about consciousness, because

179
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,360
that's all it's there for it to be about.

180
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:07,240
So, then Gertl is telling us that there's no end to the variety of conscious experiences

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
and conscious activity.

182
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,080
Whatever consciousness is, is literally unbounded, because mathematics is unbounded.

183
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah, I'd love to go a bit deeper into that, but I'd first like to ask you, you just said,

184
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,240
I mean, it avoids mathematics, avoids fuzzy thinking, right?

185
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,160
And we, I'd like to talk a bit about sort of the two paradigms, physicalism versus

186
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
idealism.

187
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,480
It's a big spectrum, of course, there's a lot in between.

188
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,560
But could you sort of sketch our Newtonian worldview and how we always thought about

189
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,480
consciousness and why that felt so scientific or scientifically correct, and what quantum

190
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,160
theory did do that notion?

191
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Right, so many of the early scientists, like Newton himself, were actually believers in

192
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:03,280
God and Christians, and Newton apparently wrote more theology than physics.

193
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,840
His, the Newtonian world was essentially a mechanical world.

194
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,320
You could write down these differential equations, and if you knew the starting conditions with

195
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
precision, then you could predict pretty much everything that was going to happen going

196
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
forward.

197
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,320
And so, it led others like George Barclay to, who was a bishop in the Christian Church

198
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,080
of England or something like that, to come up with his version of idealism as sort of

199
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,840
a counter to what he viewed was the, the mechanism, the mechanical view of the universe that came

200
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,480
from Newton.

201
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,680
So he, he was a reaction in part against that.

202
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:56,120
And but eventually, you know, idealism had a heyday in the 1800s, but in the 1900s it,

203
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,520
sort of died out, largely died out, the success of Newton, and then the success of, you know,

204
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,880
Einstein's special in general relativity theories, and then the success of quantum mechanics.

205
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:20,160
Now, with quantum mechanics, the early theorists, many of them like Mox Planck, for example,

206
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,080
clearly thought that space and time were not the fun, not the final thing.

207
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,080
They, they thought, you know, Mox Planck was very, very clearly thought consciousness was

208
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,280
fundamental, and he, he said so.

209
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,960
And there was a period in which many of the early thinkers in quantum theory, you know,

210
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,880
from like 1926, 1925, until World War II.

211
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,920
So that, that period in there, there was a lot of soul searching about what was quantum

212
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,760
mechanics telling us deeply about who we are and the nature of the universe and, and is

213
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,800
the physicalist idea that space and time and matter are fundamental.

214
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,880
So those, I mean, that's the, that's the physicalist idea.

215
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,400
Space time is fundamental, and the particles in space time, you know, quarks, leptons and bosons,

216
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,920
those are our new fundamental particles right now.

217
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,920
That, that is the fundamental grounding reality, and everything else is just a complicated pattern

218
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,760
of the interactions of, of those particles in space time.

219
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,320
Many quantum theorists began to question that early on, but after the start of World War

220
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,520
II, things changed.

221
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,160
We got the shut up and calculate kind of attitude because physics now, you know, in quantum physics

222
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,520
became put in service of, of the war, and, and it became highly funded and it made the

223
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,560
atom bomb and, and all of a sudden it was a completely different thing.

224
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,040
And so that, the, the early generation that started, that were thinking, what does this

225
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
really mean?

226
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,320
That, that really got shut down in large part by World War II, but, but more recently than

227
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,680
it, you know, like the conference that we'll be having here at Chatham, there's been a

228
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,680
lot of thought now about the nature of what our current physics theories are telling.

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Quantum field theory now, with gravity, you know, trying to understand how those interact,

230
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,720
has, has led some, but not too many, physicists to, to once again wonder whether consciousness

231
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
is fundamental.

232
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,920
That, that, I would say, not, I don't know too many physicists.

233
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,800
I've been to an FQXI conference a few years ago on the role of the observer in, in quantum

234
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,960
theory and it, it became very, very clear there that the idea that consciousness might

235
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,560
be fundamental was, was basically not on the table.

236
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,560
It, it, it's, it's not taken seriously, but what is taken seriously is that space time

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,640
is doomed.

238
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,920
That's really interesting, you know, and we're, we're talking big, big giants in, in physics.

239
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Ed Whitten has said that, who, one of the ones who's been foundational in string theory,

240
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
M theory.

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Nathan Seiberg at the Institute for Advanced Study, and then very influential, Nima, or

242
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,040
Connie Hamed, who's also at the Institute for Advanced Study, and, and it's, it's become

243
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,400
very, very clear from the actual structure of the physical laws themselves that space

244
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
time cannot be fundamental.

245
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,920
And this is, again, where the mathematics is really powerful, just like Gertl used the

246
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,040
mathematics to show that mathematics, at least any finite axiomatization of mathematics,

247
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,480
can't be the whole thing.

248
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
So the physicists are using the theory of space time to show that space time can't be

249
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,680
the whole thing, and that is the beauty of the mathematics.

250
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,380
It tells you where the theories stop.

251
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,340
This is where space, space time is great.

252
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,980
It's a wonderful framework for a while.

253
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,480
And here is where it stops.

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,220
It stops at about 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

255
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,540
It ceases to have any operational meaning.

256
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,460
And what happens, but you're referring to the Planck scale, right?

257
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,340
The smallest scale that we have in physics.

258
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:37,340
What exactly happens at that, at that scale that makes you say space time is doomed?

259
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,940
So, of course, I'm not a physicist, so I'm telling you what the physicists say.

260
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,860
But what the physicists will tell you is that the way that you probe smaller and smaller

261
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,620
regions of space, in other words, to have a better and better microscope to look at smaller

262
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,820
and smaller details, you need to have wavelengths of light that are getting finer and finer,

263
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,540
because you have to have fine wavelengths of light to resolve fine detail in what you're

264
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,540
looking at.

265
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,500
Well, that's fine.

266
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,420
Requires more energy.

267
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,780
From quantum theory, we understand that the energy is proportional to the frequency, E

268
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,300
equals h nu.

269
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,180
So as the frequency goes up, you need more energy.

270
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,700
So that's fine.

271
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,100
So unless there's gravity, and that's the problem.

272
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,180
So if it was just quantum mechanics, you could, in principle, go as far as you wanted, as

273
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,700
much energy as you wanted.

274
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:34,340
But the problem is with gravity and Einstein, energy and mass are equivalent.

275
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,700
So as you put more and more energy into a smaller and smaller region of space, you're

276
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,420
essentially putting more mass into a small region of space, and then, unfortunately,

277
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,940
you, at some point, at around 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, you just start creating black

278
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
holes.

279
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,580
And so the very thing that you're trying to study no longer exists.

280
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,580
And if you put more energy, if you say, I'm frustrated, I'm just going to try to go smaller

281
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,140
with higher and higher frequencies, you just make the black hole bigger.

282
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,860
So the problem literally grows.

283
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,100
So that's one reason.

284
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,420
The second reason is that in quantum theory, the measuring devices themselves, the thing

285
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,700
that you're using to measure the spin of the electron or the position of the gluon or something

286
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,100
like that, these devices themselves are physical devices.

287
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,460
And so they're quantum mechanical systems with their own degrees of freedom.

288
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,460
And therefore, they have their own limits of precision, Heisenberg uncertainty kinds

289
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
of things.

290
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,580
And so if you want more and more precise measurements, you have to have more and more degrees of

291
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,380
freedom in those measuring devices, which is going to make them heavier and heavier.

292
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,780
And at some point, once again, the device will collapse into a black hole.

293
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,900
So if you have a small, if you have a room and you're trying to measure something in

294
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,540
a room, it turns out there is nothing that you can measure with precision.

295
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,420
So there are no local observables in any part of space and time.

296
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,660
Yeah. So if you want to pinpoint space time down to the smallest and really know what

297
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,260
it is at the smallest level, it will blow in your face.

298
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,540
It will become a black hole and that's right.

299
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,820
And beyond that, then the very notion of space and time of lengths and distances and time

300
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,500
beyond that level simply has no operational meaning.

301
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,780
So we're not they're not saying that there are pixels that at the bottom level, there

302
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,180
are these pixels like the pixels on your screen of your computer screen or something

303
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
like that.

304
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,460
No, it just means that the whole notion of space time itself ceases to make sense.

305
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,220
So it stops. Space time is doomed. It cannot.

306
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,220
So this is a huge blow because with Newton, right, space time is fundamental, although

307
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,260
Newton believed it was more of a dualist view because he thought that there was a God beyond

308
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
space time.

309
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,740
But once the scientific world let go of that, then it's just space time and it's part

310
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,820
of the particles are fundamental.

311
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,540
And we thought we thought that it was infinitely deep.

312
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,180
You know, you could always we thought reductionism was going to work.

313
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,620
We could just go to smaller and smaller scales in space time to find more and more fundamental

314
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
laws.

315
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,180
And so and with with, you know, Boltzmann and his work on thermodynamics and so forth,

316
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,860
we had our first taste that maybe something like that could really work that we could

317
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,140
not the first taste, but a compelling taste that that kind of reductionist thing could

318
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
really work.

319
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,740
So we were off to the races with reductionism reductionism would be yeah, reductionism is

320
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,180
so I understand this, but this is just for people watching this reductionism means going

321
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:38,420
down into space time, the smallest building blocks of space time and see if we can understand

322
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,900
that. And if we understand that we then we have lost that sort of govern everything bigger,

323
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,580
including consciousness.

324
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,620
That's right. So it's going to be as we go to smaller and smaller scales will just find

325
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:58,500
deeper and deeper laws. And so that was that was the the dream. And it's a new tonic.

326
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,300
But Donald, what I'm very curious about your take on quantum mechanics or at least how

327
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:10,100
you would explain it. I've read this book, Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum and Fred

328
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:16,980
Cutner. I heard it was sort of a good introductionary book. And I found it very, very, very good.

329
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,540
And they say with quantum theory, physics and counter consciousness. And I was just

330
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,060
wondering, I've read the book, and I still find it hard to sort of retell it to people

331
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:33,500
because it's just so counterintuitive. How would you explain that that in quantum theory?

332
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,660
Or I mean, if you agree, did physics encounter consciousness?

333
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Well, some of the earlier pioneers of quantum theory did think that. So Max Planck, I think,

334
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,700
Schrodinger, arguably, Wigner, some things that von Neumann writes, wrote seem along

335
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,700
those lines, although I won't pin them with that. But I would say, when I talk to modern

336
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:11,100
day quantum physicists, I don't, when they talk about the role of the observer in quantum

337
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,940
theory, the observer is a technical term. It's some kind of measuring device, perhaps

338
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:22,940
another quantum system, another physical system. And the idea that consciousness is fundamental

339
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,780
is a tiny minority view. I would say under 1% in my interactions. They understand that

340
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,980
in many of the interpretations of quantum theory that we need to have some notion of

341
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,980
the role of the observer, although in the many worlds or multiverse kinds of interpretations

342
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,220
you can start to let go of that role of the observer in some sense. But they have their

343
00:25:52,220 --> 00:26:02,180
own problems. So I would say that for those who want to ignore consciousness and still

344
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:08,820
be quantum theorists, they can do that. And many, many brilliant physicists are doing

345
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,580
just that. Even the ones who take the notion of agency as really important in quantum theory

346
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:28,620
that somehow the wave function is not a state of the external world independent of the agent,

347
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,900
but is actually a statement of the degrees of belief of the agent about the outcomes

348
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,180
that they will experience if they do certain experiments, certain measurements. But even

349
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:46,180
in that case, and the theorists doing this are brilliant, most of them are going to say,

350
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,540
I don't know what an agent is, and I'm not going to commit that it's consciousness. I'm

351
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,060
just talking about, I'm doing quantum theory, you tell me what an agent is, but it's probably

352
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,780
going to be some kind of, when we really cash it out, it's probably going to be some kind

353
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,220
of quantum physical system with just lots of degrees and freedom and so forth. But don't

354
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,980
worry with me about that right now. I'm just going to assume that there's some notion of

355
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,980
agent that will leave undefined. So I don't see, what I do see is brilliant researchers

356
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:26,180
like Neymar, Connie Hamed and Juan Maldesena making bold moves beyond space-time. They're

357
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,340
saying there is, space-time is doomed. It's the work of our generation to find out what's

358
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,860
beyond space-time. So how do you do that? What kind of flashlight are you going to use

359
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:45,860
into the dark beyond space-time? Because even though quantum field theory and gravity together

360
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,860
tell us that space-time isn't fundamental, they can't tell us what's beyond. They just

361
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,020
say, this is how far I go and no further, but they can't tell you what's next.

362
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,540
But when you say you think consciousness is fundamental, you are not in the school of

363
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,740
and indeed you're right. That is a minority. I think the consciousness causes collapse sort

364
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,980
of interpretation of quantum mechanics. Von Neumann, who still sort of believed that.

365
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,660
And John Wheeler, I don't really know. I'm curious also on your thoughts on John Wheeler.

366
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:24,660
But so you are not thinking that consciousness somehow collapses a world in superposition

367
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,660
into a classical world?

368
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:37,660
No, that's not my view. I think that the closest to my view among the standard quantum interpretations

369
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:48,660
is Chris Fuchs, Cubism, quantum Bayesianism. Right. And I think it's a brilliant interpretation

370
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:56,660
where Chris Fuchs says, look, the way a function is not some objective thing out in space and

371
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,920
time, it's in the mind of the agent. It's the degrees of belief of the agent. And he's

372
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,620
very consistent in pointing out that when you're thinking about probabilities, you can

373
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,300
either be an objective probabilist or a Bayesian subjectivist. And he gives good reasons to

374
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,060
think that, you know, just on probability alone, you should be thinking about a subjectivist

375
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:28,500
interpretation of probability. And then once you adopt that, then well, the quantum wave

376
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,580
function is really how probabilities of interpretation.

377
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Just for people who've now totally lost it, when we talk about objective probabilities,

378
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:47,540
then you believe there is an actual world out there, and you just don't know it, right?

379
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,300
And then you have to deal with these probabilities. And that gives you sort of a way to predict

380
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,300
what's going to happen, right? But there is an objective world. And subjective probabilities

381
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,140
would be that you just don't know what's out there, or how would you describe this?

382
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,900
You could be a realist about the external world and be a subjectivist about the probabilities.

383
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:19,900
So the objectivism and subjectivism, the probability is about what do we mean when we say the probability

384
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:27,140
of tails is half? Well, does it mean that if I flip the coin a thousand times, you'll

385
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:34,140
get exactly 500 heads and 500 tails? That's sort of a frequentist kind of view that what

386
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,780
probability means is what frequency, if you do lots of observations, will you end up with?

387
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,420
And the subjectivist says, well, no, it's not about objective frequencies that are measured.

388
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:52,020
It's more about your degrees of belief, about what you expect to have happen. And so you

389
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:59,020
could have prior probabilities. I expect the sun to rise tomorrow at whatever time, 5.30

390
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,500
in the morning, because it's been doing so for thousands of years. And so I have this

391
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,500
prior. I would say it's 0.99999. A lot of nines that the sun is going to rise tomorrow,

392
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:20,260
but there is a tiny chance. And that's a subjective degree of belief.

393
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,260
And so now if you have this idea that what we're dealing with in quantum theory and when

394
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,500
we're talking about the wave functions of various, like two gluons hitting each other

395
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,260
and four gluons spraying out, like in the Large Hadron Collider, and you're asking what

396
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:44,260
are the probabilities of these various events? And you write down these scattering amplitudes,

397
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:51,860
these amplitudes for it. I think the Cubist would say that is merely me as a theorist

398
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,940
putting, as a good Bayesian, putting down what I expect to have happen, what I expect

399
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,500
to see. Whereas an objectivist would say, no, it's really a statement about something

400
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,500
true and about the objective world, and you can measure that truth with frequencies by

401
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:19,380
lots of observations. And so my view then is more like Chris Fuchs in the subjectivist

402
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:26,620
view, but in which case then, I don't need to have all these worlds out there. I'm positing,

403
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,580
okay, maybe the coin comes heads or maybe it comes up tails. I don't need to have a

404
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,780
world branching out there. I'm just wondering about the difference. So I don't need to have

405
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,340
all this metaphysical excess of, well, there's a whole universe in which the thing came up

406
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,180
heads and the other one in which it came up tails. It's a metaphysically high price to

407
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,540
pay for being, you know...

408
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,340
But what I find so funny about this, because I now understand this after a year of sort

409
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,180
of getting my head around it, is that I now understand that your position makes less metaphysical

410
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,860
claims because people on the street will think you're making a crazy metaphysical claim that

411
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,620
consciousness is primary. And they say, of course, there's a world out there and they'll

412
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,980
maybe have read something about the many worlds interpretation that there is parallel universes

413
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,980
and that they think is sort of not a metaphysical claim. So where's this, how do we end up

414
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,660
in this sort of misunderstanding of what metaphysics, what is sort of a heavy metaphysical claim

415
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,420
and a light one?

416
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Well, I think many of us intuitively would agree with Einstein. Einstein was a realist

417
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,040
and he thought that the moon was there when no one looked. He didn't think that the act

418
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,940
of observation when I look up there and see the moon that I'm creating the moon when I

419
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,420
look at it, the moon is really there and Einstein wanted physics to be that way and he didn't

420
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:58,420
like the spooky interactions at a distance that he himself sort of pointed out in quantum

421
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,980
theory that things could happen faster than the speed of light apparently and of course

422
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,380
they weren't any causal interactions, they were nothing, no information traveling through

423
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,700
space faster than the speed of light as it turned out. But he didn't like it because

424
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,700
he wanted to have a sort of a new tone, a classical world view where space and time

425
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,280
was much more interesting than Newton thought but nevertheless it wasn't spooky like quantum

426
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,000
theory seemed to be indicating and so I think most of us intuitively would agree with Einstein

427
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,040
and he's not bad company. If Einstein thinks that space and time are fundamental and objects

428
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,280
are the moon is there when no one exists, who might argue with Einstein. So I think

429
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,280
a lot of us intuitively think that and I think I know why. The developmental psychologists

430
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,840
have told us why. So Piaget said that children, he thought by the time they're at 18 months

431
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:09,840
of age, get what he calls object permanence. That is we're programmed genetically at a

432
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,760
certain point in our lives to just believe that up to a point when mommy has the doll

433
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,760
and it's where I can play with it, the doll exists while I'm playing with it but as soon

434
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
as mommy takes the doll and puts it behind the pillow and I don't see it, it's gone.

435
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,600
It doesn't exist until you're around 18 months of age according to Piaget. Later work showed

436
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,960
us maybe three or four months of age, much earlier than you thought, where you get what's

437
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,960
called object permanence which is the pre-programmed belief that object really exists even when

438
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,560
you don't perceive it. So you start to become a metaphysical realist not because you're

439
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,680
argued into it because you're programmed to believe it. So the reason why it's so hard

440
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,680
for us to let go of the idea that the moon doesn't exist except when you look and create

441
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:07,280
it. To let go of the idea that things really are there, we want the dolly to be there,

442
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,520
we want the moon to be there is because we believed that before we were rational. It's

443
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,920
the water we swim in intellectually and so it's really hard for us to even see that,

444
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,640
to question it. When I remember giving a talk to my own department, Cognizant's department

445
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:34,320
where I was explaining my argument from evolution why we are creating everything that we see

446
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,320
on the fly. So the physicists have an argument that space time isn't fundamental and therefore

447
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,160
somehow the act of observation must be creating what we're, because it's not space time,

448
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,160
whatever is there. I have an argument from evolution of natural selection to the same

449
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,560
and so I gave it to my department a few years ago and the argument was pretty clear so they

450
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,760
were nodding their heads and oh yeah and I realized that they followed the argument but

451
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,600
they didn't know what it really meant so I said look this means that neurons don't exist

452
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
when they're not perceived. Neurons cause none of our behavior and then look of horror

453
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,480
throughout all my colleagues who used to think that I was a reasonable and possibly intelligent

454
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,480
guy. All of a sudden looks of horror what is this guy saying? So it's not, it's a deep emotional

455
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,760
thing. It's like being told that someone that you thought you knew really well all your life

456
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,920
has been in a suit and they're really a Komodo dragon and you didn't know it. It's just that

457
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,120
appalling an idea. And how has this all been for you personally? I mean because this is

458
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,360
all intellectual and mathematics but at night when Donald goes too bad and you ponder about

459
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,760
this you know how does that sort of, what's the impact? What has the impact been on you

460
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,760
personally? Well it's, I know first hand how difficult it is to let go of the object permanence.

461
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,040
I see it, that is my default mode. So even though I've been working on this mathematics

462
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:14,040
and publishing papers for decades on this kind of topic, when I'm not paying attention

463
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm a realist. I just automatically fall to that point of view. So it's the way I think

464
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,800
about it is like if you've ever played a virtual reality game that's highly immersive,

465
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,480
you put on a headset and body suit and you know when you first get in, hey look, this

466
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,320
beautiful world that I'm involved in, maybe it's Grand Theft Auto or whatever it might

467
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,600
be, some VR version of that. So you're immersed, you're seeing all this stuff and when you

468
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:50,100
first go in you have this sense of detachment. Here I am outside of the game with just this

469
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,620
headset on, but once you get into it you're in the game and your emotions get tied up

470
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:02,820
in it and you lose yourself in the game and so effectively that's what I'm saying is

471
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:09,820
happening here. Space time is just our headset but we lose ourselves in the game and we lose,

472
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:17,740
we take the game as the reality and what science has done, what physics has done is

473
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:25,020
study space time very, very well. They studied our headset and they studied the headset so

474
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:32,020
well that they discovered it's just a headset and that's the power of the scientific method.

475
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,700
We studied space time because we thought it was a fundamental reality. We were lost

476
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,500
in the game but because we didn't just wave our hands and get dogmatic about it, we actually

477
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,980
wrote down equations and then Einstein wrote down, Einstein was the one that really blew

478
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,060
this thing open with general relativity because he had the notion like in 1907 that if I was

479
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:02,420
in an elevator standing on a scale to weigh myself and all of a sudden the cord broke

480
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,300
and the elevator started in free fall, how much would I weigh on that scale and Einstein

481
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,140
realized I wouldn't weigh anything. He said like the happiest thought of his life. That

482
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,300
was the key idea for general relativity. If I was on a free falling elevator and standing

483
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,300
on a scale I would weigh nothing. Brilliant idea. It took Einstein, I don't know, seven

484
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,220
or eight years or something like that of intense work to turn that idea into mathematics and

485
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,620
it was, and he's Einstein, right? He's not such a smart guy. He's a really, really smart

486
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:41,340
guy. It takes him seven or eight years. He has to learn the mathematics. It was fairly

487
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:47,740
unusual mathematics, Riemannian geometry and so forth. But he learned the mathematics

488
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,740
and struggled and struggled and finally turned it into mathematics in 1915 and turned that

489
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:02,540
idea into one equation. That one equation then, a year later, a German guy, I guess he was

490
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,540
fighting in World War I and had time and the brilliance to work on Einstein's equations,

491
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,540
discovered what we now call the solution that's called black holes. Einstein didn't know about

492
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:19,540
black holes and he didn't like it. The key thing was you can be as smart as Einstein

493
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,540
and be so smart that you write down the field equations of general relativity and then those

494
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:33,540
equations come back and teach you something fundamental about black holes and then black

495
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,540
holes are what tell you that space time cannot be fundamental itself. There's got to be something

496
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:50,540
beyond and so that is what I love about the hard-nosed scientific attitude, is turn it

497
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:57,540
into mathematics. If you have a theory that is good enough to tell you where it stops,

498
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,540
that's the kind of theory that is the heart and soul of science. If you have a theory

499
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:08,540
that allows you to dodge and weave and always dodge any objection, I have absolutely no

500
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,540
interest. You're not playing the science game. You're playing some personal game.

501
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,540
Let's stay in that headset metaphor, which you've used very often of course and it's a great metaphor.

502
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,540
First of all, were you happy with the movie The Matrix, what it did sort of culturally with that metaphor?

503
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,540
Yeah, I think the Matrix really does open people's minds up to the possibility that what they're

504
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:45,540
experiencing is just a simulation, right? Now in The Matrix though, once you pop out of the simulation,

505
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:52,540
there's another space time world. So when Neo takes off the headset, he's back in the space time world,

506
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:59,540
right? And so it's Trinity and everybody, they're all in the space time world. So this, what I'm saying is

507
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,540
even more radical that whatever is beyond space time is utterly unlike the other space time

508
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:14,540
space and time. It's utterly outside of space and time and that's really hard to think outside

509
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,540
of the space time box. When I talk about conscious agents, people go where are they? I mean, they're not

510
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:24,540
in space and time, where are they? And you have to turn things around. Space and time is inside the minds

511
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:31,540
of the conscious agents. It's just like someone inside the virtual reality game of Grand Theft Auto.

512
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,540
The players inside could say, you think you're not really riding a red Mustang and you don't think

513
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,540
that green Ferrari really exists? Well, where are you? Well, I'm outside of the game. This game is just a headset.

514
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,540
But if you're not on the game, where could you possibly be? Where else is there besides the game?

515
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,540
And that's the same situation we have with space time. We can't think about being outside of that game.

516
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,540
But that's what our mathematics is telling us. You've got to think outside of that box and the best

517
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,540
physicists are, well, the best. The physicists that I'm really interested in, like Neymar,

518
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:11,540
Connie Hamid and Juan Maldecedo and others, Benny Costa, these guys are taking the bold step of moving

519
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:17,540
beyond space time and they are finding beautiful structures beyond space time that are really,

520
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,540
they don't know what they're about, but they're there.

521
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:26,540
Yeah. I think what people find so hard and also me myself, at first I was more attracted to this idea

522
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:32,540
of our brains being a receiver to a larger consciousness, right, that you see sort of the radio.

523
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:38,540
What's that interpretation called? I think it's Aldous Huxley, who sort of popularized the idea.

524
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:46,540
But you also say that your brain itself is just a sort of and your whole body itself is a projection

525
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:54,540
in space time. It's not real. It has no causal role to play for consciousness at all.

526
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:01,540
That's right. So right now I don't have a brain. I have no neurons. If you looked inside my skull,

527
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,540
you would find neurons and brains, but that's because you would create them as you looked.

528
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,540
The act of observation is creating what you see. So the brain isn't a receiver for consciousness

529
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:15,540
because the brain doesn't even exist. The brain itself is just a symbol inside of consciousness

530
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,540
that consciousness makes now and then and then deletes. So it's just like when, if you're playing a virtual reality

531
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,540
game, like the Grand Theft Auto, and you have your headset on, and if I look over to the right,

532
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:32,540
and I'll see a green Mustang. Well, there is no green Mustang, right?

533
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,540
What I'm really interacting with in this metaphor is some supercomputer somewhere.

534
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,540
It's got all this megabytes of software and diodes and resistors and voltages and magnetic fields.

535
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,540
I don't know anything about that. I don't have to know, but that's the reality, quote-unquote,

536
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,540
in this metaphor. There's no green Mustangs inside that computer anywhere.

537
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,540
There's nothing green inside that computer that looks like a Mustang.

538
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,540
So I'm creating the Mustang when I look and I'm deleting it when I look over here.

539
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,540
Now I see a white Porsche. Well, now I've deleted the green Mustang and I'm creating the white Porsche.

540
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,540
So we create the stuff on the fly.

541
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,540
But someone else might be looking at that green Mustang, right?

542
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,540
For that person, it will still exist.

543
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,540
But the it will be a different green Mustang than the one I saw, right?

544
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,540
Because I create my own Mustang in my head and they create their green Mustang in their head.

545
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,540
And we think that we're seeing the same Mustang because we agree.

546
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,540
Is there a Mustang to my right? Oh, yeah, there's a Mustang to your right.

547
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,540
And so we think that we're seeing exactly the same thing.

548
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,540
And that's that baby principle, the object permanence you mentioned, right?

549
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,540
That my child learns that.

550
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:43,540
But the hard part also is that people find difficult to understand is that if, for instance,

551
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,540
I take alcohol or psychedelics, which is something in space-time,

552
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,540
that definitely has a causal effect on my consciousness, right?

553
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:03,540
Right. So it's absolutely the case that space and time are an interface that allow us to do things

554
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
that can affect consciousness.

555
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:11,540
So for example, right now, you are affecting my consciousness.

556
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,540
And you're doing it through space and time. You're doing it through an interface.

557
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,540
So we know that even with the idea that consciousness is fundamental,

558
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:25,540
that one consciousness can affect another consciousness through the intermediary of space and time.

559
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,540
And in fact, that's what space and time are. They are this interface.

560
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,540
It's an interface that some conscious agents use to interact with other conscious agents.

561
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,540
So it's no surprise that actions that we take using an interface could affect our consciousness.

562
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
That's what the interface is for.

563
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:49,540
Now, but the reason why people have a hard time understanding this is because we make another mistake.

564
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:56,540
We mistake, because we mistake our interface for reality,

565
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,540
we also make a fundamental mistake that things that look simple to us

566
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,540
are therefore necessarily simple in and of themselves.

567
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,540
And things that look dead to us are necessarily dead.

568
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,540
So for example, if I look in the mirror, I see my face.

569
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,540
I presume when I look at your face, you're conscious.

570
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,540
And so faces point to conscious objects.

571
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:29,540
Well, I look at my cat, I am surely alive and it's probably conscious.

572
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,540
And an ant, certainly alive, people might begin to wonder about consciousness.

573
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,540
When I get down to microbe alive, probably not conscious.

574
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,540
And when you get down to virus, now we even debate about whether it's alive.

575
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,540
When we get down to particles, absolutely not alive.

576
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:49,540
And only if you're a panpsychist, you might say that they have some consciousness associated with them.

577
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,540
But a physicalist would say no consciousness.

578
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:58,540
That whole way of looking at things is fundamentally flawed.

579
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:05,540
It's mistaking a limit of our interface for an insight into the nature of reality.

580
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,540
An interface necessarily has to simplify things.

581
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,540
But that's what an interface is there for, it's to hide most of the reality

582
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,540
and the part of reality that it shows you, it's dumbing it down.

583
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,540
Well, so with certain symbols, like human bodies and human faces,

584
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,540
we get perhaps the most insight into other consciousnesses.

585
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:29,540
With other symbols like cat and dog and mouse, we get less insight.

586
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,540
And with other symbols, we get almost no insight.

587
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,540
Well, that doesn't mean that I'm not interacting with consciousness.

588
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,540
It just means that my interface gave up.

589
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,540
Well, no surprise, that's what interfaces do.

590
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,540
They give up at some point.

591
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:46,540
But it's a rookie mistake to take the pixels of my desktop interface

592
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,540
as the fundamental elements of reality.

593
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,540
And so right now I'm looking at a bunch of pixels which is Hans' face.

594
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,540
So those pixels are conscious.

595
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,540
But if I go smaller and smaller, the pixels that correspond to the door behind you

596
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
or whatever, those aren't conscious.

597
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,540
Well, that's the wrong way to think about the pixels.

598
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
Those are just pixels.

599
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,540
They're a portal through which I'm actually interacting with something on the other side.

600
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,540
So we've mistaken our interface for the reality.

601
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,540
So the distinction that we make between conscious and unconscious

602
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,540
and between living and non-living is not a principle distinction.

603
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,540
It's a mistake.

604
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:34,540
It's a rookie mistake that we make by mistaking our space-time headset for the final truth.

605
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,540
And so as a result, now to get back to your question,

606
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,540
when we start to do things like take drugs or get hit on the head

607
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,540
and we have changes in consciousness,

608
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,540
well, first there's no surprise that the interface allows you to change consciousness.

609
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,540
That's what it's for.

610
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:53,540
It's what consciousness is used to interact and affect other consciousnesses.

611
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,540
When I have something that I call a drug, if I'm a physicalist,

612
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,540
I'm thinking, hey, there's nothing to this, but some chemicals.

613
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
This is a chemical formula.

614
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,540
There's no consciousness here.

615
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,540
So here is this physical thing, a chemical, and look, it's taking down your consciousness.

616
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,540
So that shows that physicalism is true.

617
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,540
Physicalism, your brain is creating your consciousness,

618
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,540
this drug is affecting your brain, so it's changing your consciousness.

619
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,540
But again, it's a rookie mistake.

620
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,540
Just because something has so simple in my interface that it looks like a chemical

621
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,540
doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness.

622
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,540
It just means that I'm getting very, very little insight from my interface

623
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,540
into the consciousness that I'm interacting with.

624
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,540
So I'm always dealing with behind the screen of my interface,

625
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,540
and I'm always dealing with consciousness,

626
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,540
just like in Grand Theft Auto.

627
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,540
Behind the screen, I'm dealing first with a supercomputer,

628
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,540
but then with all the other people around the world that have their headsets

629
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,540
and body suits on, I'm affecting them.

630
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,540
I'm talking with them through that interface.

631
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,540
And so there's no surprise that the interface is giving me no insight

632
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,540
into the consciousness that I'm interacting with,

633
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:10,540
but what is the glory of science is it has the tools to tell us a headset is just a headset.

634
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,540
And that's what the math is telling us.

635
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,540
When they say space-time is doomed, basically physics has learned

636
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,540
the headset is just a headset.

637
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,540
And we're starting to look outside the headset.

638
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:25,540
Now, Nima and these other physicists, I am not saying that they

639
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,540
in any way endorse my idea that consciousness is fundamental.

640
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,540
So I would bet that they don't.

641
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,540
I would think that they are just saying,

642
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,540
look, we're finding these structures beyond space-time.

643
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,540
I don't know what they're about yet,

644
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,540
but we're just let's stick with the math, let's find these structures

645
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,540
and show how space-time arises and hats off to that.

646
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,540
That's, I think, brilliant.

647
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:52,540
Yeah, but at least they agree with you on the point that what we're in is not fundamental.

648
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:57,540
So if you call it a headset or not, but space-time cannot be it.

649
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,540
And there you agree.

650
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,540
Absolutely.

651
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,540
When they say space-time is doomed.

652
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,540
I've heard you explain this a lot of times, but I'd like to hear it now from you again,

653
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,540
maybe in different words today, but what makes you take the leap then to say

654
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:18,540
if space-time is not fundamental, consciousness must be.

655
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,540
There's a couple reasons.

656
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,540
Maybe the biggest one is the poverty of my imagination.

657
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,540
What else would I do?

658
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,540
It's sort of like what if I'm interested in consciousness.

659
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:41,540
I'm interested in my emotions, my sensory experiences, the sense that I have of being,

660
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,540
even when I'm not really perceiving or thinking.

661
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:51,540
I'm still, you know, when you're at night with your eyes closed and not seeing anything

662
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:58,540
or perceiving anything, you're still, there's this sense of I am, the sense of being there.

663
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:05,540
And it's perfectly plausible if space-time is fundamental and physicalism is true

664
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:11,540
and reductionism is true to take all of that stuff that I just said, my conscious experience and so forth,

665
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,540
as, well, that's not real.

666
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,540
I'm just a brain.

667
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,540
I'm just a body.

668
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:24,540
And this is perhaps, you know, some weird, effective matter when it gets complicated enough.

669
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,540
But when space-time isn't fundamental and I realize that particles are not fundamental

670
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:34,540
and reductionism, as Nima Arkani-Hamedis said, reductionism is dead.

671
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,540
Reductionism is completely dead.

672
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,540
It doesn't work.

673
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:47,540
So many physicalists, many of my colleagues in cognitive neuroscientists who are,

674
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:53,540
and some of them will be here at this workshop, so they're cognitive neuroscientists,

675
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,540
I would say almost to a person, every one of them is a physicalist.

676
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:04,540
And so they're looking to see how consciousness emerges from complex neuroactivity or whatever,

677
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:10,540
integrated information or global workspaces or neuromocular tubular collapses.

678
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:18,540
So they're not going to think of consciousness as being fundamental.

679
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,540
They're going to think of it as somehow emerging.

680
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,540
But they take consciousness seriously.

681
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,540
So most of my physicalist colleagues, not all, but most take consciousness seriously.

682
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,540
They say it's not something to just be dismissed.

683
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,540
It's not an illusion.

684
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,540
Dan Dennett and Keith Frankish will say it's an illusion.

685
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,540
It's just flat-out an illusion.

686
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,540
We've been misled.

687
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,540
But most will not.

688
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,540
But they have not been able, with their own theories, and this did affect me,

689
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:54,540
when I looked at their theories, I realized there's no beef here in the following sense.

690
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:59,540
Specifically, there's no specific conscious experience that anybody's ever explained.

691
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,540
Integrated information theory.

692
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,540
I asked Julie Tononi about this back in the late 1990s.

693
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,540
He came to talk early on in his career at the University of California, Irvine,

694
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,540
at the Helmholtz Club, and we had him there.

695
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,540
So I asked him at the Helmholtz Club to give me a particular example.

696
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,540
He couldn't do it.

697
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,540
One specific, the taste of chocolate, or the filling of a headache, or the smell of garlic, or whatever.

698
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,540
What is the specific conscious experience that your theory can say?

699
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,540
This is the integrated information that must be that conscious experience.

700
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
It must be the taste of chocolate.

701
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,540
It couldn't be the...

702
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Yeah, and we're talking here about the code.

703
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,540
Let's call it the algorithm.

704
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:43,540
Show me the exact code that must be the taste of chocolate or garlic smell.

705
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,540
Exactly right.

706
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,540
Because in some sense, you can think about what they're doing is proposing these circuits.

707
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,540
The circuits have certain kind of integrated information.

708
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
Okay, great.

709
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,540
Sounds very, very rigorous.

710
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,540
Give me the circuit for one conscious...

711
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Just one.

712
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:04,540
I just want a circuit that you say must be one specific conscious experience.

713
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,540
It must be the taste of vanilla.

714
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
And it could not be the smell of garlic.

715
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,540
Just give me one.

716
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,540
We're trying to do science here.

717
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,540
We need some predictions of specific...

718
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,540
The predictions they're making is, am I conscious at all or not?

719
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,540
And that is an artifact.

720
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,540
What they're getting is an artifact of our interface.

721
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,540
When I get certain kind of complexity now in my interface, I can start to see the consciousness.

722
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,540
That doesn't mean that there's no consciousness otherwise.

723
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,540
It just means that that's when my interface lets me see the consciousness.

724
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:41,540
So it's no surprise that you can get these complexity measures in the variables of your interface

725
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,540
about when you can detect consciousness or not.

726
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,540
That's no surprise.

727
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,540
That follows from my theory, that my approach in which consciousness is fundamental.

728
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
So that's no surprise.

729
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:55,540
What would be a surprise, from my point of view, is that they could explain any specific conscious experience.

730
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,540
So every...

731
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:05,540
I'll say this, there is no physicalist theory that has at any time proposed a specific conscious experience

732
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,540
that they can explain.

733
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
There's not one on the table.

734
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,540
And again, nothing personal here.

735
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,540
I'm friends with a lot of these people.

736
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,540
I'm friends with Stuart Hameroff.

737
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,540
And last time I was on stage with him, I pressed him.

738
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Give me one.

739
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:26,540
Stuart, what is the orchestrated collapse of quantum states in neuronal microtubules

740
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,540
that must be whatever you want?

741
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,540
The smell of barbecue, whatever you want.

742
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,540
You think he's still like Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose are physicalists in that sense?

743
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:41,540
They are like the objective collapse kind of school, right?

744
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:46,540
Which states that there must be an external real world out there.

745
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:52,540
Well, either that or dualist, but probably mostly physicalist.

746
00:58:52,540 --> 00:59:00,540
I would say that somehow this non-computational aspect of physics,

747
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:07,540
they think may be somehow where consciousness somehow emerges.

748
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:14,540
But what I want when I talk with Stuart is, okay, great.

749
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,540
Give me one.

750
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:21,540
What is the specific orchestrated collapse of neuronal microtubule states that must be whatever you want?

751
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,540
Can you give me one?

752
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,540
And so I had to really press him on the stage.

753
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,540
It took me several presses to really get him to say, I don't have one.

754
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
And he knows the next time we're friends.

755
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,540
I'd love to have a beer with him and so forth.

756
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,540
He's a great guy.

757
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,540
Next time I'm on stage with him, I'm going to ask the same question.

758
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,540
And I'm sure he knows it.

759
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,540
I'll ask the same question.

760
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:45,540
And the point is, and again, this is nothing personal.

761
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,540
These are good friends.

762
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,540
And what I'm hoping is, I mean, they're so smart,

763
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,540
if I can get them off of this physicalist thing where they're doomed to fail, right?

764
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,540
Space-time is doomed.

765
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,540
There's no way that you can boot up a theory of consciousness

766
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,540
if you start with particles or any structures inside space-time.

767
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,540
You cannot do it.

768
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,540
So I see all of my friends and colleagues in this field.

769
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,540
Many of them just IQ's out the wazoo.

770
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:18,540
But when you have, I mean, if I'm trying to set up, for example, a theory of space travel,

771
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,540
and I believe in flat earth, good luck.

772
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,540
I mean, you just have sort of the wrong framework to think about space travel.

773
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,540
Yeah, I think for people, it's just very nice to bring it back to that,

774
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,540
because people know the matrix, they know sort of VR, metaphors,

775
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,540
to sum up everything we've discussed so far.

776
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,540
So when we entered this game or this simulation or this matrix,

777
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:50,540
object permanence sort of psychologically made us forget that we put on a headset in the first place.

778
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:58,540
And now we are sitting here as two adults and it's your life's work to sort of get to the point

779
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,540
that you know we have a headset on and to describe that headset.

780
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:08,540
And then, of course, to think about how we can put it off again, right?

781
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,540
That's right.

782
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,540
And once we realize that space and time were not fundamental,

783
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,540
space time is doomed and reductionism is dead,

784
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:23,540
then we're free to begin to think about what's beyond space time.

785
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,540
And my hypothesis is that it's a network of conscious agents.

786
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:32,540
And I have a, you know, with my colleagues Cheyton Prakash and Manish Singh and Chris Fields

787
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,540
and Robert Prentner and others, we're all developing this mathematical model.

788
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:41,540
Not that I believe that we're right, I don't.

789
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:47,540
I believe girdle that any mathematical model that we come up with will only be scratching the surface,

790
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,540
but I don't think that we're wasting our time.

791
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,540
We, in some sense, make some progress.

792
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:59,540
We do at least counter our own dogmatism and we look beyond.

793
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:04,540
And somehow when we get new deeper theories, we also get new deeper technologies

794
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:10,540
that are telling us somehow that we're getting some kind of insights

795
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,540
that are tapping into something that we couldn't tap into before.

796
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:21,540
So I'm working with my colleagues, collaborators on this mathematical theory of conscious agents,

797
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:29,540
and then what we have to do is show how space time emerges specifically with mathematical precision.

798
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,540
We have to show exactly how space time emerges as a headset.

799
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:43,540
So what is it about the dynamics of conscious agents that is being captured by the space time headset that we use?

800
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,540
Can you prove that? It's my lack of understanding of mathematics,

801
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:52,540
but can you prove something like that mathematically?

802
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:59,540
Well, I wouldn't use the word prove, but what you can do is you can write down a mathematical projection.

803
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,540
So you can say, here is this mathematical model of conscious agents.

804
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,540
It's like the Twitterverse, right? So it's a big social network.

805
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,540
And you can say, here's how Twitter works.

806
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,540
You know, this guy tweets and he follows and he retweets.

807
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,540
So you can sort of write down the laws of how tweeting works.

808
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,540
So it's like that. So I've got this social network of conscious agents.

809
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,540
They have their own laws about how they work.

810
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:23,540
And then you can look at the patterns that evolve in that, right?

811
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,540
So like with the Twitterverse, it's like what is trending and why and so forth.

812
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:31,540
How do you get these little in groups where you have echo chambers and so forth?

813
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,540
So you can look at all the things that happen.

814
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:43,540
Then you can say, okay, let's ask what about what aspects of this complicated dynamics of conscious agents

815
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,540
gets mapped into what we call space and time?

816
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:53,540
How precisely, with mathematical precision, like what are the trends in the behaviors of conscious agents?

817
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,540
And really that's the way we think about it.

818
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,540
Technically we call it the asymptotic or long-term behavior,

819
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,540
but it's really like trends in social media.

820
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:07,540
How shall we capture those long-term behaviors, those trends,

821
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,540
in the format of space and time and what we call physical objects?

822
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,540
How do we do that?

823
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:20,540
So we've actually, at this workshop, I'm going to be proposing a mathematically precise path.

824
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:25,540
I won't say the path now because it's just a bunch of mathematics that wouldn't make any sense,

825
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:33,540
but there are like five or six steps, precise mathematical steps from the dynamics of conscious agents

826
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:38,540
all through permutations, through these polytopes, through the amplitude,

827
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,540
and then into space-time.

828
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:46,540
So there's this mapping that, and so the idea then is I've got this high-level picture with my team,

829
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:52,540
and now we have to work out, it's going to take years to work out all the details of each step in this,

830
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:56,540
but we see the path from the dynamics of conscious agents through permutations

831
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:02,540
and Birkhoff polytopes, to grass monions, to the amplitude, into space-time.

832
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,540
So there's a lot of work to be done, but once we do that,

833
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:11,540
once we have enough progress on that, then we can get to the other thing you're talking about,

834
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,540
which is it'll give us new technologies, essentially.

835
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:20,540
Once we know what's beyond, well, I won't say once we know what's beyond space-time.

836
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:27,540
Once we have our first baby step theory, the first baby step beyond space-time that's really solid,

837
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:35,540
it'll be conscious agents 1.0, then maybe in five years it'll be conscious agents 10.0 or something like that.

838
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,540
So it'll move quickly and throw away the...

839
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,540
This is like fundamental stuff, right? This is the real cool stuff.

840
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:47,540
We're still thinking of traveling in space-time, and we have all these space-time fantasies, right?

841
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:53,540
So also science fiction, don't you think that when you look at what Christopher Nolan does in his movies,

842
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:59,540
that's really great. I admire it as a filmmaker. I think it's absolutely fantastic, and it's very close to science.

843
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:07,540
To me, the really fascinating stuff also for art is to fantasize about what we could do, right?

844
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:15,540
Because when we go outside of space-time, we do not have a clue what we're waiting for, right?

845
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:27,540
That's right. So one of the things that occurs to me, most of the galaxies that we can see, we could never go to.

846
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:33,540
Space is expanding so quickly that we could never get to them through space, moving at the speed of light.

847
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:37,540
So there's all this real estate out there that we can see that's waving at us and saying,

848
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,540
nanny, nanny, you can never get here. Well, that's if you go through space-time.

849
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:48,540
But if space-time is just a headset, think about the options that come in.

850
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,540
You don't have to go through space-time. You could go around space-time.

851
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Think about Grand Theft Auto. Everybody that's got the headset on is playing Grand Theft Auto.

852
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:05,540
They're stuck within the game. But if you're a software engineer who knows about the computer and the software,

853
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,540
you could take the guy who's driving the fastest car and winning the game.

854
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:14,540
You could give him flat tires out of nowhere. You could take the gas out of his tank.

855
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,540
You could turn his car upside down and put it somewhere else anytime you want to.

856
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:22,540
But you're not stuck in space and time. The whole notion of causality.

857
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,540
Nothing can go faster than a certain speed inside Grand Theft Auto.

858
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,540
And in space-time, nothing can go faster than the speed of light.

859
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:35,540
Well, that's all just part of the headset. Once you go outside this headset, you can tinker with it.

860
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:41,540
But then you're also sort of, then we also can take the matrix metaphor again, right?

861
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,540
Neoprogramming itself like new skills out of nowhere.

862
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:50,540
It potentially could be possible, you're saying.

863
01:07:53,540 --> 01:08:00,540
It certainly does seem to be quite possible that we could be interacting with other conscious agents

864
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:04,540
in a way that we can't even conceive right now.

865
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:11,540
And tapping into an intelligence that is inconceivable,

866
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,540
literally inconceivable because it transcends any conceptual system.

867
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:24,540
And if this idea that we are consciousness is correct

868
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:28,540
and that that's what is the fundamental reality,

869
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:35,540
then the girdle's incompleteness theorem tells us that, in fact, you and I already are that infinite intelligence.

870
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:43,540
We're projected into a particular headset and waking up to that fact.

871
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:53,540
And that then raises an interesting question, which is what is consciousness doing and why?

872
01:08:53,540 --> 01:09:00,540
And what girdle seems to be saying to us is that there is an infinite, unbounded,

873
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:05,540
unstoppable realm of exploration that consciousness needs to do.

874
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,540
And so what consciousness is doing is exploring all of its possibilities,

875
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,540
maybe to understand itself.

876
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:21,540
So it's the old oracle of Delphi, know-thyself.

877
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:30,540
But do you think, a lot of questions here, when I'd like the ontology of conscious agents,

878
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,540
what are your thoughts here?

879
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:35,540
I mean, what are we talking about those conscious agents outside of space-time?

880
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:43,540
I mean, people would say we think spirits or gods, but any thoughts?

881
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,540
Right.

882
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:53,540
The theory that we have picks just two aspects of consciousness,

883
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:58,540
because when you're trying to do a scientific theory, what you're trying to do is say,

884
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:05,540
what are the minimal ingredients that I need to boot up a completely general theory?

885
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:10,540
And if you ask yourself the question, so if I'm thinking about consciousness being fundamental,

886
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,540
well, what kinds of things do I want to really understand?

887
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,540
I need to understand experiences.

888
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,540
I need to understand free will or action.

889
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:26,540
I need to understand learning, memory, problem-solving, intelligence, the notion of a self, emotions.

890
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:31,540
So now if I just assume all that stuff, I'm not making a scientific theory.

891
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,540
I'm just saying, well, that's what, I'm just sort of sitting back with a beer and saying,

892
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,540
well, that's what exists.

893
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:40,540
But if I'm trying to do a scientific theory, what I have to do is to play that game,

894
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:46,540
is I have to say, okay, out of all that stuff I was talking about and more that consciousness has to be dealing with,

895
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:53,540
what are the two things or the one thing that I need to really turn into mathematics

896
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,540
and say this is the foundation and then boot up everything else?

897
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,540
That's what science is about.

898
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:06,540
So what we've picked is there are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate.

899
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:14,540
And those conscious experiences can influence other conscious experiences.

900
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,540
Those are the assumptions.

901
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,540
That's it.

902
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:22,540
There are experiences and experiences, probabilistically influence other experiences.

903
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,540
That's the minimal.

904
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:31,540
So notice there's no notion of memory, problem-solving, self, none of that stuff is there.

905
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:39,540
So we have to build all that stuff from the raw materials of just conscious experiences affecting other conscious experiences.

906
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:43,540
So that's what we're really up to is a mathematical model of that.

907
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,540
Now you could say, look, you picked the wrong starting point.

908
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,540
That's fine.

909
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:50,540
That's the kind of critique that I would welcome.

910
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:55,540
I'd say, okay, pick some other starting point, make your own networks of whatever you want to call them,

911
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,540
but then you'll be having to explain other things.

912
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,540
And that's perfectly fine.

913
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:04,540
So I picked what I thought I couldn't get away with.

914
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:14,540
And one reason why you want as few things as possible that you're assuming it to begin with is because the things you assume are your miracles.

915
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:18,540
The scientific theory has its assumptions.

916
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,540
Every theory has an assumption.

917
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,540
Those assumptions are the things you're saying.

918
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,540
If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain all this other good stuff.

919
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,540
But I'm not explaining these assumptions.

920
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,540
And that's what I mean when I say they're miracles for that theory.

921
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,540
They're the things that you just say, please let me have this.

922
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,540
And then I'll explain all this other stuff.

923
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:39,540
So you want to have your miracles as few as possible.

924
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:43,540
Now, of course, I've helped myself to a big miracle, conscious experiences.

925
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:52,540
Which is, I think, it's very natural to say it's only the last couple of hundred years that we find that a weird assumption to make.

926
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,540
But actually, it's the only thing we have, right?

927
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,540
This is Descartes.

928
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,540
But then we forgot about that.

929
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:08,540
And we got so immersed in what we assumed to be the real world that we forgot about that primacy of consciousness.

930
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,540
That's what dawned to me.

931
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,540
I mean, we were looking inside conscious.

932
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,540
We're doing the Large Hadron Collider.

933
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,540
We do that in consciousness.

934
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:21,540
We let these particles accelerate and burst into each other.

935
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,540
It's within consciousness, everything, right?

936
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,540
That's exactly right.

937
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:32,540
So when you start to look at it, you realize, well, no, this has just been a headset all along.

938
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,540
Space and time has just been a headset all along.

939
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:39,540
It's really consciousness looking at other consciousnesses through this filter.

940
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,540
And so, yeah, the experiences are fundamental.

941
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,540
My experience of space and time is just my experience.

942
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:50,540
And as soon as I close my eyes, the moon literally disappears.

943
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:54,540
It's gone.

944
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,540
Now, there's something out there.

945
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:02,540
Not out there in the sense of out there in space, but there's something out beyond my experiences.

946
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,540
And it's, by hypothesis, other conscious agents.

947
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,540
So I'm interacting with other conscious agents.

948
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:12,540
And what I see are things like the moon or an amoeba or a rock.

949
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,540
It's not that the rock is conscious.

950
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:25,540
It's just like, again, like the pixels in my Grand Theft Auto headset that I see as a Porsche.

951
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,540
Those pixels are not a Porsche.

952
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,540
Those are just pixels.

953
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:33,540
I'm making the Porsche in my consciousness, right?

954
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,540
And that's the same thing.

955
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,540
So I'm not saying that the rock is conscious.

956
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:42,540
The rock is my pixelated headset.

957
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,540
When I look at Hans, I see a face, skin, hair, and eyes.

958
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,540
What I'm seeing is not your consciousness.

959
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,540
I'm seeing something that I created.

960
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,540
In fact, that hands is now gone.

961
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,540
And now it's there.

962
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,540
But your consciousness presumably stayed there even when I wasn't paying attention to it.

963
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:01,540
Yeah, it's an icon that refers to something else.

964
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:15,540
And what I'm wondering is also a question I had is, could it be that those conscious agents in creating space time as a headset built in certain hacks, so to speak?

965
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,540
We know, for instance, death is one.

966
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:24,540
I mean, if I jump in front of a train, I'll die and I'll somehow, right?

967
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,540
We know that the headset's off then, right?

968
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,540
I suppose that.

969
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,540
And what are other ones?

970
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,540
I mean, is meditation one?

971
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,540
Are psychedelics one?

972
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,540
What are your thoughts there?

973
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,540
I think that there's an infinite variety.

974
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:45,540
That the headset that we have right now is just one of it, literally an infinite variety.

975
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:51,540
And so this might sound similar to an idea that a physicist named Max Tegmark has put out.

976
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,540
So Max Tegmark has the idea of these multiverses.

977
01:15:54,540 --> 01:16:02,540
But he thinks that mathematics is fundamental, that it is the fundamental reality, not consciousness, mathematics.

978
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:05,540
And not space time, at least not our space time.

979
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:13,540
And also, I think, building on Gertl's incompleteness theorem, he points out that there's an infinite variety of mathematics out there.

980
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,540
And so that's his level, what he calls level four multiverse.

981
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:22,540
Every kind of mathematics that is possible is actual, and it's all out there.

982
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,540
So it really exists.

983
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:31,540
And my guess is, in a similar spirit, I don't take mathematics as fundamental.

984
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,540
I take consciousness as fundamental.

985
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,540
And mathematics is like the bones of the living organism of consciousness.

986
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,540
So it's different from Max Tegmark's view.

987
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:48,540
But where it's similar is, where as Max says, everything that's mathematically possible is mathematically real, and that's my multiverse.

988
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:56,540
I'm saying every structure of consciousness that's mathematically possible is consciously real.

989
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:03,540
And that's my consciousness multiverse with all the possible headsets that it could have.

990
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:13,540
And so our little space time one is presumably one of just many that are concretely right now inconceivable to us.

991
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:21,540
But what's interesting to me about consciousness is, in this framework, why is it doing this?

992
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:34,540
Why should consciousness go to all the effort of, like, this is a pretty amazing space time universe.

993
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,540
Billions of light years across.

994
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:42,540
It's got trillions of stars and hundreds of billions of galaxies.

995
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:52,540
And in this framework in which consciousness is fundamental, what's happened to consciousness put on this headset

996
01:17:52,540 --> 01:18:00,540
programmed itself to get lost in it, to think of itself as a tiny little object in this vast universe,

997
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:08,540
to slowly wake up and to recognize as vast and as amazing as this whole thing is, I transcend it.

998
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,540
Is that what consciousness is about?

999
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:16,540
It's knowing what it is by knowing what it's not.

1000
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:26,540
So it really immerses itself into a headset like space and time and gets lost in it and flounders in it

1001
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,540
and really it has to learn how to play it.

1002
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,540
Don't touch the fire, you'll burn it.

1003
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,540
Don't step in front of the car.

1004
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:42,540
It's painful and so you're learning all how this headset works and then you're learning about how fantastic it is

1005
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,540
and then you wake up and realize, I'm not a little thing inside that headset.

1006
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,540
That headset is a tiny little thing inside of me.

1007
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,540
I am not that.

1008
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,540
And that's how consciousness is knowing itself.

1009
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:03,540
And maybe if one way of interpreting girdle is that that process is never ending, there may be a deeper wing

1010
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:08,540
which you can just view it as a vast incredible intelligence that just knows that,

1011
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:14,540
but every perspective on that gives you this temporal feeling of coming and waking up to it.

1012
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:21,540
So there may be an even deeper perspective in which you could look at the whole thing as just a vast intelligence

1013
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:29,540
that already knows it all, but any projection of that, you're seeing it as a process of coming to know itself.

1014
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:39,540
So what's interesting is if this is anywhere close to right, then you and I, anybody that, any person,

1015
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:43,540
is really part of that infinite intelligence, but wearing a headset.

1016
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:51,540
But we're wearing a headset that has really strict limits on it.

1017
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:56,540
If I ask you, please imagine a color that you've never seen before.

1018
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,540
Just one specific color that you've never seen before.

1019
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,540
Well, does anything happen?

1020
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:04,540
Nothing, I mean, nothing happens.

1021
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:12,540
But there, you know, it turns out that there are women called tetrafemes who have four color receptors.

1022
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:19,540
Most guys have three, 93% of men have three color receptors, 7% of men have only two.

1023
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:30,540
These women have four color receptors, and experiments strongly suggest that they have a new dimension of color experience

1024
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:37,540
that no man could ever imagine, and most women can't imagine either.

1025
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:43,540
And so they're having concrete experiences that you and I can't even, we can't even imagine.

1026
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:50,540
And so what's stunning to me is that consciousness, if we, if you and I really are not separate,

1027
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:57,540
we're just different headsets on the one big consciousness, the one infinitely intelligent consciousness.

1028
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,540
So we're not separate from that.

1029
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:05,540
We really, I mean, it would be pretty stunning that we are actually not just connected with,

1030
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:08,540
we are projections of that infinite intelligence.

1031
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:15,540
But projections that, we've taken the projections so seriously that we can't even imagine a new color.

1032
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:22,540
We've really restricted our imagination, even though within consciousness at a deeper level, all things are possible.

1033
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,540
All possible experiences are there.

1034
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:33,540
Yeah, we truly sort of somehow forgot who we are and the function being to expand this whole thing, right?

1035
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,540
It was needed somehow too.

1036
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:47,540
But what I'm wondering here, I heard you say you're reading or maybe even reevaluating religious literature.

1037
01:21:47,540 --> 01:22:00,540
And because this is so similar, of course, to Eastern philosophy and traditions of meditation that tend to bring you back to sort of this primordial awareness that you're a part of

1038
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:06,540
and make you see that all else is created from that awareness.

1039
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,540
So I'm just wondering here what your thoughts are.

1040
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:15,540
Is science and these traditions of introspection mostly already coming together?

1041
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:21,540
Are we going to see a science that sort of includes introspection maybe even?

1042
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,540
I think that we'll need to go there.

1043
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,540
I think that we'll need scientists.

1044
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:41,540
If this idea is anywhere near right and we really are the infinite consciousness in a space-time headset,

1045
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:49,540
the best way to do our scientific research is, of course, to use our mathematics and to do all the stuff that we're doing right now, the study and so forth,

1046
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:59,540
but then also to step back, to literally let go of thought completely and just dive back into that non-conceptual, infinite intelligence.

1047
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,540
You're doing that, right?

1048
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:08,540
I do. I spend a couple hours a day, even more, two or three hours a day meditating.

1049
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:14,540
Are you then breaking outside the headset?

1050
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:18,540
I'm making a tiny crack into the headset.

1051
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,540
I would say a tiny crack.

1052
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:25,540
When I read the experiences of others, I would say that there are many far more advanced than me,

1053
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:31,540
but I do go into periods of complete inner silence,

1054
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:39,540
and I think in those periods, whatever ideas I have that might be of any interest come from that.

1055
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:50,540
I think that if we really cultivate that as scientists and as artists and writers and so forth, whatever endeavor we might be involved in,

1056
01:23:50,540 --> 01:24:03,540
going into ultimate complete silence, letting go of the restrictions of our conceptual system really puts us in touch with this infinite intelligence

1057
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:13,540
from which we can then take back insights that we can try to then reconceptualize and make useful in this headset.

1058
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:23,540
Many of the great scientists seem to talk in ways that suggest that Einstein would say that he wasn't really getting ideas from just the equations.

1059
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:29,540
He would go and have these vague feelings and ideas and pictures or something like that,

1060
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:34,540
and it would take him a long time to turn the stuff into language and mathematics.

1061
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:42,540
So he would suggest that he was going, and I think many of the great physicists and scientists more generally,

1062
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:46,540
and then of course people in the arts and humanities who are doing wonderful work,

1063
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:53,540
they're getting their inspiration probably even with just brief periods of silence,

1064
01:24:53,540 --> 01:25:03,540
maybe that they don't even know that when they go into that inner silence that we let go of the headset temporarily and tap into this deeper intelligence.

1065
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:11,540
If this is right, I would suggest that in the future we would train our scientists with all of the standard tools,

1066
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:18,540
but also teach them to tap into this infinite intelligence as well, spend time on a regular basis,

1067
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:27,540
letting go of all of your theories and recognizing that hey, in some sense, every theory we come up with here is child's play.

1068
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,540
All of it is child's play.

1069
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:34,540
Gertl tells us everything that you come up with is child's play.

1070
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:42,540
There's a quote from Newton that I'll put up at the end of my talk at the workshop where he basically says,

1071
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:48,540
I don't know what other people think of me, but I think of myself as a little boy that spent my life on the seashore

1072
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:58,540
picking up a pretty pebble or a shell while the whole ocean of unexplored is beyond me.

1073
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:03,540
It's just sitting there and I think that's the right attitude.

1074
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,540
I don't have a theory of everything.

1075
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:08,540
In science, we'll never get a theory of everything.

1076
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,540
We can't.

1077
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,540
We'll get a theory of everything except our assumptions.

1078
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,540
Those assumptions keep going down and down and down forever, Gertl tells us.

1079
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:20,540
Your theory of everything except your assumptions is basically a theory that barely scratches the surface.

1080
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:29,540
In that sense, it changes the whole dynamic.

1081
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:39,540
Right now, a lot of the dynamic is I'm this little tiny thing in this vast space and time and I don't feel very significant.

1082
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:43,540
The only way to get significance is to make my mark, to make a new scientific theory,

1083
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,540
a new piece of art or that piece of literature, the great American novel.

1084
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,540
Finally, the great American, whatever it might be.

1085
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:56,540
I'm trying to make myself significant or have some lasting value by something I do.

1086
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,540
That puts a lot of pressure on you.

1087
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:07,540
You've only got 60, 70, 80, maybe 90 years to do it and then will they really look at your painting 200 years from now?

1088
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:08,540
Who knows?

1089
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:15,540
You're really grasping at stuff to get significance for yourself and it's sort of a struggle.

1090
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:20,540
Or I can just say, screw it, I'm going to drink and have a good time.

1091
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,540
I'm not significant.

1092
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,540
I just acknowledge that I'm here to have a good time.

1093
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:33,540
But when we let go of the physicalist framework and we say, I am consciousness, I transcend this.

1094
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,540
Death is just stepping out of this headset.

1095
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:41,540
So that puts all that I'm doing in a very different framework.

1096
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:49,540
So I feel the innate drive to try to be significant and to be better than the other.

1097
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:53,540
That's sort of wired into us just like object permanence is wired into.

1098
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,540
So I see that's all, in other words, we're wired up to take the headset seriously.

1099
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:01,540
And then so consciousness sort of wired itself up to take the headset seriously.

1100
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:05,540
But part of the waking up process is to step back and go, oh wow, okay.

1101
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,540
Oh no, no, no, I'm not a little thing inside the headset.

1102
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:10,540
The headset is inside of me.

1103
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:13,540
I'm eventually going to take the headset off.

1104
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:16,540
So I can have a looser relationship with all this stuff.

1105
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:19,540
I don't need to get that big house to be something.

1106
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,540
I don't need to have that big scientific paper.

1107
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,540
I don't need to be acknowledged.

1108
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,540
This is just all.

1109
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,540
Has it done this for you, Donald?

1110
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,540
Has it done this for you, what you're now saying?

1111
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,540
Sort of this realization in your personal life?

1112
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,540
It's interesting.

1113
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:41,540
It does it for me when I am conscious.

1114
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:50,540
When I let go of thought and sit there in consciousness without thought, yes.

1115
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:55,540
But as soon as I get back into thought, then I'm back into the old self that says,

1116
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:59,540
oh, it's just, and by the way, it's automatic.

1117
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,540
It's just like, yeah, the moon is there.

1118
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:07,540
Yeah, I need for my own significance to solve this problem or publish this paper.

1119
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,540
So I always have to step back and look at that and go, OK, there it is.

1120
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:15,540
So part of it, see, that may be part of the whole waking up process

1121
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:19,540
because when I step back and I go, OK, look, there it is.

1122
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,540
It feels bad.

1123
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,540
I feel like I'm under pressure.

1124
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,540
Why am I under pressure?

1125
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,540
This is a game.

1126
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,540
Oh, I'm taking the game.

1127
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,540
So I got lost in the game again.

1128
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,540
OK, so here I am lost in the game.

1129
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:36,540
So the periods of consciousness where you go, oh, look at that.

1130
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,540
I'm competing with so-and-so.

1131
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,540
I feel mad at so-and-so.

1132
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:44,540
Wait a minute.

1133
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:47,540
Because Joe just stole my Ferrari and Grand Theft Auto.

1134
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,540
It's just a game.

1135
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,540
Who cares if Joe stole my Ferrari and Grand Theft Auto?

1136
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,540
Yeah, I absolutely love it.

1137
01:29:54,540 --> 01:30:00,540
But it's so beautiful because this brings me back to discussions I have

1138
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:05,540
with Pornardo and Essentia, of course, is that we want to communicate pure science, right?

1139
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:11,540
You don't want people to shift or accept an idealist worldview

1140
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,540
because they want meaning in their life, right?

1141
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,540
Like you would pick a religion because you want meaning.

1142
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:21,540
No, you want it because it's true, because it's more truthful than physicalism.

1143
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,540
But you do get, as a sort of bonus, a lot of extra meaning, right?

1144
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:30,540
Because do you think culturally and where the world's at right now

1145
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:34,540
that this shift towards your view that consciousness is fundamental

1146
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:42,540
could also sort of bring us further and sort of make us tackle problems within the game

1147
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:47,540
that we are now sort of just talking climate, inequality, everything we see happening right now?

1148
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,540
What are your thoughts there?

1149
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:56,540
Yes, I think that this does lead to a perspective on social interactions

1150
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,540
and climate change and things like that.

1151
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:04,540
So communism, in principle, sounds like a great idea.

1152
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:08,540
No ownership, everybody works and shares.

1153
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:14,540
And if we were all wonderful consciousnesses and that's it, that would be fine.

1154
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:19,540
But when we're plunged into this headset, it's competition.

1155
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,540
It's nature, red, and truth, and claw.

1156
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:31,540
And so communism doesn't work because we're all asleep.

1157
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:36,540
We all buy the headset.

1158
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,540
But if we wake each other up, if consciousness,

1159
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:45,540
so there are certain spiritual teachers who are doing that,

1160
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:50,540
like Eckhart Tolle, for example, and many others who are doing a great job

1161
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:54,540
of sort of helping to wake people up and say, you're not a little thing inside space and time.

1162
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,540
You are the fundamental consciousness.

1163
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:05,540
The only way for us to get social institutions that work better is for the people to change.

1164
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:12,540
Right now, we need things like democracy and maybe even blockchain

1165
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,540
because we don't trust each other.

1166
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,540
So why do we have democracy?

1167
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:23,540
Well, if we have a monarch, we know that the monarch, it's luck of the draw.

1168
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:28,540
If it's Nero, you're in trouble, if it's Marcus Aurelius, you're great,

1169
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,540
but that's very unlikely you're going to get Marcus Aurelius.

1170
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:37,540
So when we have people that are asleep,

1171
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:40,540
that believe that they're little items inside the headset,

1172
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:43,540
then we have to have all these rules in place and so forth.

1173
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:52,540
But as we wake up, then I think, and maybe that's what consciousness is about in this headset,

1174
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,540
is humanity waking up.

1175
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:02,540
And maybe the science for the last several centuries where it studied space and time

1176
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:09,540
and all of a sudden realized space time is doomed and my interpretation realized it's a headset.

1177
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:13,540
That was a huge part of this consciousness waking up.

1178
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:16,540
That space time is doomed as a big one.

1179
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:22,540
Now realize it's a headset, realize, oh, we're the consciousness beyond the headset.

1180
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:29,540
And then as we wake up, maybe we can have a different kind of interaction with each other inside the headset.

1181
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:37,540
And so until there's a waking up, then we just have to use the standard rules and enforcement

1182
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:45,540
and democracy, avoid the monarch and all this stuff because any one person in power makes the whole thing vulnerable.

1183
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:51,540
The blockchain takes it to the extreme where you basically, you'd have to have a third of the players

1184
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:56,540
that are trying to be negative or take things down for the thing to fall apart.

1185
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,540
With a monarchy, you just need one player to take it down.

1186
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:04,540
But when you have a blockchain, you need like a third of the players to be malicious,

1187
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:08,540
what they call Byzantine attacks and so forth.

1188
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:19,540
So I think that changing human nature simply by waking us up to what we really are is the way forward for the social things.

1189
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:23,540
Otherwise, what we have to do is just make sure that we have the right rules.

1190
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:29,540
And you do this and I think that is sort of noble and so important that it's done through mathematics

1191
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,540
and not sort of because we had spiritual and religious traditions doing this,

1192
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,540
but we also see them falling back in that headset reality, right?

1193
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:39,540
And that's all about power and sort of control.

1194
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:44,540
Whereas at the core, some of them or many of them I think point to this,

1195
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:50,540
but it feels as if mathematics is maybe the most safe way to do this.

1196
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:54,540
You just don't make mistakes in doing so, in waking up.

1197
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:59,540
Make sure we really wake up and not sort of fool ourselves.

1198
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:06,540
I think so. I think that the mathematics is a gift that it counteracts dogmatism,

1199
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:11,540
it counteracts fuzzy thinking, it counteracts being asleep in some sense.

1200
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:16,540
It really is a wonderful tool to wake us up.

1201
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,540
I think there's something really deep there.

1202
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:25,540
Mathematics and its relationship to consciousness, I feel like my insight into that is trivial.

1203
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:31,540
I just have a deep feeling that my understanding is trivial.

1204
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:35,540
But I say that math is the bones of consciousness, I mean that's a metaphor,

1205
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:43,540
but I feel like Newton, I'm like a baby boy on the shore and there's something really deep out there.

1206
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:47,540
And Donald, did you two close our interview because we started with your upbringing,

1207
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:53,540
your dad being the fundamental of minister in a fundamental Protestant church.

1208
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,540
Is he still alive, your father?

1209
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,540
He died five years ago.

1210
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:04,540
Sorry to hear that, but did you ever discuss your work and theory?

1211
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:11,540
Did you have discussions with him about this and what did you think about what you did, your work?

1212
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:18,540
I did and I think he had mixed feelings about it.

1213
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,540
I think that he still thought the earth was 4,000 years old,

1214
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:27,540
but I think that he also liked that I was saying that consciousness is fundamental

1215
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:33,540
because he thought that that was true.

1216
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:41,540
But he had a notion of God that's sort of separate from us in some sense

1217
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:54,540
and the notion that I have is more that we are all one with whatever that one consciousness is.

1218
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:59,540
And that may be what Christianity really means deep down when it says that we're all children of God,

1219
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:04,540
that that might be what that means.

1220
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:10,540
So he had I think mixed feelings, he wanted me to pursue this because he liked that it was not physicalist.

1221
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:18,540
So he loved the mathematics and the science that was showing that space-time isn't fundamental.

1222
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:25,540
And I learned not to argue with him about evolution of a natural selection and the age of the earth

1223
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:30,540
because within the interface, when you take on the framework of the interface,

1224
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,540
it's just wrong to say it's 4,000 years old.

1225
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:33,540
It's just wrong.

1226
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:39,540
Now if you step outside the interface, then I can say the very notion of time itself is an illusion.

1227
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:43,540
It's an artifact of projection into our headset.

1228
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:50,540
So there is a deep sense in which it's not 4,000 years old, it's not a billion years old.

1229
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:55,540
But within the interface, if you're playing it within the interface, then you need to play fair within the interface.

1230
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:58,540
It's not 4,000 years old.

1231
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:04,540
It's so funny because it really reminds, it's the sort of discussions I have with my dad.

1232
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,540
He really likes the fact that all of this is pointing to consciousness being primary,

1233
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:13,540
but the moment I start telling that we are all one or part of this one consciousness,

1234
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:18,540
I mean, I'm much into Bernardo's thinking here as well, then I'm losing him

1235
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:25,540
because he really wants this God-creator, sort of exactly what you're saying outside of creation.

1236
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,540
Yeah, I agree.

1237
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:32,540
Now I'll just say one little thing too about the Eastern traditions that are more mystical,

1238
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:37,540
that what this can do is they talk about language as pointers.

1239
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,540
The word isn't it and so forth.

1240
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:45,540
But what science can do is really up our game on pointers.

1241
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,540
It can really help us.

1242
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:51,540
It's nothing to boast about that we've used the same pointers for 3,000 years.

1243
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:55,540
I'm using the same pointer that the Dowdy Ching used or something like that.

1244
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,540
There's nothing to boast about.

1245
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:03,540
What we like as a way to get surely if consciousness is infinitely deep,

1246
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,540
we don't want to be sticking with the same pointers all the time.

1247
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,540
We need deeper and new pointers.

1248
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:12,540
And that's where science and spirituality together, not antagonistically,

1249
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:18,540
but the insights of spirituality with the rigor of science together can evolve new pointers

1250
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:24,540
that help us to avoid one of the big problems of human nature, which is dogmatism,

1251
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,540
both among scientists and among spiritual people.

1252
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:32,540
Spiritual people can be very, very dogmatic, but I know the truth.

1253
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:37,540
It's very, very nice to have the mathematical stuff to actually push you

1254
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,540
so that we believe dogmatically space-time is fundamental.

1255
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:43,540
Our math said, no, no, no.

1256
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:47,540
Your best theory of space-time tells you that space-time is not fundamental.

1257
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:49,540
That's how we avoid dogmatism.

1258
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,540
You need to bring math into church.

1259
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,540
Yes.

1260
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,540
I will go to those sermons.

1261
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,540
Those are sermons I will go to.

1262
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:00,540
Thank you so much, Donald. You have to leave.

1263
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,540
This is a great pleasure.

1264
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:04,540
Thanks. Good to hear that.

1265
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,540
And a pleasure as well. Thanks so much.
