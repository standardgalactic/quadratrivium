0	10040	Space-time is just our headset, but we lose ourselves in the game.
10040	15960	And we take the game as the reality.
15960	20960	For Essencia Foundation, I had the honor of sitting down with one of my absolute intellectual
20960	27200	heroes, cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, to discuss the nature of reality.
27200	30920	Before I share our full conversation, here are some of the highlights.
30920	38560	I'll say this, there is no physicalist theory that has at any time proposed a specific conscious
38560	40280	experience that they can explain.
40280	42920	There's not one on the table.
42920	49120	The distinction that we make between conscious and unconscious, and between living and non-living,
49120	51000	is not a principle distinction.
51000	52760	It's a mistake.
52760	60360	It's a rookie mistake that we make by mistaking our space-time headset for the final truth.
60360	64440	What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
64440	72160	How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
72160	78560	Were you happy with the movie The Matrix, what it did sort of culturally with that metaphor?
78560	84600	The Matrix really does open people's minds up to the possibility that what they're experiencing
84600	87600	is just a simulation, right?
87600	91520	Now in The Matrix, though, once you pop out of the simulation, there's another space-time
91520	92520	world.
92520	102800	So when Neo takes off the headset, he's back in the space-time world.
102800	106320	So it's Trinity and everybody, they're all in the space-time world.
106320	113160	So what I'm saying is even more radical, that whatever is beyond space-time is utterly
113160	115080	unlike space and time.
115080	118080	But this is like fundamental stuff, right?
118080	119280	This is the real cool stuff.
119280	124920	We are still thinking of traveling in space-time, and we have all these space-time fantasies.
124920	130720	Most of the galaxies that we can see, we could never go to.
130720	135560	Space is expanding so quickly that we could never get to them through space, moving at
135560	136560	the speed of light.
136560	139840	So there's all this real estate out there that we can see that's waving at us and saying,
139840	141920	nanny, nanny, you can never get here.
141920	145520	Well, that's if you go through space-time.
145520	151000	But if space-time is just a headset, think about the options that come, you don't have
151000	152000	to go through space-time.
152000	153160	You could go around space-time.
153160	158080	When we let go of the physicalist framework, we say, no, I am consciousness.
158080	160040	I transcend this.
160040	161600	Death is just stepping out of this headset.
162360	166840	In other words, we're wired up to take the headset seriously, and so consciousness wired
166840	169640	itself up to take the headset seriously.
169640	174480	But part of the waking up process is to step back and go, oh, wow, okay, oh, no, no.
174480	177120	I'm not a little thing inside the headset.
177120	178880	The headset is inside of me.
178880	181600	I'm eventually going to take the headset off.
181600	184200	So I can have a looser relationship with all this stuff.
184200	187520	I don't need to get that big house to be something.
187520	190080	I don't need to have that big scientific paper.
190080	193000	I don't need to be acknowledged.
193000	194480	Has it done this for you, Donald?
194480	196400	Has it done this for you, what you're now saying?
196400	200760	Yeah, sort of this realization in your personal life?
200760	205240	It's interesting.
205240	209000	It does it for me when I am conscious.
209000	213200	Okay, great.
213200	216760	Donald, I'm really, really happy that we can do this.
216760	220720	So nice to have you on the other side and sitting here.
220720	221720	Thank you very much, Hansen.
221720	223280	It's a very kind of you to invite me.
223280	225240	Yeah, we just spoke about your background.
225240	231840	I thought if it's okay with you to start a bit on a personal note, could you tell a little
231840	235160	bit about your background and your upbringing?
235160	239840	Well, I was born in an army hospital in San Antonio, Texas.
239840	242120	My dad was a GI.
242120	243440	He was just trying to find himself.
243440	250200	We went into the army, newly wed, and I was born nine months later.
250200	259080	So they were both just like 21 and trying to figure things out, and they were having
259080	260360	a hard time making ends meet.
260360	264720	They didn't have enough money to eat at the end of the month, so it was quite something.
264720	267760	But six months after I was born, they moved to California.
267760	275200	So I basically was raised in Southern California all of my life, and he was an engineer, and
275200	281800	my mom, she had a bachelor's in biology, and she ended up doing some computer programming
281800	283000	when I was about 10 years old.
283000	287040	She was one of the early programmers and sort of got me interested in computers.
287040	288640	My dad was an engineer.
288640	296480	He had a master's in chemistry and worked at various high tech companies that were at
296480	302440	the early stages of building storage devices for computers and so forth.
302440	311560	And then he became a Christian when I was 10 or 11 years old, and that changed things
311560	314060	quite a bit.
314060	322320	My parents both jumped into it pretty heavily, and by the time I was in my mid to late teens,
322320	329800	he was an associate pastor at a church and went on for decades afterwards to be a pastor.
329800	337960	So I was really, from about age 10 on, really raised pretty heavily in a fundamentalist
337960	342920	Christian Protestant kind of background.
342920	348560	So it was pretty intense, and of course, well, in my case, I was the oldest.
348560	349560	I didn't rebel.
349560	351560	I went along.
351680	356000	It took me a long time to get a perspective, to be able to step back and start to get a
356000	357800	perspective on it.
357800	367960	My younger brother rebelled earlier, and my sister has never rebelled to this day.
367960	374400	And did you ever personally believe, did you have the faith as well as a teenager?
375120	383920	Well, yeah, I believed in God, and my thoughts about that have changed over the years with
383920	387520	what that word actually means, but there is a sense in which I still think that consciousness
387520	393960	is fundamental, and the grandfather in a chair with a long white beard is not what I think
393960	396960	of when I think of consciousness.
397120	404240	So it had a big influence on me, both positive and negative.
404240	409480	It really made me think about things beyond space and time, but I think it made me think
409480	413040	about them in not very functional ways.
413040	418880	And so I had to step back and really sort out what were, I mean, there are beautiful
418880	421440	things when Jesus says, love your neighbor as yourself.
421440	426040	That's, I mean, there's many, many beautiful things, but it's a mixed bag.
426120	434080	And so we each have to sort out that mixed bag and take what is really good and try to
434080	435960	be kind to everybody in the process.
435960	440520	But I think it's so great that your work offers, in a sense, I think a refuge.
440520	447760	I mean, that it is to me, alongside with people like Bernardo and more people who think consciousness
447760	449080	might be fundamental.
449080	454800	So I think that's really great that you're offering that intellectually through science
454880	455880	to people.
455880	462680	And a question I had has to do with the, I hear you say a lot in interviews that you
462680	465400	want to make things mathematically rigorous, right?
465400	468840	And I am not a mathematician.
468840	473720	Understanding of math does not sort of extend beyond high school.
473720	480880	And what exactly, if you had to define, and that's maybe a two, a weird or broad question,
480920	482640	but what is math exactly?
482640	485720	Is it sort of a symbolic representation of reality?
485720	487240	I mean, that's what I now think.
487240	490680	But how would you define mathematics?
490680	498640	So mathematics is the way of getting rid of fuzzy thinking and hand waving and therefore
498640	500440	the dogmatism that can come with it.
500440	502960	Because I know what's right.
502960	506280	Because if you try to come at me with some argument, then I'll just sort of change my
506280	512560	view enough so that, but if I put it down in an equation, then it's hard for me to dodge
512560	513560	and weave.
513560	517640	It's not impossible, but it makes it much, much harder to dodge and weave.
517640	523000	So mathematics is infinitely complicated.
523000	529480	This is a Girdel, Kurt Girdel in 1930, 1931, when he was a young man, like 25 years old,
529480	533120	proved perhaps one of the greatest intellectual achievements in all of human history.
533120	535520	It was called Girdel's incompleteness theorem.
536520	541000	Without going into the details, it entails that there's no end to the exploration of
541000	543120	mathematical structure.
543120	548240	In some sense, it seems to me that it entails that you can't be omniscient about mathematics
548240	552720	because it just really, we'll put it this way, the kind of omniscience involved would
552720	555640	be stunning omniscience.
555640	559560	It would have to, I would have to, is beyond my conception of the kind of omniscience that
559560	563640	would be needed to have a full comprehension of the math.
563760	570480	Finally, any finite formal system is, Girdel shows us, merely a scratch on the surface
570480	573640	of this infinite depth of mathematics.
573640	580280	And so that means that math is a two-edged sword here.
580280	583600	On the one hand, it cuts through our dogmatism and our fuzzy thinking.
583600	585840	And so it's absolutely essential.
585840	591400	Because one thing we know about human nature is that we're dogmatic.
591440	596640	We know what we know, and we know that the other guy's wrong, and we're not in conversations
596640	600680	typically to learn, we're in conversations to show other people that we're right and
600680	603960	they're wrong, with happy exceptions.
603960	610560	But with mathematics, when you're forced to state your ideas with mathematical precision,
610560	611560	there's no hiding, right?
611560	616200	And when I say, for example, that I think that consciousness is fundamental, and then
616200	620640	I say, and here's what I claim the structure of consciousness is.
620640	622360	And so I write down some math.
622360	626600	Now I get the other, so that's the first side of the sword, and it's wonderful, right?
626600	631360	It really cuts through dogmatism and fuzzy thinking and dodging and weaving.
631360	636560	On the other hand, Girdel has told us that essentially there's infinite wisdom beyond
636560	639040	any formal theory that you could write down.
639040	643320	Yeah, by proven by math itself, that's so astonishing.
643320	645040	It's proven by mathematics.
645040	657720	It's really, truly stunning that the mathematics itself gives us the insight that no mathematics
657720	664720	that we could do is ever the whole truth, and in fact, that there's essentially unbounded
664720	670520	intelligence of mathematics beyond what you could do with what, and who knows, and mathematics
670520	674480	isn't the whole world, but that's just part of it, certainly part of reality.
674480	680320	And so already we know that reality transcends any mathematical theory, so that also entails
680320	683080	that there can be no scientific theory of everything.
683080	688920	And yeah, yeah, it makes us humble, right, Girdel made us humble.
688920	695880	It's very, very humbling, and so what we have then, so someone might say, well, just throw
695880	701040	up your hands, you know, let's just party and, you know, we can't know it all, then
701040	702040	why know anything?
702040	705840	And I think that that's the wrong attitude, it's not my attitude anyway.
705840	716000	It is, we do have this wonderful tool, and we do find that it is incredibly effective.
716000	719560	Eugene Wigner has said that the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural
719560	722680	sciences, he was amazed at it, and a lot of us agree.
722680	727880	It's truly stunning that using Newton, Newton's equations, we can send rockets to planets,
727880	729480	and it works quite well.
729600	734000	And with Einstein's equations, we get even, you know, greater fidelity, and with quantum
734000	739640	theory, you know, well Maxwell's equations and quantum theory, we're talking literally
739640	746080	on opposite sides of the world using technology that would not be possible without the mathematics,
746080	748120	absolutely not.
748120	758800	And so the mathematics is at once empowering, and it avoids dogmatism, and it really then
758800	760040	is humbling.
760040	766200	Once you really understand it, it's truly humbling, and so, and I think for me, it then
766200	770560	is a pointer to a way of thinking about what is consciousness about.
770560	776800	If consciousness is all there is, then mathematical structure is only about consciousness, because
776800	780360	that's all it's there for it to be about.
780360	787240	So, then Gertl is telling us that there's no end to the variety of conscious experiences
787800	788800	and conscious activity.
788800	792080	Whatever consciousness is, is literally unbounded, because mathematics is unbounded.
792080	796400	Yeah, I'd love to go a bit deeper into that, but I'd first like to ask you, you just said,
796400	800240	I mean, it avoids mathematics, avoids fuzzy thinking, right?
800240	807160	And we, I'd like to talk a bit about sort of the two paradigms, physicalism versus
807160	808160	idealism.
808160	810480	It's a big spectrum, of course, there's a lot in between.
810480	815560	But could you sort of sketch our Newtonian worldview and how we always thought about
815560	823480	consciousness and why that felt so scientific or scientifically correct, and what quantum
823480	827160	theory did do that notion?
827160	832840	Right, so many of the early scientists, like Newton himself, were actually believers in
832840	843280	God and Christians, and Newton apparently wrote more theology than physics.
843640	847840	His, the Newtonian world was essentially a mechanical world.
847840	853320	You could write down these differential equations, and if you knew the starting conditions with
853320	858320	precision, then you could predict pretty much everything that was going to happen going
858320	859880	forward.
859880	868320	And so, it led others like George Barclay to, who was a bishop in the Christian Church
868320	873080	of England or something like that, to come up with his version of idealism as sort of
873080	879840	a counter to what he viewed was the, the mechanism, the mechanical view of the universe that came
879840	881480	from Newton.
881480	886680	So he, he was a reaction in part against that.
886680	896120	And but eventually, you know, idealism had a heyday in the 1800s, but in the 1900s it,
897120	904520	sort of died out, largely died out, the success of Newton, and then the success of, you know,
904520	909880	Einstein's special in general relativity theories, and then the success of quantum mechanics.
909880	920160	Now, with quantum mechanics, the early theorists, many of them like Mox Planck, for example,
920160	924080	clearly thought that space and time were not the fun, not the final thing.
924080	928080	They, they thought, you know, Mox Planck was very, very clearly thought consciousness was
928080	932280	fundamental, and he, he said so.
932280	936960	And there was a period in which many of the early thinkers in quantum theory, you know,
936960	941880	from like 1926, 1925, until World War II.
941880	946920	So that, that period in there, there was a lot of soul searching about what was quantum
946920	953760	mechanics telling us deeply about who we are and the nature of the universe and, and is
953760	958800	the physicalist idea that space and time and matter are fundamental.
958800	960880	So those, I mean, that's the, that's the physicalist idea.
960880	967400	Space time is fundamental, and the particles in space time, you know, quarks, leptons and bosons,
967400	969920	those are our new fundamental particles right now.
969920	976920	That, that is the fundamental grounding reality, and everything else is just a complicated pattern
976920	981760	of the interactions of, of those particles in space time.
982040	988320	Many quantum theorists began to question that early on, but after the start of World War
988320	992520	II, things changed.
992520	999160	We got the shut up and calculate kind of attitude because physics now, you know, in quantum physics
999160	1006520	became put in service of, of the war, and, and it became highly funded and it made the
1006520	1010560	atom bomb and, and all of a sudden it was a completely different thing.
1010560	1017040	And so that, the, the early generation that started, that were thinking, what does this
1017040	1018040	really mean?
1018040	1024320	That, that really got shut down in large part by World War II, but, but more recently than
1024320	1030680	it, you know, like the conference that we'll be having here at Chatham, there's been a
1030680	1036680	lot of thought now about the nature of what our current physics theories are telling.
1036720	1042720	Quantum field theory now, with gravity, you know, trying to understand how those interact,
1042720	1049720	has, has led some, but not too many, physicists to, to once again wonder whether consciousness
1053440	1054440	is fundamental.
1054440	1059920	That, that, I would say, not, I don't know too many physicists.
1059920	1065800	I've been to an FQXI conference a few years ago on the role of the observer in, in quantum
1065840	1071960	theory and it, it became very, very clear there that the idea that consciousness might
1071960	1074560	be fundamental was, was basically not on the table.
1074560	1081560	It, it, it's, it's not taken seriously, but what is taken seriously is that space time
1081720	1083640	is doomed.
1083640	1089920	That's really interesting, you know, and we're, we're talking big, big giants in, in physics.
1090040	1097040	Ed Whitten has said that, who, one of the ones who's been foundational in string theory,
1098160	1101160	M theory.
1101160	1107160	Nathan Seiberg at the Institute for Advanced Study, and then very influential, Nima, or
1107160	1113040	Connie Hamed, who's also at the Institute for Advanced Study, and, and it's, it's become
1113040	1119400	very, very clear from the actual structure of the physical laws themselves that space
1119400	1120800	time cannot be fundamental.
1120800	1125920	And this is, again, where the mathematics is really powerful, just like Gertl used the
1125920	1132040	mathematics to show that mathematics, at least any finite axiomatization of mathematics,
1132040	1134480	can't be the whole thing.
1134480	1138400	So the physicists are using the theory of space time to show that space time can't be
1138400	1144680	the whole thing, and that is the beauty of the mathematics.
1144680	1149380	It tells you where the theories stop.
1149380	1152340	This is where space, space time is great.
1152340	1154980	It's a wonderful framework for a while.
1154980	1156480	And here is where it stops.
1156480	1161220	It stops at about 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.
1161220	1164540	It ceases to have any operational meaning.
1164540	1167460	And what happens, but you're referring to the Planck scale, right?
1167460	1170340	The smallest scale that we have in physics.
1170340	1177340	What exactly happens at that, at that scale that makes you say space time is doomed?
1177340	1180940	So, of course, I'm not a physicist, so I'm telling you what the physicists say.
1180940	1187860	But what the physicists will tell you is that the way that you probe smaller and smaller
1187860	1192620	regions of space, in other words, to have a better and better microscope to look at smaller
1192620	1197820	and smaller details, you need to have wavelengths of light that are getting finer and finer,
1197820	1201540	because you have to have fine wavelengths of light to resolve fine detail in what you're
1201540	1202540	looking at.
1202540	1204500	Well, that's fine.
1204900	1206420	Requires more energy.
1206420	1209780	From quantum theory, we understand that the energy is proportional to the frequency, E
1209780	1211300	equals h nu.
1211300	1214180	So as the frequency goes up, you need more energy.
1214180	1217700	So that's fine.
1217700	1222100	So unless there's gravity, and that's the problem.
1222100	1227180	So if it was just quantum mechanics, you could, in principle, go as far as you wanted, as
1227180	1228700	much energy as you wanted.
1228700	1234340	But the problem is with gravity and Einstein, energy and mass are equivalent.
1234340	1238700	So as you put more and more energy into a smaller and smaller region of space, you're
1238700	1242420	essentially putting more mass into a small region of space, and then, unfortunately,
1242420	1247940	you, at some point, at around 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, you just start creating black
1247940	1248940	holes.
1248940	1253580	And so the very thing that you're trying to study no longer exists.
1253580	1256580	And if you put more energy, if you say, I'm frustrated, I'm just going to try to go smaller
1256580	1260140	with higher and higher frequencies, you just make the black hole bigger.
1260140	1263860	So the problem literally grows.
1263860	1266100	So that's one reason.
1266100	1271420	The second reason is that in quantum theory, the measuring devices themselves, the thing
1271420	1277700	that you're using to measure the spin of the electron or the position of the gluon or something
1277700	1282100	like that, these devices themselves are physical devices.
1282100	1286460	And so they're quantum mechanical systems with their own degrees of freedom.
1286700	1290460	And therefore, they have their own limits of precision, Heisenberg uncertainty kinds
1290460	1291460	of things.
1291460	1294580	And so if you want more and more precise measurements, you have to have more and more degrees of
1294580	1298380	freedom in those measuring devices, which is going to make them heavier and heavier.
1298380	1302780	And at some point, once again, the device will collapse into a black hole.
1302780	1305900	So if you have a small, if you have a room and you're trying to measure something in
1305900	1309540	a room, it turns out there is nothing that you can measure with precision.
1309540	1314420	So there are no local observables in any part of space and time.
1314580	1319660	Yeah. So if you want to pinpoint space time down to the smallest and really know what
1319660	1322260	it is at the smallest level, it will blow in your face.
1322260	1325540	It will become a black hole and that's right.
1325820	1331820	And beyond that, then the very notion of space and time of lengths and distances and time
1332140	1336500	beyond that level simply has no operational meaning.
1337420	1341780	So we're not they're not saying that there are pixels that at the bottom level, there
1341780	1345180	are these pixels like the pixels on your screen of your computer screen or something
1345180	1346180	like that.
1346180	1351460	No, it just means that the whole notion of space time itself ceases to make sense.
1351460	1355220	So it stops. Space time is doomed. It cannot.
1355220	1362220	So this is a huge blow because with Newton, right, space time is fundamental, although
1362220	1365260	Newton believed it was more of a dualist view because he thought that there was a God beyond
1365260	1366260	space time.
1366260	1371740	But once the scientific world let go of that, then it's just space time and it's part
1371740	1373820	of the particles are fundamental.
1373820	1378540	And we thought we thought that it was infinitely deep.
1378540	1382180	You know, you could always we thought reductionism was going to work.
1382180	1386620	We could just go to smaller and smaller scales in space time to find more and more fundamental
1386620	1387620	laws.
1387620	1392180	And so and with with, you know, Boltzmann and his work on thermodynamics and so forth,
1392180	1394860	we had our first taste that maybe something like that could really work that we could
1394860	1400140	not the first taste, but a compelling taste that that kind of reductionist thing could
1400140	1401140	really work.
1401540	1406740	So we were off to the races with reductionism reductionism would be yeah, reductionism is
1406740	1411180	so I understand this, but this is just for people watching this reductionism means going
1411180	1418420	down into space time, the smallest building blocks of space time and see if we can understand
1418420	1423900	that. And if we understand that we then we have lost that sort of govern everything bigger,
1423900	1426580	including consciousness.
1426580	1430620	That's right. So it's going to be as we go to smaller and smaller scales will just find
1430620	1438500	deeper and deeper laws. And so that was that was the the dream. And it's a new tonic.
1438500	1443300	But Donald, what I'm very curious about your take on quantum mechanics or at least how
1443300	1450100	you would explain it. I've read this book, Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum and Fred
1450100	1456980	Cutner. I heard it was sort of a good introductionary book. And I found it very, very, very good.
1457980	1462540	And they say with quantum theory, physics and counter consciousness. And I was just
1462540	1468060	wondering, I've read the book, and I still find it hard to sort of retell it to people
1468060	1473500	because it's just so counterintuitive. How would you explain that that in quantum theory?
1473500	1477660	Or I mean, if you agree, did physics encounter consciousness?
1478660	1488660	Well, some of the earlier pioneers of quantum theory did think that. So Max Planck, I think,
1488660	1496700	Schrodinger, arguably, Wigner, some things that von Neumann writes, wrote seem along
1496700	1503700	those lines, although I won't pin them with that. But I would say, when I talk to modern
1503740	1511100	day quantum physicists, I don't, when they talk about the role of the observer in quantum
1511100	1515940	theory, the observer is a technical term. It's some kind of measuring device, perhaps
1515940	1522940	another quantum system, another physical system. And the idea that consciousness is fundamental
1523780	1530780	is a tiny minority view. I would say under 1% in my interactions. They understand that
1536660	1539980	in many of the interpretations of quantum theory that we need to have some notion of
1539980	1545980	the role of the observer, although in the many worlds or multiverse kinds of interpretations
1545980	1552220	you can start to let go of that role of the observer in some sense. But they have their
1552220	1562180	own problems. So I would say that for those who want to ignore consciousness and still
1562180	1568820	be quantum theorists, they can do that. And many, many brilliant physicists are doing
1568820	1575580	just that. Even the ones who take the notion of agency as really important in quantum theory
1575620	1588620	that somehow the wave function is not a state of the external world independent of the agent,
1588980	1593900	but is actually a statement of the degrees of belief of the agent about the outcomes
1593900	1599180	that they will experience if they do certain experiments, certain measurements. But even
1599180	1606180	in that case, and the theorists doing this are brilliant, most of them are going to say,
1608340	1612540	I don't know what an agent is, and I'm not going to commit that it's consciousness. I'm
1612540	1617060	just talking about, I'm doing quantum theory, you tell me what an agent is, but it's probably
1617060	1620780	going to be some kind of, when we really cash it out, it's probably going to be some kind
1620780	1626220	of quantum physical system with just lots of degrees and freedom and so forth. But don't
1626260	1630980	worry with me about that right now. I'm just going to assume that there's some notion of
1630980	1637980	agent that will leave undefined. So I don't see, what I do see is brilliant researchers
1639180	1646180	like Neymar, Connie Hamed and Juan Maldesena making bold moves beyond space-time. They're
1646500	1653340	saying there is, space-time is doomed. It's the work of our generation to find out what's
1653340	1658860	beyond space-time. So how do you do that? What kind of flashlight are you going to use
1658860	1665860	into the dark beyond space-time? Because even though quantum field theory and gravity together
1665860	1671860	tell us that space-time isn't fundamental, they can't tell us what's beyond. They just
1671860	1676020	say, this is how far I go and no further, but they can't tell you what's next.
1676020	1682540	But when you say you think consciousness is fundamental, you are not in the school of
1682660	1686740	and indeed you're right. That is a minority. I think the consciousness causes collapse sort
1686740	1692980	of interpretation of quantum mechanics. Von Neumann, who still sort of believed that.
1692980	1697660	And John Wheeler, I don't really know. I'm curious also on your thoughts on John Wheeler.
1697660	1704660	But so you are not thinking that consciousness somehow collapses a world in superposition
1705660	1710660	into a classical world?
1710660	1717660	No, that's not my view. I think that the closest to my view among the standard quantum interpretations
1721660	1728660	is Chris Fuchs, Cubism, quantum Bayesianism. Right. And I think it's a brilliant interpretation
1729660	1736660	where Chris Fuchs says, look, the way a function is not some objective thing out in space and
1738420	1744920	time, it's in the mind of the agent. It's the degrees of belief of the agent. And he's
1744920	1750620	very consistent in pointing out that when you're thinking about probabilities, you can
1750620	1757300	either be an objective probabilist or a Bayesian subjectivist. And he gives good reasons to
1757340	1762060	think that, you know, just on probability alone, you should be thinking about a subjectivist
1762060	1768500	interpretation of probability. And then once you adopt that, then well, the quantum wave
1768500	1772580	function is really how probabilities of interpretation.
1772580	1779580	Just for people who've now totally lost it, when we talk about objective probabilities,
1780540	1787540	then you believe there is an actual world out there, and you just don't know it, right?
1788300	1795300	And then you have to deal with these probabilities. And that gives you sort of a way to predict
1795380	1801300	what's going to happen, right? But there is an objective world. And subjective probabilities
1801300	1807140	would be that you just don't know what's out there, or how would you describe this?
1807900	1812900	You could be a realist about the external world and be a subjectivist about the probabilities.
1812900	1819900	So the objectivism and subjectivism, the probability is about what do we mean when we say the probability
1820900	1827140	of tails is half? Well, does it mean that if I flip the coin a thousand times, you'll
1827140	1834140	get exactly 500 heads and 500 tails? That's sort of a frequentist kind of view that what
1834940	1841780	probability means is what frequency, if you do lots of observations, will you end up with?
1841780	1846420	And the subjectivist says, well, no, it's not about objective frequencies that are measured.
1846420	1852020	It's more about your degrees of belief, about what you expect to have happen. And so you
1852020	1859020	could have prior probabilities. I expect the sun to rise tomorrow at whatever time, 5.30
1859020	1864500	in the morning, because it's been doing so for thousands of years. And so I have this
1864500	1871500	prior. I would say it's 0.99999. A lot of nines that the sun is going to rise tomorrow,
1873260	1880260	but there is a tiny chance. And that's a subjective degree of belief.
1881260	1888260	And so now if you have this idea that what we're dealing with in quantum theory and when
1889620	1894500	we're talking about the wave functions of various, like two gluons hitting each other
1894500	1898260	and four gluons spraying out, like in the Large Hadron Collider, and you're asking what
1898260	1904260	are the probabilities of these various events? And you write down these scattering amplitudes,
1904860	1911860	these amplitudes for it. I think the Cubist would say that is merely me as a theorist
1913060	1918940	putting, as a good Bayesian, putting down what I expect to have happen, what I expect
1918940	1924500	to see. Whereas an objectivist would say, no, it's really a statement about something
1924500	1931500	true and about the objective world, and you can measure that truth with frequencies by
1932380	1939380	lots of observations. And so my view then is more like Chris Fuchs in the subjectivist
1939620	1946620	view, but in which case then, I don't need to have all these worlds out there. I'm positing,
1947380	1953580	okay, maybe the coin comes heads or maybe it comes up tails. I don't need to have a
1953580	1956780	world branching out there. I'm just wondering about the difference. So I don't need to have
1956780	1962340	all this metaphysical excess of, well, there's a whole universe in which the thing came up
1962340	1967180	heads and the other one in which it came up tails. It's a metaphysically high price to
1967180	1969540	pay for being, you know...
1969540	1974340	But what I find so funny about this, because I now understand this after a year of sort
1974340	1980180	of getting my head around it, is that I now understand that your position makes less metaphysical
1980180	1984860	claims because people on the street will think you're making a crazy metaphysical claim that
1984900	1989620	consciousness is primary. And they say, of course, there's a world out there and they'll
1989620	1993980	maybe have read something about the many worlds interpretation that there is parallel universes
1993980	2000980	and that they think is sort of not a metaphysical claim. So where's this, how do we end up
2001660	2007660	in this sort of misunderstanding of what metaphysics, what is sort of a heavy metaphysical claim
2007660	2010420	and a light one?
2010540	2017540	Well, I think many of us intuitively would agree with Einstein. Einstein was a realist
2017540	2024040	and he thought that the moon was there when no one looked. He didn't think that the act
2024040	2026940	of observation when I look up there and see the moon that I'm creating the moon when I
2026940	2031420	look at it, the moon is really there and Einstein wanted physics to be that way and he didn't
2031420	2038420	like the spooky interactions at a distance that he himself sort of pointed out in quantum
2038980	2045980	theory that things could happen faster than the speed of light apparently and of course
2047220	2051380	they weren't any causal interactions, they were nothing, no information traveling through
2051380	2054700	space faster than the speed of light as it turned out. But he didn't like it because
2054700	2061700	he wanted to have a sort of a new tone, a classical world view where space and time
2061780	2068280	was much more interesting than Newton thought but nevertheless it wasn't spooky like quantum
2068280	2075000	theory seemed to be indicating and so I think most of us intuitively would agree with Einstein
2075000	2081040	and he's not bad company. If Einstein thinks that space and time are fundamental and objects
2081040	2086280	are the moon is there when no one exists, who might argue with Einstein. So I think
2086280	2093280	a lot of us intuitively think that and I think I know why. The developmental psychologists
2093840	2100840	have told us why. So Piaget said that children, he thought by the time they're at 18 months
2102840	2109840	of age, get what he calls object permanence. That is we're programmed genetically at a
2110260	2116760	certain point in our lives to just believe that up to a point when mommy has the doll
2116760	2121760	and it's where I can play with it, the doll exists while I'm playing with it but as soon
2121760	2124880	as mommy takes the doll and puts it behind the pillow and I don't see it, it's gone.
2124880	2130600	It doesn't exist until you're around 18 months of age according to Piaget. Later work showed
2130600	2133960	us maybe three or four months of age, much earlier than you thought, where you get what's
2133960	2140960	called object permanence which is the pre-programmed belief that object really exists even when
2141960	2146560	you don't perceive it. So you start to become a metaphysical realist not because you're
2146560	2152680	argued into it because you're programmed to believe it. So the reason why it's so hard
2152680	2159680	for us to let go of the idea that the moon doesn't exist except when you look and create
2160280	2167280	it. To let go of the idea that things really are there, we want the dolly to be there,
2168520	2175520	we want the moon to be there is because we believed that before we were rational. It's
2176000	2181920	the water we swim in intellectually and so it's really hard for us to even see that,
2181920	2187640	to question it. When I remember giving a talk to my own department, Cognizant's department
2187640	2194320	where I was explaining my argument from evolution why we are creating everything that we see
2194320	2200320	on the fly. So the physicists have an argument that space time isn't fundamental and therefore
2200600	2206160	somehow the act of observation must be creating what we're, because it's not space time,
2206160	2211160	whatever is there. I have an argument from evolution of natural selection to the same
2211160	2215560	and so I gave it to my department a few years ago and the argument was pretty clear so they
2215560	2221760	were nodding their heads and oh yeah and I realized that they followed the argument but
2221760	2225600	they didn't know what it really meant so I said look this means that neurons don't exist
2225600	2229400	when they're not perceived. Neurons cause none of our behavior and then look of horror
2229480	2234480	throughout all my colleagues who used to think that I was a reasonable and possibly intelligent
2234480	2241480	guy. All of a sudden looks of horror what is this guy saying? So it's not, it's a deep emotional
2241760	2247760	thing. It's like being told that someone that you thought you knew really well all your life
2247760	2253920	has been in a suit and they're really a Komodo dragon and you didn't know it. It's just that
2254000	2260120	appalling an idea. And how has this all been for you personally? I mean because this is
2260120	2266360	all intellectual and mathematics but at night when Donald goes too bad and you ponder about
2266360	2271760	this you know how does that sort of, what's the impact? What has the impact been on you
2271760	2278760	personally? Well it's, I know first hand how difficult it is to let go of the object permanence.
2279040	2286040	I see it, that is my default mode. So even though I've been working on this mathematics
2287040	2294040	and publishing papers for decades on this kind of topic, when I'm not paying attention
2295680	2302680	I'm a realist. I just automatically fall to that point of view. So it's the way I think
2302800	2309800	about it is like if you've ever played a virtual reality game that's highly immersive,
2310000	2315480	you put on a headset and body suit and you know when you first get in, hey look, this
2315480	2318320	beautiful world that I'm involved in, maybe it's Grand Theft Auto or whatever it might
2318320	2323600	be, some VR version of that. So you're immersed, you're seeing all this stuff and when you
2323600	2330100	first go in you have this sense of detachment. Here I am outside of the game with just this
2330100	2336620	headset on, but once you get into it you're in the game and your emotions get tied up
2336620	2342820	in it and you lose yourself in the game and so effectively that's what I'm saying is
2342820	2349820	happening here. Space time is just our headset but we lose ourselves in the game and we lose,
2350740	2357740	we take the game as the reality and what science has done, what physics has done is
2358020	2365020	study space time very, very well. They studied our headset and they studied the headset so
2365020	2372020	well that they discovered it's just a headset and that's the power of the scientific method.
2373900	2377700	We studied space time because we thought it was a fundamental reality. We were lost
2377700	2384500	in the game but because we didn't just wave our hands and get dogmatic about it, we actually
2384500	2389980	wrote down equations and then Einstein wrote down, Einstein was the one that really blew
2389980	2396060	this thing open with general relativity because he had the notion like in 1907 that if I was
2396060	2402420	in an elevator standing on a scale to weigh myself and all of a sudden the cord broke
2402420	2406300	and the elevator started in free fall, how much would I weigh on that scale and Einstein
2406300	2412140	realized I wouldn't weigh anything. He said like the happiest thought of his life. That
2412140	2417300	was the key idea for general relativity. If I was on a free falling elevator and standing
2417300	2424300	on a scale I would weigh nothing. Brilliant idea. It took Einstein, I don't know, seven
2424660	2430220	or eight years or something like that of intense work to turn that idea into mathematics and
2430220	2435620	it was, and he's Einstein, right? He's not such a smart guy. He's a really, really smart
2435620	2441340	guy. It takes him seven or eight years. He has to learn the mathematics. It was fairly
2441340	2447740	unusual mathematics, Riemannian geometry and so forth. But he learned the mathematics
2447740	2454740	and struggled and struggled and finally turned it into mathematics in 1915 and turned that
2455540	2462540	idea into one equation. That one equation then, a year later, a German guy, I guess he was
2462540	2467540	fighting in World War I and had time and the brilliance to work on Einstein's equations,
2467540	2472540	discovered what we now call the solution that's called black holes. Einstein didn't know about
2472540	2479540	black holes and he didn't like it. The key thing was you can be as smart as Einstein
2481540	2486540	and be so smart that you write down the field equations of general relativity and then those
2487540	2493540	equations come back and teach you something fundamental about black holes and then black
2498540	2503540	holes are what tell you that space time cannot be fundamental itself. There's got to be something
2503540	2510540	beyond and so that is what I love about the hard-nosed scientific attitude, is turn it
2510540	2517540	into mathematics. If you have a theory that is good enough to tell you where it stops,
2517540	2522540	that's the kind of theory that is the heart and soul of science. If you have a theory
2522540	2528540	that allows you to dodge and weave and always dodge any objection, I have absolutely no
2528540	2533540	interest. You're not playing the science game. You're playing some personal game.
2534540	2540540	Let's stay in that headset metaphor, which you've used very often of course and it's a great metaphor.
2540540	2546540	First of all, were you happy with the movie The Matrix, what it did sort of culturally with that metaphor?
2551540	2557540	Yeah, I think the Matrix really does open people's minds up to the possibility that what they're
2558540	2565540	experiencing is just a simulation, right? Now in The Matrix though, once you pop out of the simulation,
2565540	2572540	there's another space time world. So when Neo takes off the headset, he's back in the space time world,
2572540	2579540	right? And so it's Trinity and everybody, they're all in the space time world. So this, what I'm saying is
2579540	2586540	even more radical that whatever is beyond space time is utterly unlike the other space time
2587540	2594540	space and time. It's utterly outside of space and time and that's really hard to think outside
2594540	2599540	of the space time box. When I talk about conscious agents, people go where are they? I mean, they're not
2599540	2604540	in space and time, where are they? And you have to turn things around. Space and time is inside the minds
2604540	2611540	of the conscious agents. It's just like someone inside the virtual reality game of Grand Theft Auto.
2612540	2618540	The players inside could say, you think you're not really riding a red Mustang and you don't think
2618540	2623540	that green Ferrari really exists? Well, where are you? Well, I'm outside of the game. This game is just a headset.
2623540	2628540	But if you're not on the game, where could you possibly be? Where else is there besides the game?
2628540	2634540	And that's the same situation we have with space time. We can't think about being outside of that game.
2634540	2639540	But that's what our mathematics is telling us. You've got to think outside of that box and the best
2639540	2644540	physicists are, well, the best. The physicists that I'm really interested in, like Neymar,
2644540	2651540	Connie Hamid and Juan Maldecedo and others, Benny Costa, these guys are taking the bold step of moving
2651540	2657540	beyond space time and they are finding beautiful structures beyond space time that are really,
2657540	2660540	they don't know what they're about, but they're there.
2660540	2666540	Yeah. I think what people find so hard and also me myself, at first I was more attracted to this idea
2666540	2672540	of our brains being a receiver to a larger consciousness, right, that you see sort of the radio.
2672540	2678540	What's that interpretation called? I think it's Aldous Huxley, who sort of popularized the idea.
2678540	2686540	But you also say that your brain itself is just a sort of and your whole body itself is a projection
2686540	2694540	in space time. It's not real. It has no causal role to play for consciousness at all.
2694540	2701540	That's right. So right now I don't have a brain. I have no neurons. If you looked inside my skull,
2701540	2705540	you would find neurons and brains, but that's because you would create them as you looked.
2705540	2710540	The act of observation is creating what you see. So the brain isn't a receiver for consciousness
2710540	2715540	because the brain doesn't even exist. The brain itself is just a symbol inside of consciousness
2715540	2721540	that consciousness makes now and then and then deletes. So it's just like when, if you're playing a virtual reality
2721540	2725540	game, like the Grand Theft Auto, and you have your headset on, and if I look over to the right,
2725540	2732540	and I'll see a green Mustang. Well, there is no green Mustang, right?
2732540	2736540	What I'm really interacting with in this metaphor is some supercomputer somewhere.
2736540	2741540	It's got all this megabytes of software and diodes and resistors and voltages and magnetic fields.
2741540	2745540	I don't know anything about that. I don't have to know, but that's the reality, quote-unquote,
2745540	2750540	in this metaphor. There's no green Mustangs inside that computer anywhere.
2750540	2753540	There's nothing green inside that computer that looks like a Mustang.
2753540	2757540	So I'm creating the Mustang when I look and I'm deleting it when I look over here.
2757540	2763540	Now I see a white Porsche. Well, now I've deleted the green Mustang and I'm creating the white Porsche.
2763540	2766540	So we create the stuff on the fly.
2766540	2769540	But someone else might be looking at that green Mustang, right?
2769540	2774540	For that person, it will still exist.
2774540	2778540	But the it will be a different green Mustang than the one I saw, right?
2778540	2782540	Because I create my own Mustang in my head and they create their green Mustang in their head.
2782540	2786540	And we think that we're seeing the same Mustang because we agree.
2786540	2789540	Is there a Mustang to my right? Oh, yeah, there's a Mustang to your right.
2789540	2792540	And so we think that we're seeing exactly the same thing.
2792540	2795540	And that's that baby principle, the object permanence you mentioned, right?
2795540	2797540	That my child learns that.
2797540	2803540	But the hard part also is that people find difficult to understand is that if, for instance,
2803540	2808540	I take alcohol or psychedelics, which is something in space-time,
2808540	2813540	that definitely has a causal effect on my consciousness, right?
2813540	2823540	Right. So it's absolutely the case that space and time are an interface that allow us to do things
2823540	2825540	that can affect consciousness.
2825540	2831540	So for example, right now, you are affecting my consciousness.
2831540	2835540	And you're doing it through space and time. You're doing it through an interface.
2835540	2839540	So we know that even with the idea that consciousness is fundamental,
2839540	2845540	that one consciousness can affect another consciousness through the intermediary of space and time.
2845540	2850540	And in fact, that's what space and time are. They are this interface.
2850540	2854540	It's an interface that some conscious agents use to interact with other conscious agents.
2854540	2860540	So it's no surprise that actions that we take using an interface could affect our consciousness.
2860540	2862540	That's what the interface is for.
2862540	2869540	Now, but the reason why people have a hard time understanding this is because we make another mistake.
2869540	2876540	We mistake, because we mistake our interface for reality,
2876540	2881540	we also make a fundamental mistake that things that look simple to us
2881540	2885540	are therefore necessarily simple in and of themselves.
2885540	2890540	And things that look dead to us are necessarily dead.
2890540	2894540	So for example, if I look in the mirror, I see my face.
2894540	2898540	I presume when I look at your face, you're conscious.
2898540	2903540	And so faces point to conscious objects.
2903540	2909540	Well, I look at my cat, I am surely alive and it's probably conscious.
2909540	2914540	And an ant, certainly alive, people might begin to wonder about consciousness.
2914540	2918540	When I get down to microbe alive, probably not conscious.
2918540	2921540	And when you get down to virus, now we even debate about whether it's alive.
2921540	2924540	When we get down to particles, absolutely not alive.
2924540	2929540	And only if you're a panpsychist, you might say that they have some consciousness associated with them.
2929540	2933540	But a physicalist would say no consciousness.
2933540	2938540	That whole way of looking at things is fundamentally flawed.
2938540	2945540	It's mistaking a limit of our interface for an insight into the nature of reality.
2945540	2949540	An interface necessarily has to simplify things.
2949540	2953540	But that's what an interface is there for, it's to hide most of the reality
2953540	2956540	and the part of reality that it shows you, it's dumbing it down.
2956540	2961540	Well, so with certain symbols, like human bodies and human faces,
2961540	2964540	we get perhaps the most insight into other consciousnesses.
2964540	2969540	With other symbols like cat and dog and mouse, we get less insight.
2969540	2972540	And with other symbols, we get almost no insight.
2972540	2974540	Well, that doesn't mean that I'm not interacting with consciousness.
2974540	2976540	It just means that my interface gave up.
2976540	2979540	Well, no surprise, that's what interfaces do.
2979540	2980540	They give up at some point.
2980540	2986540	But it's a rookie mistake to take the pixels of my desktop interface
2986540	2989540	as the fundamental elements of reality.
2989540	2993540	And so right now I'm looking at a bunch of pixels which is Hans' face.
2993540	2995540	So those pixels are conscious.
2995540	3000540	But if I go smaller and smaller, the pixels that correspond to the door behind you
3000540	3002540	or whatever, those aren't conscious.
3002540	3005540	Well, that's the wrong way to think about the pixels.
3005540	3007540	Those are just pixels.
3007540	3011540	They're a portal through which I'm actually interacting with something on the other side.
3011540	3015540	So we've mistaken our interface for the reality.
3015540	3019540	So the distinction that we make between conscious and unconscious
3019540	3024540	and between living and non-living is not a principle distinction.
3024540	3026540	It's a mistake.
3026540	3034540	It's a rookie mistake that we make by mistaking our space-time headset for the final truth.
3034540	3037540	And so as a result, now to get back to your question,
3037540	3041540	when we start to do things like take drugs or get hit on the head
3041540	3043540	and we have changes in consciousness,
3043540	3047540	well, first there's no surprise that the interface allows you to change consciousness.
3047540	3048540	That's what it's for.
3048540	3053540	It's what consciousness is used to interact and affect other consciousnesses.
3053540	3057540	When I have something that I call a drug, if I'm a physicalist,
3057540	3061540	I'm thinking, hey, there's nothing to this, but some chemicals.
3061540	3062540	This is a chemical formula.
3062540	3064540	There's no consciousness here.
3064540	3068540	So here is this physical thing, a chemical, and look, it's taking down your consciousness.
3068540	3071540	So that shows that physicalism is true.
3071540	3075540	Physicalism, your brain is creating your consciousness,
3075540	3078540	this drug is affecting your brain, so it's changing your consciousness.
3078540	3080540	But again, it's a rookie mistake.
3080540	3084540	Just because something has so simple in my interface that it looks like a chemical
3084540	3086540	doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness.
3086540	3089540	It just means that I'm getting very, very little insight from my interface
3089540	3091540	into the consciousness that I'm interacting with.
3091540	3095540	So I'm always dealing with behind the screen of my interface,
3095540	3097540	and I'm always dealing with consciousness,
3097540	3100540	just like in Grand Theft Auto.
3100540	3103540	Behind the screen, I'm dealing first with a supercomputer,
3103540	3106540	but then with all the other people around the world that have their headsets
3106540	3108540	and body suits on, I'm affecting them.
3108540	3111540	I'm talking with them through that interface.
3111540	3116540	And so there's no surprise that the interface is giving me no insight
3116540	3119540	into the consciousness that I'm interacting with,
3119540	3130540	but what is the glory of science is it has the tools to tell us a headset is just a headset.
3130540	3132540	And that's what the math is telling us.
3132540	3136540	When they say space-time is doomed, basically physics has learned
3136540	3138540	the headset is just a headset.
3138540	3140540	And we're starting to look outside the headset.
3140540	3145540	Now, Nima and these other physicists, I am not saying that they
3145540	3148540	in any way endorse my idea that consciousness is fundamental.
3148540	3151540	So I would bet that they don't.
3151540	3154540	I would think that they are just saying,
3154540	3156540	look, we're finding these structures beyond space-time.
3156540	3158540	I don't know what they're about yet,
3158540	3161540	but we're just let's stick with the math, let's find these structures
3161540	3164540	and show how space-time arises and hats off to that.
3164540	3165540	That's, I think, brilliant.
3165540	3172540	Yeah, but at least they agree with you on the point that what we're in is not fundamental.
3172540	3177540	So if you call it a headset or not, but space-time cannot be it.
3177540	3179540	And there you agree.
3179540	3181540	Absolutely.
3181540	3183540	When they say space-time is doomed.
3183540	3187540	I've heard you explain this a lot of times, but I'd like to hear it now from you again,
3187540	3192540	maybe in different words today, but what makes you take the leap then to say
3192540	3198540	if space-time is not fundamental, consciousness must be.
3198540	3200540	There's a couple reasons.
3200540	3204540	Maybe the biggest one is the poverty of my imagination.
3204540	3205540	What else would I do?
3205540	3211540	It's sort of like what if I'm interested in consciousness.
3211540	3221540	I'm interested in my emotions, my sensory experiences, the sense that I have of being,
3221540	3224540	even when I'm not really perceiving or thinking.
3224540	3231540	I'm still, you know, when you're at night with your eyes closed and not seeing anything
3231540	3238540	or perceiving anything, you're still, there's this sense of I am, the sense of being there.
3238540	3245540	And it's perfectly plausible if space-time is fundamental and physicalism is true
3245540	3251540	and reductionism is true to take all of that stuff that I just said, my conscious experience and so forth,
3251540	3254540	as, well, that's not real.
3254540	3255540	I'm just a brain.
3255540	3256540	I'm just a body.
3256540	3264540	And this is perhaps, you know, some weird, effective matter when it gets complicated enough.
3264540	3269540	But when space-time isn't fundamental and I realize that particles are not fundamental
3269540	3274540	and reductionism, as Nima Arkani-Hamedis said, reductionism is dead.
3274540	3277540	Reductionism is completely dead.
3277540	3279540	It doesn't work.
3279540	3287540	So many physicalists, many of my colleagues in cognitive neuroscientists who are,
3287540	3293540	and some of them will be here at this workshop, so they're cognitive neuroscientists,
3293540	3297540	I would say almost to a person, every one of them is a physicalist.
3297540	3304540	And so they're looking to see how consciousness emerges from complex neuroactivity or whatever,
3304540	3310540	integrated information or global workspaces or neuromocular tubular collapses.
3310540	3318540	So they're not going to think of consciousness as being fundamental.
3318540	3321540	They're going to think of it as somehow emerging.
3321540	3325540	But they take consciousness seriously.
3325540	3330540	So most of my physicalist colleagues, not all, but most take consciousness seriously.
3330540	3332540	They say it's not something to just be dismissed.
3332540	3333540	It's not an illusion.
3333540	3337540	Dan Dennett and Keith Frankish will say it's an illusion.
3337540	3339540	It's just flat-out an illusion.
3339540	3341540	We've been misled.
3341540	3343540	But most will not.
3343540	3348540	But they have not been able, with their own theories, and this did affect me,
3348540	3354540	when I looked at their theories, I realized there's no beef here in the following sense.
3354540	3359540	Specifically, there's no specific conscious experience that anybody's ever explained.
3359540	3361540	Integrated information theory.
3361540	3366540	I asked Julie Tononi about this back in the late 1990s.
3366540	3371540	He came to talk early on in his career at the University of California, Irvine,
3371540	3373540	at the Helmholtz Club, and we had him there.
3373540	3376540	So I asked him at the Helmholtz Club to give me a particular example.
3376540	3377540	He couldn't do it.
3377540	3384540	One specific, the taste of chocolate, or the filling of a headache, or the smell of garlic, or whatever.
3384540	3388540	What is the specific conscious experience that your theory can say?
3388540	3391540	This is the integrated information that must be that conscious experience.
3391540	3393540	It must be the taste of chocolate.
3393540	3394540	It couldn't be the...
3394540	3396540	Yeah, and we're talking here about the code.
3396540	3398540	Let's call it the algorithm.
3398540	3403540	Show me the exact code that must be the taste of chocolate or garlic smell.
3403540	3404540	Exactly right.
3405540	3409540	Because in some sense, you can think about what they're doing is proposing these circuits.
3409540	3412540	The circuits have certain kind of integrated information.
3412540	3413540	Okay, great.
3413540	3415540	Sounds very, very rigorous.
3415540	3417540	Give me the circuit for one conscious...
3417540	3418540	Just one.
3418540	3424540	I just want a circuit that you say must be one specific conscious experience.
3424540	3427540	It must be the taste of vanilla.
3427540	3429540	And it could not be the smell of garlic.
3429540	3430540	Just give me one.
3430540	3431540	We're trying to do science here.
3431540	3435540	We need some predictions of specific...
3435540	3440540	The predictions they're making is, am I conscious at all or not?
3440540	3443540	And that is an artifact.
3443540	3445540	What they're getting is an artifact of our interface.
3445540	3449540	When I get certain kind of complexity now in my interface, I can start to see the consciousness.
3449540	3453540	That doesn't mean that there's no consciousness otherwise.
3453540	3456540	It just means that that's when my interface lets me see the consciousness.
3456540	3461540	So it's no surprise that you can get these complexity measures in the variables of your interface
3461540	3464540	about when you can detect consciousness or not.
3464540	3465540	That's no surprise.
3465540	3469540	That follows from my theory, that my approach in which consciousness is fundamental.
3469540	3470540	So that's no surprise.
3470540	3475540	What would be a surprise, from my point of view, is that they could explain any specific conscious experience.
3475540	3477540	So every...
3477540	3485540	I'll say this, there is no physicalist theory that has at any time proposed a specific conscious experience
3485540	3487540	that they can explain.
3487540	3489540	There's not one on the table.
3489540	3491540	And again, nothing personal here.
3491540	3493540	I'm friends with a lot of these people.
3493540	3495540	I'm friends with Stuart Hameroff.
3495540	3498540	And last time I was on stage with him, I pressed him.
3498540	3499540	Give me one.
3499540	3506540	Stuart, what is the orchestrated collapse of quantum states in neuronal microtubules
3506540	3508540	that must be whatever you want?
3508540	3511540	The smell of barbecue, whatever you want.
3511540	3515540	You think he's still like Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose are physicalists in that sense?
3515540	3521540	They are like the objective collapse kind of school, right?
3521540	3526540	Which states that there must be an external real world out there.
3526540	3532540	Well, either that or dualist, but probably mostly physicalist.
3532540	3540540	I would say that somehow this non-computational aspect of physics,
3540540	3547540	they think may be somehow where consciousness somehow emerges.
3547540	3554540	But what I want when I talk with Stuart is, okay, great.
3554540	3555540	Give me one.
3555540	3561540	What is the specific orchestrated collapse of neuronal microtubule states that must be whatever you want?
3561540	3562540	Can you give me one?
3562540	3565540	And so I had to really press him on the stage.
3565540	3569540	It took me several presses to really get him to say, I don't have one.
3569540	3571540	And he knows the next time we're friends.
3571540	3573540	I'd love to have a beer with him and so forth.
3573540	3574540	He's a great guy.
3574540	3576540	Next time I'm on stage with him, I'm going to ask the same question.
3576540	3577540	And I'm sure he knows it.
3577540	3579540	I'll ask the same question.
3579540	3585540	And the point is, and again, this is nothing personal.
3585540	3586540	These are good friends.
3586540	3588540	And what I'm hoping is, I mean, they're so smart,
3588540	3594540	if I can get them off of this physicalist thing where they're doomed to fail, right?
3594540	3595540	Space-time is doomed.
3595540	3599540	There's no way that you can boot up a theory of consciousness
3599540	3603540	if you start with particles or any structures inside space-time.
3603540	3604540	You cannot do it.
3604540	3608540	So I see all of my friends and colleagues in this field.
3608540	3611540	Many of them just IQ's out the wazoo.
3611540	3618540	But when you have, I mean, if I'm trying to set up, for example, a theory of space travel,
3618540	3620540	and I believe in flat earth, good luck.
3620540	3624540	I mean, you just have sort of the wrong framework to think about space travel.
3624540	3628540	Yeah, I think for people, it's just very nice to bring it back to that,
3628540	3632540	because people know the matrix, they know sort of VR, metaphors,
3632540	3636540	to sum up everything we've discussed so far.
3636540	3641540	So when we entered this game or this simulation or this matrix,
3641540	3650540	object permanence sort of psychologically made us forget that we put on a headset in the first place.
3650540	3658540	And now we are sitting here as two adults and it's your life's work to sort of get to the point
3658540	3663540	that you know we have a headset on and to describe that headset.
3663540	3668540	And then, of course, to think about how we can put it off again, right?
3668540	3670540	That's right.
3670540	3674540	And once we realize that space and time were not fundamental,
3674540	3678540	space time is doomed and reductionism is dead,
3678540	3683540	then we're free to begin to think about what's beyond space time.
3683540	3687540	And my hypothesis is that it's a network of conscious agents.
3687540	3692540	And I have a, you know, with my colleagues Cheyton Prakash and Manish Singh and Chris Fields
3692540	3697540	and Robert Prentner and others, we're all developing this mathematical model.
3697540	3701540	Not that I believe that we're right, I don't.
3701540	3707540	I believe girdle that any mathematical model that we come up with will only be scratching the surface,
3707540	3710540	but I don't think that we're wasting our time.
3710540	3713540	We, in some sense, make some progress.
3713540	3719540	We do at least counter our own dogmatism and we look beyond.
3719540	3724540	And somehow when we get new deeper theories, we also get new deeper technologies
3724540	3730540	that are telling us somehow that we're getting some kind of insights
3730540	3734540	that are tapping into something that we couldn't tap into before.
3734540	3741540	So I'm working with my colleagues, collaborators on this mathematical theory of conscious agents,
3741540	3749540	and then what we have to do is show how space time emerges specifically with mathematical precision.
3749540	3753540	We have to show exactly how space time emerges as a headset.
3753540	3763540	So what is it about the dynamics of conscious agents that is being captured by the space time headset that we use?
3763540	3767540	Can you prove that? It's my lack of understanding of mathematics,
3767540	3772540	but can you prove something like that mathematically?
3772540	3779540	Well, I wouldn't use the word prove, but what you can do is you can write down a mathematical projection.
3779540	3783540	So you can say, here is this mathematical model of conscious agents.
3783540	3786540	It's like the Twitterverse, right? So it's a big social network.
3786540	3788540	And you can say, here's how Twitter works.
3788540	3791540	You know, this guy tweets and he follows and he retweets.
3791540	3794540	So you can sort of write down the laws of how tweeting works.
3794540	3797540	So it's like that. So I've got this social network of conscious agents.
3797540	3799540	They have their own laws about how they work.
3799540	3803540	And then you can look at the patterns that evolve in that, right?
3803540	3806540	So like with the Twitterverse, it's like what is trending and why and so forth.
3806540	3811540	How do you get these little in groups where you have echo chambers and so forth?
3811540	3814540	So you can look at all the things that happen.
3814540	3823540	Then you can say, okay, let's ask what about what aspects of this complicated dynamics of conscious agents
3823540	3826540	gets mapped into what we call space and time?
3826540	3833540	How precisely, with mathematical precision, like what are the trends in the behaviors of conscious agents?
3833540	3835540	And really that's the way we think about it.
3835540	3838540	Technically we call it the asymptotic or long-term behavior,
3838540	3842540	but it's really like trends in social media.
3842540	3847540	How shall we capture those long-term behaviors, those trends,
3847540	3851540	in the format of space and time and what we call physical objects?
3851540	3852540	How do we do that?
3852540	3860540	So we've actually, at this workshop, I'm going to be proposing a mathematically precise path.
3860540	3865540	I won't say the path now because it's just a bunch of mathematics that wouldn't make any sense,
3865540	3873540	but there are like five or six steps, precise mathematical steps from the dynamics of conscious agents
3873540	3878540	all through permutations, through these polytopes, through the amplitude,
3878540	3880540	and then into space-time.
3880540	3886540	So there's this mapping that, and so the idea then is I've got this high-level picture with my team,
3886540	3892540	and now we have to work out, it's going to take years to work out all the details of each step in this,
3892540	3896540	but we see the path from the dynamics of conscious agents through permutations
3896540	3902540	and Birkhoff polytopes, to grass monions, to the amplitude, into space-time.
3902540	3906540	So there's a lot of work to be done, but once we do that,
3906540	3911540	once we have enough progress on that, then we can get to the other thing you're talking about,
3911540	3915540	which is it'll give us new technologies, essentially.
3915540	3920540	Once we know what's beyond, well, I won't say once we know what's beyond space-time.
3920540	3927540	Once we have our first baby step theory, the first baby step beyond space-time that's really solid,
3927540	3935540	it'll be conscious agents 1.0, then maybe in five years it'll be conscious agents 10.0 or something like that.
3935540	3938540	So it'll move quickly and throw away the...
3938540	3942540	This is like fundamental stuff, right? This is the real cool stuff.
3942540	3947540	We're still thinking of traveling in space-time, and we have all these space-time fantasies, right?
3947540	3953540	So also science fiction, don't you think that when you look at what Christopher Nolan does in his movies,
3953540	3959540	that's really great. I admire it as a filmmaker. I think it's absolutely fantastic, and it's very close to science.
3959540	3967540	To me, the really fascinating stuff also for art is to fantasize about what we could do, right?
3967540	3975540	Because when we go outside of space-time, we do not have a clue what we're waiting for, right?
3975540	3987540	That's right. So one of the things that occurs to me, most of the galaxies that we can see, we could never go to.
3987540	3993540	Space is expanding so quickly that we could never get to them through space, moving at the speed of light.
3993540	3997540	So there's all this real estate out there that we can see that's waving at us and saying,
3997540	4002540	nanny, nanny, you can never get here. Well, that's if you go through space-time.
4002540	4008540	But if space-time is just a headset, think about the options that come in.
4008540	4011540	You don't have to go through space-time. You could go around space-time.
4011540	4017540	Think about Grand Theft Auto. Everybody that's got the headset on is playing Grand Theft Auto.
4017540	4025540	They're stuck within the game. But if you're a software engineer who knows about the computer and the software,
4025540	4030540	you could take the guy who's driving the fastest car and winning the game.
4030540	4034540	You could give him flat tires out of nowhere. You could take the gas out of his tank.
4034540	4037540	You could turn his car upside down and put it somewhere else anytime you want to.
4037540	4042540	But you're not stuck in space and time. The whole notion of causality.
4042540	4046540	Nothing can go faster than a certain speed inside Grand Theft Auto.
4046540	4049540	And in space-time, nothing can go faster than the speed of light.
4049540	4055540	Well, that's all just part of the headset. Once you go outside this headset, you can tinker with it.
4055540	4061540	But then you're also sort of, then we also can take the matrix metaphor again, right?
4061540	4065540	Neoprogramming itself like new skills out of nowhere.
4065540	4070540	It potentially could be possible, you're saying.
4073540	4080540	It certainly does seem to be quite possible that we could be interacting with other conscious agents
4080540	4084540	in a way that we can't even conceive right now.
4084540	4091540	And tapping into an intelligence that is inconceivable,
4091540	4095540	literally inconceivable because it transcends any conceptual system.
4095540	4104540	And if this idea that we are consciousness is correct
4104540	4108540	and that that's what is the fundamental reality,
4108540	4115540	then the girdle's incompleteness theorem tells us that, in fact, you and I already are that infinite intelligence.
4115540	4123540	We're projected into a particular headset and waking up to that fact.
4123540	4133540	And that then raises an interesting question, which is what is consciousness doing and why?
4133540	4140540	And what girdle seems to be saying to us is that there is an infinite, unbounded,
4140540	4145540	unstoppable realm of exploration that consciousness needs to do.
4145540	4150540	And so what consciousness is doing is exploring all of its possibilities,
4150540	4152540	maybe to understand itself.
4152540	4161540	So it's the old oracle of Delphi, know-thyself.
4162540	4170540	But do you think, a lot of questions here, when I'd like the ontology of conscious agents,
4170540	4171540	what are your thoughts here?
4171540	4175540	I mean, what are we talking about those conscious agents outside of space-time?
4175540	4183540	I mean, people would say we think spirits or gods, but any thoughts?
4183540	4184540	Right.
4185540	4193540	The theory that we have picks just two aspects of consciousness,
4193540	4198540	because when you're trying to do a scientific theory, what you're trying to do is say,
4198540	4205540	what are the minimal ingredients that I need to boot up a completely general theory?
4205540	4210540	And if you ask yourself the question, so if I'm thinking about consciousness being fundamental,
4210540	4212540	well, what kinds of things do I want to really understand?
4212540	4214540	I need to understand experiences.
4214540	4216540	I need to understand free will or action.
4216540	4226540	I need to understand learning, memory, problem-solving, intelligence, the notion of a self, emotions.
4226540	4231540	So now if I just assume all that stuff, I'm not making a scientific theory.
4231540	4234540	I'm just saying, well, that's what, I'm just sort of sitting back with a beer and saying,
4234540	4236540	well, that's what exists.
4236540	4240540	But if I'm trying to do a scientific theory, what I have to do is to play that game,
4240540	4246540	is I have to say, okay, out of all that stuff I was talking about and more that consciousness has to be dealing with,
4246540	4253540	what are the two things or the one thing that I need to really turn into mathematics
4253540	4257540	and say this is the foundation and then boot up everything else?
4257540	4259540	That's what science is about.
4259540	4266540	So what we've picked is there are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate.
4266540	4274540	And those conscious experiences can influence other conscious experiences.
4274540	4276540	Those are the assumptions.
4276540	4277540	That's it.
4277540	4282540	There are experiences and experiences, probabilistically influence other experiences.
4282540	4284540	That's the minimal.
4284540	4291540	So notice there's no notion of memory, problem-solving, self, none of that stuff is there.
4291540	4299540	So we have to build all that stuff from the raw materials of just conscious experiences affecting other conscious experiences.
4299540	4303540	So that's what we're really up to is a mathematical model of that.
4303540	4306540	Now you could say, look, you picked the wrong starting point.
4306540	4307540	That's fine.
4307540	4310540	That's the kind of critique that I would welcome.
4310540	4315540	I'd say, okay, pick some other starting point, make your own networks of whatever you want to call them,
4315540	4318540	but then you'll be having to explain other things.
4318540	4319540	And that's perfectly fine.
4319540	4324540	So I picked what I thought I couldn't get away with.
4324540	4334540	And one reason why you want as few things as possible that you're assuming it to begin with is because the things you assume are your miracles.
4334540	4338540	The scientific theory has its assumptions.
4338540	4339540	Every theory has an assumption.
4339540	4341540	Those assumptions are the things you're saying.
4341540	4345540	If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain all this other good stuff.
4345540	4347540	But I'm not explaining these assumptions.
4347540	4350540	And that's what I mean when I say they're miracles for that theory.
4350540	4354540	They're the things that you just say, please let me have this.
4354540	4356540	And then I'll explain all this other stuff.
4356540	4359540	So you want to have your miracles as few as possible.
4359540	4363540	Now, of course, I've helped myself to a big miracle, conscious experiences.
4363540	4372540	Which is, I think, it's very natural to say it's only the last couple of hundred years that we find that a weird assumption to make.
4372540	4375540	But actually, it's the only thing we have, right?
4375540	4377540	This is Descartes.
4377540	4379540	But then we forgot about that.
4379540	4388540	And we got so immersed in what we assumed to be the real world that we forgot about that primacy of consciousness.
4388540	4389540	That's what dawned to me.
4389540	4391540	I mean, we were looking inside conscious.
4391540	4393540	We're doing the Large Hadron Collider.
4393540	4395540	We do that in consciousness.
4395540	4401540	We let these particles accelerate and burst into each other.
4401540	4404540	It's within consciousness, everything, right?
4404540	4406540	That's exactly right.
4406540	4412540	So when you start to look at it, you realize, well, no, this has just been a headset all along.
4412540	4414540	Space and time has just been a headset all along.
4414540	4419540	It's really consciousness looking at other consciousnesses through this filter.
4419540	4422540	And so, yeah, the experiences are fundamental.
4422540	4425540	My experience of space and time is just my experience.
4425540	4430540	And as soon as I close my eyes, the moon literally disappears.
4430540	4434540	It's gone.
4434540	4436540	Now, there's something out there.
4436540	4442540	Not out there in the sense of out there in space, but there's something out beyond my experiences.
4442540	4444540	And it's, by hypothesis, other conscious agents.
4444540	4446540	So I'm interacting with other conscious agents.
4446540	4452540	And what I see are things like the moon or an amoeba or a rock.
4452540	4454540	It's not that the rock is conscious.
4454540	4465540	It's just like, again, like the pixels in my Grand Theft Auto headset that I see as a Porsche.
4465540	4467540	Those pixels are not a Porsche.
4467540	4469540	Those are just pixels.
4469540	4473540	I'm making the Porsche in my consciousness, right?
4473540	4474540	And that's the same thing.
4474540	4476540	So I'm not saying that the rock is conscious.
4476540	4482540	The rock is my pixelated headset.
4482540	4487540	When I look at Hans, I see a face, skin, hair, and eyes.
4487540	4489540	What I'm seeing is not your consciousness.
4489540	4491540	I'm seeing something that I created.
4491540	4493540	In fact, that hands is now gone.
4493540	4495540	And now it's there.
4495540	4498540	But your consciousness presumably stayed there even when I wasn't paying attention to it.
4498540	4501540	Yeah, it's an icon that refers to something else.
4501540	4515540	And what I'm wondering is also a question I had is, could it be that those conscious agents in creating space time as a headset built in certain hacks, so to speak?
4515540	4518540	We know, for instance, death is one.
4518540	4524540	I mean, if I jump in front of a train, I'll die and I'll somehow, right?
4524540	4527540	We know that the headset's off then, right?
4527540	4528540	I suppose that.
4528540	4530540	And what are other ones?
4530540	4532540	I mean, is meditation one?
4532540	4533540	Are psychedelics one?
4533540	4535540	What are your thoughts there?
4535540	4538540	I think that there's an infinite variety.
4538540	4545540	That the headset that we have right now is just one of it, literally an infinite variety.
4545540	4551540	And so this might sound similar to an idea that a physicist named Max Tegmark has put out.
4551540	4554540	So Max Tegmark has the idea of these multiverses.
4554540	4562540	But he thinks that mathematics is fundamental, that it is the fundamental reality, not consciousness, mathematics.
4562540	4565540	And not space time, at least not our space time.
4565540	4573540	And also, I think, building on Gertl's incompleteness theorem, he points out that there's an infinite variety of mathematics out there.
4573540	4577540	And so that's his level, what he calls level four multiverse.
4577540	4582540	Every kind of mathematics that is possible is actual, and it's all out there.
4582540	4584540	So it really exists.
4584540	4591540	And my guess is, in a similar spirit, I don't take mathematics as fundamental.
4591540	4593540	I take consciousness as fundamental.
4593540	4597540	And mathematics is like the bones of the living organism of consciousness.
4597540	4600540	So it's different from Max Tegmark's view.
4600540	4608540	But where it's similar is, where as Max says, everything that's mathematically possible is mathematically real, and that's my multiverse.
4608540	4616540	I'm saying every structure of consciousness that's mathematically possible is consciously real.
4616540	4623540	And that's my consciousness multiverse with all the possible headsets that it could have.
4623540	4633540	And so our little space time one is presumably one of just many that are concretely right now inconceivable to us.
4633540	4641540	But what's interesting to me about consciousness is, in this framework, why is it doing this?
4641540	4654540	Why should consciousness go to all the effort of, like, this is a pretty amazing space time universe.
4654540	4656540	Billions of light years across.
4656540	4662540	It's got trillions of stars and hundreds of billions of galaxies.
4662540	4672540	And in this framework in which consciousness is fundamental, what's happened to consciousness put on this headset
4672540	4680540	programmed itself to get lost in it, to think of itself as a tiny little object in this vast universe,
4680540	4688540	to slowly wake up and to recognize as vast and as amazing as this whole thing is, I transcend it.
4688540	4690540	Is that what consciousness is about?
4690540	4696540	It's knowing what it is by knowing what it's not.
4696540	4706540	So it really immerses itself into a headset like space and time and gets lost in it and flounders in it
4706540	4709540	and really it has to learn how to play it.
4709540	4711540	Don't touch the fire, you'll burn it.
4711540	4713540	Don't step in front of the car.
4713540	4722540	It's painful and so you're learning all how this headset works and then you're learning about how fantastic it is
4722540	4727540	and then you wake up and realize, I'm not a little thing inside that headset.
4727540	4730540	That headset is a tiny little thing inside of me.
4730540	4732540	I am not that.
4732540	4735540	And that's how consciousness is knowing itself.
4735540	4743540	And maybe if one way of interpreting girdle is that that process is never ending, there may be a deeper wing
4743540	4748540	which you can just view it as a vast incredible intelligence that just knows that,
4748540	4754540	but every perspective on that gives you this temporal feeling of coming and waking up to it.
4754540	4761540	So there may be an even deeper perspective in which you could look at the whole thing as just a vast intelligence
4761540	4769540	that already knows it all, but any projection of that, you're seeing it as a process of coming to know itself.
4769540	4779540	So what's interesting is if this is anywhere close to right, then you and I, anybody that, any person,
4779540	4783540	is really part of that infinite intelligence, but wearing a headset.
4783540	4791540	But we're wearing a headset that has really strict limits on it.
4791540	4796540	If I ask you, please imagine a color that you've never seen before.
4796540	4799540	Just one specific color that you've never seen before.
4799540	4801540	Well, does anything happen?
4801540	4804540	Nothing, I mean, nothing happens.
4804540	4812540	But there, you know, it turns out that there are women called tetrafemes who have four color receptors.
4812540	4819540	Most guys have three, 93% of men have three color receptors, 7% of men have only two.
4819540	4830540	These women have four color receptors, and experiments strongly suggest that they have a new dimension of color experience
4830540	4837540	that no man could ever imagine, and most women can't imagine either.
4837540	4843540	And so they're having concrete experiences that you and I can't even, we can't even imagine.
4843540	4850540	And so what's stunning to me is that consciousness, if we, if you and I really are not separate,
4850540	4857540	we're just different headsets on the one big consciousness, the one infinitely intelligent consciousness.
4857540	4858540	So we're not separate from that.
4858540	4865540	We really, I mean, it would be pretty stunning that we are actually not just connected with,
4865540	4868540	we are projections of that infinite intelligence.
4868540	4875540	But projections that, we've taken the projections so seriously that we can't even imagine a new color.
4875540	4882540	We've really restricted our imagination, even though within consciousness at a deeper level, all things are possible.
4882540	4884540	All possible experiences are there.
4884540	4893540	Yeah, we truly sort of somehow forgot who we are and the function being to expand this whole thing, right?
4893540	4895540	It was needed somehow too.
4895540	4907540	But what I'm wondering here, I heard you say you're reading or maybe even reevaluating religious literature.
4907540	4920540	And because this is so similar, of course, to Eastern philosophy and traditions of meditation that tend to bring you back to sort of this primordial awareness that you're a part of
4920540	4926540	and make you see that all else is created from that awareness.
4926540	4928540	So I'm just wondering here what your thoughts are.
4928540	4935540	Is science and these traditions of introspection mostly already coming together?
4935540	4941540	Are we going to see a science that sort of includes introspection maybe even?
4941540	4945540	I think that we'll need to go there.
4945540	4949540	I think that we'll need scientists.
4949540	4961540	If this idea is anywhere near right and we really are the infinite consciousness in a space-time headset,
4961540	4969540	the best way to do our scientific research is, of course, to use our mathematics and to do all the stuff that we're doing right now, the study and so forth,
4969540	4979540	but then also to step back, to literally let go of thought completely and just dive back into that non-conceptual, infinite intelligence.
4979540	4981540	You're doing that, right?
4981540	4988540	I do. I spend a couple hours a day, even more, two or three hours a day meditating.
4988540	4994540	Are you then breaking outside the headset?
4994540	4998540	I'm making a tiny crack into the headset.
4998540	5000540	I would say a tiny crack.
5000540	5005540	When I read the experiences of others, I would say that there are many far more advanced than me,
5005540	5011540	but I do go into periods of complete inner silence,
5011540	5019540	and I think in those periods, whatever ideas I have that might be of any interest come from that.
5019540	5030540	I think that if we really cultivate that as scientists and as artists and writers and so forth, whatever endeavor we might be involved in,
5030540	5043540	going into ultimate complete silence, letting go of the restrictions of our conceptual system really puts us in touch with this infinite intelligence
5043540	5053540	from which we can then take back insights that we can try to then reconceptualize and make useful in this headset.
5053540	5063540	Many of the great scientists seem to talk in ways that suggest that Einstein would say that he wasn't really getting ideas from just the equations.
5063540	5069540	He would go and have these vague feelings and ideas and pictures or something like that,
5069540	5074540	and it would take him a long time to turn the stuff into language and mathematics.
5075540	5082540	So he would suggest that he was going, and I think many of the great physicists and scientists more generally,
5082540	5086540	and then of course people in the arts and humanities who are doing wonderful work,
5086540	5093540	they're getting their inspiration probably even with just brief periods of silence,
5093540	5103540	maybe that they don't even know that when they go into that inner silence that we let go of the headset temporarily and tap into this deeper intelligence.
5104540	5111540	If this is right, I would suggest that in the future we would train our scientists with all of the standard tools,
5111540	5118540	but also teach them to tap into this infinite intelligence as well, spend time on a regular basis,
5118540	5127540	letting go of all of your theories and recognizing that hey, in some sense, every theory we come up with here is child's play.
5127540	5129540	All of it is child's play.
5130540	5134540	Gertl tells us everything that you come up with is child's play.
5134540	5142540	There's a quote from Newton that I'll put up at the end of my talk at the workshop where he basically says,
5142540	5148540	I don't know what other people think of me, but I think of myself as a little boy that spent my life on the seashore
5148540	5158540	picking up a pretty pebble or a shell while the whole ocean of unexplored is beyond me.
5158540	5163540	It's just sitting there and I think that's the right attitude.
5163540	5165540	I don't have a theory of everything.
5165540	5168540	In science, we'll never get a theory of everything.
5168540	5169540	We can't.
5169540	5171540	We'll get a theory of everything except our assumptions.
5171540	5174540	Those assumptions keep going down and down and down forever, Gertl tells us.
5174540	5180540	Your theory of everything except your assumptions is basically a theory that barely scratches the surface.
5181540	5189540	In that sense, it changes the whole dynamic.
5189540	5199540	Right now, a lot of the dynamic is I'm this little tiny thing in this vast space and time and I don't feel very significant.
5199540	5203540	The only way to get significance is to make my mark, to make a new scientific theory,
5203540	5206540	a new piece of art or that piece of literature, the great American novel.
5206540	5209540	Finally, the great American, whatever it might be.
5209540	5216540	I'm trying to make myself significant or have some lasting value by something I do.
5216540	5218540	That puts a lot of pressure on you.
5218540	5227540	You've only got 60, 70, 80, maybe 90 years to do it and then will they really look at your painting 200 years from now?
5227540	5228540	Who knows?
5228540	5235540	You're really grasping at stuff to get significance for yourself and it's sort of a struggle.
5236540	5240540	Or I can just say, screw it, I'm going to drink and have a good time.
5240540	5242540	I'm not significant.
5242540	5245540	I just acknowledge that I'm here to have a good time.
5245540	5253540	But when we let go of the physicalist framework and we say, I am consciousness, I transcend this.
5253540	5256540	Death is just stepping out of this headset.
5256540	5261540	So that puts all that I'm doing in a very different framework.
5262540	5269540	So I feel the innate drive to try to be significant and to be better than the other.
5269540	5273540	That's sort of wired into us just like object permanence is wired into.
5273540	5277540	So I see that's all, in other words, we're wired up to take the headset seriously.
5277540	5281540	And then so consciousness sort of wired itself up to take the headset seriously.
5281540	5285540	But part of the waking up process is to step back and go, oh wow, okay.
5285540	5288540	Oh no, no, no, I'm not a little thing inside the headset.
5288540	5290540	The headset is inside of me.
5290540	5293540	I'm eventually going to take the headset off.
5293540	5296540	So I can have a looser relationship with all this stuff.
5296540	5299540	I don't need to get that big house to be something.
5299540	5302540	I don't need to have that big scientific paper.
5302540	5304540	I don't need to be acknowledged.
5304540	5306540	This is just all.
5306540	5308540	Has it done this for you, Donald?
5308540	5310540	Has it done this for you, what you're now saying?
5310540	5313540	Sort of this realization in your personal life?
5313540	5316540	It's interesting.
5316540	5321540	It does it for me when I am conscious.
5321540	5330540	When I let go of thought and sit there in consciousness without thought, yes.
5330540	5335540	But as soon as I get back into thought, then I'm back into the old self that says,
5335540	5339540	oh, it's just, and by the way, it's automatic.
5339540	5341540	It's just like, yeah, the moon is there.
5341540	5347540	Yeah, I need for my own significance to solve this problem or publish this paper.
5347540	5351540	So I always have to step back and look at that and go, OK, there it is.
5351540	5355540	So part of it, see, that may be part of the whole waking up process
5355540	5359540	because when I step back and I go, OK, look, there it is.
5359540	5361540	It feels bad.
5361540	5362540	I feel like I'm under pressure.
5362540	5363540	Why am I under pressure?
5363540	5364540	This is a game.
5364540	5365540	Oh, I'm taking the game.
5365540	5367540	So I got lost in the game again.
5367540	5370540	OK, so here I am lost in the game.
5370540	5376540	So the periods of consciousness where you go, oh, look at that.
5376540	5378540	I'm competing with so-and-so.
5378540	5380540	I feel mad at so-and-so.
5380540	5384540	Wait a minute.
5384540	5387540	Because Joe just stole my Ferrari and Grand Theft Auto.
5387540	5388540	It's just a game.
5388540	5391540	Who cares if Joe stole my Ferrari and Grand Theft Auto?
5391540	5393540	Yeah, I absolutely love it.
5394540	5400540	But it's so beautiful because this brings me back to discussions I have
5400540	5405540	with Pornardo and Essentia, of course, is that we want to communicate pure science, right?
5405540	5411540	You don't want people to shift or accept an idealist worldview
5411540	5413540	because they want meaning in their life, right?
5413540	5416540	Like you would pick a religion because you want meaning.
5416540	5421540	No, you want it because it's true, because it's more truthful than physicalism.
5421540	5425540	But you do get, as a sort of bonus, a lot of extra meaning, right?
5425540	5430540	Because do you think culturally and where the world's at right now
5430540	5434540	that this shift towards your view that consciousness is fundamental
5434540	5442540	could also sort of bring us further and sort of make us tackle problems within the game
5442540	5447540	that we are now sort of just talking climate, inequality, everything we see happening right now?
5447540	5449540	What are your thoughts there?
5449540	5456540	Yes, I think that this does lead to a perspective on social interactions
5456540	5458540	and climate change and things like that.
5458540	5464540	So communism, in principle, sounds like a great idea.
5464540	5468540	No ownership, everybody works and shares.
5468540	5474540	And if we were all wonderful consciousnesses and that's it, that would be fine.
5474540	5479540	But when we're plunged into this headset, it's competition.
5479540	5482540	It's nature, red, and truth, and claw.
5482540	5491540	And so communism doesn't work because we're all asleep.
5491540	5496540	We all buy the headset.
5496540	5501540	But if we wake each other up, if consciousness,
5501540	5505540	so there are certain spiritual teachers who are doing that,
5505540	5510540	like Eckhart Tolle, for example, and many others who are doing a great job
5510540	5514540	of sort of helping to wake people up and say, you're not a little thing inside space and time.
5514540	5517540	You are the fundamental consciousness.
5517540	5525540	The only way for us to get social institutions that work better is for the people to change.
5526540	5532540	Right now, we need things like democracy and maybe even blockchain
5532540	5534540	because we don't trust each other.
5534540	5537540	So why do we have democracy?
5537540	5543540	Well, if we have a monarch, we know that the monarch, it's luck of the draw.
5543540	5548540	If it's Nero, you're in trouble, if it's Marcus Aurelius, you're great,
5548540	5551540	but that's very unlikely you're going to get Marcus Aurelius.
5551540	5557540	So when we have people that are asleep,
5557540	5560540	that believe that they're little items inside the headset,
5560540	5563540	then we have to have all these rules in place and so forth.
5563540	5572540	But as we wake up, then I think, and maybe that's what consciousness is about in this headset,
5572540	5574540	is humanity waking up.
5575540	5582540	And maybe the science for the last several centuries where it studied space and time
5582540	5589540	and all of a sudden realized space time is doomed and my interpretation realized it's a headset.
5589540	5593540	That was a huge part of this consciousness waking up.
5593540	5596540	That space time is doomed as a big one.
5596540	5602540	Now realize it's a headset, realize, oh, we're the consciousness beyond the headset.
5602540	5609540	And then as we wake up, maybe we can have a different kind of interaction with each other inside the headset.
5609540	5617540	And so until there's a waking up, then we just have to use the standard rules and enforcement
5617540	5625540	and democracy, avoid the monarch and all this stuff because any one person in power makes the whole thing vulnerable.
5625540	5631540	The blockchain takes it to the extreme where you basically, you'd have to have a third of the players
5631540	5636540	that are trying to be negative or take things down for the thing to fall apart.
5636540	5639540	With a monarchy, you just need one player to take it down.
5639540	5644540	But when you have a blockchain, you need like a third of the players to be malicious,
5644540	5648540	what they call Byzantine attacks and so forth.
5648540	5659540	So I think that changing human nature simply by waking us up to what we really are is the way forward for the social things.
5659540	5663540	Otherwise, what we have to do is just make sure that we have the right rules.
5663540	5669540	And you do this and I think that is sort of noble and so important that it's done through mathematics
5669540	5673540	and not sort of because we had spiritual and religious traditions doing this,
5673540	5677540	but we also see them falling back in that headset reality, right?
5677540	5679540	And that's all about power and sort of control.
5679540	5684540	Whereas at the core, some of them or many of them I think point to this,
5684540	5690540	but it feels as if mathematics is maybe the most safe way to do this.
5690540	5694540	You just don't make mistakes in doing so, in waking up.
5694540	5699540	Make sure we really wake up and not sort of fool ourselves.
5699540	5706540	I think so. I think that the mathematics is a gift that it counteracts dogmatism,
5706540	5711540	it counteracts fuzzy thinking, it counteracts being asleep in some sense.
5711540	5716540	It really is a wonderful tool to wake us up.
5716540	5718540	I think there's something really deep there.
5718540	5725540	Mathematics and its relationship to consciousness, I feel like my insight into that is trivial.
5726540	5731540	I just have a deep feeling that my understanding is trivial.
5731540	5735540	But I say that math is the bones of consciousness, I mean that's a metaphor,
5735540	5743540	but I feel like Newton, I'm like a baby boy on the shore and there's something really deep out there.
5743540	5747540	And Donald, did you two close our interview because we started with your upbringing,
5747540	5753540	your dad being the fundamental of minister in a fundamental Protestant church.
5754540	5757540	Is he still alive, your father?
5757540	5759540	He died five years ago.
5759540	5764540	Sorry to hear that, but did you ever discuss your work and theory?
5764540	5771540	Did you have discussions with him about this and what did you think about what you did, your work?
5771540	5778540	I did and I think he had mixed feelings about it.
5778540	5782540	I think that he still thought the earth was 4,000 years old,
5782540	5787540	but I think that he also liked that I was saying that consciousness is fundamental
5787540	5793540	because he thought that that was true.
5793540	5801540	But he had a notion of God that's sort of separate from us in some sense
5801540	5814540	and the notion that I have is more that we are all one with whatever that one consciousness is.
5814540	5819540	And that may be what Christianity really means deep down when it says that we're all children of God,
5819540	5824540	that that might be what that means.
5824540	5830540	So he had I think mixed feelings, he wanted me to pursue this because he liked that it was not physicalist.
5830540	5838540	So he loved the mathematics and the science that was showing that space-time isn't fundamental.
5838540	5845540	And I learned not to argue with him about evolution of a natural selection and the age of the earth
5845540	5850540	because within the interface, when you take on the framework of the interface,
5850540	5852540	it's just wrong to say it's 4,000 years old.
5852540	5853540	It's just wrong.
5853540	5859540	Now if you step outside the interface, then I can say the very notion of time itself is an illusion.
5859540	5863540	It's an artifact of projection into our headset.
5863540	5870540	So there is a deep sense in which it's not 4,000 years old, it's not a billion years old.
5870540	5875540	But within the interface, if you're playing it within the interface, then you need to play fair within the interface.
5875540	5878540	It's not 4,000 years old.
5878540	5884540	It's so funny because it really reminds, it's the sort of discussions I have with my dad.
5884540	5888540	He really likes the fact that all of this is pointing to consciousness being primary,
5888540	5893540	but the moment I start telling that we are all one or part of this one consciousness,
5893540	5898540	I mean, I'm much into Bernardo's thinking here as well, then I'm losing him
5898540	5905540	because he really wants this God-creator, sort of exactly what you're saying outside of creation.
5905540	5907540	Yeah, I agree.
5907540	5912540	Now I'll just say one little thing too about the Eastern traditions that are more mystical,
5912540	5917540	that what this can do is they talk about language as pointers.
5917540	5920540	The word isn't it and so forth.
5920540	5925540	But what science can do is really up our game on pointers.
5925540	5927540	It can really help us.
5927540	5931540	It's nothing to boast about that we've used the same pointers for 3,000 years.
5931540	5935540	I'm using the same pointer that the Dowdy Ching used or something like that.
5935540	5937540	There's nothing to boast about.
5937540	5943540	What we like as a way to get surely if consciousness is infinitely deep,
5943540	5945540	we don't want to be sticking with the same pointers all the time.
5945540	5948540	We need deeper and new pointers.
5948540	5952540	And that's where science and spirituality together, not antagonistically,
5952540	5958540	but the insights of spirituality with the rigor of science together can evolve new pointers
5958540	5964540	that help us to avoid one of the big problems of human nature, which is dogmatism,
5964540	5967540	both among scientists and among spiritual people.
5967540	5972540	Spiritual people can be very, very dogmatic, but I know the truth.
5972540	5977540	It's very, very nice to have the mathematical stuff to actually push you
5977540	5981540	so that we believe dogmatically space-time is fundamental.
5981540	5983540	Our math said, no, no, no.
5983540	5987540	Your best theory of space-time tells you that space-time is not fundamental.
5987540	5989540	That's how we avoid dogmatism.
5989540	5991540	You need to bring math into church.
5991540	5993540	Yes.
5993540	5995540	I will go to those sermons.
5995540	5997540	Those are sermons I will go to.
5997540	6000540	Thank you so much, Donald. You have to leave.
6000540	6002540	This is a great pleasure.
6002540	6004540	Thanks. Good to hear that.
6004540	6006540	And a pleasure as well. Thanks so much.
