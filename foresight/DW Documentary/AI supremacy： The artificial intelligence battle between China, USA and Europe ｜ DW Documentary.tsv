0	9240	After many, many years later, maybe we will look back.
9240	15080	We recognize that, oh, that's the moment when everything changed.
15080	19200	In five years, AI is going to literally be in everything we do.
19200	26400	As humans, we have to, first of all, understand that this is going to happen.
26400	31440	Many technologists try to solve human problems using technology when actually what we need
31440	35200	are human solutions.
35200	38360	The deeper question is, what does it mean to be human?
38360	41920	What are the things I'll still be proud of?
41920	48080	I find this moment extremely profound, because it really forces us as a humanity to think
48080	52760	through exactly what consciousness is, what makes humans human.
52760	56040	There's a whole lot at stake here.
56040	60800	It's careers, unbelievable amounts of money, and who gets to shape the future.
86040	92240	It's already begun.
92240	96320	A global race for supremacy in the age of artificial intelligence.
96320	102000	China, the United States, and the European Union are vying for economic growth, political
102000	104440	influence, and power.
104440	110200	So are the big tech companies, and startups are hot on their heels.
110200	115840	For those who lose, there'll be no second chances.
115840	121120	Jonas Andrewles founded one of the most influential European AI companies.
121120	126680	With his help, the European Union could catch up with the world's AI leaders, become independent
126680	133840	from the US and China, secure a prosperous future.
133840	138560	This is a watershed moment for Europe, the last roll of the dice.
138560	143360	If Europe wants to decide how to use technology in accordance with European values, then it
143360	147880	has to be able to build that technology itself.
147880	153200	Thomas Wolff co-founded Huggingface, a major open source AI platform.
153200	157880	He wants to stop one of the most powerful technologies in human history from ending
157880	160640	up in the hands of a few corporations.
160640	166160	What we need is a multitude of players, not just one that owns AI.
166160	171360	We don't want a future where such a fundamental technology is in the hands of a single company.
171360	175680	There are plenty of films where that's the mark of a dystopia, one company that controls
175680	183680	everything.
183680	186720	Han Chao is a Chinese AI entrepreneur.
186720	193280	He wants his company, Gina AI, to be successful on both the Western and Chinese markets.
193280	198480	So what role do Chinese AI companies play in this global race, and how is the Chinese
198480	202200	Communist Party using them to achieve its political goals?
202200	208200	Chai GPT or GPT-4, it basically serves as a brain, and this brain cannot be made in
208200	209200	the US.
209200	212640	So this is some worry that the Chinese government has.
212640	220320	The culture of each country, how each government runs this country will eventually be reflected
220320	224320	into this brain.
224320	229480	It is absolutely clear that at the highest levels of leadership in the United States
229480	235240	and in China, artificial intelligence is viewed as foundational to the future of economic
235240	239640	and military power.
239640	245840	We've created an economic and financial system that's based on the assumption that everything's
245840	247560	going to keep running smoothly.
247560	250200	We get cheap gas from Russia.
250200	254000	The Americans look after us, so we don't need to spend money on arms.
254000	259280	And as always friendly, we've gotten comfortable, and now we have to break out of that comfort
259280	265160	and say, we can go on the political offensive again, we can compete, we can create competitive
265160	270520	conditions here, we can make sure that the cool companies we have can also grow and play
270520	285480	a role in the global market.
285480	291520	At the end of 2023, German Vice Chancellor Robert Harbeck made significant progress towards
291520	293640	these geopolitical goals.
293640	302200	Aleph Alfa, a German AI company, raised around half a billion euros from investors.
302200	307640	It was one of the largest rounds of European financing for artificial intelligence technology,
307640	312120	and it was a signal that the European Union can produce elite players in the field of
312120	315160	AI.
315160	319400	Aleph Alfa's founder and CEO is Jonas Androulis.
319400	325800	His given priority to investment from German industry, SAP, Bosch and the Schwarz Group,
325800	343440	which owns supermarket retailers Liedl and Kauffland.
343440	345880	I was an amateur radio enthusiast.
345880	349000	I soldered radios together and built my own antennas.
349000	353240	Early on, my father had computers at home, so I was able to start programming and playing
353240	363320	around with them at a very young age.
363320	367320	When we started out, the term generative AI didn't exist.
367320	369360	Hardly anyone had heard of open AI.
369360	370840	We were very technical.
370840	373840	We managed to create category defining innovations.
373840	381720	We were just nerds, researchers.
381720	386560	And there were times when I felt like I wasn't coping with the amount of work and the challenges.
386560	391120	Every night, I could answer emails until I was so tired I fell off the couch.
391120	399080	And there were still things I was neglecting, which I didn't want to neglect.
399080	404960	In spring 2023, the European AI landscape was a lonely place.
404960	410960	With his startup, Alfa, Jonas Androulis had built the only generative AI that could compete
410960	413120	at an international level.
413120	419320	He'd acquired the expertise from his work as a high-ranking AI researcher at Apple.
419320	428000	Suddenly he'd become one of Europe's great hopes in the global AI race.
428000	433120	Right now we simply can't cope with the onslaught of potential customers and partners.
433120	438600	Most of the German stock index companies have been in touch, lots of medium-sized companies.
438600	443720	There are briefings, press engagements, events, an unbelievable amount of stuff.
443720	448600	It's like the Cambrian explosion right now, an incredible amount of new and creative things
448600	449600	are emerging.
449600	456760	We're the only Europeans to be involved on this scale.
456760	458480	It was an exciting development.
458480	463240	We also had things like open AI and maybe ours were even cooler.
463240	467680	What is missing and what I think deserves more attention in the EU is why there are
467680	474440	not more domestic companies that actually grow and scale.
474440	481200	A lot of company leaders, startup innovators end up going to the US and the access to capital
481200	486280	is really one of the main challenges.
486680	494160	If you look at what we did, it's enabling technology.
494160	499640	What I need for that is a carefully selected, effective team of brilliant researchers.
499640	502200	Then I need money.
502200	506040	More money than you normally get as a German startup.
506040	509120	These days we're talking about billions.
509120	514160	And then you need partners to help you, the kind of help that money can't buy.
514160	519040	Open AI doesn't just get 10 billion from Microsoft, it also gets incredible support
519040	525960	in integrating its technology into all Microsoft products and platforms.
525960	531440	At the time, Aleph Alpha had 60 employees at various locations.
531440	536040	Most were at the company's headquarters in Heidelberg in southwest Germany, unlike
536040	542480	Open AI, and Drullus wasn't gearing his AI towards private users, but rather industry
542480	544280	in the public sector.
544280	548320	But they tend to be sluggish and not easy to win over.
548320	551400	That posed a challenge for Jonas Andrullus.
551400	555280	He needed pilot projects to prove his technology works.
555280	559080	You stand here and you're greeted by a virtual person.
559080	560680	Hello, may I help you?
560680	561680	Where do you want to go?
561680	564120	Then I can use the screen.
564120	567120	We have to keep moving in this direction.
567120	568120	That's not good.
568120	569120	That's my job.
569360	572400	I know it is, but we're very happy to still have you.
572400	575400	She'll probably be taking her well-earned retirement soon.
575400	577720	It's become a standard question.
577720	582160	I ask if you'd like to stay on a little longer, because I need you, and because there aren't
582160	585200	enough skilled workers coming in.
585200	587200	It's a big issue.
588800	591800	That's important for us.
592800	594800	Solidarity.
595800	599800	And, of course, the main topic is innovation.
600800	606800	Heidelberg is one of the first municipalities in the world to introduce an AI citizen assistant
606800	610800	using a language model provided by Aleph Alpha.
613800	618800	We have a partner, a customer, with whom we can look at these new technologies.
618800	623800	They also act as a testimonial for us, because anyone can go and try it out.
623800	629800	That's a huge advantage, because a lot of our customers don't want to be named right now.
629800	632800	They don't want people to know exactly what they're doing,
632800	637800	so it's great to have a pilot customer with a bit of vision and courage.
638800	644800	The hope is that in the long term, AI will improve public administration and speed up services.
645800	653800	I just enter a question. Motor vehicle traffic on the B-37, which is a busy road.
653800	657800	Then I get it to search. Of course, that's a very general question.
657800	662800	The question now is what point in time, whether we're talking daily or annually.
662800	666800	Of course, the AI has to work out what the user actually wants.
666800	669800	The B-37 is closed between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.
669800	673800	Now I can ask, how do I apply for child benefit?
675800	679800	That wasn't the right answer. It can't find anything now.
679800	684800	So the error messages that we get back from the public and from tests we do ourselves
684800	690800	get passed on to Aleph Alpha to figure out what needs to change to make the inputs more accurate.
690800	693800	It's always about the accuracy of the input.
696800	700800	The technology is still in the test phase and not yet reliable.
701800	704800	2023 was a delicate time for Aleph Alpha.
704800	708800	Jonas and Droolers needed fresh money from investors.
708800	712800	Meanwhile, Microsoft and OpenAI were gaining more of an advantage.
713800	716800	In fact, a race starts today and we're going to move.
716800	723800	We're going to move fast and for us, every day, we want to bring out new things.
724800	729800	On March 14th, 2023, OpenAI released ChatGPT4,
729800	733800	the most powerful artificial intelligence to date.
733800	737800	At the same time, it greatly reduced costs for users.
737800	742800	For Jonas and Droolers and his team, it was a threat to their business model.
742800	746800	We might have a poem about fly fishing from the perspective of a fish.
747800	752800	And it goes on for hours.
752800	756800	In the depths where shadows weave and play,
756800	759800	in this cool clear waters where I stay,
759800	762800	I am the fish beneath the silver stream,
762800	765800	where life's a dream or so it seems,
765800	767800	a wily being, sleek and sly,
767800	770800	with ancient instincts to live and die.
770800	773800	Yeah, it goes on.
773800	776800	Yeah, they see the ends of my heart.
778800	781800	I went to an apartment with a number of colleagues
781800	785800	and we watched on a big projector screen
785800	787800	the announcement of GPT4.
787800	790800	Someone had a ChatGPT Pro account,
790800	793800	so they could use GPT4 and we could play with it.
793800	800800	And we were, like, very impressed and surprised by how good it was.
800800	804800	It's not upsetting when someone comes out with a great piece of technology
804800	808800	because we're researchers and building technology and that's how it is.
808800	811800	You know, when you're a violinist and you go and you watch
811800	815800	an amazing solo by an incredible violinist,
815800	819800	you don't feel, oh, you know, I'll give up.
819800	821800	You know, it's inspiring.
821800	823800	I was a little stressed out.
823800	827800	I was in the middle of conversations with potential investors, business partners,
827800	830800	and I knew that in every conversation I was going into,
830800	833800	somebody would say, but GPT4.
833800	836800	I would have wanted to build GPT4 myself.
836800	840800	Two years ago, get 200 million,
840800	845800	be the first model at that level of capabilities
845800	847800	out of Heidelberg, out of Europe.
847800	850800	It caused a lot of frustration in the team and I saw that.
850800	852800	That's painful to see.
853800	857800	In fact, comparing open AI with ALEF Alpha was absurd.
857800	861800	Open AI was almost half owned by tech giant Microsoft,
861800	865800	which had pumped over 10 billion dollars into the company.
865800	869800	Jonas Androulas had raised just 28 million euros.
869800	872800	Still, he wanted to take them on.
872800	875800	We're all under enormous pressure.
875800	877800	We're fighting for security.
878800	881800	We're all under enormous pressure.
881800	883800	We're fighting for survival.
883800	886800	We've created something world-class with a lot less money.
886800	890800	We're basically at the forefront on the highest level.
890800	896800	But we all know that there's now a wave of Microsoft money rolling towards us,
896800	899800	and we can't do anything to stop it.
907800	911800	Is it very easier to speak in French or English?
911800	914800	I might find it difficult to make really French
914800	916800	without English words everywhere.
916800	917800	Yes.
917800	919800	Yeah, because, yeah.
919800	922800	While Jonas Androulas was filling the heat
922800	926800	from industry top dogs Microsoft and open AI,
926800	928800	Thomas Wolff was more worried
928800	931800	about the fact that he could not speak English.
931800	934800	He was worried about the fact that he could not speak English.
934800	938800	With Microsoft and open AI, Thomas Wolff was more relaxed.
938800	940800	He co-founded Huggingface,
940800	945800	which has 200 employees and offices in Paris, New York and Amsterdam.
945800	948800	The company has built a successful platform
948800	951800	where programmers and companies can share AI models
951800	953800	and further develop them.
953800	956800	The philosophy, the mission and the values that we push
956800	959800	are actually very European by some way.
959800	961800	Being careful about the data,
961800	963800	trying to build something responsible
963800	966800	and not just go fast and break it.
968800	972800	There are definitely Anglo-American values in chat GPT.
972800	975800	We wondered whether we could set up a project
975800	977800	to analyze and document that.
977800	980800	For example, with benchmarks that could show
980800	984800	whether a model has Anglo-American, French or German values.
985800	989800	It would be interesting to do a comparative study
989800	993800	between chat GPT and bloom chat, wouldn't it?
993800	996800	If you ask a question in different languages,
996800	1000800	how different are the answers depending on the kind of question?
1000800	1003800	Is the approach more American or European?
1003800	1006800	That would be an interesting study.
1006800	1009800	That would be an interesting study.
1009800	1012800	That would be an interesting study.
1017800	1020800	When I talk about pluralism of values,
1020800	1024800	I mean that every population in the world has its own value system.
1024800	1027800	We have a lot of different nationalities here
1027800	1031800	and we have to ask ourselves, what are our values?
1031800	1034800	What's important to us?
1035800	1041800	Optimistic sparks in Europe, like new startups.
1041800	1045800	Germany, Aleph Alpha is already a big player.
1045800	1049800	In the UK, stability is obviously a very visible player.
1049800	1052800	Here in Europe, in France, there's Mistral,
1052800	1055800	there's a new player in Finland.
1055800	1057800	In almost every European country,
1057800	1062800	I see at least one or two startups with this ambition
1063800	1066800	to become and to build something big.
1067800	1071800	As idealistic as Thomas and his team from Hugging Face appear,
1071800	1073800	there is also criticism.
1073800	1078800	Open source or not, the end result is that a small elite of tech professionals
1078800	1080800	is determining what our future looks like
1080800	1083800	and what risks we're exposed to.
1086800	1088800	All the business people I meet say,
1088800	1092800	we need education, society has to educate itself.
1092800	1094800	We only create the systems,
1094800	1097800	but you can design those systems in different ways.
1097800	1101800	For example, you can make it so that a person can understand what's going on,
1101800	1102800	at least a little.
1102800	1106800	This could be one of the obligations we impose on the industry.
1112800	1115800	These machines have processed all cultural knowledge
1115800	1119800	and are created by mathematicians who don't know anything about culture.
1119800	1121800	That's a bit of an exaggeration, of course,
1121800	1125800	but we have to find ways of explaining this to people who aren't interested in the math.
1125800	1128800	They just use the machines as tools.
1128800	1130800	They need to understand where the limits are,
1130800	1134800	in which situations the machine will or won't work.
1134800	1136800	Just like with GPS devices,
1136800	1139800	where we recognize when they give us the wrong route.
1140800	1144800	Isn't it great that such a huge research field is opening up?
1149800	1151800	But there's also a huge gulf opening up.
1151800	1153800	Who's actually responsible in the end?
1153800	1155800	Because as a developer or researcher,
1155800	1157800	you have a certain responsibility.
1157800	1159800	It's not about restricting research,
1159800	1163800	but when there are applications that are harmful to society,
1163800	1165800	we have to be aware of that.
1165800	1168800	There is a huge potential for manipulation.
1168800	1172800	Just think of the influence of chat GPT on elections.
1172800	1174800	I think there needs to be an antidote.
1174800	1176800	More education.
1176800	1178800	That's a good topic for the upcoming elections.
1178800	1182800	What education do we need to stop us being manipulated?
1188800	1190800	That's a big question.
1190800	1194800	What happens when people start asking AI who they should vote for?
1194800	1198800	Because the AI will give them an answer, as it always does.
1198800	1200800	Who decides how it answers?
1200800	1202800	Who should decide that?
1202800	1204800	Unfortunately, I have no answer to that.
1214800	1217800	Generative AI is developing at breathtaking speed
1217800	1220800	and tech giants are battling it out in the ring.
1220800	1223800	That's spurring development even more.
1223800	1226800	There's a massive new market up for grabs.
1229800	1232800	Leading AI experts worry that big tech,
1232800	1234800	in its eagerness to compete,
1234800	1238800	is creating technologies beyond our control.
1239800	1241800	I think we've made a mistake
1241800	1245800	when my Swedish countryman Carl von Linnaeus branded our species
1245800	1248800	as homo sapiens, because sapiens means the thinking homo,
1248800	1250800	the smart one.
1250800	1253800	We're not going to be the smartest anymore.
1253800	1256800	Maybe we should re-brand ourselves the homo sentience,
1256800	1258800	the feeling human.
1258800	1263800	We can feel curiosity, meaning, purpose, love.
1263800	1266800	That is what really makes us unique.
1270800	1273800	We should ask, how can we keep control over the machine?
1273800	1276800	So that we can use them as tools to build a world
1276800	1281800	where we can really have human flourishing with positive experiences.
1287800	1290800	In 2014, when I founded the Future Life Institute,
1290800	1296800	it was quite taboo to even talk about AI safety at all,
1296800	1299800	because that would imply that it wasn't totally safe.
1299800	1302800	And a lot of AI researchers thought that it would be bad for funding,
1302800	1305800	and that only weird people worried about this.
1307800	1309800	It was very much like coming out of the closet moment
1309800	1311800	for people to sign this letter and say,
1311800	1314800	oh, you too are worried?
1314800	1316800	I think we should slow down a little bit.
1316800	1317800	Oh, I didn't know that.
1317800	1320800	And then it suddenly became socially acceptable.
1323800	1326800	Max Tegmark and his Future of Life Institute
1326800	1328800	published an open letter,
1328800	1330800	warning that artificial intelligence
1330800	1333800	posed an existential danger to humanity.
1333800	1337800	Civilisation itself could be under threat.
1347800	1350800	The letter was signed by hundreds of AI researchers
1350800	1352800	and tech industry leaders,
1352800	1356800	including Tesla boss and ex-owner Elon Musk,
1356800	1359800	Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,
1359800	1362800	and touring award winner Joshua Benio.
1362800	1366800	And it's been quite shocking that once we put this letter out
1366800	1369800	and kind of a who's who of AI researchers signed it,
1369800	1371800	the conversation really exploded.
1382800	1385800	My worst fears are that we cause significant...
1385800	1387800	We, the field, the technology, the industry
1387800	1390800	cause significant harm to the world.
1392800	1394800	I think that could happen in a lot of different ways.
1394800	1396800	It's why we started the company.
1399800	1401800	I think if this technology goes wrong,
1401800	1403800	it can go quite wrong.
1405800	1407800	And we want to be vocal about that.
1407800	1409800	We want to work with the government.
1409800	1411800	I think he was serious about that.
1411800	1413800	I think that's kind of...
1413800	1415800	So we were talking about existential risks
1415800	1417800	and I also believe there are existential risks.
1417800	1419800	There are also a whole spectrum of other risks.
1419800	1422800	And I know of some, I talked to him a couple of times about this.
1422800	1425800	He very much recognises them as well.
1425800	1427800	On the one hand, of course, these warnings
1427800	1430800	about the major power of this new technology
1430800	1433800	also amplify the significance of the products
1433800	1435800	that these people are building.
1435800	1438800	So it could also have an indirect marketing effect.
1438800	1441800	Right? Like look at the incredible things that we're building.
1441800	1444800	But also, let's make sure that nothing goes wrong.
1444800	1447800	And for that, they look to the politicians.
1447800	1449800	The net effect of that could be that
1449800	1452800	if heaven forbid something goes wrong,
1452800	1454800	they could say, well, we warned you,
1454800	1456800	but the politicians did not act
1456800	1458800	or they did not act in time.
1458800	1460800	So I'm looking at a paper here
1460800	1462800	entitled Large Language Models Trained on Media Diets
1462800	1464800	Can Predict Public Opinion.
1464800	1466800	This is just posted about a month ago.
1466800	1469800	This work was done at MIT and then also at Google.
1469800	1472800	The conclusion is that large language models
1472800	1475800	can indeed predict public opinion.
1475800	1478800	I want to think about this in the context of elections.
1478800	1482800	Should we be concerned about large language models
1482800	1485800	that can predict survey opinion
1485800	1488800	and then can help organisations into these fine-tuned strategies
1488800	1490800	to elicit behaviours from voters?
1490800	1492800	Should we be worried about this for our elections?
1492800	1494800	Yeah. Thank you, Senator Holly, for the question.
1494800	1497800	It's one of my areas of greatest concern.
1497800	1499800	The more general ability of these models
1499800	1501800	to manipulate, to persuade,
1501800	1505800	to provide sort of one-on-one interactive disinformation.
1505800	1507800	I'm nervous about it.
1507800	1510800	I think people are able to adapt quite quickly
1510800	1513800	when Photoshop came onto the scene a long time ago.
1513800	1516800	For a while, people were really quite fooled
1516800	1518800	by Photoshopped images
1518800	1520800	and then pretty quickly developed
1520800	1523800	an understanding that images might be Photoshopped.
1523800	1526800	This will be like that, but on steroids.
1526800	1529800	And the interactivity,
1529800	1532800	the ability to really model, predict humans well
1532800	1535800	as you talked about, I think is going to require
1535800	1538800	a combination of companies doing the right thing,
1538800	1540800	regulation and public education.
1553800	1556800	2024 is a crucial election year.
1556800	1558800	Not only in the United States, but worldwide.
1558800	1561800	There will be European Parliament elections.
1561800	1563800	There will be elections in India.
1563800	1565800	I mean, it's a large amount of people in the world
1565800	1567800	will actually go to the polls.
1567800	1570800	And while we're living in this big experiment
1570800	1573800	where it's very hard for independent researchers,
1573800	1575800	journalists, civil society organisations
1575800	1577800	to probe these models,
1577800	1580800	that we may only find out, you know,
1580800	1584800	what the harms and malign uses
1584800	1588800	as a weapon against democracy were when it is too late.
1591800	1594800	Shortly after Sam Altman appeared before the US Senate,
1594800	1596800	he co-signed a statement
1596800	1598800	along with a number of high-ranking executives
1598800	1601800	from Google, Microsoft and other tech companies.
1611800	1614800	The fact that it was the companies
1614800	1618800	who themselves were asking for this type of regulation
1618800	1620800	and it was the leading researchers
1620800	1623800	who were asking for the government to get involved,
1623800	1626800	that really was the turning point in the conversation.
1630800	1633800	To understand the effect that generative AI
1633800	1637800	was having behind the scenes of global politics at the time,
1637800	1641800	you have to travel north to a small Swedish city called Luleå,
1641800	1646800	around 150 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle.
1646800	1648800	When people say that artificial intelligence
1648800	1651800	is going to be like the next industrial revolution,
1651800	1654800	I think they're underestimating its impact.
1654800	1656800	It's not just going to be a new technology
1656800	1658800	like the steam engine.
1658800	1661800	It's like building a new species.
1661800	1664800	A species that's much smarter than us.
1664800	1667800	President Biden himself was having meetings
1667800	1670800	on artificial intelligence in some cases
1670800	1672800	as often as three times per week.
1672800	1675800	And I will tell you that not very many things
1675800	1679800	get on the president's calendar for three times a week.
1683800	1686800	May 31st, 2023.
1686800	1690800	The sirens and motorcades descending on this Swedish coastal city
1690800	1693800	gave a sense of how much was at stake.
1693800	1696800	Leaders came here to discuss nothing less
1696800	1700800	than how humanity should react to the arrival of this new,
1700800	1703800	albeit artificial, form of intelligence.
1703800	1706800	What role should politicians play?
1706800	1710800	Democracy needs to show that we are as fast as technology.
1710800	1714800	You saw the first letter on asking for a course of six months.
1714800	1718800	You saw yesterday a number of very, very insightful people
1718800	1721800	signing up to say you need to do something
1721800	1723800	for the very existential risks.
1723800	1726800	And then you have the non-existential risks as well.
1726800	1729800	Why is it important for the European Union
1729800	1732800	to have a common policy with the US concerning AI
1732800	1734800	and shouldn't other parts of the globe
1734800	1736800	be included in the conversation?
1736800	1738800	Europe is important, but this is bigger than Europe.
1738800	1741800	US is important, but it is bigger than the US.
1741800	1744800	But if the two of us take the lead with close friends,
1744800	1746800	I think we can push something
1746800	1748800	that will make us all much more comfortable
1748800	1751800	with the fact that generative AI is now in the world
1751800	1754800	and is developing at amazing speeds.
1771800	1775800	Jonas Androulos was also invited to the top-level meeting in Sweden
1775800	1778800	to represent the views of European AI startups
1778800	1781800	and call for fair competition.
1784800	1787800	Of course there are other AI companies in Europe,
1787800	1789800	but we're the one that's keeping pace the most
1789800	1791800	with the global leaders.
1791800	1793800	I assume that's the reason why we're here,
1793800	1796800	not because we're so charming.
1806800	1809800	What kind of change is coming in some industries?
1809800	1811800	How do you feel about that?
1811800	1814800	We can raise more capital.
1814800	1816800	I think we have...
1816800	1818800	Two weeks ago I was at SFI conference,
1818800	1820800	SAP SFI conference,
1820800	1822800	and Christian Klein on his opening keynote
1822800	1823800	he kind of said,
1823800	1825800	our key partners for generative AI
1825800	1828800	are Aleph, Alfa, Google and Microsoft.
1828800	1831800	And then I'll have events coming up
1831800	1833800	with HPE, with Antonio Neri.
1833800	1836800	What do you think about
1836800	1839800	our colleagues on the other end here,
1839800	1842800	from Anthropics and the latest...
1845800	1847800	Statements, etc.
1847800	1849800	Oh, so the statements on safety?
1849800	1851800	Yeah, like yesterday and so on.
1851800	1856800	Long-term it is possible to conceive catastrophic events.
1856800	1858800	I've had Brussels and Berlin
1858800	1862800	and they basically are scared.
1864800	1867800	We will start with Jonas Androulis,
1867800	1870800	who's the founder and CEO of Aleph, Alfa.
1870800	1871800	The floor is yours,
1871800	1873800	and thank you very much for being with us today.
1873800	1875800	All right, thanks for having me.
1875800	1877800	I think we're all a little bit dizzy.
1877800	1879800	The speed of change,
1879800	1881800	like everybody I know that is in AI
1881800	1882800	is kind of stressed out,
1882800	1884800	and with this technology
1884800	1887800	we're only even just stretching the surface.
1887800	1889800	I fear that knowledge work
1889800	1891800	is in the hands of the world
1891800	1893800	and I fear that knowledge work
1893800	1896800	is an important part of what is happening in Europe.
1896800	1899800	So this is an opportunity for us
1899800	1901800	to build new empires,
1901800	1902800	to build new value,
1902800	1904800	but it's also a risk
1904800	1907800	that we're losing a substantial pillar
1907800	1908800	that we're standing on.
1908800	1911800	Thinking about how we can
1911800	1914800	make this a fair playing field,
1914800	1917800	because I think it's in everybody's interest
1917800	1920800	that Europe will contribute to a safer future in AI.
1920800	1922800	Thank you very much.
1930800	1932800	While the U.S. and the EU
1932800	1934800	were trying to come up with a common strategy
1934800	1936800	on the other side of the world in China,
1936800	1939800	an artificial intelligence ecosystem
1939800	1942800	was emerging with its own set of rules.
1942800	1945800	AI is a key part of China's efforts
1945800	1948800	to become a global power.
1948800	1951800	I always remember my mom and my dad
1951800	1953800	pushing me to this Olympic school
1953800	1956800	in order to get specialized in mathematics
1956800	1957800	and also English school.
1957800	1959800	It's like extra work
1959800	1961800	besides this regular schoolwork.
1961800	1963800	So basically you have to take the lessons
1963800	1965800	on Saturday, on weekend.
1965800	1968800	It makes me a quick learner.
1968800	1970800	And my mom is correct, right?
1970800	1973800	So in order to keep progress,
1973800	1975800	in order to keep pushing yourself,
1975800	1976800	you have to keep learning.
1976800	1979800	And I always tell my employees
1979800	1980800	also to keep learning,
1980800	1983800	to keep up this fast pace in AI.
1985800	1987800	My father was a professor
1987800	1989800	in computer science,
1989800	1991800	so I am very lucky to get
1991800	1994800	in touch with AI in the very early days.
1994800	1996800	Back in 2009, I was trying to
1996800	1998800	build some AI models,
1998800	1999800	very simple AI models.
1999800	2001800	Nowadays, if you look
2001800	2003800	from today's large language model perspective,
2003800	2006800	that model is like a very simple,
2006800	2008800	simple like a small ant.
2012800	2015800	Han Xiaoh has worked in both the East and the West.
2015800	2019800	He's held positions at the Chinese tech giant Tencent
2019800	2022800	and German online retailer Zalando.
2022800	2025800	Three years ago, he founded his own company.
2025800	2027800	Gina is an AI startup
2027800	2030800	with offices in Shenzhen and Beijing.
2030800	2032800	But its headquarters are in Berlin.
2032800	2034800	Oh, where do we have another interview here?
2034800	2035800	Why?
2035800	2037800	Yes, for the website.
2037800	2038800	For the website?
2038800	2040800	We have the internship program with interns
2040800	2042800	and now we want to add also like employees experience
2042800	2045800	so people can see how it is to work at Gina.
2045800	2047800	Not only from an intern perspective.
2047800	2048800	Yes, I see, I see.
2051800	2054800	So, Kalimia of course from India,
2054800	2059800	Isabella from South Africa.
2059800	2061800	Aladdin from Tunisia.
2062800	2065800	Jack Mian from Malaysia.
2065800	2068800	Michelle finally from Germany.
2071800	2073800	I have a limited amount of wires.
2073800	2075800	So I can only power one monitor.
2075800	2078800	Sometimes I really need to show people the architecture
2078800	2080800	and also show people the results of the model.
2080800	2083800	So it's nice that I have this second screen
2083800	2085800	where I can draw on it as well.
2085800	2087800	It basically becomes touchscreen.
2090800	2093800	So this is basically showing the progress
2093800	2095800	of training the model.
2095800	2097800	It's kind of like stock market, right?
2097800	2099800	I see this model performs relatively good
2099800	2102800	because you can see it's increasing over time.
2102800	2105800	But sometimes it's not very successful.
2105800	2109800	For example, this one, this model start very high
2109800	2111800	but then the progress kind of stopped.
2111800	2114800	That is wasting our time, it's wasting GPU resources,
2114800	2116800	energy and so on, right?
2116800	2119800	Han Shao and his team are working on optimizing
2119800	2122800	AI models for specific applications.
2122800	2126800	For example, linking text, video and images.
2126800	2129800	Their goal is to make communication between humans
2129800	2132800	and machines more intuitive and natural.
2132800	2134800	A lot of people may recognize this.
2134800	2138800	This guy, this is a kind of grand-par meme, right?
2138800	2141800	So it's very popular on social media, right?
2141800	2144800	So if you upload this picture to the algorithm,
2144800	2146800	it will generate a story.
2146800	2151800	You can generate comedy, erotic, fantasy, horror,
2151800	2153800	all this kind of story.
2153800	2157800	So we just keep it default and then we just do.
2157800	2159800	It wasn't supposed to be like this.
2159800	2161800	I was meant for more.
2161800	2165800	He whispered to the room, his words echoing into silence.
2165800	2168800	I am more than the lonely man I've become,
2168800	2171800	more than these disappointments.
2172800	2176800	Suddenly, his eyes glinted, a revelation forming within his mind.
2176800	2180800	Perhaps, it is time I showed the world that again.
2180800	2184800	With strengthened resolve, Arthur placed the coffee down,
2184800	2186800	marking an end to his solitary reflection
2186800	2188800	and the beginning of a new chapter.
2188800	2191800	So basically, this is what you can do
2191800	2194800	when you push multimodal AI into an extreme, right?
2194800	2196800	So you can see from a single image,
2196800	2200800	you are able to generate not only a text description,
2200800	2203800	but an emotional audio story.
2217800	2221800	Eventually, Chinese companies will be in the leading position
2221800	2223800	in this generative AI.
2223800	2229800	Two months ago, I was participating in this World AI Congress in Shanghai.
2229800	2233800	And during that conference, there were 30 large language models
2233800	2236800	released on one day.
2236800	2240800	Some from big companies like Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu,
2240800	2245800	some also from middle-sized companies from different industries.
2245800	2247800	For example, from Bank.
2247800	2261800	This Chinese company is usually very good at learning from U.S. companies.
2261800	2264800	So they kind of copycat what U.S. companies are doing
2264800	2266800	and then make it even better.
2269800	2274800	I don't doubt that one day, you will see one of the top models
2274800	2278800	in the benchmark in the leaderboard are actually from China.
2282800	2287800	The question of which companies will dominate the age of artificial intelligence
2287800	2290800	has real geopolitical consequences.
2290800	2295800	China is using the expertise of its tech companies to expand its power.
2295800	2299800	Western nations, meanwhile, are trying to counter this.
2304800	2306800	I'm going to go back.
2315800	2317800	My name is Jeffrey Kane.
2317800	2320800	I was a long-time journalist and foreign correspondent in China.
2320800	2322800	I wrote a book called The Perfect Police State,
2322800	2324800	and I was an advisor to the U.S. Congress,
2324800	2329800	to the House of Representatives on sanctions and Chinese politics.
2329800	2333800	From what I have seen around the world in China and elsewhere,
2333800	2338800	I am deeply concerned that we do not know how to manage AI yet.
2338800	2340800	We do not know what's coming.
2340800	2343800	We do not know how to rein in this technology
2343800	2347800	and put it to the good use of our democracy.
2350800	2355800	China has been leading in bringing technology under state control
2355800	2358800	and, in fact, using it as an instrument for state power,
2358800	2364800	whether it is for internal control and censorship, a grip on society,
2364800	2369800	or whether it is their global ambition to have digital infrastructure around the world
2369800	2374800	and to work with countries, for example, I think, about the African continent.
2374800	2379800	It is, of course, a vision that is at direct odds with that of democratic societies.
2379800	2384800	In 2017, China's national strategy for artificial intelligence,
2384800	2386800	and this is a public document,
2386800	2391800	set out the explicit goal of dominating global AI technology.
2391800	2395800	And so I think the United States has explicitly set the goal
2395800	2403800	that we are not going to assist China in rising as an AI-enabled authoritarian superpower.
2406800	2409800	Ironically, in the past, it's been large U.S. companies
2409800	2412800	that have undermined their government's policies
2412800	2416800	in order to gain access to the massive Chinese market,
2416800	2419800	foremost among them, Microsoft.
2419800	2425800	Microsoft is the most pivotal and important western company operating in China
2425800	2430800	that has helped the Chinese government develop its AI dystopia.
2430800	2434800	Microsoft set up an office in China called Microsoft Research Asia.
2434800	2438800	This was a gesture from Bill Gates back in the 1990s
2438800	2442800	because he wanted to guarantee stronger market access to China.
2442800	2447800	This laboratory has gone on to train the who's who list,
2447800	2452800	the superstars of the Chinese artificial intelligence world.
2452800	2457800	Many of the key people in this laboratory have gone on to found companies
2457800	2461800	such as MakeV, SenseTime, or either found them
2461800	2464800	or they've taken on very senior roles in them.
2465800	2473800	That was like the incubator of the modern Chinese internet or AI industry.
2473800	2477800	A lot of great people, great researchers, startup founders
2477800	2479800	actually come from Microsoft Research.
2479800	2485800	And those talents are now becoming kind of the very, very big influencers,
2485800	2489800	opinion leaders, and really like entrepreneurs in China.
2490800	2493800	Microsoft helped build China's tech elite.
2493800	2496800	This in turn has been used by the Chinese government
2496800	2502800	to create a gigantic surveillance state that operates with the help of AI.
2504800	2506800	Like in China, in Beijing and Shenzhen,
2506800	2510800	you can find the most CCTV camera in the world.
2510800	2516800	And to be honest, like a general public get used to it.
2517800	2522800	So they don't see this as intrusion to their own privacy
2522800	2526800	or having a software that analyze their behavior,
2526800	2531800	because the kind of the narrative there was to protect them,
2531800	2534800	to make the society more secure,
2534800	2537800	provide, protect from terrorists and so on.
2537800	2541800	So in general, like the public over the last 10 years
2541800	2545800	has already accept the fact that there are surveillance everywhere.
2552800	2556800	And now, not only you have an option of listening to all the information
2556800	2558800	that people exchange in society,
2558800	2562800	now you also have the cognitive capacity to process all of this.
2562800	2564800	So that's a scary, scary future.
2564800	2567800	Unfortunately, it's definitely not an impossible one.
2571800	2576800	Right now we have like over 500 city brands across the country.
2576800	2578800	That means one city is just like Shanghai.
2578800	2581800	They have a lot of big data analysis center.
2581800	2585800	They're collecting all this data from different areas.
2585800	2589800	And they have the machine, they have the algorithm,
2589800	2594800	like centralized it and do the computation analysis
2594800	2596800	and making all these decisions.
2602800	2606800	The Chinese government has used all forms of AI so far.
2606800	2608800	They see AI as an extremely powerful tool
2608800	2612800	that they can use for the military, for national security,
2612800	2614800	for state surveillance, police work,
2614800	2617800	also the management of cities, traffic.
2617800	2620800	They have been selling these same technologies all over the world,
2620800	2622800	especially to authoritarian governments
2622800	2625800	with the promise of total surveillance
2625800	2629800	and a nation free of crime, free of dissident,
2629800	2631800	it's a brave new world
2631800	2634800	because we have not yet found a solution to this in the West.
2641800	2643800	China is forging ahead.
2643800	2646800	The US is pursuing its own interests.
2646800	2648800	And the EU?
2648800	2651800	It's striving for independence.
2652800	2656800	If Europeans don't play a part in shaping this future technology,
2656800	2658800	then it will be American or Chinese AI
2658800	2662800	that will penetrate our lives to an unprecedented extent.
2664800	2668800	It will know us as well as our closest friends and relatives.
2668800	2671800	It will communicate with us around the clock
2671800	2674800	and influence our thoughts and actions.
2679800	2681800	To prevent this, the EU needs companies
2681800	2683800	that can not only program
2683800	2686800	but also build their own hardware infrastructure
2686800	2689800	to keep highly sensitive data safe.
2699800	2702800	The most precious commodity, the most important resource
2702800	2705800	for the future of generative AI is GPU power.
2705800	2707800	In other words, computing power.
2707800	2710800	In the future, it will be as essential as electricity
2710800	2714800	and water have been for developments that have taken place in the past.
2718800	2722800	There's already a saying in Silicon Valley, the GPU poor,
2722800	2725800	the people with fewer graphics cards.
2731800	2734800	Training high-end AI language models
2734800	2737800	requires thousands of high-performance graphics cards,
2737800	2740800	which is also why supplies are scarce.
2740800	2742800	That's another reason why many smaller players
2742800	2745800	ally themselves with large tech companies.
2750800	2754800	A lot of the deals in the field of generative AI in recent months
2754800	2756800	have come at the cost of independence.
2756800	2759800	Many companies have partnered with large corporations
2759800	2762800	by accepting restrictions on things like hardware selection,
2762800	2765800	cloud selection, integration.
2765800	2768800	We absolutely didn't want to do that.
2771800	2774800	Early on, Jonas Androulis recognized the value
2774800	2777800	of having one's own hardware.
2777800	2780800	He built a data center for his company in Germany.
2780800	2785800	For that reason, Alif Alpha is becoming increasingly strategically important
2785800	2787800	for politicians.
2788800	2792800	The media talks about you as Germany's answer to chatGPT.
2792800	2794800	Is that right?
2795800	2797800	That's wrong.
2797800	2800800	You could say Germany's answer to open AI,
2800800	2803800	but chatGPT is a product aimed at the consumer.
2803800	2806800	It's really intended to help school kids do their homework
2806800	2809800	and to help them understand what's going on in the world.
2809800	2811800	That's right.
2811800	2814800	That's not our target group at all.
2814800	2818800	We want to go where the most complex and critical processes are.
2818800	2821800	For example, in the financial industry,
2821800	2824800	in administration, in security, in healthcare,
2824800	2828800	that's where we want to build systems that assist and support people.
2828800	2831800	We're in a government ministry here.
2831800	2834800	We're in a government ministry here.
2834800	2837800	We're in a government ministry here.
2837800	2841800	And public administration could benefit enormously from AI.
2841800	2843800	We have an incredible number of processes
2843800	2846800	that could be systematized and carried out.
2846800	2849800	So the focus of my work here was a bit like asking
2849800	2853800	how the public sector could act as a mainstay consumer,
2853800	2856800	generating work, if you can put it like that,
2856800	2860800	which would create demand for German and European AI technology.
2860800	2863800	I mean, it's an AI company that targets the public sector,
2863800	2865800	and we are the public sector.
2865800	2868800	So we only have to see that we generate opportunities
2868800	2870800	for these technologies to be tested,
2870800	2873800	be it through customer experience, funding decisions, or even permits.
2873800	2877800	We talk a lot about regulation and that kind of thing,
2877800	2880800	but if we continue to be dependent on foreign countries
2880800	2883800	and commercial enterprises for the future,
2883800	2886800	we're going to be able to do that.
2886800	2889800	And if we continue to be dependent on foreign countries
2889800	2892800	and commercial enterprises for this essential technology,
2892800	2895800	then in the future, things could potentially end up
2895800	2898800	like they did with energy, like with gas recently,
2898800	2901800	where we wanted to say certain things, but we couldn't,
2901800	2905800	because otherwise it would have gotten cold and dark around here.
2910800	2914800	The data center that so far ensured Aleph Alpha's independence
2914800	2917800	is the US company Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
2923800	2926800	Hewlett Packard Enterprise is one of the biggest players
2926800	2929800	when it comes to setting up computer infrastructure.
2929800	2931800	They build data centers.
2931800	2934800	They set up internal server rooms.
2934800	2937800	A lot of the high quality infrastructure
2937800	2940800	in which the modern world runs comes from HPE.
2945800	2947800	MUSIC
2956800	2960800	Andrew Lewis secured a strategic partnership with HPE,
2960800	2962800	giving him access to hardware
2962800	2965800	without tying him to the company exclusively.
2965800	2969800	He also hoped it would help him gain a foothold in the US market.
2969800	2972800	He finalized the deal in Las Vegas
2972800	2975800	with HPE CEO Antonio Neri.
2993800	2996800	We're announcing a major joint project with HPE today.
2996800	2999800	There will be a press release going out simultaneously.
2999800	3002800	It'll be a big joint market venture.
3002800	3004800	That's the important thing.
3004800	3006800	Not that I'm going to go on a stage,
3006800	3009800	but that we're now taking a joint step with a major partner.
3009800	3012800	Am I nervous? Maybe a little.
3012800	3015800	We've been working towards this for months.
3015800	3017800	I'm sure it'll go well.
3021800	3025800	What is the competitive advantage of Marvel, eventually?
3025800	3028800	We're building our bond.
3028800	3030800	We have an independent tax tax,
3030800	3033800	so we're not relying on any external dependencies.
3033800	3036800	We recently solved explainability in a new way
3036800	3039800	so you can not only see positive, confirming sources,
3039800	3041800	but also disagreeing sources.
3041800	3043800	You share with me an example of that.
3043800	3046800	Yes, exactly. From your own kind of speech.
3046800	3049800	They are analysts here, so be careful.
3051800	3053800	Americans move fast.
3053800	3055800	They're willing to take risks,
3055800	3059800	but, of course, this partnership also has to benefit HPE,
3059800	3063800	and any partnership can come to an end at any time.
3070800	3073800	Jonas Andrewles wanted to avoid becoming dependent
3073800	3075800	on a large corporation,
3075800	3078800	as with open AI and Microsoft.
3078800	3081800	But that strategy brought with it a major risk.
3081800	3084800	If his technology doesn't keep up with the competition,
3084800	3087800	he'll be out of the race.
3087800	3089800	We'll have more money soon.
3089800	3094800	I'm hoping that yesterday helped a little bit with that.
3094800	3098800	Yeah, certainly didn't hurt,
3098800	3101800	and I've got some kind of immediate feedback
3101800	3106800	after the show from investors on my cell phone.
3106800	3110800	And, of course, I want to put this money to work.
3111800	3114800	I think if we can get your help,
3114800	3118800	if we could get your help to really say,
3118800	3120800	okay, these are the application use cases,
3120800	3124800	I think we can get that list from you,
3124800	3126800	and then we can turn around and look at,
3126800	3128800	okay, one, how do we package it?
3128800	3131800	Two, can we use it internally?
3131800	3133800	I think that would be great.
3133800	3134800	And then, obviously, three,
3134800	3137800	how do we make sure we line up the services offer?
3137800	3139800	Thanks again for the partnership. Great to see you.
3139800	3141800	Thanks a lot.
3141800	3144800	I think what always attracted us to the relationship was,
3144800	3148800	LFLFA's mission was to enable enterprise application use cases
3148800	3151800	for LLMs and multimodal models,
3151800	3154800	and most of the customers in the Valley
3154800	3156800	or most of the companies in Silicon Valley
3156800	3158800	were much more consumer-oriented.
3158800	3161800	So this concept of a single-tenant LLM
3161800	3165800	that can be trained with your data for your application
3165800	3168800	really fits our core customer base.
3170800	3172800	For all their friendliness,
3172800	3176800	and Drulles knew the Americans wanted to see concrete results,
3176800	3179800	he had to deliver and fast.
3188800	3191800	I will show you anger.
3194800	3196800	I have a smile for you.
3197800	3200800	Are you happy with the trade fair so far?
3207800	3209800	What's been most interesting?
3221800	3224800	The AI race is also a competition for attention.
3225800	3227800	It's about catching the eye of investors
3227800	3231800	sitting on panels, being noticed, being quoted.
3245800	3249800	We've already heard from a few masterminds on this topic today,
3249800	3251800	and there are still a few more to come.
3252800	3254800	With you, we'll be asking to what extent
3254800	3257800	AI itself will drive innovation.
3259800	3263800	This one's niche technology is now the subject of massive hype.
3263800	3266800	Jonas S. Drulles is suddenly in the spotlight.
3266800	3270800	His AI is being tested and evaluated,
3270800	3272800	not always favourably.
3272800	3276800	News Magazine did cite accused LFLFA of allowing its AI
3276800	3280800	to be provoked into making racist and chauvinistic statements.
3281800	3284800	And Drulles pointed out that its basic technology
3284800	3287800	has deliberately not been restricted.
3290800	3293800	That's just low-hanging fruit for journalists.
3293800	3295800	I took a screenshot.
3295800	3297800	The model used a bad word.
3297800	3300800	Every time I fine-tune the model or tune the instructions,
3300800	3303800	that diminishes it in certain areas.
3304800	3309800	It loses capabilities in exchange for me making it more pleasant or safer,
3309800	3312800	and those might be the exact capabilities that I need
3312800	3316800	in an industrial context for automating processes.
3316800	3321800	We want the embedding technology to become a well-known brand,
3321800	3323800	just like the iPhone.
3323800	3325800	That's the most important thing.
3325800	3328800	Don't forget to subscribe to our channel
3328800	3330800	for more videos like this.
3346800	3349800	We want to think about whether it makes sense or not.
3352800	3355800	We want to become a company like OpenAI,
3355800	3358800	the top provider in the embedding world.
3377800	3383800	What is the best way to push the team to focus on this product?
3383800	3388800	We have teams with different cultural backgrounds,
3388800	3393800	and sometimes it's very hard to organize everybody to concentrate on one thing.
3393800	3396800	This is also because the AI is developing so fast,
3396800	3399800	and a lot of hypes are here and there,
3399800	3402800	and people want to try this out, try that out.
3402800	3406800	So I just talk to my CEO and make sure that all the senior engineers,
3406800	3409800	senior leaders are kind of on the same page.
3412800	3414800	For me as a CEO,
3414800	3418800	my primary job is actually killing the fun,
3418800	3422800	killing the fun part by killing all this distraction
3422800	3425800	to make sure that people concentrate on the single mission
3425800	3427800	to make this company successful.
3427800	3430800	We are kind of a developer-driven company,
3430800	3433800	and most of our customers or users are actually developers,
3433800	3434800	software engineers.
3434800	3438800	So for example, right now there is a talentus sitting there,
3438800	3441800	and their engineering team is also our customer.
3441800	3448800	The biggest challenge is the competition in AI is just too intense.
3448800	3450800	Investors are not stupid, like most of the investors,
3450800	3452800	especially when it comes to later round,
3452800	3455800	investors have a very strict evaluation about this company.
3455800	3458800	So the companies that we are competing with,
3458800	3461800	such as Hackingface from France,
3461800	3464800	and Coher from the US,
3464800	3468800	so those companies are not like those guys who previously worked at Google,
3468800	3471800	or graduated from MIT, Stanford,
3471800	3473800	so they are very smart people.
3473800	3476800	Most of the investors will look at us as not as a small company,
3476800	3479800	but they will evaluate us with more,
3479800	3482800	not based on the hype, but based on the performance of the company.
3482800	3486800	So that means we have to show two things,
3486800	3489800	either the hyper growth of the user,
3489800	3492800	so we need to grow the user base super fast,
3492800	3495800	or we show them a solid revenue.
3505800	3507800	Summer 2023.
3507800	3513800	Thomas Wolff has managed to make time for a family vacation in Brittany, France.
3513800	3516800	As Chief Scientific Officer, he's primarily responsible
3516800	3519800	for research and development at Hackingface,
3519800	3523800	a job that allows him to take a break from time to time.
3526800	3530800	What are you up to today? Anything special?
3530800	3533800	We're practicing ceiling with a trapeze.
3533800	3536800	Didn't you do that yesterday?
3536800	3539800	Yes, today we'll do something else.
3544800	3546800	I'm here to help.
3546800	3551800	Meanwhile, Thomas' business partner, Clemente Long, is in the spotlight.
3551800	3555800	He's the CEO of Hackingface, the public face of the company.
3557800	3562800	Tech industry heavyweights like Google, Amazon, NVIDIA and AMD
3562800	3567800	have invested $235 million into Hackingface.
3567800	3572800	The open development platform for AI models has become a billion-dollar business.
3574800	3576800	It's not.
3578800	3580800	The company gained even more prestige
3580800	3583800	when Mark Zuckerberg's Meta used Hackingface
3583800	3587800	to publish its high-end language model, Lama 2.
3591800	3595800	It's a model that was recently published by Facebook, or Meta.
3595800	3599800	It's similar to ChatGBT, an open-source competitor.
3599800	3601800	The difference is that it's free.
3601800	3604800	You can just install it on your computer.
3604800	3608800	You don't have to access it through the ChatGBT interface or pay for it.
3608800	3610800	It's like a set of Lego.
3610800	3613800	Everything is open. Everything is freely accessible.
3613800	3615800	You can also buy it pre-built.
3615800	3618800	If someone builds an open-source model for you,
3618800	3620800	it's like they're building Lego for you,
3620800	3623800	a beautiful sports car made from Lego.
3623800	3624800	And then it's yours.
3624800	3627800	You can open up the hood and look inside.
3628800	3632800	The greatest advantage of open-source, its free accessibility,
3632800	3635800	is also its greatest weakness.
3635800	3638800	What if a model was developed further by criminals,
3638800	3643800	terrorists or other bad actors and used to cause harm?
3643800	3646800	Any security mechanisms built into a language model
3646800	3648800	can easily be removed.
3653800	3656800	That's a big question we're asking ourselves.
3657800	3660800	In the beginning, our aim was to make this technology
3660800	3663800	as widely accessible as possible.
3663800	3665800	We thought it would help lots of developers,
3665800	3667800	but there are two sides to the technology.
3667800	3669800	There are some people who can access it
3669800	3671800	who really shouldn't be able to.
3681800	3685800	There was a guy I met last year who had an AI.
3685800	3689800	Designed to develop medicines, molecules that are good for your health.
3689800	3693800	Just as an experiment, he put in a minus sign
3693800	3697800	and trained it to look for molecules that were bad for your health.
3697800	3702800	Within four hours, it discovered thousands of chemical weapons,
3702800	3707800	including VX, the most powerful nerve gas
3707800	3711800	that we here in the US have developed.
3711800	3714800	Of course, you shouldn't open-source things like that.
3714800	3716800	It's just crazy.
3716800	3718800	I'm a scientist. I love open-source, right?
3718800	3721800	And it's undeniable if you think about the pace of progress,
3721800	3724800	how do you make sure that there is the most progress?
3724800	3726800	Open-source is your friend.
3726800	3731800	Having said that, I just cannot completely ignore all the dangers.
3731800	3734800	And of course, the only argument I have seen so far
3734800	3737800	from supporters of open-sourcing, everything is saying,
3737800	3739800	well, we will figure it out.
3740800	3742800	It's easy to comment from the sidelines
3742800	3744800	to simply warn that it's all dangerous.
3744800	3747800	It's more difficult to actively get involved,
3747800	3750800	to try to create something positive, something good.
3750800	3752800	It won't necessarily be successful.
3752800	3755800	There'll be mistakes and then fresh attempts,
3755800	3757800	but I'm going to try.
3757800	3760800	It's risky, but we'll follow the path we think is right.
3772800	3784800	MIT is one of the most renowned tech universities in the world.
3784800	3787800	It has close ties to industry.
3787800	3791800	The research carried out here has the potential to change the world.
3791800	3796800	Needless to say, MIT is at the forefront of artificial intelligence.
3796800	3800800	In addition to his work with the Future of Life Institute,
3800800	3802800	Max Tegmark is a professor here.
3802800	3806800	The topic of AI security is part of his day-to-day.
3808800	3812800	So we want to ramp up the effort and pace at which we do things.
3812800	3816800	And it's also very inspiring whenever I go to Silicon Valley
3816800	3818800	and meet with various companies there,
3818800	3819800	how quickly they do things,
3819800	3821800	often compared to what we do in universities.
3821800	3823800	So I thought it'd be fun to...
3824800	3825800	Now we have a whole...
3825800	3828800	We're lucky to have a whole bunch of talented people here.
3828800	3830800	We can wrap up.
3832800	3835800	Tegmark and his fellow campaigners want to keep a close eye
3835800	3838800	on the tech startups from Silicon Valley,
3838800	3841800	uncover risks and use scientific methodology
3841800	3844800	to show people just how little time we have left
3844800	3847800	to counteract the pull of the tech industry.
3849800	3851800	So you've been working very hard on finishing our paper.
3851800	3854800	We had a very, very long conversation about it yesterday.
3854800	3857800	I thought the very last part of what we talked about
3857800	3859800	might be kind of fun for the whole group.
3859800	3860800	Yeah, I completely agree.
3860800	3862800	Do you want to draw that table on the board
3862800	3866800	and maybe they can contribute to good quotes for it?
3866800	3870800	So we basically, as you know,
3870800	3873800	modeled the conflict between the movement
3873800	3876800	to replace human livelihoods
3876800	3878800	and maybe replace humans period
3878800	3881800	versus the movement to resist this
3881800	3884800	and to preserve the status quo.
3884800	3885800	So this doesn't just come...
3885800	3887800	It's not just something Peter pulled out of a hat.
3887800	3889800	It just actually comes from the math.
3889800	3891800	So if you're naive, like,
3891800	3894800	oh, we have AI that can do everything a human can do but better,
3894800	3896800	my life will still be good.
3896800	3898800	So we call that naivete.
3898800	3900800	So if a lot of people believe this,
3900800	3903800	then they will not invest personal sacrifices
3903800	3906800	and personal costs to greater unite
3906800	3909800	and for the movement to be in a better position
3909800	3910800	to resist as a team.
3910800	3913800	There's companies and open-source developers
3913800	3915800	that are working day and night
3915800	3918800	with the goal of taking people's income streams
3918800	3920800	by creating AI models that are better
3920800	3923800	than them at their job and their capabilities.
3923800	3926800	So once you lose your income streams and your leverage,
3926800	3927800	like, it's too late.
3927800	3930800	Your options are more limited.
3930800	3933800	The biggest danger is that we'll look back in 20 years
3933800	3935800	and realize that we've automated everything
3935800	3938800	because it was so easy and because it worked
3938800	3941800	and the AI behaved correctly in 99% of cases
3941800	3944800	and suddenly we no longer have control
3944800	3947800	over something that's crucial for society.
3959800	3962800	The process has already begun.
3962800	3966800	Until now, it's been the intellectual and creative abilities
3966800	3969800	of humans that have set us apart from other creatures
3969800	3971800	and machines.
3971800	3975800	But what if those qualities are now being taken away?
3984800	3987800	My name is Dr. Inongo Lumumba-Casango,
3987800	3988800	a.k.a. Samus.
3988800	3990800	I'm a rapper, I'm a producer,
3990800	3992800	and I'm an assistant professor
3992800	3994800	at Brown University and the Music Department.
3994800	3998800	Initially, I wasn't sort of tapped into all of the discussions
3998800	4000800	that were happening around AI.
4000800	4002800	Of course, peripherally, I was sort of listening,
4002800	4004800	watching, reading,
4004800	4007800	but I really started to tap into these conversations
4007800	4009800	when I noticed what was happening
4009800	4011800	at the intersection of hip-hop and AI,
4011800	4013800	and that's when I realized, whoa, this thing is moving
4013800	4014800	really quickly.
4014800	4016800	I mean, last year, we were talking about
4016800	4018800	a sort of AI-generated rapper,
4018800	4022800	and this year, we're talking about rappers like Drake
4022800	4025800	and artists like The Weeknd having their voices
4025800	4028800	actually sort of cloned using AI technologies,
4028800	4031800	and so the speed at which this has become
4031800	4034800	sort of an immediate challenge for working artists
4034800	4036800	is very alarming.
4036800	4039800	Ultimately, it's the logic of capitalism,
4039800	4043800	and as a human creator, what you can do is
4043800	4047800	try not to be left behind.
4047800	4052800	As a Chinese, we always feel that, like,
4052800	4055800	technology, if you use it in a smarter way,
4055800	4058800	it can, like, push you,
4058800	4061800	uplift you yourself
4061800	4066800	to become a smarter, greater creator.
4066800	4069800	You know, machine and AI could do the job faster,
4069800	4072800	cheaper, and they don't have strike,
4072800	4076800	and, you know, they don't resist any, like,
4076800	4080800	ridiculous demand from the clients or from the bosses,
4080800	4085800	and I can see that Chinese companies are already,
4085800	4088800	like, using it to replace human labors.
4088800	4091800	So I think this is a very critical moment right now
4091800	4094800	for the creators around the world.
4094800	4097800	So this is something happening,
4097800	4101800	and it's gonna be big in the next three to five years.
4106800	4109800	So for folks like myself who, you know,
4109800	4111800	I've been able to build a life for myself,
4111800	4114800	but I would definitely not say that I'm in the,
4114800	4117800	sort of, like, top tier of the music industry.
4117800	4120800	There's a way that I think we're able to skirt under the radar
4120800	4122800	and continue doing work as we're doing it,
4122800	4125800	because it's so much about experimentation,
4125800	4128800	it's so much about trying out weird things,
4128800	4131800	and AI is so much about averaging.
4131800	4135800	It's the people who are invested in playing
4135800	4138800	in that space of the anomaly and playing with the unexpected,
4138800	4141800	who will, sort of, continue to thrive.
4151800	4153800	The impact of artificial intelligence
4153800	4157800	on our society is far-reaching and complex.
4157800	4159800	How can we regulate a technology
4159800	4161800	that's developing so quickly
4161800	4165800	and whose potential is almost impossible to gauge?
4166800	4168800	The United States is struggling.
4168800	4172800	Here in Washington, the tech industry's influence is huge,
4172800	4175800	and governing majorities are fragile.
4175800	4179800	The fact of the matter is that the U.S. government moves slowly.
4179800	4181800	It is a democracy.
4181800	4184800	That slowness is built into the system.
4184800	4186800	The U.S. government is not supposed to be efficient
4186800	4189800	and not supposed to be able to tackle problems quickly,
4189800	4192800	because a government that is too efficient,
4192800	4195800	you know, can use that against its own citizens, too.
4195800	4198800	I think that we've now reached a state in our society
4198800	4201800	that many philosophers and writers
4201800	4203800	in the 20th century warned about,
4203800	4207800	which is the inability to govern technology
4207800	4210800	due to the increasing pace of change.
4213800	4217800	Well, I certainly would not bet against democracies,
4217800	4220800	but it will be a really tough adjustment period.
4221800	4223800	The first major piece of legislation
4223800	4225800	aimed at regulating artificial intelligence
4225800	4230800	on a far-reaching scale came from the EU, the AI Act.
4231800	4234800	I definitely kind of really admire European Union
4234800	4236800	for being essentially the leader in this space.
4236800	4239800	They took on this kind of regulation very seriously
4239800	4242800	before anyone else really fought seriously all that.
4251800	4254800	Jonas Androulas has come to Brussels.
4256800	4258800	Together with other startup founders,
4258800	4260800	he wants to let politicians know
4260800	4263800	that strong regulation could put smaller European players
4263800	4266800	at a disadvantage compared to the competition
4266800	4268800	in the U.S. and China.
4274800	4277800	Meetings like this are always a bit difficult,
4277800	4279800	because you say your piece,
4279800	4282800	and you never really know what reaction you're going to get.
4282800	4284800	A few new people will listen,
4284800	4286800	and of course it's clear that cooperation
4286800	4289800	within Europe and with Europe is important,
4289800	4293800	but it's always hard to say how much we can achieve here and now.
4308800	4309800	No.
4325800	4326800	Do you have documents?
4326800	4331800	I could just talk. I've prepared something.
4332800	4336800	It's your session. You can decide where you want to sit.
4336800	4354800	So, good afternoon to all of you. I'm pleased to welcome you to the European Parliament to this
4354800	4362800	meeting, an important meeting at the right time. Something that will happen and we already see
4362800	4368800	basically a few steps down the road is like the cloud, like the hyperscalers have done
4368800	4374800	with cloud compute, there will be an infrastructure for general intelligence, that all the value
4374800	4381800	creation, all the apps, all the new innovations in the world will build upon. And for us, there
4381800	4387800	will be no second chance. If we cannot move fast, then we won't be able to try again in 12 months.
4387800	4389800	Thank you very much.
4390800	4393800	APPLAUSE
4408800	4414800	Androulos has repeated his message over and over again, whether on international stages,
4414800	4420800	to German politicians or here at the European Parliament. Over the course of a year, networking
4420800	4423800	and lobbying has become second nature to him.
4428800	4434800	So, I started my career as an investment banker and management consultant, wearing a suit and
4434800	4436800	38 degree weather with no air conditioning.
4444800	4447800	MUSIC
4457800	4461800	I don't think I'd make a good politician. I realize that in my days at Apple.
4464800	4470800	What's the probability of success? Is it worth investing this time? Is it worth fighting this battle?
4470800	4475800	I think so. I think it's a battle worth fighting, but I also have moments when I think that doing
4475800	4477800	something else would be pretty nice.
4486800	4491800	Shortly after his meeting with the European Parliament, it passed the AI Act.
4491800	4494800	MUSIC
4496800	4500800	Ten or even five years down the line, it is this governance structure that will give Europe the
4500800	4505800	ability to deal with the rapid evolution of AI and to reap the most benefits from it.
4505800	4510800	And we have worked first and foremost to ensure our citizens' rights and freedoms are not just
4510800	4516800	respected, but protected and strengthened. We don't want mass surveillance. We don't want social
4516800	4519800	scoring. We don't want predictive policing in the European Union. Full stop.
4528800	4531800	My name is Dragosh Daraque. I'm a member of the European Parliament, representing the
4531800	4536800	Renew Group, the Liberal Group in the European Parliament. I'm a judge by profession. I was
4536800	4542800	also a member of government in Romania, Minister of Digitalization, Minister of Interior, prior
4542800	4543800	to coming to Parliament.
4546800	4552800	AI will play very much into the power balance. Why? Because it drives our economies, but not
4552800	4557800	only. It becomes also a geopolitical factor, both in terms of how warfare is going to look
4557800	4563800	like, but also how this technology will play into many of the processes that will keep
4563800	4569800	one part of the world or the other competitive. And therefore, also the way you write the
4569800	4575800	standards and how those standards become globally accepted standards is very important in that
4575800	4579800	power balance that you mentioned earlier. So we're going to see very soon also, I think,
4579800	4584800	a competition or possible clash in terms of global standards. And that is why we have
4584800	4592800	to take measures to protect our interests and also to make sure that, again, our understanding
4592800	4597800	of the role of technology is one that is shared by as many on the global stage as possible.
4597800	4602800	In renegotiations, Germany, France and Italy lobbied again to soften the rules of the
4602800	4609800	AI Act to protect domestic players like Alpha Alpha from heavy regulation. But in the end,
4609800	4612800	the European Parliament prevailed.
4622800	4626800	In terms of regulation, we're the economy that's leading the way. And there's a concern that
4626800	4634800	that will take too much creativity out of the market. So in Europe, we're better at regulation
4634800	4638800	than at putting technology on the market, unfortunately.
4638800	4644800	The truth is, it's ultimately going to be good for the tech industry as well to be regulated,
4644800	4651800	level playing field. Even seatbelts in cars were viciously opposed by the auto industry at first.
4651800	4658800	But then when we got the law saying all cars have to have seatbelts, they started to sell much more cars.
4682800	4689800	Han Shao has travelled to Shenzhen. In order to keep his team on the same page, the CEO has to visit
4689800	4692800	the various company offices regularly.
4692800	4700800	So you see that there's red letters on the building that is basically our office. But we are not that big.
4700800	4703800	We are just one small room inside that big building.
4704800	4714800	He wants to take his company Gina to the next level. That will require all his employees to pull together
4714800	4716800	as much as possible.
4721800	4723800	I'll just put this down.
4727800	4731800	I brought some waffles. Try them. They're delicious.
4734800	4736800	You have to eat them.
4736800	4738800	You don't eat them.
4740800	4745800	I told them you have to eat now and make a happy face to the camera.
4754800	4759800	When I work at Germany, people are greeting each other like telling jokes,
4759800	4764800	talking random stuff, football match yesterday, all these kind of things.
4764800	4770800	Here is more introvert. The office is more introvert.
4770800	4773800	It's just like different working cultures.
4773800	4777800	Both of them are pretty productive under my weep.
4777800	4791800	I always think that a sequence of small success will make the team stronger
4791800	4794800	and make the team more confident on building things.
4794800	4797800	Because larger success means larger hope.
4797800	4802800	A larger hope could mean larger disappointment.
4803800	4808800	Here in the start-up, everything moves very quickly.
4808800	4810800	Then we become a little bit stressed.
4810800	4815800	We become a little bit nervous because we could lose the advantages
4815800	4819800	against the other competitors, against the market and so on.
4819800	4826800	It's not about what we did. It's about how people perceive us on what we did.
4827800	4834800	In Germany, there is also a team working on releasing a new large-language model.
4834800	4839800	Yesterday, the leaders told me that this model can be ready on Monday,
4839800	4842800	but it has been postponed for many times.
4842800	4845800	I have to see how it goes.
4849800	4853800	In the evening, Han Xiaoh has another meeting with a potential investor.
4854800	4858800	On the way, he calls his technical director to ask whether the launch
4858800	4861800	of the new language model is going as planned.
4867800	4871800	Hey, Wan Nan, your embedding platform has to get into the global best model list.
4871800	4874800	This company won't succeed unless everyone does their best.
4879800	4882800	If you don't get into the top 10, it'll be much more difficult.
4883800	4886800	Who uses a platform that's not in the top 10?
4891800	4894800	You need to think more about these practical things.
4894800	4897800	Is the LinkedIn post done? The Twitter post?
4897800	4899800	There needs to be a strategy here.
4902800	4905800	Okay, that's it. Bye.
4906800	4913800	We want to get into the top 10 model, a leaderboard.
4913800	4919800	Our models get into the top 10, but the German team just told me
4919800	4922800	they probably cannot get into the top 10.
4922800	4930800	That's why I get a little bit intense on my conversation,
4930800	4934800	because I said this is something that we promised to ourselves.
4934800	4938800	In this world, it's a very, very attention-based world.
4938800	4947800	If you cannot get into the top 10, even if you get into number 11, nobody cares.
4947800	4953800	This is why I'm telling the team that it's not about engineering only.
4953800	4958800	You also have to think about the whole company, the marketing sales.
4958800	4964800	It all depends on the top 10 models on this leaderboard.
4989800	4994800	Hi, Grace.
5004800	5008800	Grace Liu works for a Chinese investment bank.
5008800	5014800	The two first met a couple of years ago during the start-up phase of Han Xiaos' company.
5018800	5023800	You're just starting to bring AI-generated content to people, right?
5025800	5029800	Multimodal AI. We're working on two things right now.
5029800	5035800	One is prompt technology, and the other is embedding technology.
5035800	5040800	This year will be quite a challenge for you.
5040800	5045800	We've made a new software with prompt perfect aimed at developers.
5045800	5049800	We've already got 200,000 registered users.
5049800	5053800	Ah, that means there's a lot of demand.
5053800	5057800	I don't think I can jump to my conclusion yet,
5057800	5063800	but Han mentioned something very interesting to me about his new development and two new products.
5063800	5068800	Actually, the most important thing is the CEO, him or herself, right?
5068800	5074800	And whether he is a good entrepreneur, not only a scientist or a good developer.
5074800	5079800	Meetings like this one put opportunities on the table for Han Xiaos' company,
5079800	5081800	both in China and in the West.
5081800	5084800	And there's good news about his important project.
5084800	5090800	The new developer tool performs just as well as the equivalent technology from OpenAI.
5090800	5097800	By the end of 2023, Jonas Androulas has plenty to celebrate.
5097800	5100800	He's completed a major round of financing.
5100800	5106800	The company prevailed and convinced enough investors to raise half a billion dollars.
5106800	5109800	That's money Androulas is going to need,
5109800	5114800	because competitor OpenAI is already triggering a new technology.
5115800	5120800	We did a lot of things that smart people told me.
5120800	5123800	Four years ago, they would be impossible.
5123800	5123880	They signed the contract,
5138880	5140880	But what about technologies?
5140880	5144720	four years ago, they would be impossible.
5144720	5149120	Build deep tech, AIR&D out of Germany, impossible.
5149120	5153280	Fund this with mostly European capital, impossible.
5153280	5157080	Build our own data center, impossible.
5157080	5161180	Contribute category defining research, impossible.
5161180	5163400	And now we are entering into a new era
5163400	5166400	and I'm super happy to have you all with us.
5166400	5168160	Yeah, and thanks for being here
5168160	5170280	and help us make this the best party
5170280	5171880	that Heidelberg has ever seen.
5171880	5172720	Thanks.
5181720	5184320	And for Thomas Wolff, quiet holidays
5184320	5186480	may soon be a thing of the past.
5186480	5190920	Hugging face is now valued at $4.5 billion.
5190920	5194400	Thanks to successful startups and the AI Act,
5194400	5196840	the EU at least has a seat at the table
5196840	5199360	alongside the US and China.
5199360	5203560	For now, for humanity at large, the question remains,
5203560	5205920	what kind of world are we building right now
5205920	5209480	for ourselves and for our children?
5209480	5212160	I was holding my little baby Leo,
5212160	5213960	you know, who just turned nine months old
5215400	5217480	and looking into his eyes and thinking that, you know,
5217480	5221160	right now his language abilities are much worse
5221160	5226160	than chat's GPT-4 and he's never gonna catch up with AI ever.
5227040	5229440	I have two kids that are in middle school
5229440	5230720	and I'm thinking exactly about that,
5230720	5232720	what I should teach them about,
5232720	5236040	so they kind of prepared for the AI-infused future.
5236040	5239480	How do we teach our kids to kind of build something
5239480	5241960	like unique and individual?
5241960	5244560	The machine is our something,
5244560	5248000	it's our brothers or sisters, so we're working together.
5248000	5250720	So I think that's how I feel.
5251320	5254280	Even in these pivotal moments,
5254280	5257960	in these complex times, people always find a way.
5257960	5260160	They're creative and resourceful.
5260160	5262800	My son is already learning to code.
5262800	5264960	He's really interested in AI.
5264960	5268400	He wants to understand things and create things using AI.
5268400	5270440	Our children will probably create a world
5270440	5272840	that's completely different from ours.
5272840	5275600	We have a lot of people who are interested in AI,
5275600	5277400	who are interested in AI,
5277400	5278800	who will probably create a world
5278800	5281120	that's completely different from ours.
5281120	5282800	But I'm not worried.
5282800	5285800	At the end of the day, I'm an optimist.
