 The narrator, who considers himself a "stray dog man," frequently rescues stray dogs he finds beside the road. He cares for them, providing food and love. However, his peaceful life is disrupted by frequent visits from extraterrestrial beings who drop off mysterious gunny sacks in his backyard. These sacks often contain alien creatures that escape and either harm or are consumed by his pets.

The first incident results in the demise of one of his dogs, Fido, after it chases and is eaten by an alien creature from a gunny sack. Subsequent events see more alien creatures arriving in similar fashion, each posing a threat to his dogs. Despite the chaos, he manages to train one of the extraterrestrial beings, which he names Ursa Major, to behave like a dog and integrate into his pack. However, Ursa Major's behavior remains unpredictable, and it even attempts to eat the padlock on a shed.

Eventually, the narrator grows tired of the constant stream of aliens and their creatures wreaking havoc on his dogs. He decides to take matters into his own hands by building a rocket to send these extraterrestrial visitors back from whence they came, in hopes of finally having peace with his canine companions.

The narrator's story is a humorous and whimsical account of the challenges of being a guardian to both earthly dogs and alien creatures, expressing a desire for tranquility amidst the chaos.
