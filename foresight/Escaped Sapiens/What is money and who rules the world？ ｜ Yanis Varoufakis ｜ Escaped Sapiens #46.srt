1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Who really runs the world today?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,880
Is it politicians or multinational banks?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,800
Or is it social media and tech giants?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,000
In this conversation, I speak with economists,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
politician and author Yanis Varoufakis,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,960
who served as the Greek minister of finance

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,680
during the 2015 Greek credit crisis.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
We discuss how economies crash,

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
the winners and losers of bank bailouts,

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
dysfunctions within the EU,

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,040
and the real power that politicians have access to

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
in the face of their political rivals

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
and the rising influence of social media and tech monopolies.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm Shane Farnsworth,

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,560
and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
These conversations are supported

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,240

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,920

And now, here's Yanis Varoufakis.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,640
I hope you enjoy.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
Just to make this more pleasurable though,

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
would you like a little bit of an overview,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
or are you just happy to jump in?

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,040
Let's go straight in.

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's go straight in.

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
Because I was originally going to ask you questions like,

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,040
what's the best place to go?

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
You ask me any questions you want.

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
Just don't give me any advance warning.

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
Feel free to ask anything you want.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,760
I don't mind.

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
So what's the best place to go swimming in Greece then?

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,520
There is a cove on a barren island of the island where I live,

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
which is where I've asked my wife to scatter my ashes

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,160
when I'm done.

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,360
I don't even know what it's called,

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
because it's a barren island.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
There's no name, at least not that I know.

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
For me, that's the spot.

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
But I'm not going to tell you how to find it.

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm not going to give you the coordinates,

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,840
because it's a very well-kept secret.

45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,080
But why?

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
What's the beautiful thing about the island?

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,120
What draws you to it?

48
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, look, we live on an island about a stone's throw from Athens.

49
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,560
And because where we are, it looks to the other side of Athens,

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
so you can't see the aggliness of the cement blocks.

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
And we can see the beautiful mountains of the Peloponnese.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,560
It feels as if we are a very, very long way from civilization.

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,680
But we're not.

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
We're only one hour's ferry, right?

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,040
And then on our little boat, we sail to this tiny island,

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,480
which is 20 minutes away, at 15 knots.

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
And on the other side of the island,

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
there is this little cove with deep blue waters

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
and pine trees coming all the way down to the sea.

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,880
And that's like being a million miles away.

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
And it's the human scale.

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,520
The trees are my height, a bit taller, maybe double my height.

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
The stones, the rocks, the fish, they're all, you know,

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,320
as I said, they're the human scale.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,600
They're no sharks.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,480
They're no cairns.

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
It is just like it was designed by some divinity for us.

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
So that's the best I can do.

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
So when you're dealing with politics and the economy all day,

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
just getting back and being a human.

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
It's all those old ways.

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
I just go there, put some music on, and I am away.

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm in paradise.

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
And also the proximity, the fact that it's so close,

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
I can do this every day almost.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
So let's do it in theory.

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
Well, especially when you're not anywhere and you agree,

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,320
so you can't do it.

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,320
But let's jump into the economy and politics then.

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,320
There's two real questions I want to ask you,

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,760
and they're very basic.

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
I basically want to ask you what money is

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,440
and who holds power in the world.

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
So these are the two questions.

85
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,600
And I thought I'd start off at a very basic level.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,720
You used to be, oh, you've worked as an economics professor.

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,240
And so what I want to know is, in your mind,

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
is economics more like the study of psychology

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,800
or more like, say, physics in your mind?

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Okay, big questions.

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
What's money?

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
The best definition of money I've come across

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
is by Karl Marx.

94
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,040
He defined money as the alienated ability of humankind.

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
I think it's such a poetic and accurate description

96
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
because money, you see, is a bit like in physics,

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
since you are a physicist.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,360
It's a bit like light.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,280
For centuries, there were deep divisions between scientists

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,240
on whether it's a stream of particles or a wave.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
So you had huge disagreements.

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
Newton thought it was particles.

103
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
Maxon thought it was waves.

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
Democracy thought it was particles.

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Pickle thought it was waves.

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,680
Antiline Stein comes on and says, guys, it's both.

107
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,800
Which is very difficult for the human mind

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,760
to wrap itself around the idea that it can be both

109
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,400
two things that are contradictory.

110
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
Now, in physics, you can actually prove these hypotheses.

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
You conduct experiments under controlled conditions,

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
and you can actually prove it.

113
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
Money is very similar in the sense

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
that it's got two different,

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,760
natures that seem absolutely incompatible with one another.

116
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,840
And yet, money is both those things.

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
The equivalent of the particle theory of light for money

118
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,920
is that it is a thing, that money is a thing.

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880
It's a commodity.

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
You have wheat.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,280
You have corn that can be used to eat.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
It can be used to plow the fields.

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
And the form of seeds, that's capital.

124
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
But it can also be used in order to exchange.

125
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,720
So you exchange a pound of corn for a bundle of butter or something.

126
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
So there is a tendency to think of, especially the gold bugs,

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,200
those who believe that money has to be something tangible,

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
like gold, like a metal.

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
It must be substantial.

130
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Not the figment of our imagination, like digital money, or paper money.

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,480
They tend to think of money as a thing, a commodity, a tangible.

132
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,080
And then there is a completely different view,

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,720
that money is nothing more than a transferable form of debt.

134
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
So, you can see that there is a big difference

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,960
so if you look at archaeological evidence, there is plenty of it,

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,200
that money did not emerge as a thing, but it emerged as a form of debt.

137
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:18,000
In Syria, in the Mesopotamia, we have evidence that the first form of widely, widely, widely

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,000
used money, were shards of clay with number zone.

139
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:35,600
And the idea was that the hedgewam, the landlord, the king, the tyrant, whatever,

140
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,840
would use these pieces of clay with number zone

141
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
to pay advanced payment of the wheat, the corn,

142
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,880
that had not already been produced, that would be produced after the harvest, to workers.

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,200
So, workers would go home at the end of each day, every week,

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,040
with one of those pieces of clay, with a number, and that's how numbers were invented.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,640
That's how accounting happened. This is how writing was discovered or invented.

146
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,320
The first instances of writing had to do with these payment systems.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,600
So, if it had the number two, it meant two pounds or ounces or something of wheat was owed to you,

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,640
because you had worked in the fields, so you'd have to wait for it.

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,880
Now, the beauty of it was, of course, that you didn't have to wait to cash it in for wheat.

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,520
You could use these pieces of clay to go to your next-door neighbor and say,

151
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,080
listen, you've got a goat, can I have some of its milk?

152
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,880
And here is a piece of clay that is like a tidal deed to an ounce of wheat in three months' time.

153
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,240
So, what is money? Is it a thing? Is it a promise?

154
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,440
Dead? And the answer is that it is both, in the same way that light is both.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,600
So, that's the best I can do in order to introduce our audience to the complexity of money,

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,640
and why I love the definition of Marx, that it is the alienated ability of humankind.

157
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,920
It's been alienated from us, it's been abstracted,

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,280
but it reflects our ability to do things individually and collectively.

159
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,240
Your second question, I forgot because I'm getting old.

160
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
Well, we'll get into that towards the end of it. So, ultimately, we'll touch on

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
that's where we're going to end up.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,760
Hopefully. We may not, but it depends where we take things.

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,680
So, this abstraction then, this is how I picture money as a shared fiction,

164
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,960
and I guess the next obvious question that I want to ask is,

165
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,400
when our economy crashes, when we go through some turbulent economic times,

166
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,960
what's happening there? Is it that the abstraction is breaking down,

167
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,760
that our shared fiction is breaking, or is something else going on at the lowest level?

168
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, the shared fiction breaks down because promises have been made that cannot be kept.

169
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
That's what's going on. That's what the crisis is.

170
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,960
So, to the extent that the liquidity of an economic system

171
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,760
is a form of debt that is transferable, what's debt? It's a promise.

172
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,600
You give me the pint of milk, and I promise you something at the end of the month,

173
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
some wheat or pounds or sterling or whatever.

174
00:10:49,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Now, in the old epochs, eras, you would have war, you would have pestilence,

175
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,240
you would have bad weather. That was the cause of the crisis really, earthquakes.

176
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:22,640
You didn't have a collapse of economic forces feeding into a kind of domino effect.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,800
There were occasions when poverty or overextending a military effort, kings that

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,280
made too many promises to their people and to their soldiers as to how much loot they would get

179
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,400
if they pursue a war together and then if the war didn't go well, all these promises broke down.

180
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,960
But this was not an endogenous economic crisis. It was not a crisis of the economy. It was a

181
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,920
crisis of politics. It was a crisis of the weather. It was a crisis of a military campaign gone wrong.

182
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,960
It was the advent of capitalism that gave rise to purely economic crisis. The reason for that is

183
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:14,800
there's been a great transformation somewhere around the 18th century when we moved from

184
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:24,000
feudalism to capitalism. Because if you think about it, under feudalism, the order of play

185
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
was rather straightforward. First, you had production. The peasants toiled the land.

186
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,360
They produced goods, agricultural goods. That was the production phase. Production came first.

187
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Second came the distribution phase. The lord would send the sheriff to the peasants,

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:55,360
armed and dangerous. The sheriff would steal a percentage of the harvest on behalf of the landlord.

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,880
It was just pure theft on behalf of legalized theft. That's what feudalism was, right?

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,840
So you had distribution. This second phase, violent phase, at least potentially violent phase,

191
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,480
determined how much of the produce would stay with the peasants, how much would go with the landlord.

192
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,200
And then the third phase was financialization. The landlord could not eat all that stuff.

193
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,240
So the landlord would sell it in rudimentary markets that were marginal to production,

194
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:35,920
but nevertheless important, get cash and use that cash either to arm his soldiers or to build

195
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:44,160
a better castle or to found a church or to lend it. Because the lords were the money lenders as

196
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,080
well, because they were the only ones who had money. So you had production, distribution and

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,280
financialization. In societies like that, it was impossible to have an endogenous economic crisis.

198
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:05,200
But with the advent of capitalism, the transformation, when the peasants were expelled from the land,

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,280
they were replaced by sheep in England, in Scotland, in Wales, because wool was an international

200
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,200
commodity by then, due to the discovery of international trade rules and the creation of

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,760
international trade rules. You have the creation of a working class, which is landless. They've

202
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:31,920
been evicted. They live in slums now, outside the land. The land now is commodified. It is leased

203
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,800
to former peasants or to the sheriff or whoever, who now becomes a proto-capitalist who hires laborers

204
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:48,720
now and pays rent to the landlord. But these proto-capitalists, to make business work,

205
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,600
to start production, first they had to borrow, because they had to pay wages up in upfront,

206
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
so that the workers would not die of hunger, not because they were nice people, but because

207
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
otherwise they wouldn't be able to get them to work. And also they had to pay the landlord

208
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,840
rent before the harvest came in. So suddenly what you have is a complete reversal. It used to be

209
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,560
production, distribution, finance. Now it's finance, distribution, and finally production.

210
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:31,120
And this reversal unleashed tremendous productive powers. Workers were forced to be far more

211
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,080
efficient. The entrepreneurs, the proto-capitalists, because they were struggling themselves to keep

212
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,000
their nose above water, they had to improve efficiency. They had to invest in machinery

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,080
in order to enhance labor productivity, because they were in competition with one another and

214
00:15:50,080 --> 00:16:00,640
anyone who didn't do it simply went bankrupt. So because finance now is at the beginning

215
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,400
of this production process. Finance is the linchpin for this new system called capitalism.

216
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:17,120
Bankers begin to emerge as the liquidity providers of this system, the lubricants,

217
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,000
the lubricators of the system. And the more this system becomes efficient, the greater the cut

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,800
that the bankers retain. So the way I've described this is in a book a few years ago,

219
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:41,920
was to say that it is a bit like bankers had time traveling hands. They would push their hand

220
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,120
through the membrane of the timeline and extract value from the future that has not been created

221
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,800
yet. Bring it to the present to fund the production that will produce the values of the future.

222
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:03,520
And that of course made them central in this chain and allowed them to become very rich.

223
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,360
And the more they lend, the more value they extracted from the future to bring to the present,

224
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,720
the richer they go. But that meant that at some point they extracted so much value from the future

225
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,920
that the present could not be delivered. The present could not repay the future.

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,000
And that's when promises are broken. Debt are issued that cannot be repaid. And when those

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
accumulate at some point, like grains of sand that you lay one on top of the other at some point,

228
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,800
there's going to be an implosion. And that's an economic crisis. At that point,

229
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,320
you have a situation where the alienated ability of humankind is in crisis,

230
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:56,640
it's in a vortex, and you've got unpayable debts. And that's when you have the eradication of debts,

231
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,560
because debts that cannot be paid will not be paid.

232
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:10,240
So in 2008, where we had the bailout of the banks, I want to understand how dirty this

233
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,920
process was. Because if I follow what you're saying, what I understand is happening is that the

234
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,560
banks have a whole bunch of assets that have accumulated that are not good, they're toxic

235
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,480
in some sense, like loans that will never be repaid, this sort of thing. And so then the

236
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,640
central bank steps in and buys them all out at some price. That's sort of, in some sense,

237
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,560
if I understand you putting the hand into the future, I want to understand.

238
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,960
Ah, no, no, it's not the same thing. Because you see, when you put your hand into the future,

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,800
you extract value to bring it in to produce new value. What happened with the central banks was

240
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:55,920
none of that. It was simply printing money to make failed bets all. Not the same thing. There

241
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:05,760
was never any productive benefit from doing this. They salvaged the banks by creating money to replace

242
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,440
their busted flushes, their busted wages, their busted bets.

243
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,520
I guess then the question that I have is, ultimately, who wins and who loses? Who is it

244
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
that's paying to buy out those busted bets, the toxic assets?

245
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,240
Well, it depends on what's happening in the rest of the economy as well. I'm quite relaxed about

246
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,680
you know, forgiving debts and writing them off. You have to do it. As I said, an unpayable debt

247
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,880
will not be paid. So you need to write it off. There are two ways of writing it off. One is to

248
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,720
just write it off. Really, very simple. Say, okay, this IOU is going to be torn up because it

249
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,320
cannot be paid. That, to me, is the honest and uncomplicated way of doing it. But if you want to

250
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:14,000
pretend that the debt is sacred and it will be repaid, then the only way of pretending that an

251
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:26,640
unpayable debt can be repaid is by constantly rolling it over, lending the busted entity,

252
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,800
the failed banker, for instance, money, continue to give him liquidity in the form of, you know,

253
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,880
short-term, medium-term, long-term debt, so as to allow him to pretend that he is honoring the

254
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,640
IOUs that he's issued. Now, again, it really is no skin of my nose whether you excuse him the debt

255
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,480
or whether you roll it over. So the question is, what else is happening, however, around this little

256
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,520
drama? Because the tragedy of 2008 and beyond was that while we had socialism for the bankers,

257
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,800
you know, the central banks were printing state money to give it almost philosophically to the

258
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,240
bankers, they were imposing harsh austerity on the innocence of the people who had not done

259
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,920
nothing wrong and who had not benefited for years and years and years through financialization, through

260
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:37,600
betting on impossible horses in the financial sector. So when you have socialism for the

261
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,160
very few who happen to be the financiers and austerity for everybody else, you end up with a

262
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:51,200
catastrophe that we've experienced over the last ten years, because the financiers get their money,

263
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,600
there is the ethical question as well, right? The people who created the crisis

264
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,040
get power and money. And the people who suffered the crisis and who never benefited from the

265
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,360
makings of the crisis, the many, are suffering austerity, they can't put food on the table.

266
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:22,880
They can't go to sleep at night because they are so surrounded, so much in the clasps of angst

267
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,080
about how they're going to make ends meet by the end of the week. But besides the ethical

268
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:36,000
point, there's a macroeconomic point as well, because the industrialists, the people who benefited

269
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,320
from socialism for the very few for the oligarchy, look at, you know, they have all this money which

270
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,400
is being printed by the central banks and given to them, right? But they're never going to invest it,

271
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,920
because not because they don't want to invest, they would like it, they would like to invest it,

272
00:22:51,920 --> 00:23:00,160
but they look out there and they see the masses, the multitudes being impecunious and finding it

273
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,000
very hard to make ends meet and they think, I'm not going to produce snazzy expensive products

274
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,160
for them, they won't be able to afford it. So if you're Volkswagen in 2009, you're not going to say

275
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,440
I'm going to produce an alternative to a Tesla, an expensive $100,000 electric car,

276
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,040
because who the hell is going to buy it? Look at them. I'll make little golfs with stupid little

277
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:33,360
polluting diesel engines, as I was doing before. I will fake their exhaustive measurements as well

278
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,120
and, you know, make money out of that, out of the little people with, you know, small dirty little

279
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,480
cars that sell to them. So you've got very low levels of investments and that also augurs really

280
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,760
badly for the green transition, because for 13 years we have not invested in the green transition

281
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,480
as we should have and we can see the effects on the environment now. You can see it on electricity,

282
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:09,040
I mean, we have under invested for 13 years. So the tragedy, the crime of the post 2008 period

283
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:17,840
is not just that you have excused those busted wages of the finances and that you have printed

284
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,760
money as if in the context of socialism for the rich to give to them. It's also that the austerity

285
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,640
you've imposed upon people in the European Union, people in the United Kingdom, people in the United

286
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,760
States, I mean, here in this country where the champions were stated, world record record holders

287
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,440
when it came to state, to idiotic austerity, self-defeating austerity. And the result is that

288
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,560
you have very low levels of investment. And when you have very low levels of investment,

289
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,600
what does this mean? It means that demand is low and it means that the only way you can keep

290
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,760
finances in health, in better commerce or alive or zombified, call it what you might, may

291
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,680
is to keep printing money to give to them because they're not going to get it from the

292
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,920
little people because the little people don't have any and because there's no investment to produce

293
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,120
new wells for the bankers to benefit. So for 13 years after 2008, we have had rude health

294
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:26,480
in the financial markets, which was, however, driven by state money that was printed and printed,

295
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,240
to keep the finances, boisterous, while the rest of the economy was shrinking.

296
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,200
So how long can you push this for? There's sort of two questions I want to ask. The first is,

297
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,440
what would you have done instead? What's the alternative? Did you have to inject the money

298
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,880
up to the level of banks or could have you given money to the people who made the,

299
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,040
you know, did you have to inject money at the level of the banks or could have been at the

300
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:05,120
level of the people? And what is the long-term impact if we continue to do quantitative easing

301
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,040
and we continue to give austerity to the people and not the banks?

302
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,640
Well, the first question that came out of your mouth was, how long can this last for? The answer

303
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,880
was until the pandemic, because now it's all collapsing around us. We can see that.

304
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,880
But before I explain why that is happening, let me answer your other question. What could

305
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,000
we have done instead? And I think you already embedded into your question the proper answer.

306
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,440
The first thing you do is, of course, you save the banks because banks are not like other businesses.

307
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,720
If a bike shop shuts down, okay, you don't have bikes. But a bank, for better or for worse,

308
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:00,000
I think for worse, the banks own the payment system. Forget credit. You know, whenever you want to buy

309
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,520
coffee these days or buy a book or go to the movies or whatever, you need to make a payment.

310
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,600
And you make a payment using your debit card or credit card or even some ATM from which you

311
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,840
withdraw money. And that's all owned by the banking system, by the early gobbling of the banksters.

312
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,600
So you need to save those banks. You can't allow the ATMs to shut down and the payment system to

313
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,480
collapse because then you'll have another great depression like we had after 1949.

314
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,320
And only monsters, Nazis and fascists emerge from that. But it's one thing to say you should save

315
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:47,520
the banks. It's quite another to say that you must save the bankers. So what I would have done,

316
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,600
I would have picked up the phone and called them and say, I've got some good news and I've got

317
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,800
some bad news. We will save the bank. That's a good news. The bad news, we're not going to save you.

318
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:04,960
You are out. So shareholders are wiped out. Board of directors are fired.

319
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,040
They are nationalized and they're saved. And this is not buying the sky stuff.

320
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,480
This is precisely what happened in 1998 in South Korea. The Korean state got into the

321
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,440
failed private banks, took them over, drove out the board of directors. I remember I was having

322
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,960
a very intense conversation with the finance minister of South Korea. And I asked him, how did

323
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,800
you do that? Because we are having such difficulty. I mean, you know, bankers are so powerful people.

324
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,240
So powerful people. I mean, they have more powerful than they have more power than us

325
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,480
ministers of finance, you know, they can fire us. He said, well, we'll use them in a very,

326
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,720
very good institution in Korea. He said, what? He said, well, the Marines. I said the Marines in

327
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,440
and had them leave the building at gunpoint. I thought, that's a very good idea.

328
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,840
So they saved the banks and within a year and how they had sold them back to the private sector,

329
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,880
because they were not Marxists, they were left wing lingers like me, but they didn't save the bankers.

330
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:22,160
So the message to bankers was, if you, if you steer your bank onto the rocks,

331
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,440
and it starts sinking, we will save the vessel, but not you. So big.

332
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay, that was number one thing that I would. Can I ask just quick quickly, did that have

333
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,640
a lasting effect? So what happened in 2008 and later on, did Korea have a sort of softer journey

334
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:48,480
as a result of that prior policy? Absolutely. Look at the data Korea had next to no crisis in 2008.

335
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,480
What had happened in 1998 shielded Korea from the vagaries of Wall Street, the city of London,

336
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,360
what's happening in the European Union, come from, from strength to strength.

337
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,920
And it wasn't just South Korea, it was six years before South Korea, it was Scandinavia.

338
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,320
The Scandinavian banks in 1992 went bust, all of them that made some stupid decisions,

339
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,560
and they all went bust, Swedish banks, Danish banks, Norwegian banks, Finnish banks,

340
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,720
and the states back then, they were social democratic back then, no longer, they,

341
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,040
they bailed out the banks, got rid of the bankers, nationalized the banks, and then sold them off

342
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,040
in within two years back to the private sector to different bankers. And they didn't have the same

343
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:49,280
problems in 2008 that the Anglo, the Anglo sphere had, as well as the European Union.

344
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,120
So that's one thing I would do, save the banks, not the bankers. The second thing I would do,

345
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,480
and you already foreshadowed that in your question, if I wanted to boost demand,

346
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,280
I would not give it to the financiers, I wouldn't print money to give to the financiers,

347
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,440
I would give it to the little people. I mean, Donald Trump did it, and then Joe Biden continued

348
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,760
with the checks in the mail too little bit. The Australian government did it in 2009

349
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,160
under Kevin Rudd, and the result was that Australia did not have a recession in 2009,

350
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,280
because every household, you probably recall that, got something between 10,000 and 20,000

351
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Australian dollars. It missed me, unfortunately. I was a little bit annoyed about that.

352
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all my friends got the, yeah.

353
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,200
So, you know, even during the pandemic, when the central bank of Europe was printing,

354
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,720
as if there was no tomorrow, I was warning them, I was saying, you're creating a gigantic bubble

355
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,000
in the real estate, because the money will go from the central bank, the financiers,

356
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,520
from the financiers to their mates, their mates are going to take the stock exchange

357
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,120
or buy flats in Berlin. Asset prices will go through the roof. That will create asset

358
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:15,360
price inflation. That will increase the shortfall, actually reduce further investment,

359
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,480
and that's going to shrink aggregate supply of goods and services. And then at some point,

360
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,240
some of that money will leak into the economy, and there's going to be inflation,

361
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,680
and then you'll be stopped, which is where they are. So the alternative proposition was,

362
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:41,360
why don't you just send some like 500 euros I proposed, or 1,000 years, or 2,000 years,

363
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,680
depending on the length of the pandemic, send it to people's bank accounts. And the most astonishing

364
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,920
answer I got from German colleagues, politicians and bankers and so on, is you can't do that.

365
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:03,280
So why can't you do it? He said, we don't have the know-how. So what? Because our social security

366
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,280
numbers are not connected to our banking system, and therefore technically we cannot even send

367
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,160
them money. We can't do what Trump and Biden did. And I thought, my goodness, this is the state of

368
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:24,240
Europe. The great German efficient state cannot even find its citizens and give them some money.

369
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,560
They can take them, they can't give it. Okay, so this makes me think of something else that

370
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm quite curious about, which is that in Europe, we don't have big tech competitors. So for example,

371
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,360
there's no, you know, French Twitter. There's no, why is it that on these technical grounds,

372
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,760
people seem more competent in the United States? Why is it that you have these,

373
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,760
you know, blossoming tech companies that are missing here?

374
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, the hegemon always produces cutting edge technologies. Before America rose,

375
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:16,400
almost every important technological breakthrough was made in Cambridge, Oxford,

376
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,000
the University College of London, in Britain. Britain was the empire. It produced the technological

377
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,520
advances. Before that, it was Rome. So there's nothing terribly surprising about that.

378
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,440
Size also matters. You have a very large economy in the United States. You've got English.

379
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,800
You've got the size of America. You've got English. So if you were going to start Twitter

380
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,840
in France, it wouldn't really go that far. Twitter went far because from day one,

381
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,640
it was used by us Greeks, by Australians, by the Portuguese and so on and so forth.

382
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,080
And first mover advantage is everything. So once you created Facebook, there can't be another

383
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,800
Facebook even in the United States, even in the United States. If you and I had a much better

384
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:24,720
software for a Facebook competitor, it wouldn't matter because if anyone wants to join

385
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,880
something like Facebook, they will go to where their friends are. So there is the first mover

386
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,760
advantage, which is really very strong. Now, the only country that has developed competitors,

387
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,600
real competitors, substantial competitors, very strong competitors to big tech is China.

388
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:55,680
But that's because there was a political project to do so. They understood really very well that

389
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:04,240
if the whole of the Chinese political economy and society enter Facebook, Twitter,

390
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,360
buy everything from Amazon.com and so on, any possibility of autonomous growth and development

391
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:23,520
in China is gone. Europe never understood that. And we now are in this kind of

392
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,200
semi-war between Europe and America over social media. You've got the European Commission

393
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:39,680
constantly sniping at Twitter, at Facebook, at Google, at Apple, imposing fines. Ms. Westager,

394
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,440
she does well. I mean, she's right on many of the issues that she's got. But as you pointed out,

395
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,800
this is just a defensive war. There is no attempt or capacity of the European Union,

396
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,880
despite the fact that we are more than the Americans put together. We're richer than the

397
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,920
Americans put together. We have a lot of technologies. We cannot bring it together

398
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,720
and create either competitive to Amazon.com or to Alibaba in China.

399
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,160
So with every crisis and every technological advance, Europe falls behind both China and

400
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,240
the United States of America. It still surprises me that you say this because

401
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,360
we had, for example, MySpace, which was taken over by Facebook. And I guess now Facebook shares

402
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,680
are really tumbling in the last weeks. And I guess TikTok is sort of rolling over YouTube.

403
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,920
So there are examples of other tech companies rising up.

404
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,480
Do you think the EU is taking appropriate steps then to break up these monopolies?

405
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:05,200
No. You think they should go further? Or how should they help companies in their own sort

406
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,000
of domain develop competitors? How about having a lobotomy to begin with and start in a fresh

407
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,240
because the situation with the European Union is beyond a joke. They have completely failed

408
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,440
to rise up to the great challenges of the time. And what are the great challenges of the time?

409
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,040
The banking crisis of 2008, the European Union made a complete and utter mess of it. The result

410
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,160
now is that we have 13 years of centrifugal forces tearing the European Union of Art.

411
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,840
And that has never subsided. They just threw a lot of printed money on the problem

412
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,600
under Mario Draghi. But without solving the underlying centrifugal forces that are tearing

413
00:38:49,600 --> 00:39:00,160
us apart. So banking crisis, disaster. Green energy, catastrophe, catastrophe. I mean,

414
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,960
think about it. We have something called the European Union, but we do not have

415
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,360
an energy plan for Europe. Germany has its own plans. And we saw how great those were

416
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:22,800
when put in invaded the Ukraine. France has its own polyonic nuclear based plan.

417
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,520
Half of the nuclear power stations now that they're necessary because the

418
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:36,000
height and price of natural gas are now defunct. They're out of commission. Greece has its own

419
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,600
plan. It's pathetic. I wish we had a European Union. We do not. We have something that

420
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:51,760
pretends to be a union. Artificial intelligence, nothing, zero. There's no plan for artificial

421
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:59,040
intelligence. There are pockets of AI here and there. But nothing like the concentrated

422
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,240
investment on AI that the Japanese have, that the Koreans have, that the Chinese have. Of course,

423
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:15,280
the Americans. You've got a lot of rent seeking in Europe. There is hardly any entrepreneurship

424
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,440
happening. They're all, you know, the big wigs are simply trying to extract whatever value has

425
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:31,040
already been created without producing new value. And we do not have a government. We have a bureaucracy

426
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,400
whose job in Brussels is to behave like the bureaucracy of a cartel. The nearest

427
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,400
parallel analog to the European Union Commission is OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting

428
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,880
Countries. They have a bureaucracy. Their purpose is to coordinate the activities of the different

429
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,560
countries with a view to simply maximizing the extraction of ransom on the rest of the world.

430
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,440
But this can never be the source of innovative thinking about creating new values. It's only

431
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,080
innovative thinking about how to corner existing markets. That's what the European Union Commission

432
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,320
is. And whenever they have a good idea, because there are some good ideas that come out of the

433
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:29,360
commission, since I remember in the 1990s, they've all been vetoed by Berlin, all of them,

434
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,880
every single one of them. In some European Union Council has been vetoed by Berlin. And if not

435
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,800
by Berlin, by one of the 100 maidens of Berlin, because sometimes Berlin doesn't want to be seen

436
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:51,440
to be the bad guy or girl in the case of Berlin. So they asked the Slovak or the Dutch to veto it

437
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,320
on their behalf. So then what does the US have that the EU is lacking? What is it that makes

438
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,600
the US function, which doesn't allow the EU to function a similar way?

439
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:14,080
Common debt, treasury bills. You know the treasury, the US treasury. We have a central bank here in

440
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,120
Europe and they have a central bank. But if you think of how we constructed it, it was as if

441
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:29,840
constructed by morons in order to serve slaves. Because what we did, we created the central bank

442
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:37,040
without a state behind it. There's no state that can have the back of the European central bank.

443
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,080
And you have 19 states, now it's 20 states that use this central bank for the money, but cannot

444
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,800
rely on it in case there's a banking crisis to bail them out. Because by its constitution,

445
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,120
it's not allowed to bail them out. So they had to bend the constitution of the ECB,

446
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,080
the charter of the ECB in order to bail them out. But to do this, they had to get the permission

447
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,880
from Berlin to do it. So it's a catastrophe. It's exactly what Alexander Hamilton in the United

448
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,960
States was trying to avoid and succeeded in avoiding. Situation where you have different

449
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,320
states, different formal colonies, supposedly one country, but without common debt. Common debt is

450
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:30,240
everything. It's what binds states together. What binds the British together is not so much,

451
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:39,920
you know, the Royal Family. It is the bound and the fact that the north of England and the south

452
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,440
of England share the debt, the national debt. That's what gives substance to countries. How long

453
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,480
with languages and traditions and conventions and all that jazz, as they say?

454
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I don't want to sound too conspiratorial. You mentioned the system is created as though by

455
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:10,160
morons. But could it be that it was constructed in this way to force federation further down the

456
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,240
line? Is there some sort of intent behind a system which seems not to work currently in your mind?

457
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:27,280
Look, there were some smart people who thought of the Euro and the European Central Bank in those terms.

458
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,320
And one of them was President Mitterrand of France, François Mitterrand, in the 80s and 90s.

459
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,560
I have done good authority, I've written about this. I put a friend of mine who was in the room

460
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,360
in 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty, which is the foundational treaty of the Euro,

461
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,680
and the European Central Bank, was signed. There was a discussion between the President of France,

462
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,600
François Mitterrand, and the President of the European Commission at the time, Jacques Delors,

463
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,960
who was a friend of Mitterrand and who had been his finance minister many years before,

464
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,880
with a friend of mine in the room. And Jacques Delors, representing the European Commission at

465
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,600
the time, was trying to convince the French president that it is important to have two

466
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:27,520
pylons, two legs for the Eurozone. One should be the Central Bank to guarantee monetary stability,

467
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:35,680
and another one should be something like an investment ministry or a treasury that would

468
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:43,200
borrow on behalf of the whole of the Eurozone area in order to invest, so there would be the

469
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:51,120
stability leg and the growth or development leg, which of course meant a political union.

470
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,280
It meant that if you have a common debt, you have to have common rules, who borrows,

471
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,280
you need to have a common parliament or parliamentary process to approve the common debt.

472
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,280
And François Mitterrand turned around and said what he said. He said, listen, Jacques,

473
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,040
that would be great to do that. We can't do it. We don't have the political clouds to do it at the

474
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:25,680
moment. What we can do is we can create a monetary union, and this is where the old fox, François Mitterrand,

475
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:36,720
proved yet very clear vision of the future. He said, when the next large financial crisis comes,

476
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,280
our successors will have to choose between letting this whole thing collapse or federating

477
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:49,920
or doing what you're suggesting. So this is precisely what you're saying. However,

478
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:58,800
he was wrong. And he was wrong for reasons that a British Cambridge economist

479
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:10,080
had foreseen in 1971, in April 1971, Nicolas Calder was his name, a well-known economist

480
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,520
of the Cambridge tradition, who was actually Eurofiled. He wanted the European Union to come

481
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:22,800
together, and he was writing that paper as somebody who's worried about the future of the

482
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,040
European common market back then, the European Union today. So this is now April 1971, just before,

483
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,320
a few months before the collapse of the Bretton Wood system and the fixed exchange rates, when the

484
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,840
Europeans could see that it was happening, that the exchange rates would no longer be fixed. They

485
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,720
needed the exchange rates to be fixed because the European Union was a cartel. They were trying to

486
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,920
sell, to fix the price of coal, to fix the price of steel, to fix the price of cars. If exchange

487
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,080
rates between France and Germany and Italy and Holland go up and down, it's very difficult to

488
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,120
fix prices. So they needed the fixed exchange rates that the Americans were providing under

489
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,760
the Bretton Woods. And they could see that these fixed exchange rates would blow up. So they were

490
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,960
already planning a common currency or fixed exchange rates in Europe as a prelude to the

491
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,240
Euro back in 1971. And Caldor in the news statement said this. He said it would be a gross mistake.

492
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,680
I don't have his names now, his words in my head to tell you about, but I can assure you,

493
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,920
you can look it up. I've republished that paper as well in my books, in a couple of my books.

494
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:38,960
He said, if we make the mistake of thinking that through a monetary union,

495
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:49,520
we create a stepping stone towards federation. We will have killed off, maybe that was not

496
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,280
the words used. We will have annulled the possibility of a political union. Because he explains,

497
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,000
a monetary union without a political union is like putting the cart before the horses.

498
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,040
A monetary union without a political union in common debt is going to create a gigantic financial

499
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:19,120
crisis by itself. And when it hits, we are going to suffer massive centrifugal forces,

500
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:25,680
politically, socially, at the level of discourse, and the Europeans will not be able to politically

501
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
to unite after that. And I think that this is exactly what happens.

502
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,880
I suppose you're alluding to the rise of sort of right-leaning politicians and...

503
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,120
Not just. After, you know, when the banking crisis happened, it started in Wall Street,

504
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:52,480
as it usually does. Like 1929, it started in 2007, 2008 in Wall Street. Then very soon after that,

505
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,600
we realized that the French and the German banks were kaput, gone. Okay.

506
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,720
A domino effect starts. Once the German and the French banks are bankrupt, they can no longer

507
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,560
roll over the Greek government debt, the Italian government debt, the Irish government debt,

508
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,160
because they were the banks that were lending those dates. And then there is, of course,

509
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:27,680
a feedback loop, because once the front page of newspapers is full of news of the Greek

510
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:34,880
state's bankruptcy, and everybody knows that the Greek state owes 120, 130 billion euros

511
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,880
to the German banks and another 100 to the French banks, then that makes the position

512
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,640
of the French and the German banks even worse. And then what happens is, then politicians start

513
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,800
pointing accusatory fingers at one another. The German politicians are pointing their fingers

514
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,800
at the Greeks. You messed this thing up. It is because you were so spendthrift and because you

515
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,120
sung and played the Buzuki under the sun in the summer and it didn't work. And then the Greeks

516
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,200
turn around and the pointing accusatory fingers at the German in the beginning, you're Nazis.

517
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,600
You've never been anything other than Nazis. That's it. It's finished. At that moment,

518
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,640
you have centrifugal forces at the cultural level, the political level, the ethical level,

519
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:28,400
the every level. And you go now to any German or any Greek, any Dutchman or woman or French person

520
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,000
and say, do you think it's a good idea that we should federate in Europe? They say, bugger off

521
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:43,120
immediately, which would not be the case before 2010. So I think that Nicolas Calder was

522
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:51,040
completely present. So sort of shot ourselves in the foot. I noticed that so in respect for the

523
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:59,840
time, we're going to have to wrap up fairly soon. Can I just ask with a few and with a few quick

524
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:10,800
questions about power? So the main one is who holds the power today? Is it Musk? Is it Biden?

525
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,000
Is it the head of the IMF or Goldman Sachs? Where does power really reside today?

526
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:27,280
The hardest aspect of contemporary society to comprehend

527
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,480
is that we live in a capitalist world or post capitalist world,

528
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,360
where power has been concentrated tremendously

529
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,080
inside the confines of a new form of capital

530
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,400
without any human being, Musk, Biden, whoever, being in command of it.

531
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,760
If you look at Musk on a minute-by-minute basis, if you actually watch him work,

532
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,880
you can see that this is a driven man who's got enormous resources at his disposal,

533
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:21,680
but given his ambition and his different projects, he's very constrained. He feels the pressure.

534
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,320
He doesn't feel like somebody who can do anything. He doesn't feel like God. Similarly, Jeff Bezos,

535
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:34,800
he's got hundreds of billions stashed away in terms of wealth, but he too feels constrained.

536
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,000
So this is a great tragedy and a great paradox. It's like an ancient Greek tragedy.

537
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,400
If you're watching or Shakespeare, if you're watching a Shakespearean play,

538
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:53,440
this is the third. What do you see? You see powerful men on a stage who nevertheless,

539
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,080
their great tragedy is that the more power they have, the more powerless they feel,

540
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,120
and it's the nature of the game which extracts power from the many,

541
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,600
concentrates in the hands of a few who are tragic figures and therefore powerless.

542
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,640
This is how I understand the capitalist post-capitalist system we live in,

543
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,320
and that's why I continue to be a leftist who thinks that capitalism is neither natural nor

544
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,840
pleasant or stable for that matter. In the end, we've created magnificent machines

545
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,840
that had the capacity of being our slaves. I'm a tech enthusiast. I love machinery.

546
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,280
I love technology, but in the end, we become the slaves of the machines, and that is not

547
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,680
simply to say that this is the rich versus the poor. There is, of course, the rich versus the poor.

548
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:53,200
We see this on a daily basis, but in the end, even the rich, even the Elon Musk's of the world,

549
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,800
the Jeff Bezos's of the world, they are also victims of this enslavement of the whole of

550
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:07,600
humanity to our artifacts. A kind of Dr. Frankenstein who created the thing, this capitalist thing,

551
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:16,000
which has taken over and is threatening our very existentialist condition.

552
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,480
Did you also feel that at your core, in the place of the finance minister of Greece,

553
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,320
did you feel that you had less or more power than what you anticipated when you entered the role?

554
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,360
Oh, I had exactly as much power as I had anticipated, precisely zero.

555
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,560
I knew I would have none. I knew I would have none because, remember, the only reason why I was

556
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:46,480
elected was because we had a massive bankruptcy, and I had become the finance minister of the most

557
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,360
bankrupt state in the world after Puerto Rico, maybe. I knew that I wouldn't have any power.

558
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:01,360
The only power I had was the power to say no, not to put my signature on another credit card

559
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:08,080
on behalf of my people. That's why I was so demonized and so despised by the powers that be.

560
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:15,680
They could not believe that I had the audacity not to take their money. Okay, guys.

561
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So let me end by asking you. I mean, you took the job.

562
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,480
I didn't take the job. I mean, you're a moral imperative.

563
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:37,200
Yeah. So let me end by asking, it's actually two questions. How do you decide,

564
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,800
as a Marxist or a socialist, which trenches to die in? So for example, do you buy shares? Do you

565
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:53,680
shop in Amazon? Where do you decide on moral or ethical grounds? No, I'm not going to go down

566
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,040
that path. So that's the first question. And to wrap up, let me answer it because I won't

567
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:05,920
forget it. Firstly, I don't buy shares. I have a natural and antipathy and ideological opposition

568
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,600
to share markets. That's why my last book, which was a science fiction novel and other now,

569
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,400
where I try to imagine a different world, there are no share markets. So no, I don't believe in

570
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,200
horse races. I don't believe in the stock exchange. I hate derivatives. I don't do it.

571
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:32,160
Only, you know, everybody shares indirectly when I can't stop it due to the super valuation fund

572
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,960
buying shares on my behalf without asking me, right? But I would never buy consciously and

573
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:44,800
purposefully shares. Do I buy Amazon.com stuff? Of course I do. Because we live in capitalism.

574
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:52,240
I'm not going to survive if I simply eat and consume products produced under socialist order,

575
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:00,320
which doesn't exist. When do I choose to do something like, for instance, accepting the

576
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:08,480
Ministry of Finance? Well, that election in January 2015 was the election of a political party that

577
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:16,480
had a reason from 4% to almost 40% in two years as a result of a popular rebellion against

578
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:25,120
the dead bondage of whole people. The reason I said yes was because for four years I was

579
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:32,240
criticizing what the parts that we were doing. My proposals, similar to what I was discussing with

580
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:39,920
you about what to do with the banks, what to do with furlough wages, how to empower the many,

581
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,000
these proposals were accepted and embraced by a young man who's going to be prime minister,

582
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,600
very improbable prime minister, because as I said, up until two years before he had 4% of the vote.

583
00:58:53,120 --> 00:59:01,360
And people were eating out of rubbish bins. As a result of this enslavement,

584
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,080
dead bondage, it was like, Greece had become like something like a Victorian workhouse.

585
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:12,960
And I was elected. I didn't think I was going to, you know, affect the transition from capitalism

586
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,320
to socialism or anything stupid like that. I had one task that I wanted to accomplish.

587
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,960
And I was planning to resign the moment that task was accomplished or the moment I realized

588
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,400
I could not accomplish it. And the task was to haircut the Greek debt so that we no longer

589
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,320
took more credit cards on conditions of further austerity that forced more people to eat out of

590
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:43,600
rubbish bins. So that's when, you know, my ethos tells me, do it. This is a job that you should

591
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:52,960
try to do, even if the probability of success is low. So let me finish by just asking you simply

592
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,640
what makes you happy and what makes you look forward to the future? What is it that really

593
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:08,320
drives you and gives you hope? Well, besides being with the people that I love and listening

594
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:16,560
to the music that permits me to forget who I am, for me, good art, good music, good cinema,

595
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,720
must help me forget who I am. But I need to lose myself in this. So when I lose myself in good

596
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,720
stuff, stuff that other talented people have created, I'm at I think at my happiest. That's

597
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:38,080
why I'm married to an artist as well. But more generally, I'll give you the answer that Captain

598
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:43,120
Picard gives in the next generation of Star Trek, which is of course a major source of

599
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,520
philosophical insights for me, because I'm a trekking. I don't know whether you know that.

600
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:59,200
When he's asked, so they find in space in one of the episodes in the very last episode of Season 1,

601
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:07,600
they find some frozen people from the 20th century, industrialists, who froze themselves and had

602
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:14,240
themselves their bodies covered in space in case they're rescued and fixed and cured in the future.

603
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:21,200
Of course, this happens 24th century. And one of these unfrozen businessmen from the 20th century

604
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:28,480
says to Picard, so you have no money here. There are no markets. Everybody gets what

605
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,160
their basic needs covered. So what do you do? What's the point of your existence?

606
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:45,360
And Picard says, my friend, to improve yourself. I think anything that you're doing to improve

607
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:54,240
yourself in a self-motivated way, you play the piano a little bit better. You write a better

608
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:03,680
article, a better book. You learn how to appreciate a beautiful sunset more maturely than you did

609
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,760
the previous day or the previous year. That's the stuff of life.

610
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:16,320
You make the world just that little bit more beautiful. Yanis, it's been an absolute pleasure.

611
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,360
Welcome back anytime. Thanks for coming on. Thank you, Shane. That was fun.
