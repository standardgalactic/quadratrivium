00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
my intuition is that in order to understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live

00:06.560 --> 00:11.520
in a complex world but are only able to perceive real things.

00:14.400 --> 00:22.160
And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into the real world and so on.

00:22.560 --> 00:32.640
But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to approach this problem.

00:32.640 --> 00:38.480
Okay, I just, I don't know enough and I mean, it's a really, really hard question and I wouldn't

00:38.480 --> 00:44.960
even begin to fake it. In the following conversation, I speak with one of the world's most creative

00:44.960 --> 00:49.440
and renowned applied mathematicians, Carl Bender from Washington University.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.960
Carl was also one of my own favorite lecturers. I invited him on the podcast because he has a

00:54.960 --> 01:00.720
unique talent for making complicated mathematical ideas, not just understandable, but conceptually

01:00.720 --> 01:06.000
beautiful. In the following, we discuss the history of imaginary numbers and how they fit

01:06.000 --> 01:11.280
in with reality. We also discuss Carl's interactions with Richard Feynman and his own

01:11.280 --> 01:17.200
research in quantum mechanics. I'm Shane Farnsworth and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast

01:31.040 --> 01:42.560
enjoy. Escape Sapiens. So let's start with some philosophy of mathematics. Is the effectiveness

01:42.560 --> 01:48.560
of mathematics in describing the natural world in some sense unreasonable or mysterious?

01:51.040 --> 02:00.480
Now, that's an interesting question. Mathematics is a subject in itself. It's a contained

02:00.480 --> 02:10.080
subject. It's internally self-consistent or not. The question is, can it be applied

02:10.720 --> 02:16.000
to describe the real world? And that's a very interesting question because it isn't obvious

02:16.000 --> 02:22.800
that mathematics has anything whatsoever to do with the real world. And it's an extraordinarily

02:22.800 --> 02:30.720
amazing thing that it does. And the recognition that mathematics, in some sense, describes

02:30.720 --> 02:36.080
what's going on in the real world, that took centuries for people to become aware of that,

02:36.240 --> 02:44.960
right? I mean, orbital mechanics is a typical example. When you can predict the positions of

02:44.960 --> 02:51.920
the planets or you can predict an eclipse, that's extraordinary because there's no obvious reason

02:51.920 --> 03:01.600
why nature should obey any kind of mathematical formula. So yes, that's a deep question. Why

03:01.600 --> 03:09.840
should mathematics have anything whatsoever to do with reality as we perceive it? And of course,

03:09.840 --> 03:19.120
in a dream, if you can distinguish reality from a dream, but in a dream, you look around and things

03:19.120 --> 03:25.840
are happening without cause. And they do things that are unpredictable. You could be floating in

03:25.840 --> 03:31.200
the air. You could be whizzing through the air and so on. And mathematically, there's absolutely

03:31.200 --> 03:36.720
no possible way to explain that. So what's the difference between dream and reality?

03:36.720 --> 03:45.920
Is mathematics an essential description of reality? I don't know. It appears to be,

03:45.920 --> 03:58.320
of course, and people have been able to predict mathematical consequences and observe them in

03:58.400 --> 04:09.600
reality with incredible precision. So the bottom line is that mathematics appears to be a complete

04:09.600 --> 04:15.600
and total description of what happens in the real world. But I have no idea why.

04:18.880 --> 04:27.920
I don't have a deep explanation of why. I mean, I can walk into the laboratory

04:27.920 --> 04:34.080
and show you experiment after experiment where I make a prediction about what's going to happen

04:34.080 --> 04:38.560
and measure it with great precision. And what I predicted really happens.

04:40.320 --> 04:46.160
But I can't give you a deep, deep reason why it should.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Do you think there might come day where we hit a limit? So for example, at the moment,

04:52.000 --> 04:57.200
we're trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity. And that's the biggest, I suppose,

04:57.200 --> 05:00.800
most difficult question that physicists are currently working with. And here I'm thinking

05:00.800 --> 05:04.880
along the line of Goethe's theorem or something like this. Do you think there's going to come a

05:04.880 --> 05:09.360
time when really everything breaks down and we can't go any further?

05:11.200 --> 05:24.480
Actually, yes, I do. Yes, I do. There are now amazing experiments where you can measure

05:24.480 --> 05:30.320
extraordinarily short times, phenomena happening on extraordinarily short times.

05:30.320 --> 05:36.240
But if it happens on a short enough time, then quantum mechanics comes into play.

05:37.360 --> 05:46.560
And if we're talking about times of order 10 to the minus 20 seconds,

05:46.560 --> 05:56.160
how does a particle move over a time scale that short? And it isn't at all clear.

05:56.960 --> 06:03.920
That is, if you are making measurements of a millionth of a second, now you're still talking

06:03.920 --> 06:15.600
about motion on the distance scale, say, of a bacterium or something. But when you're talking

06:15.680 --> 06:21.840
about 10 to the minus, that's 10 to the minus six. But when you get down to 10 to the minus 20,

06:21.840 --> 06:28.720
the uncertainty principle comes into play. It's not at all clear what is happening.

06:28.720 --> 06:36.080
It may actually look like a fantasy world on that kind of a time scale. So you ask,

06:36.080 --> 06:47.440
will mathematics continue to apply forever? I have my doubts. At very, very short time scales,

06:47.440 --> 06:54.880
things may just look like a soup and they may be undescribable. That's a very interesting question.

06:56.560 --> 07:02.000
Do you think perhaps in those cases, it could be the case that we just need a different set of

07:02.880 --> 07:06.800
mathematics doesn't break down, but we're just using the wrong axioms, but potentially.

07:07.360 --> 07:20.400
I have no idea. It could be that in extreme physical cases, the current theories of physics,

07:20.400 --> 07:27.120
how physics works, may no longer be valid. And it's conceivable that there's a new physics

07:27.120 --> 07:36.480
that happens at a micromicroscopic level, very, very short times, very short space distances.

07:39.360 --> 07:47.600
But maybe it just is sort of looking at a bowl of jello and that what we're seeing

07:47.600 --> 07:53.840
is in some sense an average of all of these microscopic things all happening together.

07:58.080 --> 08:05.440
That could be. That could be. It's not at all, I wouldn't even guess what's going to happen

08:06.640 --> 08:13.440
as you make finer and finer measurements. That's a really good question. I just have

08:13.440 --> 08:20.640
absolutely no idea. I don't even know whether I should formulate an opinion because it's not

08:20.720 --> 08:27.680
based on anything. But it is clear that there are many things that happen,

08:28.880 --> 08:37.200
and already it's very hard to describe the process. When a particle tunnels,

08:39.200 --> 08:49.840
what is happening while it's tunneling? Where is the particle? You make up a word

08:49.920 --> 08:53.680
if you're a physicist to cover up the fact that you don't understand.

08:54.880 --> 09:01.280
Like dark matter or dark energy. That's right. And in this case, when a particle is tunneling,

09:02.960 --> 09:07.760
you call it a virtual particle, but that doesn't explain anything. It's just a word.

09:10.160 --> 09:19.680
So the question is, how does, if there's a potential hill, the particle strikes the hill,

09:19.760 --> 09:24.640
classically it would bounce back. Quantum mechanically, every once in a while,

09:24.640 --> 09:32.160
the particle goes through whatever that means and reappears on the other side and keeps going.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.680
But then here it seems like this is not a case that fits what we're talking about exactly,

09:39.680 --> 09:46.240
right? Because we can predict to extraordinarily high precision the tunneling rate, for instance.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.920
So that seems to be something that does fit within the realms of what mathematics can describe.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.400
That's right. That's a quantity that you can

09:57.760 --> 10:05.840
calculate, such as the tunneling time. However, you cannot predict whether or not a given particle

10:05.840 --> 10:19.040
is going to tunnel. And if it does, while it's tunneling, so we have this vision of continuity.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.600
We live in a world where things are continuous. So if I throw a baseball,

10:24.800 --> 10:32.640
that baseball is always visible to me. And it's moving in a continuous way through a medium.

10:33.600 --> 10:41.120
Okay? But when a particle tunnels, you can't say where the particle is as it's tunneling.

10:41.120 --> 10:48.320
So I lose sight of the particle on one side of a potential hill. And then I see it again on the

10:48.320 --> 10:54.480
other side. And I don't even know if it's the same particle. If it's an elementary particle,

10:55.040 --> 11:02.720
if an electron strikes a potential barrier, and an electron comes out the other side,

11:02.720 --> 11:11.040
is it the same? Or is it a different electron? And where was the electron as it went from one side

11:11.040 --> 11:19.760
to the other? Okay? And so we have this, in our world, we see things happening continuously.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.400
We don't pick up a rock and throw it. It disappears from view, and then it reappears,

11:24.960 --> 11:32.400
you know, 10 feet later. It doesn't do that. But in quantum mechanics, it seems to. Okay? Now,

11:32.400 --> 11:39.200
I would argue that that thing, that tunneling object, that tunneling particle, is actually going

11:39.200 --> 11:47.120
through the complex plane. But that may just be a mathematical description of this tunneling phenomenon.

11:47.840 --> 11:52.720
This might be a good point, I think, to jump in. Because the complex numbers are going to be

11:53.280 --> 11:59.760
appearing throughout the discussion, it might be a good opportunity to introduce them. For the

11:59.760 --> 12:05.520
person who has no physics background, no mathematics background, are you able to describe,

12:06.480 --> 12:12.880
I can remind you of the list, but what are imaginary numbers? What are complex numbers?

12:13.840 --> 12:23.840
And how do we first come up with them? Right. So when numbers were first invented,

12:24.640 --> 12:33.440
that is, you know, you were counting your toes or counting your fingers, it's clear that even

12:33.520 --> 12:46.000
some animals understand small integers, one, two, three, four. Okay? But it eventually became

12:46.000 --> 12:52.400
clear that there were other numbers, because you could add one, one, and get another number.

12:53.120 --> 13:00.320
But if you subtracted one from one, you got a new number, which was zero. And it took a while

13:00.960 --> 13:11.760
to to absorb the fact that zero is also a number. Okay? But it wasn't what we're not done yet,

13:11.760 --> 13:18.320
because although there's no problem with addition now, you know, if you start with one number and

13:18.320 --> 13:25.120
add it to another number, you get a third number, no problem. One plus two equals three, and three is

13:25.200 --> 13:35.360
a positive integer. But now subtraction gives us a problem. Okay, because two minus one is one.

13:36.320 --> 13:46.000
And that's fine. But one minus two, what do we mean by that? Okay. And so we need to append

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
the negative integers, just because we understand that we can subtract as well as add.

13:52.960 --> 13:59.680
Okay, I can give something away, as well as taking something in. Okay, now multiplication is fine.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.680
Also, I can multiply, I can say two sets of five is 10.

14:07.920 --> 14:14.480
But division again, gives me a problem. So just the way the inverse of addition,

14:14.480 --> 14:19.600
which is subtraction, gave me a problem. The inverse of multiplication, which is division,

14:20.480 --> 14:26.960
leads to a new problem. Okay, what is two divided by three? And that's no longer a number. And I'm

14:26.960 --> 14:35.520
forced to append the rational numbers. Okay, so every time I have a new mathematical operation,

14:36.560 --> 14:42.720
I may have to extend the number system. And this is worrying, because I may think of an

14:42.720 --> 14:48.320
operation and then have to make the number system bigger and bigger and bigger. So for example,

14:48.320 --> 14:57.600
the operation of taking a square root. Okay, so if I take the square root of four, I get two.

14:58.240 --> 15:05.280
And if I take the square root of nine, I get three. But if I take the square root of two,

15:07.280 --> 15:15.760
it isn't a fraction. It isn't a rational number. Okay, so I have to append a new set of numbers

15:15.760 --> 15:23.360
called irrational numbers. And then of course, I can take other roots, I can take third cube roots,

15:24.080 --> 15:32.720
fourth roots, fifth roots, and so on. And these, fortunately, don't generate new kinds of numbers.

15:32.720 --> 15:38.720
But we have both rational numbers. And now we have irrational numbers. And eventually,

15:38.800 --> 15:46.480
we have transcendental numbers. Okay, these are new kinds of irrational numbers, like pi.

15:48.400 --> 15:56.880
Okay. But we're not done yet. And this is the really interesting case.

15:58.400 --> 16:05.120
One kind of mathematical operation is to solve an equation. So I can write down an equation

16:05.440 --> 16:17.680
like x squared equals one. And I can say, what's x? And the solution is either plus one or minus one.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.440
And you come to realize that if you have an equation that contains a square, there are two answers,

16:24.400 --> 16:32.720
which might happen to be the same. But they're not more than two. And if I have a cubic equation,

16:32.720 --> 16:41.280
there are three answers. But so I have a new mathematical operation called solving an equation.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.760
But what about the equation x squared equals minus one?

16:48.320 --> 16:59.120
Okay, so what number when you square it gives minus one? And it was recognized very early

16:59.120 --> 17:02.480
that there must either we can't write down that equation.

17:04.240 --> 17:09.280
Or if we want to be able to solve the equation, we have to invent a new number.

17:10.480 --> 17:17.760
And this is a very strange number. And it's called I for imaginary. Okay. And I is a number

17:18.560 --> 17:26.320
by definition, whose property is as one property that I squared is minus one.

17:27.280 --> 17:33.200
And so I can solve the equation x squared equals minus one by inventing one new number,

17:33.200 --> 17:44.240
just one. Okay. And now we have to, it took a long time to agree that I is a number.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.840
Because it doesn't look like other numbers. Okay, it's imaginary. But it was accepted after a while.

17:54.800 --> 18:01.200
But the first, and it was recognized that when you write down a quadratic equation,

18:01.200 --> 18:12.400
like x squared equals minus one, a root can be imaginary. Okay, or it can be complex,

18:12.400 --> 18:20.880
that is, it can be a combination of a real number like three, and an imaginary number like say six i.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.840
Okay, so that we'll call, we'll call that a complex number. Okay. But now we're not done.

18:33.600 --> 18:45.520
Because now a miracle happens. Okay. This was back in the 1500s, or somewhere around 1535 or 1540.

18:45.760 --> 19:01.120
So imaginary numbers were already being accepted. Okay. But Cardano realized that you could have,

19:02.880 --> 19:12.080
you could write down a cubic equation. And once again, not all the roots of a cubic algebraic

19:12.080 --> 19:22.640
equation can be, it's not obvious whether or not those roots that are not real,

19:23.840 --> 19:30.480
are also complex in the sense that those roots are combinations of a real number and an imaginary

19:30.480 --> 19:39.200
number. They may be, they may require a new number yet. And the miracle is, they don't.

19:39.680 --> 19:46.800
And that's an amazing fact. Okay. It's, it's amazing. Now, he was very interested in cubic

19:46.800 --> 19:55.200
equations. And, and he spent his life thinking about it many, many years. And he understood it.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.880
He came up with a cubic formula, like the quadratic formula that you learn in high school.

20:01.440 --> 20:14.880
And then later on, shortly thereafter, it became clear that higher degree equations, like

20:14.880 --> 20:23.040
quartic equations and so on, don't have, don't require new numbers. In other words, it appears

20:23.680 --> 20:33.200
as if you have filled out the number system. And there aren't any ways of generating new kinds of

20:33.200 --> 20:42.960
numbers. Okay. Now there are new kinds of mathematical systems. Okay. There are systems of matrices

20:42.960 --> 20:51.120
and so on. But in terms of numbers, just numbers, and I'll say what, what I mean by that in a second.

20:51.840 --> 21:02.400
Um, but the, that these numbers are now complete. But the real numbers, which includes the positive

21:02.400 --> 21:09.360
numbers, the negative numbers, the irrational and irrational numbers. And then this, those real

21:09.360 --> 21:18.160
numbers multiplied by I together. So A plus I times B, where A and B are real numbers.

21:19.120 --> 21:28.320
Those numbers fill out the complex number system. And it's remarkable that there aren't any operations

21:29.360 --> 21:38.160
that force us to bring in new kinds of numbers. There are new kinds of number systems that exist

21:38.160 --> 21:45.360
with, with, with even more advanced kinds of numbers belonging to those systems. But this system

21:45.360 --> 21:53.520
is complete. And this is a beautiful, beautiful result. And the complex number system

21:55.040 --> 22:01.840
needs to be there. Okay. It has to be there because what is happening

22:02.640 --> 22:08.080
in the, in the complex, in the system of complex numbers is connected to what is happening

22:08.960 --> 22:16.320
just on the real, just for the real numbers, we would say on the real axis. So the real numbers

22:16.320 --> 22:23.440
are on a number line, a one-dimensional number line. The complex numbers lie in a plane. This is

22:23.440 --> 22:30.960
the imaginary direction, the I direction. This is the real direction. Okay. And any point in the

22:30.960 --> 22:39.760
plane has the form A plus I times B. A is how far you are in this direction. B is how far you

22:39.760 --> 22:46.800
are in the imaginary direction. And you multiply that by I to keep track of that. So A plus I,

22:46.800 --> 22:54.960
B is a point in the complex plane. In order to describe, to understand what is happening with

22:54.960 --> 23:02.080
the real numbers, you need to know what is happening in the complex plane. There are all kinds of

23:05.680 --> 23:12.480
phenomena that cannot be simply described just in terms of real numbers. And that's remarkable.

23:14.240 --> 23:20.480
Could you give an intuitive picture of how these are actually used in engineering and science?

23:21.280 --> 23:24.160
So what sort of scenarios arise where you might need them?

23:25.200 --> 23:36.080
Well, first of all, in mathematics. Okay. So if you take the function one over one plus x square,

23:37.600 --> 23:47.120
okay, one divided by one plus x squared, if you plot that function, it is a very smooth

23:47.200 --> 23:57.680
function on the real axis. So a kid in junior high school can make a plot of the function

23:57.680 --> 24:06.400
one over one plus x squared. The plot looks like this. It has a nice smooth bump in the middle.

24:07.040 --> 24:11.120
It falls off to zero as you go off to infinity. Could it be smoother?

24:11.680 --> 24:19.600
Okay. And if you know calculus, this function can be infinitely differentiated.

24:20.560 --> 24:29.200
So it can be differentiated an infinite number of times. It has no discontinuities. It is perfectly

24:29.200 --> 24:40.800
smooth. However, if you expand this function in a series, just by expanding it in a geometric

24:40.800 --> 24:47.680
series, you know, one over one plus x squared is equal to one minus x squared plus x to the fourth

24:47.680 --> 24:59.680
minus x to the sixth and so on. That series diverges if x is bigger than is one or more.

25:00.560 --> 25:10.400
Why? Why does the series diverge? Is it one over one minus x squared?

25:12.960 --> 25:20.480
No, that has a place where it's infinite. One over one minus x squared becomes infinite

25:20.480 --> 25:27.040
when x is plus or minus one. So you could say, oh, I know why the series for that function diverges

25:27.040 --> 25:34.720
is because the function becomes infinite. Okay. So the series for that function converges until

25:34.720 --> 25:42.720
the function becomes infinite. Okay. I can buy that. But what about one over one plus x squared?

25:42.720 --> 25:51.040
That function is perfectly smooth. It doesn't ever become infinite. And yet the series that

25:51.040 --> 26:00.240
represents that function ceases to converge. It becomes infinite when x equals one or when x equals

26:00.240 --> 26:10.080
minus one. Why is that? And the answer is that there are places where that function does become

26:10.080 --> 26:16.720
infinite, but not on the real axis. It becomes infinite in the complex plane. And in the complex

26:16.800 --> 26:25.120
plane, it becomes infinite at x equals i and x equals minus i. And that's because i squared is minus

26:25.120 --> 26:34.080
one. So one over one plus x squared becomes one over zero. And so it blows up. So the function

26:35.040 --> 26:46.480
is becomes singular. That means infinite in the complex plane. But the fact that it is

26:46.480 --> 26:51.680
infinite in the complex plane, one unit away from the origin in the vertical direction,

26:52.480 --> 26:58.320
apparently affects what is happening one unit away in the horizontal direction.

26:59.040 --> 27:08.400
That is incredible. So what is happening on the real axis is controlled by what is happening in

27:08.400 --> 27:18.720
the complex plane. So there is a connection. So we live on the real axis. Everything that we

27:18.720 --> 27:26.560
perceive is real. When you look in your wallet, you have a real number of dollars. Okay.

27:27.280 --> 27:38.640
When you measure your IQ, it's real. Okay. When you measure a quantity of anything, you count it

27:38.640 --> 27:47.680
in terms of real numbers. And indeed, if you ask how many spoonfuls are there in this container here,

27:48.480 --> 27:59.280
it may be a rational number, but it's a real rational number. Okay. But the complex numbers

27:59.280 --> 28:06.400
do affect how the real numbers behave and how operations on the real numbers

28:07.040 --> 28:13.760
are performed and how effective they are. Okay. So when you represent a function by a series,

28:14.640 --> 28:22.400
that series may cease to converge. And when it does, the explanation has to do with what's going

28:22.400 --> 28:39.440
on in the complex plane. Okay. And there are interesting physical examples of how the complex

28:39.440 --> 28:50.960
plane is affecting the physical behavior of objects. Okay. So that's quite subtle and quite

28:50.960 --> 29:01.920
interesting. And we can see it even in elementary, we don't have to go to quantum mechanics to see

29:02.640 --> 29:13.040
problems like this. We can see it in the case of classical mechanics, just simple classical

29:13.040 --> 29:20.160
motion. We can see things that are happening that are very hard to explain with real numbers alone.

29:20.960 --> 29:31.760
But there are also real problems that we cannot understand without using complex numbers.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.600
So if a student who is just learning about imaginary numbers came to you and asked,

29:39.040 --> 29:44.640
are these things real? Or are they just a mathematical trick? I suppose then your answer

29:44.640 --> 29:50.240
would be, we can measure it, right? We can go ahead and there are functions that we can calculate

29:50.240 --> 29:55.360
and they behave the way they do only because of the existence of the imaginary numbers and

29:55.360 --> 30:00.000
their behavior can only be explained by the existence of the complex numbers. So in that sense,

30:00.640 --> 30:05.200
there is real as real numbers. There is measurable as real numbers.

30:05.200 --> 30:11.520
What I'm arguing is that the complex plane is not just a beautiful mathematical construct,

30:12.400 --> 30:21.680
but starting in the 1920s, which is very late, people began to realize that the complex plane

30:22.320 --> 30:30.560
is necessary to describe some physical processes, namely microscopic physical processes.

30:30.560 --> 30:38.400
Macroscopic physical processes don't seem to require the complex plane, although

30:39.120 --> 30:46.480
complex mathematics is very useful in understanding equations. So you understand,

30:46.480 --> 30:57.840
so all of the classical theories like classical mechanics, astronomical motion, orbital motion,

30:57.840 --> 31:05.920
and so on, fluid dynamics, electricity, those are 19th century theories.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.640
I mean, we're developed to a very high level by the 19th century and even in the 20th century,

31:16.640 --> 31:24.160
relativity, special relativity and general relativity, gravity, don't seem to require

31:24.560 --> 31:35.760
complex numbers. In fact, later on, it was discovered that they do, but before the 1920s,

31:35.760 --> 31:45.280
nobody had any idea that you were required to use the number I. But even in special relativity,

31:45.280 --> 31:56.000
you do need to use the number I, and I can talk about that later. But what I'm saying is that

31:57.920 --> 32:04.640
you can't avoid it. The complex number system is actually, I was going to say really,

32:04.640 --> 32:13.680
but I shouldn't do that. That's a pun. It's actually present and determines not just the

32:13.760 --> 32:20.800
behavior of mathematics, real mathematics, but it determines the behavior of real physics that

32:20.800 --> 32:28.560
we are measuring. And that is what quantum mechanics does. So one scenario that immediately

32:28.560 --> 32:36.080
pops into my mind is electrons bound in an atom, right? When you first learn about quantum mechanics,

32:36.080 --> 32:41.760
we learned that electrons can't take any sort of energy with inside the atom, but they exist

32:41.760 --> 32:47.680
in sort of quantized states, and that they transition between these states. Do you have

32:47.680 --> 32:53.280
a picture for what happens as they're transitioning between the states? Is that similar, where there's

32:53.280 --> 33:03.760
sort of a complex space in which they travel through? Yeah. So a long time ago, when I

33:03.760 --> 33:13.600
wrote my thesis, I began to realize that this picture that we have of what you're describing

33:13.600 --> 33:24.000
is the quantum mechanics that was being developed in the 1920s and later in the 1930s. And we say

33:24.960 --> 33:32.800
that a particle in a potential, so this time it's a right-side-up potential,

33:34.480 --> 33:41.280
so if you had a classical particle in a right-side-up potential,

33:42.320 --> 33:49.120
it would be a particle that's rolling back and forth in a potential hill. And

33:49.760 --> 33:56.960
classically, you would say you can give this particle any amount of energy that you like,

33:59.280 --> 34:06.800
but quantum mechanically, we learn that only discrete energy levels are allowed.

34:08.240 --> 34:14.000
Could I stop you just for one second? So there will be lots of people who don't understand the

34:14.000 --> 34:18.400
connection between the potential and the atom scenario, where you have an electron that's

34:18.880 --> 34:22.560
bound. Could you just say a few words there for just to clarify for some people?

34:22.560 --> 34:34.080
Right. So a potential is described using units of energy. So in general, a particle has a certain

34:34.080 --> 34:40.960
amount of energy. It has kinetic energy, which is energy of motion. If it's moving faster,

34:40.960 --> 34:48.080
it has more energy. And it also has potential energy. So if it is subject to forces,

34:48.080 --> 34:54.960
such as the force of gravity, a particle, if you raise it up, has more potential,

34:55.840 --> 35:01.840
because it's higher up in the gravitational field. So it's not moving, but it has more energy.

35:06.960 --> 35:13.040
If a particle is moving in a gravitational field, some of the energy of the particle is

35:13.920 --> 35:19.360
the energy of the motion called kinetic energy. And some of the energy is potential energy,

35:19.360 --> 35:26.560
which means how high the particle is. If the particle goes lower, it will be going faster.

35:27.680 --> 35:32.880
And if it's higher, it will be going slower. If you throw a ball up into the air, at first it's

35:32.880 --> 35:38.560
going fast. It then goes higher and higher and higher. And some of its energy, its energy of

35:38.560 --> 35:47.600
motion becomes potential energy. And that potential energy is being stored in that particle.

35:49.040 --> 35:54.880
Eventually, it may stop and then start falling down again. And as it falls,

35:54.880 --> 36:03.120
it loses potential energy, but it gains kinetic energy. In an atom, you don't have gravity,

36:03.120 --> 36:11.440
but you have electrical forces that are holding the electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.

36:13.040 --> 36:21.200
If you think of this as a classical system, you might think of it as a solar system, where the

36:22.160 --> 36:29.200
planets that are far from the, all the planets are held together by the force of the sun,

36:29.200 --> 36:34.720
the gravitational force. The planets close to the sun are moving very quickly. The planets far

36:34.720 --> 36:46.800
from the sun are moving slowly, but they have a lot more potential energy. So if you think of an atom

36:46.800 --> 36:53.520
that way, which means classically, you would say, I can put a planet in any orbit I like.

36:54.160 --> 37:05.200
It could be at a radius of 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, 7.9 miles. It doesn't matter, okay, but

37:08.640 --> 37:14.480
quantum mechanically, that's not what happens. It's very interesting that planets,

37:16.640 --> 37:22.240
which are acting classically, can be any distance from the sun and they can have any amount of

37:22.240 --> 37:34.480
energy you want them to have. But in an atom, an electron can only be, can only have a given

37:34.480 --> 37:41.600
amount of energy and that can be demonstrated in the laboratory, okay. So the naive picture,

37:41.600 --> 37:47.360
if you want to think of the electrons as being, as moving in a real

37:47.760 --> 37:55.840
sense, that is, you know, moving about back and forth inside the atom, you have some sort of

37:55.840 --> 38:01.440
fog of electrons that are moving around. You don't know where any of the electrons are,

38:02.720 --> 38:09.760
but a given electron cannot have, is not allowed to have any amount of energy at once.

38:10.160 --> 38:20.480
I can't do that. It has discrete energy levels and these are called, these are called energy

38:20.480 --> 38:26.160
levels or states and the electron can be in a state of this much energy, this much energy,

38:26.160 --> 38:32.240
this much energy, and so on. Okay, those are energy levels and you can see those energy levels

38:32.240 --> 38:40.240
when, when you allow the atom to interact with light and you can see, you know, when you look at

38:40.240 --> 38:46.240
a spec, you do a spectral analysis, you can see the specific energy levels, okay, they're very

38:46.240 --> 38:53.200
visible. Okay, now, and furthermore, you can predict them mathematically. But what is very

38:54.160 --> 39:01.280
very interesting is that the picture is more complicated than that. So, you can,

39:02.160 --> 39:08.480
instead of studying the atom on the real axis, you can study the atom in the complex plane.

39:10.720 --> 39:18.320
And in the complex plane, you can see that the electron is moving in a certain direction,

39:18.400 --> 39:29.760
in the complex plane. And in the complex plane, the, the possible energies for the electron

39:30.640 --> 39:39.440
are continuous. They're not discrete. Okay, that's an amazing result. This is

39:40.400 --> 39:46.000
the work that I did in my thesis, in fact, a long time ago. And

39:48.000 --> 39:57.280
so why is it that they look discrete? And that's because we live on the real axis. And so when

39:57.280 --> 40:06.000
we see an electron, it can only have this much energy, this much energy, and so on. But, but

40:06.320 --> 40:16.080
in the complex plane, the electron can move, can have any energy, as it moves off into the complex

40:16.080 --> 40:23.600
plane. But when it crosses the real axis, it can only have these discrete energies. So what

40:23.600 --> 40:29.600
with continuous is actually, what, what is discrete is actually at a higher level at the

40:29.680 --> 40:36.400
higher level at the complex level is actually now continuous. The way I describe this, if I'm giving

40:36.400 --> 40:44.640
a lecture on this, is I say, imagine a parking garage. Okay, you enter the parking garage,

40:46.160 --> 40:53.840
and you see that the parking garage has distinct levels, it may be the five level parking garage,

40:53.840 --> 41:02.080
you drive into it. But in fact, you can continuously drive from one level to the next to the next to

41:02.080 --> 41:09.680
the next. Okay, but if you were to take a gigantic saw, and cut the parking garage, cut right through

41:09.680 --> 41:16.400
the parking garage and pull it apart, what you would see is discrete levels. But the complex

41:16.400 --> 41:23.440
plane says that there's something much more sophisticated going on. And that the levels

41:23.920 --> 41:30.000
in this parking garage are continuous. Okay, and you can go continuously

41:30.000 --> 41:35.600
from one level to the next to the next, just by moving through the complex plane.

41:35.600 --> 41:40.240
And does the dynamics in the complex plane also work, the calculations you can do?

41:40.240 --> 41:46.880
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. You can look at the motion as the particles are traveling in the

41:46.880 --> 41:56.000
complex plane. And if you want to understand motion on the real axis, you look at the limit

41:56.640 --> 42:03.200
as you approach the real axis. And the complex motion is very complicated. But as you approach

42:03.200 --> 42:08.960
the real axis, it becomes recognizable as what we know and love. You know, what happens when you

42:09.040 --> 42:15.840
throw a baseball. Okay, but in the complex plane, you have more interesting motion.

42:17.840 --> 42:22.640
So famously, quantum mechanics has a number of different interpretations. There's sort of the

42:22.640 --> 42:27.920
Copenhagen interpretation and pilot wave interpretations, many worlds and so on. Does

42:27.920 --> 42:35.280
this shed, does this sort of idea shed any light on which of these interpretations may be correct?

42:35.280 --> 42:41.200
Or are you able to say something deeper because of this insight, this analytic continuation?

42:42.400 --> 42:52.160
So when I was a graduate student, and I was getting ready to begin my thesis work,

42:53.440 --> 43:04.080
you have to take a qualifying exam to demonstrate that you are qualified. You've successfully

43:06.080 --> 43:16.080
passed all of your required courses to go on to a PhD, to write a PhD thesis that you've sufficiently

43:16.080 --> 43:22.160
mastered what you've learned in your courses. This is a qualifying exam and it can be a very

43:22.160 --> 43:27.600
difficult exam. It may be an all day exam, maybe an oral exam, maybe a written exam and so on.

43:28.000 --> 43:36.480
In my case, it was an oral exam, very frightening because the first time I ever stood up in front

43:36.480 --> 43:44.480
of a committee of people who were throwing questions at me, very hard questions. My friends who had

43:44.480 --> 43:50.720
already passed the exam, of course, gave me some advice. And the advice was, if you don't know

43:50.720 --> 44:01.040
the answer to a question, don't try to fake it. Say you don't know because if you try to fake it,

44:02.240 --> 44:08.560
they will ask you harder and harder and harder questions until they show that you don't know

44:08.560 --> 44:13.360
what you're talking about. But if you honestly say, I don't know, let me think about it.

44:13.600 --> 44:27.040
You don't back yourself into a corner. And indeed, when I had my exam,

44:31.120 --> 44:39.760
I was asked a very hard question and I said, I don't know. And one of the people on my committee

44:39.760 --> 44:45.920
said the answer must be this. And another person on the committee said, no, you're wrong. And my whole

44:45.920 --> 44:50.720
committee started arguing with each other because nobody was certain about what the answer was to

44:50.720 --> 45:00.800
the question. And I felt great because they were ignoring me. Well, you've asked me a very hard

45:00.800 --> 45:12.160
question about the, I mean, quantum mechanics is not, it depends on how you approach quantum

45:12.160 --> 45:18.720
mechanics. If your approach is that of a mathematician, and you'd like to solve the

45:18.720 --> 45:26.640
Schrodinger equation, for example, as a mathematical problem, that I can do. But if you want to go

45:26.640 --> 45:33.200
into deep philosophical interpretation, and there are many different interpretations

45:33.760 --> 45:43.920
about quantum mechanics, many worlds and so on. I would say my intuition is that in order to

45:43.920 --> 45:50.880
understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live in a complex world, but are only able

45:50.880 --> 46:02.000
to perceive real things. And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into

46:02.000 --> 46:12.640
the real world and so on. But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to

46:12.640 --> 46:18.480
approach this problem. Okay, I just, I don't know enough. And I mean, it's a really, really hard

46:18.480 --> 46:25.520
question. And I wouldn't even begin to fake it. Okay, I mean, I can, I can tell you about solutions

46:25.520 --> 46:33.680
to equations. But when it comes to a very high level philosophical interpretation about what

46:35.520 --> 46:41.120
quantum mechanics is very strange. And there are these different interpretations of quantum

46:41.120 --> 46:49.360
mechanics. What should I say? My choice is not to say anything at this point. That's a long answer.

46:51.440 --> 46:57.440
I'm not, I'm not trying to evade the question, although that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

46:58.400 --> 47:03.280
Okay, I also don't know the question. I also don't know the answer. So I'm like one of the people in

47:03.280 --> 47:11.520
your one of the examiners. But yeah, yeah, there was a very, very hard question. And you can see

47:11.520 --> 47:22.960
people arguing about, you know, what is quantum mechanics? Okay, I mean, quantum mechanics goes

47:22.960 --> 47:32.720
beyond our perception of the world. Okay, because it's what happens in

47:35.120 --> 47:43.040
to very, very small masses. And what happens over distance scales that are very, very small.

47:43.680 --> 47:49.520
And there are now people are doing macroscopic quantum quantum mechanical experiments.

47:49.760 --> 47:58.640
But quantum behavior is, is described in the small, okay, and it's different from our perception of the

47:58.640 --> 48:03.840
real world. What is also happening is that there are now strange things that are happening in the

48:03.840 --> 48:15.280
large, okay, that is, gravity may be repulsive at gigantic distances, which is very interesting. Okay,

48:15.520 --> 48:25.440
okay. And, and so is this, is this PT symmetric conformal gravity type directions or

48:28.320 --> 48:35.600
I can talk about that. I mean, it would be, it would be more of a more discussion, but I'm happy

48:35.600 --> 48:40.480
to chat about it. I think, I think that would be a mistake for the scope of this interview,

48:40.560 --> 48:45.840
because I think it will, I think it would take too many steps to get there. But what we can do

48:45.840 --> 48:50.800
is we can talk about your research more generally in PT symmetry. Because I think, I think that is

48:51.840 --> 48:59.200
something that's very interesting that people will be able to follow in a confined bit of time.

49:00.400 --> 49:05.920
So, so let's do that then. If you're happy with that, let's jump into with just very the basic

49:05.920 --> 49:15.920
question. What is PT symmetry and what does it mean conceptually? Yeah, so P, the letter P stands for

49:15.920 --> 49:25.680
parity, which means reflecting space. Okay, so it's what you see when you look in a mirror.

49:27.120 --> 49:34.160
When you look in a mirror, your left hand becomes your right hand and so on. So it is a

49:35.040 --> 49:41.440
spatially reversed picture that you see. Okay.

49:45.760 --> 49:54.160
So, so that's parity. Okay, and it refers to space reflection, reflection through a mirror.

49:54.400 --> 50:05.520
Okay, T means time reversal. And we can't physically reverse time. But mathematically,

50:05.520 --> 50:16.560
we can imagine time flowing backward. Okay, and in fact, Wigner showed that time reversal

50:16.800 --> 50:27.680
corresponds to changing the sign of I in the complex numbers. Okay, so there's this deep connection

50:28.800 --> 50:39.600
between time reversal and complex number theory. Okay. And so PT symmetric quantum mechanics,

50:39.600 --> 50:47.360
what is that? Before I say anything about quantum mechanics, let me still

50:49.280 --> 50:57.280
remind you about classical mechanics. Okay, so, you know, Einstein's gigantic breakthrough

50:57.280 --> 51:05.840
at the beginning of the 20th century was the discovery of special relativity.

51:06.160 --> 51:16.720
Okay, it's a fantastic discovery. And what he basically said was that if you do

51:18.160 --> 51:30.640
a Lorentz transformation, which means that you go from one dynamical system,

51:31.520 --> 51:36.720
okay, to another dynamical system, moving relative to you. That's why it's called relativity.

51:36.720 --> 51:42.560
It's moving. So you're moving through space like this. Another system is moving at a greater speed

51:43.200 --> 51:49.440
through space. Okay, they can look at each other. And the question is, what about the relative

51:51.280 --> 51:56.480
physics between, you know, what is when one person in one space looks at a person in the other,

51:56.800 --> 52:03.680
in one platform that looks at a person on the other platform, what do they see? And they see

52:03.680 --> 52:10.480
time dilation and space contraction and so on. They see things that are that are relativistic.

52:10.480 --> 52:24.400
Okay. At a slightly higher level, you describe how one person looks at another person or how

52:24.400 --> 52:31.280
one person is related to another person in terms of a mathematical object called a group.

52:32.080 --> 52:38.320
Okay. And they talk about the Lorentz group. So when you perform a Lorentz transformation,

52:39.280 --> 52:46.320
you go from one object floating through space to another object flowing through space. Okay. So

52:46.320 --> 53:01.920
you transform from here to here. Okay. Is that clear? So Einstein gave us something that we

53:01.920 --> 53:08.880
didn't have before. He pointed out that, and this is not quantum mechanics. This is classical

53:08.880 --> 53:18.080
mechanics. That classical mechanics, in fact, is, doesn't behave the way you think it's behaving,

53:18.080 --> 53:26.480
because all of your, your world experiences are connected with slowly moving things.

53:27.760 --> 53:34.080
When I say slowly moving, I mean much slower than the speed of light. And he shows us,

53:34.080 --> 53:40.400
Einstein shows us that the speed of light is the fastest you can go. And as you go faster and

53:40.400 --> 53:47.760
faster and faster, new effects come into play, which you could never have imagined. Okay. Namely,

53:47.760 --> 54:01.760
time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and so on. So the Lorentz group is all possible ways

54:02.720 --> 54:07.360
of transforming, of performing a Lorentz transformation, transforming from one frame of

54:07.360 --> 54:15.440
reference to another frame of reference. Is that clear? I can show on screen as well some aides.

54:16.240 --> 54:27.840
Okay. Good. So what's an example of a Lorentz transformation? So one, the simplest possible

54:28.000 --> 54:32.800
transformation is you don't do anything. You just stay in your same frame of reference.

54:33.360 --> 54:41.040
So that's unity. You don't do anything. Another Lorentz transformation is to,

54:41.040 --> 54:46.880
suddenly, is to jump onto a platform that's moving five miles an hour faster than you are.

54:47.760 --> 54:54.560
Okay. But another very interesting kind of Lorentz transformation would be to reflect space.

54:55.280 --> 55:06.400
Okay. That's a transformation. So what is happening is now a mirror image. So you're

55:06.400 --> 55:11.920
moving this way, and you jump onto something moving at the same speed, but going that way.

55:12.560 --> 55:16.320
That would be, that would be a possible transformation.

55:17.280 --> 55:23.280
And even fancier transformation would be to reflect time.

55:26.880 --> 55:37.040
Okay. So after the discovery of the Lorentz group, which is the set of all possible transformations,

55:37.040 --> 55:44.800
infinite numbers of possible transformations, it was believed that if you had a laboratory that

55:44.800 --> 55:50.400
was going forward in time, and another laboratory that was going backward in time,

55:51.120 --> 55:55.440
and they each did an experiment, they would always get the same result. For example,

55:55.440 --> 56:01.920
if they measured how long it took for a radioactive particle to decay, or they did a chemical

56:01.920 --> 56:09.600
experiment or someone, it would be the same. And it was also believed that if you reflected a

56:09.600 --> 56:17.520
laboratory through a mirror, you looked at a mirror image. Okay. And you did an experiment

56:17.520 --> 56:23.600
in this reflected world, things would be the same. Now, in fact, we don't experience this because

56:24.320 --> 56:34.080
there are, you know, proteins are in the shape of a helix, as you know, DNA is in helix.

56:34.800 --> 56:43.120
And there is a left-handed helix and a right-handed helix going in opposite directions.

56:44.320 --> 56:49.520
And we only deal with proteins that spiral one way, not the other way.

56:51.120 --> 56:57.760
Okay. However, in principle, you could have left-handed life and right-handed life,

56:58.000 --> 57:10.080
but we don't see that. And it was believed that a reflection in space and a reflection in time

57:10.880 --> 57:17.920
are to be included in the set of all possible transformations. Okay. And it was believed for

57:17.920 --> 57:29.360
many years. So Einstein is at the beginning, you know, 1905, right? But much later, 50 years later,

57:29.360 --> 57:37.520
more than 50 years later, it was realized that space reflection is not, in fact, an allowed

57:37.520 --> 57:44.800
Lorentz transformation. Because if you do a space reflection, you get different physics.

57:45.120 --> 57:53.840
And that's unbelievable. I mean, it's amazing. I would never have believed it. And that, of course,

57:54.880 --> 58:00.240
was, you know, Li and Yang, and they won the Nobel Prize for it.

58:01.200 --> 58:08.400
So could I stop and sort of reiterate what you've said, just to make sure I understand exactly,

58:08.400 --> 58:13.920
and that others are following? So you have this symmetry group. You can change your frame of

58:13.920 --> 58:19.440
reference. You can do rotations of your reference frame, for instance. But you're talking about

58:19.440 --> 58:25.920
discrete transformations, like reflection symmetry. So you turn a right-handed frame

58:25.920 --> 58:32.640
into a left-handed frame. And it was believed that those were also symmetries of nature, just like...

58:33.360 --> 58:39.760
Because they are elements of the Lorentz group, as it was mathematically formulated.

58:40.400 --> 58:45.680
Okay. But then you do an experiment. But then you do an experiment, it's not.

58:45.680 --> 58:53.920
To put it differently, there is a light cone, which basically says that the speed of light

58:53.920 --> 58:59.520
is a unique speed. A particle moving it, if we were moving at the speed of light,

59:00.320 --> 59:07.520
would satisfy an equation called the light cone condition. And that says that x squared plus

59:07.520 --> 59:16.240
y squared plus z squared minus t squared is a constant. And a space reflection means x goes

59:16.240 --> 59:26.240
to minus x, y goes to minus y, and z goes to minus z. But they're squared. So the minus sign

59:26.240 --> 59:33.680
doesn't make any difference. So it's obvious that parity should be a symmetry. Why should it be that

59:33.680 --> 59:39.760
if you look in the mirror, there's a different world. And nobody imagined that possibility.

59:40.640 --> 59:44.560
But it is different. They are not the same world.

59:45.200 --> 59:48.560
So through... This is the weak force, right? Which is chiral.

59:48.560 --> 59:53.200
Right. Right. Very, very good. So strong forces.

59:53.200 --> 59:59.120
So do you mind if I pause? Sorry, because I think this is a topic that will confuse people.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.960
So what you're saying very basically at its core is physics shouldn't depend on the way that you

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:13.600
look at it. It should be invariant under Bob or Sue looking at it from different directions.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:21.120
And so you can change the frame at which you're looking at the physics. And so that includes

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:28.000
rotations, these sort of things, as I said before. And we assumed a different way of looking at things

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.880
that wouldn't change the physics was just doing one of these inversions sort of in space,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.440
this sort of changing from a left frame to a right-handed frame. But in experiment, that's not

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.160
true. We find surprisingly, amazingly, that this is not just a different way of looking at nature,

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.040
but that it really is different physics if you change the frame.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:58.320
Right on. Right on. Now, there's a second discovery that happened after Lee and Young,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:07.520
which was verified by experiments that Madame Wu did the year later. So they did the theory and

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:19.760
Madame Wu did the experiment. It was realized by Cronin and Fitch, who also won the Nobel Prize,

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:27.680
that time reversal changes the physics. That is, a laboratory going backward in time

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.840
will get different experimental results than a laboratory going forward in time.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:45.120
Okay. So the group of Lorentz transformations is much smaller because it cannot include the

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:55.280
element P or the element T. Could I ask you just, sorry, this is something that people are going

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.720
to wonder about. How on earth do you set up an experiment that's going back in time?

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:15.120
Oh, of course, you can't. But you can have such a laboratory. But you can interpret

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.520
a particle spinning one way as a particle that spins the other way, but is going backward in

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:29.440
time. That sort of thing. Okay. So you can spin it up this way and you could spin it up that way.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.160
And so it's the motions of the particle that are reversed. But of course, you can't go backward

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.960
in time. You can't directly do that. So yes, the experiment is inferential in that sense.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:51.920
Okay. But it is a clear experiment. Okay. So physics that is time reversed is different physics.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:03:00.560
Okay. And this raises a very, very interesting question. What happens if you reverse space

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:08.000
and time? Okay. So, you know, the point about the Lorentz group is that we're talking about

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.920
space time. And if you want to be mathematical about it, we don't want to distinguish between

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:21.440
space and time. It's simply four dimensional space. Okay. And if you reflect part of it,

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.640
that's no good. And if you reflect the other part of it, if you reflect the three space dimensions,

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:37.200
no good. The one time dimension, no good. But what if you reflect all four? That seems to be

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:45.200
much more symmetric in a way because we're talking about four dimensional space, change the sign of

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:56.240
all four dimensions. Okay. Now, there is a theorem, a very famous theorem called the CPT theorem.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:09.360
And what it says is that if you reflect space and you reflect time and you change

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:17.840
particles into antiparticles, then you will get the same result. Okay. Now, not everybody

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.400
believes the CPT theorem and people do experiments to see if they can find violations of that theorem,

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.880
but they haven't been found. So there's something very special about the product of P and T.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:42.960
Not P separately or T separately, but PT. Okay. And what we were talking about very early about

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:52.640
the classical physics and infinity and complex motion and so on,

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:07.360
those are PT, we did PT reflections. I didn't call it that, but those are PT reflections. So

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:19.040
let's put it this way. What would PT symmetry, what is PT symmetry? Okay. So imagine that I have

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:26.880
a pail and I'm pouring water into this pail. Well, the pail will be filling up with water,

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.440
so the pail is not in equilibrium. There's more and more water all the time.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:42.000
Okay. And suppose I have another pail over here and there's a hole in this pail and the water in

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:49.120
the pail is draining out. That pail is not in equilibrium because it has less and less water.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:57.520
This situation, however, is PT symmetric. Okay. In the following sense,

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:06.800
if I reflect space, then the pails are interchanged. But if I reflect time,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.280
the water going out becomes the water going in and the water going in becomes the water going

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:20.960
out. It reverses direction. Now it's the same. So if I switch the buckets and reverse time,

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:27.600
the image remains the same. Right. So that's an example of a PT symmetric reflection.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:40.880
And it's the same. Okay. Now we can do something else. We can connect the two pails with a pipe.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:49.520
And now this system is a very strange system because water is flowing into one pail.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:55.120
It's now flowing through the pipe into the other pail where it's flowing out.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:04.800
Okay. This system is in dynamical equilibrium. So the water level in each pail

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.800
stays exactly the same. It's not changing. Why? Because water is flowing in. It flows to the

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:17.360
other pail. It flows out and the level of water in each pail is the same. Normally physicists

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:24.160
would say that there are two types of physical systems. There are systems that are isolated. So

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:32.880
an atom sitting all by itself, not interacting with a beam of light or x-rays or it's completely

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:42.080
isolated from the rest of the world. This system has a given set of energy levels. Okay. And all

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:49.520
those energies are real. Okay. But there's another kind of system which is interacting with the outside

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:58.720
world. Stuff is going into the system and stuff is going out of the system. Okay. And that is a

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:07.840
system in contact with its environment. Okay. And this system may not be in equilibrium because

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:13.760
you may be putting more stuff in than you're taking out and the system is filling up with stuff,

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.000
with whatever the stuff is. It could be energy, it could be number of particles,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.760
it could be the amount of water. It doesn't matter. Okay. But PT symmetric systems are systems which

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:32.880
are similar to both. Okay. In the sense that they are in contact with the environment,

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:40.560
stuff is going in and stuff is going out in a balanced PT symmetric fashion. Okay.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:52.240
But at the same time, they are in dynamic equilibrium. Okay. So these are special new kinds

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:59.120
of systems and they behave very much like systems of one type, isolated systems,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.400
and systems of another type which are not isolated. They're in contact with the environment. So

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:18.640
in what ways are they the same? Well, they have real energies or they may have real energies to

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:26.320
be more precise. Can I ask? Okay. So the pitch that you paint is sort of, it's very intuitive

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.680
and because I can imagine a system which is in this sort of dynamical equilibrium,

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.000
I can imagine closed systems which have no energy or other things coming in and out,

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.920
and then I can imagine open systems or systems that are in contact with the external world,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:50.160
whether it's a flow of energy or temperature or heat rather, or particles. It doesn't seem so

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:57.040
crazy to consider these three options, but yet when you first started playing, it was around

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.760
the year 2000, right? When you started playing around with PT symmetry and quantum mechanics,

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:11.680
why? Yeah, it was just around 2000 and it was shocking, right? I was completely shocked and

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:19.920
appalled. I was completely thrown by this. So this is a picture that I want to somehow paint

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.280
for people. Why was this shocking? Why? Because of course, you've given us this nice intuitive

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:33.120
picture. Can you sort of reel us back and explain why that somehow wasn't expected,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.920
that you would find these three sorts of systems in quantum mechanics?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:53.200
Right. So this isn't easy, but let me try. So when you take an elementary course

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.480
in quantum mechanics, your very first encounter with quantum mechanics,

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:10.400
what you learn is that the very first thing that you study or among the first things that you study

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:16.080
is a simple atom, like a hydrogen atom. And you learn that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:23.200
are all real and all real energies. There is a ground state and there are various excited states

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:35.840
and these energies are real. Of course, that's an isolated hydrogen atom. If you connect the hydrogen

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:44.720
atom to its environment, the energies are not real. Why is that? Because if you have a hydrogen

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:52.160
atom in an excited state, what can that atom do? The atom can drop to a lower energy state

01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.160
and radiate a photon which carries away some of that energy. Energy is conserved,

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:12.720
but a photon, a tiny burst of light will come out. When we look at a neon light at night,

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:23.120
and street signs, especially a neon light or an argon light, what you're seeing

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:33.520
is electrons in excited neon atoms dropping to lower energy levels and giving off light,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:43.680
characteristic color of neon light. Since those systems are not stable,

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:52.000
we interpret that as meaning that the energies are actually complex. In any case, you take

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.640
your elementary course in quantum mechanics and the very first question, kind of question,

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:03.600
that arises is, when are the energy levels real and when are the energy levels complex?

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:13.440
There is a condition, a very famous condition, called hermiticity. You say that a hermitian

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.640
system has real energy levels and you learned this at the very beginning.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:35.440
The reason that ptsymmetric systems are shocking is that they can be systems that are not hermitian

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:45.520
but still have real energy levels. In the sense that in that funny classical model I had of a ball

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.680
rolling up the hill and going on and then coming back from infinity, it continues on. It's not

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:58.960
changing. It's in a fixed state. It's in a fixed energy level state and yet it's connected to its

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:08.640
environment because stuff is going out to infinity and coming in from infinity. It should definitely

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.040
not have a real energy level. What should happen, you would think, is that all the stuff

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.040
runs off to infinity and it's gone. It runs downhill and there's no more energy. All the

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:32.080
energy has radiated out to infinity and it's gone. That's sort of our intuitive picture.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.120
If you have something hot, what does it do? It radiates energy. The energy flows away off

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:48.480
to infinity and it's gone. The state was not in a stable state. Yet what I've argued is that if

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.040
you include the complex plane, now you can have states that are connected to their environment.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.520
Particles can flow out to infinity and come in from infinity and the state is stable.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:12.720
It's in dynamic equilibrium. It can radiate. It can be connected to its environment and yet

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:24.320
not change. I'm not going to give you the mathematical condition, but this is a state

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:31.520
that violates this elementary condition of hermiticity and yet has real energies.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.440
As I say, when I first took my quantum mechanics course in the first week or two,

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:49.600
the professor said, the way you know if there are real energies corresponding to states that

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:57.200
are stable, unchanging in time and equilibrium. If the energy is real, the states will not be

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:07.520
changing their physical properties. This is the condition of hermiticity. Here,

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:17.200
I am talking about physical systems that are not hermitian and yet they're not changing in time.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:25.920
This is a whole new class of quantum mechanical and classical mechanical systems,

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:32.960
like the pales of water that shows classical physics, which are connected to their environments

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:46.080
and yet they're stable. This requires the use of complex variables.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:57.360
The mathematical underpinning is based on complex numbers, but we know that complex numbers are

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.400
really there in physics that are required. At the very beginning of quantum mechanics,

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:08.960
you have complex numbers. It's funny. I should point out that when I went through my physics

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:15.280
undergrad, this condition, this hermiticity condition is still hammered into you. The

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.080
quantum mechanics grates Heisenberg and from there onwards, I suppose, this has been hammered

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.160
into person after person after person. It's so heavily ingrained that it really is shocking.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:36.880
There are physical systems. You can go away and you can do an experiment. This has quite wide

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:43.120
applicability. Let me say it just to make sure. Let me say it right. I'm not saying there's anything

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:53.600
wrong about hermiticity. The statement is, if you have a physical system that is described

01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.720
as a Hermitian one, that is the equations for the system are Hermitian,

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.800
then the energies will be real. I'm not saying there's anything wrong about that.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:16.000
What I am saying is that if the system is not Hermitian, which means that you are working in

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.920
the complex plane, the energies can still be real and the system can still live in a stable state.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:32.960
That's the surprise. What it means is that there are huge numbers of new physical systems

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:44.560
that we can study. If you want a serious example that has been performed in a laboratory

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:54.560
to verify the equations that we have written down, here it is. Here's an example. Imagine you have

01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:02.720
a fiber, a very thin fiber, and light is flowing through the fiber. This was the earliest

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:13.120
example, an incredibly beautiful example of a non-Hermitian PT symmetric system.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:26.160
Light is just traveling down this fiber. We have a second fiber and light is also traveling down the

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:36.000
fiber. You put light in one end of the fiber and it comes out the other end. Is that clear?

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:45.440
So we have two fibers. Now, it's a physical fact that if you put two fibers close to each other,

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.120
light can leak out of one fiber into the other fiber. For example, if you have a fiber with no

01:19:53.120 --> 01:20:04.720
light in it and a fiber with light flowing down the fiber, and the two fibers are in contact,

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:14.560
then light traveling down the blue fiber here will wind up in the black fiber. So no light

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:21.280
is going in at this end in the black fiber. Light is going into the blue fiber at this end.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.920
But because they're near each other, most of the light is coming out of the blue fiber,

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:34.000
but some light has leaked into the black fiber and is coming out. That's just

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:43.680
straightforward optics. What I can do is consider an equilibrium situation. Remember,

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:49.680
we had an equilibrium situation with gain and loss. So imagine we have these two fibers.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:21:02.160
Let us remove light from the black fiber. So how do you remove light? How do you absorb it?

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:10.720
Well, one way is to plate the fiber, to cover the fiber with metal. So you just put a little chromium

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.680
on the fiber and the light energy will be sucked into the chromium and the light will disappear.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:28.880
Okay. How do you put light into a fiber? Well, you shine a laser on it and that introduces

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:38.560
light into the fiber as it's flowing. So not at the where the fiber begins or where it ends,

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:46.240
but you just shine a laser light, say midway down the fiber and that will induce light to flow

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.520
down the fiber. So these are the two pales of water with loss and gain.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:22:00.160
Okay. And a pipe between them is simply that the fibers are touching each other.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:14.080
Okay. And there's light leaking from this fiber into this. So this system is PT symmetric because

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:21.600
light flowing in and light flowing out, if we reverse time, it looks like this.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:29.280
But if we reverse space, it looks like this. So you recover the original situation.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:45.600
Okay. So that's an example. That was the very first experiment verifying the mathematics behind a

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:53.520
PT symmetric system. And since then, there have been countless numbers of experiments, many,

01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:03.440
many, many experiments, mechanical experiments, electrical experiments. And these systems

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:12.880
have remarkable properties. They're new. They're very interesting. I mean, now there are something

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:25.680
like they're approaching 10,000 papers have been written on systems with PT symmetry. Okay. The

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:31.760
citation, you know, I mean, we're talking about published papers. By the end of this year, there

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:40.880
will be it will exceed 10,000 papers at the rate that it's going. So lots of people are working on

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:51.680
this. This is a very busy active field. Can I ask what makes a good quest? What makes a good question

01:23:51.680 --> 01:24:00.720
physics to study to work on? Let me tell you about me and my life at my university. So I love solving

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:08.560
problems. As you might guess, I love mathematics, I love solving problems. And there is an exam called

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:20.000
the Putnam exam, which is taken by college students. These are the Putnam exam is a six hour

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:31.920
mathematics contest. Okay, at the top, top, top mathematical, mathematically inclined

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:39.360
college students often take this exam every year. Several thousand students take the exam.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:48.320
Okay, and the exam is six hours long. And there are 12 problems on the exam.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:56.640
So you, in fact, the exam is three hours long in the morning, a two hour break for lunch and then

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.480
three more hours. So you have to solve six problems in the morning and six problems in the afternoon,

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:11.040
if you want a perfect score. Essentially, nobody gets a perfect score. Okay, solving one problem

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.680
means that you're pretty much in the upper quarter of the people taking the exam. It's a very, very

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.960
hard exam. And if you solve two problems, you are doing spectacularly well. I mean, it means that

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:32.800
you're very, very talented. So it's rare, but the, you know, the top person in the country,

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:39.520
there's there are big cash prizes and scholarships and so on. But the top person in the country

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:48.240
may solve typically nine problems, maybe even 10. In the past, it has happened

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:56.320
that someone has solved all 12. But basically, it's virtually hopeless to be able to do that.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:02.640
Okay, so they give you a feeling. Okay, so I love solving problems. And when I began

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:16.720
my teaching here at Washington University, I noticed that nobody was coaching kids to prepare

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:24.240
for the Putnam exam. And I announced that I was the coach. I just said, I'm going to teach,

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:31.280
I'm going to have practice sessions to prepare you to take the Putnam exam. And lots of kids

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.200
were interested in mathematics, and they attended the practice sessions, and we learned how to solve

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:44.800
problems. Okay, which is an important aspect of being a physicist, you have to the theoretical

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:53.600
physicists, you have to learn how to solve problems. And this was very effective, because

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:02.160
that year, out of the hundreds of schools, who they're there's something like 400 and

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:13.200
over 400 schools, 425 schools, something like that, colleges, participated in the exam. Washington

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.800
University came out second. I mean, it helps to learn how to solve problems, hard problems,

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:32.560
really, really hard problems. And the year after, in fact, we came in first in the country,

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:44.240
top team in the country. Okay, and we were virtually always in the top 10. And it's because

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:50.160
the students are bright, but also the students learned how to solve problems in these practice

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:56.720
sessions, which is really good. Okay, and they really, it was wonderful, they did very well.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:03.920
You would think that when they went on to become, if they became theoretical physicists, you might

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:14.400
think that these kids all became professors of physics, but they didn't. And that's because

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:22.800
there's another aspect of science, which they were not prepared for. And that is that in physics,

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:33.040
not all problems can be solved. But on the Putnam exam, every problem can be solved. That is,

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:40.640
it may be very hard, but you know, before you even see the problem, that there is a solution.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:50.480
And that typically is beautiful. Okay, you know, you can do it. And that gives you a leg up.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:59.600
Because knowing that there is a solution is the first step in being able to solve a problem.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:06.960
I mean, it's what generates your, it's what brings up your intuition. It gets you into the right frame

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:17.840
of mind. The problem with physics is that not all problems can be solved. And if you're going to

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:27.120
be a successful physicist, you have to know how to pick a problem. So some of the top kids

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:37.360
in the Putnam exam never go on to a career, a scientific or a mathematical career, because

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.520
they don't have an intuitive feeling of how to pick a problem that you can solve.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:52.640
It's not just solving the problem is that you have to find the problem. Okay, so there are

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:58.880
there are two ingredients to being a successful physicist or a mathematician. You have to pick

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:07.200
a problem that is hard enough to be deep and interesting. You know, you don't say, I'm going

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.560
to publish your paper on how much one and what is that stupid, right? So you have to pick a problem

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:21.920
which is deep and subtle, but still within the realm of possibility of being solved.

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:31.280
And finding a problem is a rare, a very rare ability finding an appropriate problem

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.760
to make that is it's a big enough advance in physics to be significant,

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:46.080
but a small enough advance that you can solve it. Because I can add, I mean, I can pose for you

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:55.920
a very hard problem in physics, but I have no idea how to solve it. So I wouldn't attempt to solve it.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.440
Okay, there are lots of these problems. Okay, I mean, for example,

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:10.160
the nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons, but they have different masses.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:19.360
How do you calculate the difference in the mass of a proton and a neutron? And why is the mass

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:29.520
different? And can you quantitatively calculate that amount of mass difference? They don't weigh

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:36.960
the same amount. Okay, that's a very, very hard problem. And at this point in my life,

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:42.640
I wouldn't try to solve that problem, because I don't know how to begin. And I could waste a lot of

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:52.320
time trying to solve something that I'm not equipped to solve. Okay, so I've learned, so

01:31:53.040 --> 01:32:00.560
the most brilliant problem solvers don't necessarily become effective physicists,

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:08.000
effective physicists, or scientists in general, know how to pick a problem that they can solve,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:15.680
but will still be significant. That's a very hard thing to teach. I don't know how to teach that.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:23.600
It's something that you have to have a tremendous amount of experience,

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:32.240
but it's not something you can teach as a rote piece of information in a lecture. This is

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.720
how you behave as a physicist. Okay. It's a little bit of a shame that there's no pathway to couple

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.000
those students that are really good at solving problems with those students that are really

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:55.760
good at picking problems. In fact, that does happen. There are sometimes groups of, I mean,

01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.000
this is why physicists are very sociable. I mean, they don't work alone. And they talk. This is the

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.880
reason why physicists talk with experiment, you know, theoretical physicists talk with

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:13.920
experimentalists. This is why we have seminars and colloquia, so we can learn about problems

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:21.120
that are interesting and important. And then if we're a good problem solver, we might focus on

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:28.640
maybe not the whole problem, but an aspect of the problem. For example, although I don't know

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.760
how to solve the question I just asked about a proton and a neutron, I can make a model

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:45.040
okay. So instead of taking a proton and a neutron in our four dimensional space,

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:51.360
what about a proton and a neutron in one dimensional space? That's a much simpler question.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:59.600
And I can solve that problem. Okay, so I can simplify the problem by making a model

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:06.800
and develop, learn about aspects of the problem without

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.960
doing a complete solution. I mean, if you solve that problem, you're going to win a Nobel Prize,

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:17.600
right? In general, if you solve a really, really hard problem, that's very rare,

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.480
but you still have to earn money, you know, so you pick a problem that's not so hard,

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.720
but it's still interesting.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:34.720
There's a famous saying from Feynman. He said a lot of things, but one of the things he said,

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:41.600
every physicist has heard this shut up and calculate mantra, right? Can you say,

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.880
what are your thoughts then on that way of thinking?

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:59.760
Well, let me tell you about Feynman. So to begin with, Feynman, so my uncle was a high school

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:11.040
teacher, a high school physics teacher, in fact, and he was Feynman's high school physics teacher.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.080
Feynman in high school was very, very smart, and my uncle just put him in the back room and said,

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:27.920
here's a book, read this, but you don't need to sit in my class. Okay, so I had a lot of interaction

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:41.200
with Feynman and also his sister, who's very smart, and so I and two colleagues worked on

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.960
some papers over the summer at Caltech where Feynman was, and we used to eat lunch with Feynman.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:54.000
He happened to be around that summer and we ate lunch and we, and he would always say,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.800
so how's it going? In fact, he didn't say that. He would say, how's it going?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:13.040
Okay, and the three of us would say, well, we showed this and this, and we were able to

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:22.160
calculate this and we established this. And he would say, very good, very good.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:36.480
And then he would say, BS, except he would say that word right away. And he would say, no,

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:44.800
you're wrong because of this and this and this and this is inconsistent and it's not correct.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:53.600
And we would be stunned because Feynman was very, very smart and very, very fast. In fact,

01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:05.840
he's the fastest guy I've ever known. And the three of us didn't have an answer. I mean,

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:12.400
he had picked apart our calculation because he looked at it not in a technical way,

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.280
but he looked at it from above and he brought to bear some basic physical

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:30.400
theorems and questioned our assumptions and so on and found what was apparent. He found apparent

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:39.840
violations of sensible physical outcome. And we would go back to the office and work together

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.440
with the three of us all afternoon arguing with each other about what to do and why this happened

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:53.520
and what was the violation due to. And much more often than not, we found that there was a flaw.

01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:00.640
There was an assumption that Feynman had made in his argument that we couldn't catch

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.400
on the fly sitting and sitting around a cafeteria table. We couldn't do that. But

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:19.840
we saw through it and we would include this take account, this fact. And we got it to work again.

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:27.840
And the next day at lunch, Feynman would say, so how's it going? And we would say, well,

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:36.960
you assumed that this and this were true, but they aren't because we made this delicate assumption

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:44.000
at the beginning, which forbids this possibility from occurring. And so there is no contradiction.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:53.520
And he would say, oh, very good, very good. And he was never, by the way, he was wonderful

01:38:53.520 --> 01:39:06.240
because it was never a destructive criticism. He didn't benefit by putting us down. He was

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:13.600
only interested in physics being done right and things being done logically and correctly.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.800
And if he saw that it was working, he would say very, very good. But very often it would turn out

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:29.040
that he would say, ah, but you're wrong because of this. And once again, we'd have to go back to

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.000
the office to repeat the process over and over and over. You can imagine by the end of the summer,

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:42.320
boy, did we have a fantastic piece of work. We published four papers at the end of the summer

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:49.120
on our research effort. And that was wonderful. That was an incredible experience,

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:58.480
okay, because physics is a very social endeavor. It's not sitting in your room alone. It's

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:05.760
interacting with people and bouncing ideas off each other. And it's because physics is not

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:14.640
entirely rigorous. It's based on certain assumptions. The mathematics can be a little bit vague.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:26.480
And making precise statements is very difficult. So physics is interesting because of that, right?

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:35.600
It's not, it's not like a dry axiomatic mathematical system. So it's very mathematical

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:42.560
and you have to be very careful. So I would say this is sort of care, great care, but not necessarily

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:51.120
rigor. Okay, and physics has something that mathematics doesn't. Because after you come

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.920
up with a finished product, you can test it in the laboratory and see if you're right.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:05.280
Okay, and mathematics is mathematics. It's either rigorously right. That is, it's in agreement with

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:13.440
your axioms or it conflicts with an axiom. So physics is very similar, but it isn't rigorous.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:20.480
Okay, and in physics, you can make approximations. So long as they don't destroy,

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:31.280
they're not in conflict with your assumptions. Okay, so this is a distinct field. You know,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.480
it's an interaction between what you see in the laboratory and what you do on paper.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.360
Okay, mathematics doesn't have a laboratory. You are the writer wall.

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:51.440
So in some sense, you can, you can run much faster by dropping rigor,

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.200
because at the end of the day, you can do the experiment.

01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:01.120
Yes, you can, I don't know if you say run faster because there are times when you're really

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:19.520
slogging along at a slow pace. But yes, you can, if you drop rigor, it is true

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:27.840
that you can get lots of results that appear to be correct, but have to be verified.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:35.600
And some of them will in the end not be valid. And that's because your experimental test

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.000
is violated. And it, your conclusion is not correct.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.120
That's just not jumping off the cliff and building the bridge underneath yourself as you go,

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:54.720
in some sense. Yeah, it's, it's, it may be that you're, that one of your axioms is seriously an error.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:03.680
Um, so as far as PT symmetry, it may be that the assumption of PT symmetry, which is more general,

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:12.080
is that there may be something flawed about it. Of course, that's not going to happen because

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.800
there are already many PT symmetric systems that have been studied and the predictions are correct.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:27.680
But it could be that down the road, we will make wrong assumptions about how the world is

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:34.080
supposed to behave and it doesn't behave that way. So far, things are going very well, however, which

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:46.880
is nice. So let me just ask in brief detail then, we've already discussed the role of rigor in physics.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.560
What role does beauty play or what role should it play in solving a problem?

01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:00.080
Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Different people

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.040
see beauty in different, I mean, you may see something as being beautiful when I don't think

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:18.480
it's beautiful at all. Um, beautiful, I think for me means that it's a result that it's deep

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:30.080
and unexpected and surprising. Okay. And beautiful also means that there is an extremely clever and

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:46.000
unexpected argument for producing that result. Would you like an example of something beautiful

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:53.200
and unexpected? I think this is actually quite important because for non-mathematicians and

01:44:53.200 --> 01:45:00.720
people who aren't doing mathematics regularly, I imagine it's quite difficult to understand

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.360
what physicists and mathematicians mean when they say that a set of equations is beautiful or that

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.840
some system is beautiful or that, you know, you have these situations where you're solving something

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.600
and it just sort of leaps out at you. I'd like to somehow give that feeling to listeners.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:32.080
Right. So I could give you, I could give you an example of a problem with a, what I would regard

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:40.640
as a beautiful result, a beautiful answer. I could even give you a simple problem,

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:51.920
I mean, sorry, not a simple problem, but a simple sounding problem, which I would say is beautiful.

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:58.880
Okay. I don't know which, maybe I should do both because they're very different, but

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:09.040
here's an example of a problem from the Putnam exam, which we talked about before.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.760
Okay. It's a very, very hard problem and it's a yes or no problem.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:25.360
Okay. So you have a plane. Okay. And there are an infinite number of points in the plane.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.880
And the question is, can you color all of the points in the plane

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:42.880
assign a color to each point in the plane, assign one of three colors to each of the points in the

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:50.400
plane. So you could color this point red and this point green and this point blue. And so

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:56.880
you walk around in this infinite plane and you assign a color to each point in the plane,

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:05.520
red or green or blue. Okay. And the question is, I mean, you can do that. You're going to

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:14.000
assign, you know, if you have a point at this location, it's blue. The question is, can this

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:22.240
be done in such a way that if two points are one inch apart, they do not have the same color?

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:33.040
So the criterion, do you understand? So the criterion, this is, there's also like a

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:38.560
cartography related question like this, right? Yes, it's a little bit, it's a cut down version

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:45.440
of the four color theorem, if you like. But this is, if you can call it the three color theorem.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.960
So if, if two points are one inch apart, they may not have the same color,

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.160
they, but they could have different colors, of course,

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:01.680
can you assign a color to every point in the plane such that this is true? This is a very,

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:09.440
very hard problem. But the solution is what I would call beautiful, because it's so simple.

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:14.640
But you have to see your way through the solution and I can give it to you if you like.

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.840
Sure, please. Okay, I'll get a piece of paper.

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:26.640
So,

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.800
so here are three points,

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:49.360
and they are all one inch apart. So this is one, and one, and one. Okay. Now,

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:56.320
they're, this is an equilateral triangle here, they're one inch apart. So they must all have

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:07.600
different colors. Okay, so if this point, for example, is red, this must be blue or green.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:16.400
So, so for example, if this point is red, then this point would have to be different from red,

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:24.160
so it might be blue, and this might be green. Or this might, these two guys at the bottom

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:36.720
could be switched, but they can't be red. Okay, so we already now know the answer to the problem.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:49.520
So the question is why? Okay, so what I'm going to do is draw another equilateral triangle back to back.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:50:03.360
Okay, so if this point is red, these two points must be blue and green,

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.880
but since these two points are blue and green, this point must be red again.

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.560
Right? So now we know that if two points are the square root of two inches apart,

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:24.160
they're the same color. Right. So therefore, and it doesn't matter,

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:30.640
square root of two, square root of three, who cares? But we can clearly see that this

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:37.440
distance is bigger than one. It's one point something. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.640
So we'll just say that this distance is D. There are D inches from here to here,

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.360
and those two points have to be the same color. And the point is that D is bigger than one,

01:50:51.360 --> 01:51:00.080
and you can just see that from the picture. So therefore, all I need to do is to take a point

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:08.400
in the plane, which is red, and draw a circle about that point of radius D.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:19.280
So there's a circle of radius D, and every single point on this circle

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:28.000
is D distance away from this red point over here. And therefore, every single point on this circle

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:37.760
on this entire circle is red. So therefore, I will simply draw an arc

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:45.200
a chord, I don't need an arc, a chord in the circle that is one inch long.

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:54.160
And these two points are both red, but there's a one inch separation between them.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.080
That's not possible. So the assumption is not possible that you can't do it.

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:11.920
And that's the proof. And that proof, in my opinion, is beautiful because it is so elegant.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:21.840
It's so clever. And that's an example of something that I regard as beautiful. It was the

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:30.560
it was the elegance of the argument that I gave to prove bid. The simplicity,

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:43.200
the argument made, didn't make use of any other extraneous clever things about mathematics. It was

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:50.960
simply cold logic that led to the answer. It was sharply directed toward getting the answer.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:57.200
And I didn't say anything irrelevant. A high school student could have come up with it if

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:02.960
they were bright. Of course, of course, of course. In this case, what was what made it beautiful

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:13.680
was the technique of proving it. The actual answer is not so interesting. I mean, do you really care

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:21.440
whether or not the answer is yes or no? So here the beauty lies in the proof,

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:28.240
much more in the proof than in the answer, because, you know, saying, okay, so you can't do it. So who

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:33.520
cared? I mean, that I wouldn't say that's beautiful, but the proof is beautiful. But let me give you

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:48.880
an example where where the answer is beautiful. Okay, where the proof is more elaborate.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:54:01.200
But the answer is astonishing and surprising and incredible. Okay, so here's here's a favorite

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:12.240
problem of mine. It's a game. It's just a very simple game with incredibly simple rules. Okay.

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:25.040
And the game the rules of the game are this. You have an opponent who and you're not actually

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:33.760
fighting your opponent, the opponent is just your, your, your double who's setting up a problem for

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:44.160
you. That's all. So what what this guy does is he takes a bunch of slipped pieces of little pieces

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:50.720
of paper. And on each piece of paper, he writes a different number down real number.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.320
Okay, for simplicity, we can assume all the numbers are positive, but it doesn't matter,

01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:03.200
they could be positive and negative. I don't care, but they're all different. Okay, and there are many

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:12.320
pieces of paper. Okay, and he writes a number on each piece of paper and he puts it in a box.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:20.960
And the game is that you have to figure out what the biggest number is.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.680
You have to find the biggest number. Okay, now this, this is, this is how these are the rules.

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:38.960
They're very simple. You pick the piece of paper out of the box. Okay. And you open it up and you

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:49.680
read the number. And now you have two possibilities. You can say, I think this is the biggest number.

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:57.120
And if you're right, you win. And if you're wrong, you lose the game.

01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:11.120
Okay. Okay. However, if you're right, if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number.

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.360
And if again, you're wrong because it was the biggest number, you lose the game right away.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.080
If you say anything wrong, you lose the game. You don't get a second chance.

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:29.680
But if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number, that's a correct statement.

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.360
So you're allowed to proceed. So then you pick another piece of paper out of the box.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.960
Okay, another piece of paper, you look at it and you once again, you say,

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.920
now I think this is the biggest number. If you write, you win. If you're wrong, you lose.

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.520
But if you say, I still don't think this is the biggest number, then you can play again.

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.200
If you're right, if it was the biggest number, you lose. Okay. Now the question,

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.200
do you understand the rules? It's very simple. So the question is,

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.840
what if there were 100 pieces of paper in the box?

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.680
What do you think your chances are of winning this game?

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:25.040
So you would look at a bunch of pieces of paper and eventually you would get more and more nervous.

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:32.080
And eventually you would say, well, I think maybe this is finally the biggest piece of paper and you

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:38.640
guess. So what do you think the chances are of winning the game?

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.120
Well, of course, it depends on your strategy.

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:53.920
Well, that's right. You're right. There is a strategy. And the question is, what is the strategy?

01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:03.760
And the numbers don't have to be regular. They're not like in order. One, two, three,

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:12.800
four, five. One number is 1.6 and the other one is pi. The other one is 3,048 million and so on.

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:18.880
So there's no regularity in these numbers. I would say that if I was going to give a solution

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:24.080
without thinking too much about it, I would say this probably, you probably want to

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:32.000
turn over a certain number of cards to a certain point and then the next biggest one that you find,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.560
it'll be something like this. But I don't know where that point would be though.

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.800
Okay. So that's absolutely correct. You're absolutely right. There is a strategy.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:52.240
It's so simple. I mean, it's almost trivial. Of course, we use this process all the time.

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:54.320
How do you find the person that you're going to marry?

01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:03.920
Okay. You date somebody. You say, nah, you date another person. You say, nah,

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:10.160
you date another person. Nah, eventually you come to a person who's better than all the previous

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:18.240
people and you say, this is the one for me. Now, it's the best I'll do. Well, you could be wrong

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:25.920
because if you intended to date a hundred people, you might have picked a person who was like

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:34.880
number 10 in the list and you didn't get the best person. So the question is, if you were going to

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:43.520
date a hundred people, how many people should you date before you decide to take the next

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:51.040
better one that comes along? And what's your chance of, in the end, the question really is,

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:58.800
what is the chance of winning the game? So would you give me one out of three odds that I can find

01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:14.480
the best person in a hundred? Probably not, but I imagine I'm going to be proven wrong.

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:20.960
Well, okay, let's make it a harder game. What if there were a million

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:29.040
numbers in the box? You're going to date one million people before you decide. What's your

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:39.840
chance of finding the best one in that one million? Would you say that, would you give me

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:47.760
one in a thousand that I might get the best person in a million? Or would you say I have a

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:54.800
better or worse chance? I mean, that's the question. Yeah, so let's say we start with one box,

02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:03.120
one piece of paper in the first problem. Right, so it does depend on the number of

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:11.680
pieces of paper to a certain extent, right? It does. To an extent, it does.

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.080
But I don't think I'm going to be able to work this out on camera.

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:33.040
No, don't even try. What is amazing is that this is a way of defining a transcendental

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:47.120
number. Okay, so a very, very famous transcendental number is E. Okay, E numerically is

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:57.360
a little bit smaller than three. It's 2.718281828. Something, something, it goes on.

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:19.840
So it's roughly 2.7. Okay, so one over 2.7 is about 37.37. Okay, so now I'm going to tell you

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:30.240
the strategy for winning the game. You should date 30% of all of the girls that you intend to date

02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:43.360
or boys, whatever you, okay, and don't choose any of them. The next bigger one that comes along

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:53.280
is what you pick. So to optimize your strategy, you should look at 37% of all of the numbers.

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:04.480
And your chance of then winning the game will be 37% again.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:13.440
But shouldn't it be the percentage of no, no, it's not. And that's,

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.000
I mean, this is a mathematical calculation that I can show you. It's pretty easy,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:27.840
but it involves Taylor series. But the point here is it doesn't matter how many numbers there are,

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:38.080
there can be a billion numbers. But what you do is you look, your strategy is to look at 37%

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:47.920
of a billion, which is 370 million. So you look at the first 370 million numbers

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:55.600
and you say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not the biggest number. No, no, no. And you keep

02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:02.720
saying that 370 million times. Now, of course, you could be wrong, in which case you'll lose the game.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:13.120
Okay. But you may be right. And then your objective is to take the next bigger number

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:20.800
that comes along. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, it could be, of course, that the next bigger number

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.320
that comes along is not the biggest number, in which case, once again, you'll lose the game.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:34.400
But the chance of you winning the game is also 37%. So it's better than one out of three.

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:43.920
And if you don't believe me, you can try it at home. Take 27 numbers, different numbers,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:52.960
have your friend write it on 27 different pieces of paper, pick the first 10, say no,

02:04:52.960 --> 02:05:00.480
no, no, no, no, 10 times, and take the next bigger one that comes along. And you could make a,

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:08.480
if you do this over and over and over again, you'll see that your history, your probability of

02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:23.520
winning the game is 37%, which is extraordinary, right? So 37% of 27 is about 10. So you look at

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:30.960
10 numbers and then you take the next bigger one and better than one out of three times,

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:38.240
you will win the game with that strategy. Okay. And as far as anybody knows, that's the optimal

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:42.960
strategy. That's the best possible strategy you can use. So you want to always win,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.040
but you'll win more than one out of three times. No matter how many numbers there are,

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:57.600
that is beautiful. And it's not beautiful. It's not the argument so much. This is different from

02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:08.320
the other example I gave you. It's that the answer is beautiful because it's amazing,

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:18.160
because it's so counterintuitive. Who would have thought that who could possibly have imagined

02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:27.040
that your chance of winning the game, it doesn't make any difference how many numbers there are.

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:33.120
Your chance of winning the game is better if there are many numbers, of course. So it is very,

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:38.160
very slightly, as you pointed out, dependent on the number of numbers because if there's only one,

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:45.520
the chance is 100%. But as you get more and more numbers, it drops down to

02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:56.000
1 over E or 37%. So for anyone out there who is on the dating scene and they think they're going

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.680
to be dating from, say, 20 through to 40, those are the years they have available,

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:10.240
and they date, say, one person a year, then after eight years of being frivolous with their dates,

02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:16.240
they should then settle down for the next best person. Pick the next person who's better than

02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:23.280
everything they came before. The problem is, there may not be. It may be that you've passed

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:32.240
your optimal mate. That's entirely the chance of screwing this up or choosing too early.

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:36.640
That is, you might pick the next better one that comes along, but there's an even better one.

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:46.000
So let's finish on... That's a very powerful strategy, don't you think? That's beautiful.

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:52.560
As you said at the beginning, this is what people actually do to a certain extent.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:56.960
They date around when they're young, and then at some point,

02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:01.280
they do settle down when they're... I don't know what the average is,

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:06.080
average marriage age. It might be about 30. So it sounds about right, actually.

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:14.240
Right. But the divorce rate is roughly 50%.

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.480
So both numbers work out.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:25.600
Yeah. I mean, they're pretty close, right? I mean, if you just say, this is the one for me.

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.400
Okay. Of course, that person may look at you and say, well, you're not the one for me.

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:37.280
But of course, you could have numbers that are very close together.

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.120
So the next best number might not be so bad.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.840
Right. That's right. And that's the human

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.280
feature. I mean, there may be lots of people who in the end would be a perfect mate,

02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:03.760
or not a perfect mate, but an excellent mate. And maybe we could define an excellent marriage

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:09.200
as one that doesn't end in divorce. Now, that may not be the right way to define a good marriage.

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:17.760
I mean, it may not be a happy one. But the chance of a happy marriage is not zero.

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:22.480
So you date a bunch of people and then you take the next better one that comes along.

02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.800
That's the strategy that people basically tend to use. Sometimes they circle back to,

02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:36.480
you have that option. In this game, you don't have the option of circling back.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:44.800
Maybe the fact that the divorce rate is 50%, not 67% or something,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.640
is the fact that people are allowed to circle back after they realize that they're screwing up

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.800
and they missed out. And sometimes you can fix the problem, right?

02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:06.000
So let's end on, this is sort of a combined question.

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:16.400
But I'll put the combination of questions together. In 1900, Hilbert came up with his

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:22.000
famous Hilbert problems. There are these 23, some say 24 Hilbert problems, depending on how you

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:33.280
count. I would say just right away, this is a crucial turning point in the development of

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:47.200
mathematics. Because by doing this, what he essentially did was to split the field of mathematics

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:56.080
into two fields. What he said was that mathematics is beautiful, and that we solve problems in

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.000
mathematics not because they're going to be useful, but because they're just beautiful.

02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:09.920
Okay. And there's a very elaborate way of defining beauty, as we know.

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:24.720
But he said mathematics certainly doesn't have to be useful. So if you want to know

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:32.400
how many six-dimensional balls, what is the optimal number, the maximum number of

02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:37.280
six-dimensional spheres that will fit into a six-dimensional box?

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:49.200
You might say, who cares? And furthermore, even if I knew the answer, I couldn't test it in the

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:58.720
laboratory. Okay, that's how a physicist would respond. But more importantly, it wasn't important

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:06.320
if mathematics could be used by other branches of science. So that mathematics community, two

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:14.000
thirds of that community, followed Hilbert and said it doesn't have to be useful. It doesn't have to be

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:20.320
applicable. Roughly one third, or at least that's what the count is today,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:32.320
have stayed in the, with the point of view that it has to be useful. It has to be relevant,

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:40.240
meaning it can be built on and eventually have a connection with reality, because we do know

02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:48.160
that the physical world obeys mathematics. It really does, really seems to.

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:55.040
So these mathematicians are now called applied mathematicians,

02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.680
and Hilbert's mathematicians became pure mathematicians, and mathematicians didn't have that

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:14.000
distinction. It was just mathematics. Okay, I am definitely of the one third variety.

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:28.560
And so to me, mathematics is a tool, and it is a lot of fun, and it's beautiful.

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:38.320
But ultimately, it should be useful. So for example,

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:50.240
a lot, my, one of my expertise, you know, in mathematics is the idea that, that although

02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:58.560
almost all equations are impossible to solve, you have to learn what the answer is like.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.320
What are the properties of the answer, even if you can't solve the problem exactly. So you have

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:12.960
to learn how to do approximate mathematics. And approximate mathematics, again, is something

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:20.880
that requires great care, but not rigor. And that's what I do. Okay, and that's the kind of

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:27.040
mathematics that's relevant in physics, because if you are, if you encounter a new physics problem,

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.040
you can't solve it. There's no chance that you're going to find the answer to a physics problem.

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.440
I mean, essentially, all of the problems that you can solve exactly have been solved.

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:46.800
And they all involve systems that are too simple to be realistic. Okay, so life is complicated.

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:52.960
You know, how do you predict the weather? Well, you can't predict the weather exactly.

02:14:53.520 --> 02:15:00.000
But the question is, what is the best approximation that you can make? And probably there's an

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:08.080
upper bound. You can't, you can't give better, maybe then a 80% accurate approximation, if you

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:15.680
want the weather two days from now. But how do you get the optimal approximation? Okay, this is

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:23.600
applied mathematics. And that is my, that is what I love to do. I love to be able to solve a problem

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.320
approximately and understand what the answer is like, to a high degree of approximation

02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:36.400
without solving the problem exactly. If you had to pick your Hilbert problems,

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:46.320
what would you choose? It's, I could make up problems, but they wouldn't really be

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:53.840
of interest to me. They just wouldn't. I mean, you know, an example.

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.360
Oh, I meant for physics. I meant the ones you're interested in.

02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.320
Oh, in physics.

02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.680
I mean, your Hilbert problems.

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:05.280
Oh, oh, oh, Hilbert problems in physics. I don't think there are any.

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:10.640
No, no, I mean your version. Like, so, so Hilbert gave his 23 that he thought that were the most

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:18.080
important for mathematics to him personally. I mean, if you had to pick, you had your pick,

02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:22.880
and you're now going to influence the, you're going to split the field of physics, you're going to

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:27.920
influence the future of the field. You don't have to pick 23, but there might be one or two

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:30.800
that you think are particularly close to your heart.

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:35.200
Well, there's certainly a bunch of problems that I would love to see answered.

02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:43.600
Um, uh, one of them has to do with the acceleration and the expansion of the universe.

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:53.040
The reason that I think this is such an interesting problem is that it may be an example of a problem

02:16:53.040 --> 02:17:07.440
where, uh, where PT symmetry comes into play. Okay. Um, and the point is that, um,

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:18.160
you know, this goes under the, under the heading of alternative theories of gravity.

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.840
Okay. Because we know that gravity is attractive.

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:27.840
Okay. But the universe is expanding and accelerating.

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.040
So isn't gravity pulling back on it and stopping it from accelerating?

02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:42.560
And the answer is that, um, not the answer. Sorry. Be very careful. Not the answer, but a possible

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:50.240
answer is that, you know, in electrodynamics, a positive and a negative charge attract.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.160
And they attract just as if there were, they were attracting gravitationally. They both have a one

02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:08.480
over R, uh, force. Okay. Or one over, I should say one over R potential. Okay. One over R squared

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:18.160
Newtonian force. Okay. And a positive and negative charge attract. But you can make

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:32.000
a PT symmetric theoretical model of electrodynamics. Okay. Where the electric charge is not a real

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:39.920
number, but it's an imaginary number. Okay. But everything else is the same.

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:49.520
And now you can ask, what happens? Well, what you find is that a positive and negative charge repel.

02:18:49.760 --> 02:19:05.440
Okay. So one interesting possibility is that gravity at short distances, where short means on

02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:19.760
the scale of a galaxy at short distances, way out on a galactic scales, galaxy gravity is attractive.

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:29.360
But on the scale of the universe, on very large scales, gravity is repulsive. So you can imagine

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:39.200
a theory of gravity, which is where two masses attract. And all you need to do is to look at

02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:48.400
this theory in the complex plane. And now two masses repel. And if we have a bridge over

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:56.640
distances shorter than some characteristic distance, gravity is attractive, but larger than

02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:04.560
this characteristic distance, it's repulsive, then we can understand something about the structure

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:12.240
of the universe. And I think this is an example of a very hard, but very interesting problem.

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:20.640
And so the idea is that PT symmetry is then broken at short distance scales and then not

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:24.080
at long scales or right out. Okay.

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:33.440
That's exactly right. So if you imagine that you begin with a universe that is PT symmetric,

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:42.560
but it has a broken PT symmetry, that is, it has the symmetry, but it's not, it's like the water

02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:49.680
pales that are not connected with a pipe. Okay, it's PT symmetric, but it's still not an equilibrium

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:56.800
because one pot is filling up and the other one is emptying out. So that has broken PT symmetry.

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:04.960
But if you connect it with a pipe, it's unbroken PT symmetry. So therefore,

02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:15.920
you imagine the universe at great distances being somehow connected by a pipe, sort of.

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:30.160
Okay. Well, we can imagine it being broken or unbroken, but the point here is that

02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:37.360
depending on the separation, it either is repulsive or it's attractive and there is

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:47.600
some change over distance. That's the idea. So that's, I mean, that would be an example of a

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:56.080
beautiful, wonderful problem. If you could solve it, of course, it seems to me you would deserve

02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:04.880
a Nobel Prize and that's a very, that would be a beautiful

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:16.720
application of the ideas of PT symmetry. Okay. And use of the complex world to understand what

02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:25.920
is going on. This is work with Philip Mannheim, is it? Philip and I have done some work with

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:31.200
of course, with that objective in mind, Philip is very smart, and he's very knowledgeable about

02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:38.800
ATG's, alternative theories of gravity. He's worked on conformal gravity and so on. In fact,

02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:48.880
I'm in discussion with a guy in London where I'm going in a few days, whose name is, he's actually

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:57.520
in Greece, but he's coming to London, a guy named Marvo Matos, who is very knowledgeable about

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:06.000
modern physics and gravitation. And we've been talking about this problem for a long time.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I mean, this would be a wonderful application of PT symmetry.

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:16.080
Well, Carl, it's been an absolute pleasure having you on the podcast. Thanks for coming along.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:31.280
Pleasure to chat with you. I had lots of fun.
