1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
my intuition is that in order to understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,520
in a complex world but are only able to perceive real things.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,160
And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into the real world and so on.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,640
But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to approach this problem.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,480
Okay, I just, I don't know enough and I mean, it's a really, really hard question and I wouldn't

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,960
even begin to fake it. In the following conversation, I speak with one of the world's most creative

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,440
and renowned applied mathematicians, Carl Bender from Washington University.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,960
Carl was also one of my own favorite lecturers. I invited him on the podcast because he has a

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,720
unique talent for making complicated mathematical ideas, not just understandable, but conceptually

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,000
beautiful. In the following, we discuss the history of imaginary numbers and how they fit

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
in with reality. We also discuss Carl's interactions with Richard Feynman and his own

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,200
research in quantum mechanics. I'm Shane Farnsworth and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:42,560
enjoy. Escape Sapiens. So let's start with some philosophy of mathematics. Is the effectiveness

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,560
of mathematics in describing the natural world in some sense unreasonable or mysterious?

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:02:00,480
Now, that's an interesting question. Mathematics is a subject in itself. It's a contained

18
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:10,080
subject. It's internally self-consistent or not. The question is, can it be applied

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,000
to describe the real world? And that's a very interesting question because it isn't obvious

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,800
that mathematics has anything whatsoever to do with the real world. And it's an extraordinarily

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,720
amazing thing that it does. And the recognition that mathematics, in some sense, describes

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,080
what's going on in the real world, that took centuries for people to become aware of that,

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,960
right? I mean, orbital mechanics is a typical example. When you can predict the positions of

24
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,920
the planets or you can predict an eclipse, that's extraordinary because there's no obvious reason

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:01,600
why nature should obey any kind of mathematical formula. So yes, that's a deep question. Why

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:09,840
should mathematics have anything whatsoever to do with reality as we perceive it? And of course,

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,120
in a dream, if you can distinguish reality from a dream, but in a dream, you look around and things

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,840
are happening without cause. And they do things that are unpredictable. You could be floating in

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
the air. You could be whizzing through the air and so on. And mathematically, there's absolutely

30
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,720
no possible way to explain that. So what's the difference between dream and reality?

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Is mathematics an essential description of reality? I don't know. It appears to be,

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:58,320
of course, and people have been able to predict mathematical consequences and observe them in

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:09,600
reality with incredible precision. So the bottom line is that mathematics appears to be a complete

34
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,600
and total description of what happens in the real world. But I have no idea why.

35
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:27,920
I don't have a deep explanation of why. I mean, I can walk into the laboratory

36
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,080
and show you experiment after experiment where I make a prediction about what's going to happen

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,560
and measure it with great precision. And what I predicted really happens.

38
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,160
But I can't give you a deep, deep reason why it should.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you think there might come day where we hit a limit? So for example, at the moment,

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,200
we're trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity. And that's the biggest, I suppose,

41
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,800
most difficult question that physicists are currently working with. And here I'm thinking

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
along the line of Goethe's theorem or something like this. Do you think there's going to come a

43
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,360
time when really everything breaks down and we can't go any further?

44
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Actually, yes, I do. Yes, I do. There are now amazing experiments where you can measure

45
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,320
extraordinarily short times, phenomena happening on extraordinarily short times.

46
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,240
But if it happens on a short enough time, then quantum mechanics comes into play.

47
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,560
And if we're talking about times of order 10 to the minus 20 seconds,

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:56,160
how does a particle move over a time scale that short? And it isn't at all clear.

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,920
That is, if you are making measurements of a millionth of a second, now you're still talking

50
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:15,600
about motion on the distance scale, say, of a bacterium or something. But when you're talking

51
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,840
about 10 to the minus, that's 10 to the minus six. But when you get down to 10 to the minus 20,

52
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,720
the uncertainty principle comes into play. It's not at all clear what is happening.

53
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,080
It may actually look like a fantasy world on that kind of a time scale. So you ask,

54
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:47,440
will mathematics continue to apply forever? I have my doubts. At very, very short time scales,

55
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,880
things may just look like a soup and they may be undescribable. That's a very interesting question.

56
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you think perhaps in those cases, it could be the case that we just need a different set of

57
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,800
mathematics doesn't break down, but we're just using the wrong axioms, but potentially.

58
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:20,400
I have no idea. It could be that in extreme physical cases, the current theories of physics,

59
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,120
how physics works, may no longer be valid. And it's conceivable that there's a new physics

60
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:36,480
that happens at a micromicroscopic level, very, very short times, very short space distances.

61
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,600
But maybe it just is sort of looking at a bowl of jello and that what we're seeing

62
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,840
is in some sense an average of all of these microscopic things all happening together.

63
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,440
That could be. That could be. It's not at all, I wouldn't even guess what's going to happen

64
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,440
as you make finer and finer measurements. That's a really good question. I just have

65
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,640
absolutely no idea. I don't even know whether I should formulate an opinion because it's not

66
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,680
based on anything. But it is clear that there are many things that happen,

67
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,200
and already it's very hard to describe the process. When a particle tunnels,

68
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:49,840
what is happening while it's tunneling? Where is the particle? You make up a word

69
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,680
if you're a physicist to cover up the fact that you don't understand.

70
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,280
Like dark matter or dark energy. That's right. And in this case, when a particle is tunneling,

71
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,760
you call it a virtual particle, but that doesn't explain anything. It's just a word.

72
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:19,680
So the question is, how does, if there's a potential hill, the particle strikes the hill,

73
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,640
classically it would bounce back. Quantum mechanically, every once in a while,

74
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,160
the particle goes through whatever that means and reappears on the other side and keeps going.

75
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,680
But then here it seems like this is not a case that fits what we're talking about exactly,

76
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,240
right? Because we can predict to extraordinarily high precision the tunneling rate, for instance.

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
So that seems to be something that does fit within the realms of what mathematics can describe.

78
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,400
That's right. That's a quantity that you can

79
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,840
calculate, such as the tunneling time. However, you cannot predict whether or not a given particle

80
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:19,040
is going to tunnel. And if it does, while it's tunneling, so we have this vision of continuity.

81
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,600
We live in a world where things are continuous. So if I throw a baseball,

82
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,640
that baseball is always visible to me. And it's moving in a continuous way through a medium.

83
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Okay? But when a particle tunnels, you can't say where the particle is as it's tunneling.

84
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,320
So I lose sight of the particle on one side of a potential hill. And then I see it again on the

85
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,480
other side. And I don't even know if it's the same particle. If it's an elementary particle,

86
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,720
if an electron strikes a potential barrier, and an electron comes out the other side,

87
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,040
is it the same? Or is it a different electron? And where was the electron as it went from one side

88
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:19,760
to the other? Okay? And so we have this, in our world, we see things happening continuously.

89
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,400
We don't pick up a rock and throw it. It disappears from view, and then it reappears,

90
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,400
you know, 10 feet later. It doesn't do that. But in quantum mechanics, it seems to. Okay? Now,

91
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I would argue that that thing, that tunneling object, that tunneling particle, is actually going

92
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:47,120
through the complex plane. But that may just be a mathematical description of this tunneling phenomenon.

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,720
This might be a good point, I think, to jump in. Because the complex numbers are going to be

94
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,760
appearing throughout the discussion, it might be a good opportunity to introduce them. For the

95
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,520
person who has no physics background, no mathematics background, are you able to describe,

96
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,880
I can remind you of the list, but what are imaginary numbers? What are complex numbers?

97
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:23,840
And how do we first come up with them? Right. So when numbers were first invented,

98
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:33,440
that is, you know, you were counting your toes or counting your fingers, it's clear that even

99
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:46,000
some animals understand small integers, one, two, three, four. Okay? But it eventually became

100
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,400
clear that there were other numbers, because you could add one, one, and get another number.

101
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,320
But if you subtracted one from one, you got a new number, which was zero. And it took a while

102
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:11,760
to to absorb the fact that zero is also a number. Okay? But it wasn't what we're not done yet,

103
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,320
because although there's no problem with addition now, you know, if you start with one number and

104
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,120
add it to another number, you get a third number, no problem. One plus two equals three, and three is

105
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:35,360
a positive integer. But now subtraction gives us a problem. Okay, because two minus one is one.

106
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:46,000
And that's fine. But one minus two, what do we mean by that? Okay. And so we need to append

107
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the negative integers, just because we understand that we can subtract as well as add.

108
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,680
Okay, I can give something away, as well as taking something in. Okay, now multiplication is fine.

109
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,680
Also, I can multiply, I can say two sets of five is 10.

110
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,480
But division again, gives me a problem. So just the way the inverse of addition,

111
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,600
which is subtraction, gave me a problem. The inverse of multiplication, which is division,

112
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,960
leads to a new problem. Okay, what is two divided by three? And that's no longer a number. And I'm

113
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:35,520
forced to append the rational numbers. Okay, so every time I have a new mathematical operation,

114
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,720
I may have to extend the number system. And this is worrying, because I may think of an

115
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,320
operation and then have to make the number system bigger and bigger and bigger. So for example,

116
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:57,600
the operation of taking a square root. Okay, so if I take the square root of four, I get two.

117
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,280
And if I take the square root of nine, I get three. But if I take the square root of two,

118
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:15,760
it isn't a fraction. It isn't a rational number. Okay, so I have to append a new set of numbers

119
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,360
called irrational numbers. And then of course, I can take other roots, I can take third cube roots,

120
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:32,720
fourth roots, fifth roots, and so on. And these, fortunately, don't generate new kinds of numbers.

121
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,720
But we have both rational numbers. And now we have irrational numbers. And eventually,

122
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,480
we have transcendental numbers. Okay, these are new kinds of irrational numbers, like pi.

123
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:56,880
Okay. But we're not done yet. And this is the really interesting case.

124
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,120
One kind of mathematical operation is to solve an equation. So I can write down an equation

125
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:17,680
like x squared equals one. And I can say, what's x? And the solution is either plus one or minus one.

126
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,440
And you come to realize that if you have an equation that contains a square, there are two answers,

127
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:32,720
which might happen to be the same. But they're not more than two. And if I have a cubic equation,

128
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:41,280
there are three answers. But so I have a new mathematical operation called solving an equation.

129
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,760
But what about the equation x squared equals minus one?

130
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:59,120
Okay, so what number when you square it gives minus one? And it was recognized very early

131
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
that there must either we can't write down that equation.

132
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,280
Or if we want to be able to solve the equation, we have to invent a new number.

133
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,760
And this is a very strange number. And it's called I for imaginary. Okay. And I is a number

134
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:26,320
by definition, whose property is as one property that I squared is minus one.

135
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,200
And so I can solve the equation x squared equals minus one by inventing one new number,

136
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:44,240
just one. Okay. And now we have to, it took a long time to agree that I is a number.

137
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,840
Because it doesn't look like other numbers. Okay, it's imaginary. But it was accepted after a while.

138
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,200
But the first, and it was recognized that when you write down a quadratic equation,

139
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:12,400
like x squared equals minus one, a root can be imaginary. Okay, or it can be complex,

140
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:20,880
that is, it can be a combination of a real number like three, and an imaginary number like say six i.

141
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Okay, so that we'll call, we'll call that a complex number. Okay. But now we're not done.

142
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:45,520
Because now a miracle happens. Okay. This was back in the 1500s, or somewhere around 1535 or 1540.

143
00:18:45,760 --> 00:19:01,120
So imaginary numbers were already being accepted. Okay. But Cardano realized that you could have,

144
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:12,080
you could write down a cubic equation. And once again, not all the roots of a cubic algebraic

145
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:22,640
equation can be, it's not obvious whether or not those roots that are not real,

146
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,480
are also complex in the sense that those roots are combinations of a real number and an imaginary

147
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:39,200
number. They may be, they may require a new number yet. And the miracle is, they don't.

148
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:46,800
And that's an amazing fact. Okay. It's, it's amazing. Now, he was very interested in cubic

149
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:55,200
equations. And, and he spent his life thinking about it many, many years. And he understood it.

150
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,880
He came up with a cubic formula, like the quadratic formula that you learn in high school.

151
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:14,880
And then later on, shortly thereafter, it became clear that higher degree equations, like

152
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:23,040
quartic equations and so on, don't have, don't require new numbers. In other words, it appears

153
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:33,200
as if you have filled out the number system. And there aren't any ways of generating new kinds of

154
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:42,960
numbers. Okay. Now there are new kinds of mathematical systems. Okay. There are systems of matrices

155
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:51,120
and so on. But in terms of numbers, just numbers, and I'll say what, what I mean by that in a second.

156
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:02,400
Um, but the, that these numbers are now complete. But the real numbers, which includes the positive

157
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,360
numbers, the negative numbers, the irrational and irrational numbers. And then this, those real

158
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:18,160
numbers multiplied by I together. So A plus I times B, where A and B are real numbers.

159
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:28,320
Those numbers fill out the complex number system. And it's remarkable that there aren't any operations

160
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:38,160
that force us to bring in new kinds of numbers. There are new kinds of number systems that exist

161
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,360
with, with, with even more advanced kinds of numbers belonging to those systems. But this system

162
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,520
is complete. And this is a beautiful, beautiful result. And the complex number system

163
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,840
needs to be there. Okay. It has to be there because what is happening

164
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,080
in the, in the complex, in the system of complex numbers is connected to what is happening

165
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,320
just on the real, just for the real numbers, we would say on the real axis. So the real numbers

166
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,440
are on a number line, a one-dimensional number line. The complex numbers lie in a plane. This is

167
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,960
the imaginary direction, the I direction. This is the real direction. Okay. And any point in the

168
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:39,760
plane has the form A plus I times B. A is how far you are in this direction. B is how far you

169
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,800
are in the imaginary direction. And you multiply that by I to keep track of that. So A plus I,

170
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,960
B is a point in the complex plane. In order to describe, to understand what is happening with

171
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,080
the real numbers, you need to know what is happening in the complex plane. There are all kinds of

172
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,480
phenomena that cannot be simply described just in terms of real numbers. And that's remarkable.

173
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,480
Could you give an intuitive picture of how these are actually used in engineering and science?

174
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
So what sort of scenarios arise where you might need them?

175
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:36,080
Well, first of all, in mathematics. Okay. So if you take the function one over one plus x square,

176
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:47,120
okay, one divided by one plus x squared, if you plot that function, it is a very smooth

177
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:57,680
function on the real axis. So a kid in junior high school can make a plot of the function

178
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:06,400
one over one plus x squared. The plot looks like this. It has a nice smooth bump in the middle.

179
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,120
It falls off to zero as you go off to infinity. Could it be smoother?

180
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,600
Okay. And if you know calculus, this function can be infinitely differentiated.

181
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:29,200
So it can be differentiated an infinite number of times. It has no discontinuities. It is perfectly

182
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:40,800
smooth. However, if you expand this function in a series, just by expanding it in a geometric

183
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,680
series, you know, one over one plus x squared is equal to one minus x squared plus x to the fourth

184
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:59,680
minus x to the sixth and so on. That series diverges if x is bigger than is one or more.

185
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Why? Why does the series diverge? Is it one over one minus x squared?

186
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,480
No, that has a place where it's infinite. One over one minus x squared becomes infinite

187
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,040
when x is plus or minus one. So you could say, oh, I know why the series for that function diverges

188
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,720
is because the function becomes infinite. Okay. So the series for that function converges until

189
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,720
the function becomes infinite. Okay. I can buy that. But what about one over one plus x squared?

190
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:51,040
That function is perfectly smooth. It doesn't ever become infinite. And yet the series that

191
00:25:51,040 --> 00:26:00,240
represents that function ceases to converge. It becomes infinite when x equals one or when x equals

192
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:10,080
minus one. Why is that? And the answer is that there are places where that function does become

193
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,720
infinite, but not on the real axis. It becomes infinite in the complex plane. And in the complex

194
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:25,120
plane, it becomes infinite at x equals i and x equals minus i. And that's because i squared is minus

195
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:34,080
one. So one over one plus x squared becomes one over zero. And so it blows up. So the function

196
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:46,480
is becomes singular. That means infinite in the complex plane. But the fact that it is

197
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,680
infinite in the complex plane, one unit away from the origin in the vertical direction,

198
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,320
apparently affects what is happening one unit away in the horizontal direction.

199
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:08,400
That is incredible. So what is happening on the real axis is controlled by what is happening in

200
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:18,720
the complex plane. So there is a connection. So we live on the real axis. Everything that we

201
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,560
perceive is real. When you look in your wallet, you have a real number of dollars. Okay.

202
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:38,640
When you measure your IQ, it's real. Okay. When you measure a quantity of anything, you count it

203
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:47,680
in terms of real numbers. And indeed, if you ask how many spoonfuls are there in this container here,

204
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:59,280
it may be a rational number, but it's a real rational number. Okay. But the complex numbers

205
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:06,400
do affect how the real numbers behave and how operations on the real numbers

206
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,760
are performed and how effective they are. Okay. So when you represent a function by a series,

207
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,400
that series may cease to converge. And when it does, the explanation has to do with what's going

208
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:39,440
on in the complex plane. Okay. And there are interesting physical examples of how the complex

209
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:50,960
plane is affecting the physical behavior of objects. Okay. So that's quite subtle and quite

210
00:28:50,960 --> 00:29:01,920
interesting. And we can see it even in elementary, we don't have to go to quantum mechanics to see

211
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:13,040
problems like this. We can see it in the case of classical mechanics, just simple classical

212
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:20,160
motion. We can see things that are happening that are very hard to explain with real numbers alone.

213
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:31,760
But there are also real problems that we cannot understand without using complex numbers.

214
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,600
So if a student who is just learning about imaginary numbers came to you and asked,

215
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,640
are these things real? Or are they just a mathematical trick? I suppose then your answer

216
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,240
would be, we can measure it, right? We can go ahead and there are functions that we can calculate

217
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,360
and they behave the way they do only because of the existence of the imaginary numbers and

218
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,000
their behavior can only be explained by the existence of the complex numbers. So in that sense,

219
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,200
there is real as real numbers. There is measurable as real numbers.

220
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,520
What I'm arguing is that the complex plane is not just a beautiful mathematical construct,

221
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:21,680
but starting in the 1920s, which is very late, people began to realize that the complex plane

222
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:30,560
is necessary to describe some physical processes, namely microscopic physical processes.

223
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:38,400
Macroscopic physical processes don't seem to require the complex plane, although

224
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,480
complex mathematics is very useful in understanding equations. So you understand,

225
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:57,840
so all of the classical theories like classical mechanics, astronomical motion, orbital motion,

226
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,920
and so on, fluid dynamics, electricity, those are 19th century theories.

227
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,640
I mean, we're developed to a very high level by the 19th century and even in the 20th century,

228
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:24,160
relativity, special relativity and general relativity, gravity, don't seem to require

229
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:35,760
complex numbers. In fact, later on, it was discovered that they do, but before the 1920s,

230
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:45,280
nobody had any idea that you were required to use the number I. But even in special relativity,

231
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:56,000
you do need to use the number I, and I can talk about that later. But what I'm saying is that

232
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,640
you can't avoid it. The complex number system is actually, I was going to say really,

233
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:13,680
but I shouldn't do that. That's a pun. It's actually present and determines not just the

234
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,800
behavior of mathematics, real mathematics, but it determines the behavior of real physics that

235
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:28,560
we are measuring. And that is what quantum mechanics does. So one scenario that immediately

236
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:36,080
pops into my mind is electrons bound in an atom, right? When you first learn about quantum mechanics,

237
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,760
we learned that electrons can't take any sort of energy with inside the atom, but they exist

238
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,680
in sort of quantized states, and that they transition between these states. Do you have

239
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,280
a picture for what happens as they're transitioning between the states? Is that similar, where there's

240
00:32:53,280 --> 00:33:03,760
sort of a complex space in which they travel through? Yeah. So a long time ago, when I

241
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:13,600
wrote my thesis, I began to realize that this picture that we have of what you're describing

242
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:24,000
is the quantum mechanics that was being developed in the 1920s and later in the 1930s. And we say

243
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,800
that a particle in a potential, so this time it's a right-side-up potential,

244
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,280
so if you had a classical particle in a right-side-up potential,

245
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,120
it would be a particle that's rolling back and forth in a potential hill. And

246
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,960
classically, you would say you can give this particle any amount of energy that you like,

247
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:06,800
but quantum mechanically, we learn that only discrete energy levels are allowed.

248
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,000
Could I stop you just for one second? So there will be lots of people who don't understand the

249
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,400
connection between the potential and the atom scenario, where you have an electron that's

250
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,560
bound. Could you just say a few words there for just to clarify for some people?

251
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:34,080
Right. So a potential is described using units of energy. So in general, a particle has a certain

252
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,960
amount of energy. It has kinetic energy, which is energy of motion. If it's moving faster,

253
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,080
it has more energy. And it also has potential energy. So if it is subject to forces,

254
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,960
such as the force of gravity, a particle, if you raise it up, has more potential,

255
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,840
because it's higher up in the gravitational field. So it's not moving, but it has more energy.

256
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,040
If a particle is moving in a gravitational field, some of the energy of the particle is

257
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,360
the energy of the motion called kinetic energy. And some of the energy is potential energy,

258
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:26,560
which means how high the particle is. If the particle goes lower, it will be going faster.

259
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,880
And if it's higher, it will be going slower. If you throw a ball up into the air, at first it's

260
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,560
going fast. It then goes higher and higher and higher. And some of its energy, its energy of

261
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:47,600
motion becomes potential energy. And that potential energy is being stored in that particle.

262
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,880
Eventually, it may stop and then start falling down again. And as it falls,

263
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:03,120
it loses potential energy, but it gains kinetic energy. In an atom, you don't have gravity,

264
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:11,440
but you have electrical forces that are holding the electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.

265
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,200
If you think of this as a classical system, you might think of it as a solar system, where the

266
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,200
planets that are far from the, all the planets are held together by the force of the sun,

267
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,720
the gravitational force. The planets close to the sun are moving very quickly. The planets far

268
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:46,800
from the sun are moving slowly, but they have a lot more potential energy. So if you think of an atom

269
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,520
that way, which means classically, you would say, I can put a planet in any orbit I like.

270
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:05,200
It could be at a radius of 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, 7.9 miles. It doesn't matter, okay, but

271
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,480
quantum mechanically, that's not what happens. It's very interesting that planets,

272
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,240
which are acting classically, can be any distance from the sun and they can have any amount of

273
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:34,480
energy you want them to have. But in an atom, an electron can only be, can only have a given

274
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,600
amount of energy and that can be demonstrated in the laboratory, okay. So the naive picture,

275
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,360
if you want to think of the electrons as being, as moving in a real

276
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,840
sense, that is, you know, moving about back and forth inside the atom, you have some sort of

277
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,440
fog of electrons that are moving around. You don't know where any of the electrons are,

278
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,760
but a given electron cannot have, is not allowed to have any amount of energy at once.

279
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:20,480
I can't do that. It has discrete energy levels and these are called, these are called energy

280
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,160
levels or states and the electron can be in a state of this much energy, this much energy,

281
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,240
this much energy, and so on. Okay, those are energy levels and you can see those energy levels

282
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,240
when, when you allow the atom to interact with light and you can see, you know, when you look at

283
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,240
a spec, you do a spectral analysis, you can see the specific energy levels, okay, they're very

284
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,200
visible. Okay, now, and furthermore, you can predict them mathematically. But what is very

285
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,280
very interesting is that the picture is more complicated than that. So, you can,

286
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,480
instead of studying the atom on the real axis, you can study the atom in the complex plane.

287
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,320
And in the complex plane, you can see that the electron is moving in a certain direction,

288
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:29,760
in the complex plane. And in the complex plane, the, the possible energies for the electron

289
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:39,440
are continuous. They're not discrete. Okay, that's an amazing result. This is

290
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,000
the work that I did in my thesis, in fact, a long time ago. And

291
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:57,280
so why is it that they look discrete? And that's because we live on the real axis. And so when

292
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:06,000
we see an electron, it can only have this much energy, this much energy, and so on. But, but

293
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:16,080
in the complex plane, the electron can move, can have any energy, as it moves off into the complex

294
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:23,600
plane. But when it crosses the real axis, it can only have these discrete energies. So what

295
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,600
with continuous is actually, what, what is discrete is actually at a higher level at the

296
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,400
higher level at the complex level is actually now continuous. The way I describe this, if I'm giving

297
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:44,640
a lecture on this, is I say, imagine a parking garage. Okay, you enter the parking garage,

298
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:53,840
and you see that the parking garage has distinct levels, it may be the five level parking garage,

299
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:02,080
you drive into it. But in fact, you can continuously drive from one level to the next to the next to

300
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:09,680
the next. Okay, but if you were to take a gigantic saw, and cut the parking garage, cut right through

301
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,400
the parking garage and pull it apart, what you would see is discrete levels. But the complex

302
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,440
plane says that there's something much more sophisticated going on. And that the levels

303
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,000
in this parking garage are continuous. Okay, and you can go continuously

304
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,600
from one level to the next to the next, just by moving through the complex plane.

305
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,240
And does the dynamics in the complex plane also work, the calculations you can do?

306
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,880
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. You can look at the motion as the particles are traveling in the

307
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:56,000
complex plane. And if you want to understand motion on the real axis, you look at the limit

308
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,200
as you approach the real axis. And the complex motion is very complicated. But as you approach

309
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,960
the real axis, it becomes recognizable as what we know and love. You know, what happens when you

310
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,840
throw a baseball. Okay, but in the complex plane, you have more interesting motion.

311
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,640
So famously, quantum mechanics has a number of different interpretations. There's sort of the

312
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,920
Copenhagen interpretation and pilot wave interpretations, many worlds and so on. Does

313
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:35,280
this shed, does this sort of idea shed any light on which of these interpretations may be correct?

314
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,200
Or are you able to say something deeper because of this insight, this analytic continuation?

315
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:52,160
So when I was a graduate student, and I was getting ready to begin my thesis work,

316
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:04,080
you have to take a qualifying exam to demonstrate that you are qualified. You've successfully

317
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:16,080
passed all of your required courses to go on to a PhD, to write a PhD thesis that you've sufficiently

318
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:22,160
mastered what you've learned in your courses. This is a qualifying exam and it can be a very

319
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,600
difficult exam. It may be an all day exam, maybe an oral exam, maybe a written exam and so on.

320
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:36,480
In my case, it was an oral exam, very frightening because the first time I ever stood up in front

321
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:44,480
of a committee of people who were throwing questions at me, very hard questions. My friends who had

322
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,720
already passed the exam, of course, gave me some advice. And the advice was, if you don't know

323
00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:01,040
the answer to a question, don't try to fake it. Say you don't know because if you try to fake it,

324
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,560
they will ask you harder and harder and harder questions until they show that you don't know

325
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,360
what you're talking about. But if you honestly say, I don't know, let me think about it.

326
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:27,040
You don't back yourself into a corner. And indeed, when I had my exam,

327
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:39,760
I was asked a very hard question and I said, I don't know. And one of the people on my committee

328
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,920
said the answer must be this. And another person on the committee said, no, you're wrong. And my whole

329
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,720
committee started arguing with each other because nobody was certain about what the answer was to

330
00:44:50,720 --> 00:45:00,800
the question. And I felt great because they were ignoring me. Well, you've asked me a very hard

331
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:12,160
question about the, I mean, quantum mechanics is not, it depends on how you approach quantum

332
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,720
mechanics. If your approach is that of a mathematician, and you'd like to solve the

333
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:26,640
Schrodinger equation, for example, as a mathematical problem, that I can do. But if you want to go

334
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,200
into deep philosophical interpretation, and there are many different interpretations

335
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:43,920
about quantum mechanics, many worlds and so on. I would say my intuition is that in order to

336
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,880
understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live in a complex world, but are only able

337
00:45:50,880 --> 00:46:02,000
to perceive real things. And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into

338
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:12,640
the real world and so on. But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to

339
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,480
approach this problem. Okay, I just, I don't know enough. And I mean, it's a really, really hard

340
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,520
question. And I wouldn't even begin to fake it. Okay, I mean, I can, I can tell you about solutions

341
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:33,680
to equations. But when it comes to a very high level philosophical interpretation about what

342
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,120
quantum mechanics is very strange. And there are these different interpretations of quantum

343
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:49,360
mechanics. What should I say? My choice is not to say anything at this point. That's a long answer.

344
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,440
I'm not, I'm not trying to evade the question, although that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

345
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,280
Okay, I also don't know the question. I also don't know the answer. So I'm like one of the people in

346
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:11,520
your one of the examiners. But yeah, yeah, there was a very, very hard question. And you can see

347
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:22,960
people arguing about, you know, what is quantum mechanics? Okay, I mean, quantum mechanics goes

348
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:32,720
beyond our perception of the world. Okay, because it's what happens in

349
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:43,040
to very, very small masses. And what happens over distance scales that are very, very small.

350
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,520
And there are now people are doing macroscopic quantum quantum mechanical experiments.

351
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:58,640
But quantum behavior is, is described in the small, okay, and it's different from our perception of the

352
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,840
real world. What is also happening is that there are now strange things that are happening in the

353
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:15,280
large, okay, that is, gravity may be repulsive at gigantic distances, which is very interesting. Okay,

354
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:25,440
okay. And, and so is this, is this PT symmetric conformal gravity type directions or

355
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:35,600
I can talk about that. I mean, it would be, it would be more of a more discussion, but I'm happy

356
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,480
to chat about it. I think, I think that would be a mistake for the scope of this interview,

357
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,840
because I think it will, I think it would take too many steps to get there. But what we can do

358
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,800
is we can talk about your research more generally in PT symmetry. Because I think, I think that is

359
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:59,200
something that's very interesting that people will be able to follow in a confined bit of time.

360
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,920
So, so let's do that then. If you're happy with that, let's jump into with just very the basic

361
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:15,920
question. What is PT symmetry and what does it mean conceptually? Yeah, so P, the letter P stands for

362
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:25,680
parity, which means reflecting space. Okay, so it's what you see when you look in a mirror.

363
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:34,160
When you look in a mirror, your left hand becomes your right hand and so on. So it is a

364
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,440
spatially reversed picture that you see. Okay.

365
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:54,160
So, so that's parity. Okay, and it refers to space reflection, reflection through a mirror.

366
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:05,520
Okay, T means time reversal. And we can't physically reverse time. But mathematically,

367
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:16,560
we can imagine time flowing backward. Okay, and in fact, Wigner showed that time reversal

368
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:27,680
corresponds to changing the sign of I in the complex numbers. Okay, so there's this deep connection

369
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:39,600
between time reversal and complex number theory. Okay. And so PT symmetric quantum mechanics,

370
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:47,360
what is that? Before I say anything about quantum mechanics, let me still

371
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,280
remind you about classical mechanics. Okay, so, you know, Einstein's gigantic breakthrough

372
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:05,840
at the beginning of the 20th century was the discovery of special relativity.

373
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:16,720
Okay, it's a fantastic discovery. And what he basically said was that if you do

374
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:30,640
a Lorentz transformation, which means that you go from one dynamical system,

375
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,720
okay, to another dynamical system, moving relative to you. That's why it's called relativity.

376
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,560
It's moving. So you're moving through space like this. Another system is moving at a greater speed

377
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,440
through space. Okay, they can look at each other. And the question is, what about the relative

378
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,480
physics between, you know, what is when one person in one space looks at a person in the other,

379
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:03,680
in one platform that looks at a person on the other platform, what do they see? And they see

380
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,480
time dilation and space contraction and so on. They see things that are that are relativistic.

381
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:24,400
Okay. At a slightly higher level, you describe how one person looks at another person or how

382
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:31,280
one person is related to another person in terms of a mathematical object called a group.

383
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,320
Okay. And they talk about the Lorentz group. So when you perform a Lorentz transformation,

384
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:46,320
you go from one object floating through space to another object flowing through space. Okay. So

385
00:52:46,320 --> 00:53:01,920
you transform from here to here. Okay. Is that clear? So Einstein gave us something that we

386
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,880
didn't have before. He pointed out that, and this is not quantum mechanics. This is classical

387
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:18,080
mechanics. That classical mechanics, in fact, is, doesn't behave the way you think it's behaving,

388
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:26,480
because all of your, your world experiences are connected with slowly moving things.

389
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,080
When I say slowly moving, I mean much slower than the speed of light. And he shows us,

390
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:40,400
Einstein shows us that the speed of light is the fastest you can go. And as you go faster and

391
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:47,760
faster and faster, new effects come into play, which you could never have imagined. Okay. Namely,

392
00:53:47,760 --> 00:54:01,760
time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and so on. So the Lorentz group is all possible ways

393
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,360
of transforming, of performing a Lorentz transformation, transforming from one frame of

394
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:15,440
reference to another frame of reference. Is that clear? I can show on screen as well some aides.

395
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:27,840
Okay. Good. So what's an example of a Lorentz transformation? So one, the simplest possible

396
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,800
transformation is you don't do anything. You just stay in your same frame of reference.

397
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:41,040
So that's unity. You don't do anything. Another Lorentz transformation is to,

398
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,880
suddenly, is to jump onto a platform that's moving five miles an hour faster than you are.

399
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,560
Okay. But another very interesting kind of Lorentz transformation would be to reflect space.

400
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:06,400
Okay. That's a transformation. So what is happening is now a mirror image. So you're

401
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,920
moving this way, and you jump onto something moving at the same speed, but going that way.

402
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,320
That would be, that would be a possible transformation.

403
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,280
And even fancier transformation would be to reflect time.

404
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:37,040
Okay. So after the discovery of the Lorentz group, which is the set of all possible transformations,

405
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,800
infinite numbers of possible transformations, it was believed that if you had a laboratory that

406
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,400
was going forward in time, and another laboratory that was going backward in time,

407
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,440
and they each did an experiment, they would always get the same result. For example,

408
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,920
if they measured how long it took for a radioactive particle to decay, or they did a chemical

409
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:09,600
experiment or someone, it would be the same. And it was also believed that if you reflected a

410
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:17,520
laboratory through a mirror, you looked at a mirror image. Okay. And you did an experiment

411
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,600
in this reflected world, things would be the same. Now, in fact, we don't experience this because

412
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:34,080
there are, you know, proteins are in the shape of a helix, as you know, DNA is in helix.

413
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:43,120
And there is a left-handed helix and a right-handed helix going in opposite directions.

414
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,520
And we only deal with proteins that spiral one way, not the other way.

415
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:57,760
Okay. However, in principle, you could have left-handed life and right-handed life,

416
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:10,080
but we don't see that. And it was believed that a reflection in space and a reflection in time

417
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,920
are to be included in the set of all possible transformations. Okay. And it was believed for

418
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:29,360
many years. So Einstein is at the beginning, you know, 1905, right? But much later, 50 years later,

419
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:37,520
more than 50 years later, it was realized that space reflection is not, in fact, an allowed

420
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,800
Lorentz transformation. Because if you do a space reflection, you get different physics.

421
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:53,840
And that's unbelievable. I mean, it's amazing. I would never have believed it. And that, of course,

422
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,240
was, you know, Li and Yang, and they won the Nobel Prize for it.

423
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:08,400
So could I stop and sort of reiterate what you've said, just to make sure I understand exactly,

424
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,920
and that others are following? So you have this symmetry group. You can change your frame of

425
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,440
reference. You can do rotations of your reference frame, for instance. But you're talking about

426
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,920
discrete transformations, like reflection symmetry. So you turn a right-handed frame

427
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,640
into a left-handed frame. And it was believed that those were also symmetries of nature, just like...

428
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,760
Because they are elements of the Lorentz group, as it was mathematically formulated.

429
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,680
Okay. But then you do an experiment. But then you do an experiment, it's not.

430
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:53,920
To put it differently, there is a light cone, which basically says that the speed of light

431
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,520
is a unique speed. A particle moving it, if we were moving at the speed of light,

432
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:07,520
would satisfy an equation called the light cone condition. And that says that x squared plus

433
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:16,240
y squared plus z squared minus t squared is a constant. And a space reflection means x goes

434
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:26,240
to minus x, y goes to minus y, and z goes to minus z. But they're squared. So the minus sign

435
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:33,680
doesn't make any difference. So it's obvious that parity should be a symmetry. Why should it be that

436
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,760
if you look in the mirror, there's a different world. And nobody imagined that possibility.

437
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,560
But it is different. They are not the same world.

438
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,560
So through... This is the weak force, right? Which is chiral.

439
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,200
Right. Right. Very, very good. So strong forces.

440
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,120
So do you mind if I pause? Sorry, because I think this is a topic that will confuse people.

441
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,960
So what you're saying very basically at its core is physics shouldn't depend on the way that you

442
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:13,600
look at it. It should be invariant under Bob or Sue looking at it from different directions.

443
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,120
And so you can change the frame at which you're looking at the physics. And so that includes

444
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:28,000
rotations, these sort of things, as I said before. And we assumed a different way of looking at things

445
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,880
that wouldn't change the physics was just doing one of these inversions sort of in space,

446
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,440
this sort of changing from a left frame to a right-handed frame. But in experiment, that's not

447
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,160
true. We find surprisingly, amazingly, that this is not just a different way of looking at nature,

448
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,040
but that it really is different physics if you change the frame.

449
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:58,320
Right on. Right on. Now, there's a second discovery that happened after Lee and Young,

450
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:07,520
which was verified by experiments that Madame Wu did the year later. So they did the theory and

451
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:19,760
Madame Wu did the experiment. It was realized by Cronin and Fitch, who also won the Nobel Prize,

452
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:27,680
that time reversal changes the physics. That is, a laboratory going backward in time

453
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,840
will get different experimental results than a laboratory going forward in time.

454
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:45,120
Okay. So the group of Lorentz transformations is much smaller because it cannot include the

455
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:55,280
element P or the element T. Could I ask you just, sorry, this is something that people are going

456
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,720
to wonder about. How on earth do you set up an experiment that's going back in time?

457
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:15,120
Oh, of course, you can't. But you can have such a laboratory. But you can interpret

458
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:21,520
a particle spinning one way as a particle that spins the other way, but is going backward in

459
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:29,440
time. That sort of thing. Okay. So you can spin it up this way and you could spin it up that way.

460
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:36,160
And so it's the motions of the particle that are reversed. But of course, you can't go backward

461
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:42,960
in time. You can't directly do that. So yes, the experiment is inferential in that sense.

462
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:51,920
Okay. But it is a clear experiment. Okay. So physics that is time reversed is different physics.

463
01:02:52,400 --> 01:03:00,560
Okay. And this raises a very, very interesting question. What happens if you reverse space

464
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:08,000
and time? Okay. So, you know, the point about the Lorentz group is that we're talking about

465
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,920
space time. And if you want to be mathematical about it, we don't want to distinguish between

466
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:21,440
space and time. It's simply four dimensional space. Okay. And if you reflect part of it,

467
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,640
that's no good. And if you reflect the other part of it, if you reflect the three space dimensions,

468
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,200
no good. The one time dimension, no good. But what if you reflect all four? That seems to be

469
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,200
much more symmetric in a way because we're talking about four dimensional space, change the sign of

470
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:56,240
all four dimensions. Okay. Now, there is a theorem, a very famous theorem called the CPT theorem.

471
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:09,360
And what it says is that if you reflect space and you reflect time and you change

472
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:17,840
particles into antiparticles, then you will get the same result. Okay. Now, not everybody

473
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:24,400
believes the CPT theorem and people do experiments to see if they can find violations of that theorem,

474
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,880
but they haven't been found. So there's something very special about the product of P and T.

475
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:42,960
Not P separately or T separately, but PT. Okay. And what we were talking about very early about

476
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:52,640
the classical physics and infinity and complex motion and so on,

477
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:07,360
those are PT, we did PT reflections. I didn't call it that, but those are PT reflections. So

478
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:19,040
let's put it this way. What would PT symmetry, what is PT symmetry? Okay. So imagine that I have

479
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,880
a pail and I'm pouring water into this pail. Well, the pail will be filling up with water,

480
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,440
so the pail is not in equilibrium. There's more and more water all the time.

481
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:42,000
Okay. And suppose I have another pail over here and there's a hole in this pail and the water in

482
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,120
the pail is draining out. That pail is not in equilibrium because it has less and less water.

483
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:57,520
This situation, however, is PT symmetric. Okay. In the following sense,

484
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:06,800
if I reflect space, then the pails are interchanged. But if I reflect time,

485
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,280
the water going out becomes the water going in and the water going in becomes the water going

486
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:20,960
out. It reverses direction. Now it's the same. So if I switch the buckets and reverse time,

487
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:27,600
the image remains the same. Right. So that's an example of a PT symmetric reflection.

488
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:40,880
And it's the same. Okay. Now we can do something else. We can connect the two pails with a pipe.

489
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:49,520
And now this system is a very strange system because water is flowing into one pail.

490
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:55,120
It's now flowing through the pipe into the other pail where it's flowing out.

491
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:04,800
Okay. This system is in dynamical equilibrium. So the water level in each pail

492
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,800
stays exactly the same. It's not changing. Why? Because water is flowing in. It flows to the

493
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,360
other pail. It flows out and the level of water in each pail is the same. Normally physicists

494
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:24,160
would say that there are two types of physical systems. There are systems that are isolated. So

495
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:32,880
an atom sitting all by itself, not interacting with a beam of light or x-rays or it's completely

496
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:42,080
isolated from the rest of the world. This system has a given set of energy levels. Okay. And all

497
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:49,520
those energies are real. Okay. But there's another kind of system which is interacting with the outside

498
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:58,720
world. Stuff is going into the system and stuff is going out of the system. Okay. And that is a

499
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:07,840
system in contact with its environment. Okay. And this system may not be in equilibrium because

500
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:13,760
you may be putting more stuff in than you're taking out and the system is filling up with stuff,

501
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,000
with whatever the stuff is. It could be energy, it could be number of particles,

502
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,760
it could be the amount of water. It doesn't matter. Okay. But PT symmetric systems are systems which

503
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:32,880
are similar to both. Okay. In the sense that they are in contact with the environment,

504
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:40,560
stuff is going in and stuff is going out in a balanced PT symmetric fashion. Okay.

505
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:52,240
But at the same time, they are in dynamic equilibrium. Okay. So these are special new kinds

506
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:59,120
of systems and they behave very much like systems of one type, isolated systems,

507
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:06,400
and systems of another type which are not isolated. They're in contact with the environment. So

508
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:18,640
in what ways are they the same? Well, they have real energies or they may have real energies to

509
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:26,320
be more precise. Can I ask? Okay. So the pitch that you paint is sort of, it's very intuitive

510
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,680
and because I can imagine a system which is in this sort of dynamical equilibrium,

511
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,000
I can imagine closed systems which have no energy or other things coming in and out,

512
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:41,920
and then I can imagine open systems or systems that are in contact with the external world,

513
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:50,160
whether it's a flow of energy or temperature or heat rather, or particles. It doesn't seem so

514
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:57,040
crazy to consider these three options, but yet when you first started playing, it was around

515
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,760
the year 2000, right? When you started playing around with PT symmetry and quantum mechanics,

516
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:11,680
why? Yeah, it was just around 2000 and it was shocking, right? I was completely shocked and

517
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:19,920
appalled. I was completely thrown by this. So this is a picture that I want to somehow paint

518
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:27,280
for people. Why was this shocking? Why? Because of course, you've given us this nice intuitive

519
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:33,120
picture. Can you sort of reel us back and explain why that somehow wasn't expected,

520
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,920
that you would find these three sorts of systems in quantum mechanics?

521
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:53,200
Right. So this isn't easy, but let me try. So when you take an elementary course

522
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,480
in quantum mechanics, your very first encounter with quantum mechanics,

523
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:10,400
what you learn is that the very first thing that you study or among the first things that you study

524
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,080
is a simple atom, like a hydrogen atom. And you learn that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom

525
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:23,200
are all real and all real energies. There is a ground state and there are various excited states

526
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:35,840
and these energies are real. Of course, that's an isolated hydrogen atom. If you connect the hydrogen

527
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:44,720
atom to its environment, the energies are not real. Why is that? Because if you have a hydrogen

528
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:52,160
atom in an excited state, what can that atom do? The atom can drop to a lower energy state

529
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:00,160
and radiate a photon which carries away some of that energy. Energy is conserved,

530
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:12,720
but a photon, a tiny burst of light will come out. When we look at a neon light at night,

531
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:23,120
and street signs, especially a neon light or an argon light, what you're seeing

532
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:33,520
is electrons in excited neon atoms dropping to lower energy levels and giving off light,

533
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:43,680
characteristic color of neon light. Since those systems are not stable,

534
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:52,000
we interpret that as meaning that the energies are actually complex. In any case, you take

535
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,640
your elementary course in quantum mechanics and the very first question, kind of question,

536
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:03,600
that arises is, when are the energy levels real and when are the energy levels complex?

537
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:13,440
There is a condition, a very famous condition, called hermiticity. You say that a hermitian

538
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,640
system has real energy levels and you learned this at the very beginning.

539
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:35,440
The reason that ptsymmetric systems are shocking is that they can be systems that are not hermitian

540
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:45,520
but still have real energy levels. In the sense that in that funny classical model I had of a ball

541
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,680
rolling up the hill and going on and then coming back from infinity, it continues on. It's not

542
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:58,960
changing. It's in a fixed state. It's in a fixed energy level state and yet it's connected to its

543
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:08,640
environment because stuff is going out to infinity and coming in from infinity. It should definitely

544
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:15,040
not have a real energy level. What should happen, you would think, is that all the stuff

545
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,040
runs off to infinity and it's gone. It runs downhill and there's no more energy. All the

546
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:32,080
energy has radiated out to infinity and it's gone. That's sort of our intuitive picture.

547
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:39,120
If you have something hot, what does it do? It radiates energy. The energy flows away off

548
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:48,480
to infinity and it's gone. The state was not in a stable state. Yet what I've argued is that if

549
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:55,040
you include the complex plane, now you can have states that are connected to their environment.

550
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,520
Particles can flow out to infinity and come in from infinity and the state is stable.

551
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:12,720
It's in dynamic equilibrium. It can radiate. It can be connected to its environment and yet

552
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:24,320
not change. I'm not going to give you the mathematical condition, but this is a state

553
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:31,520
that violates this elementary condition of hermiticity and yet has real energies.

554
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,440
As I say, when I first took my quantum mechanics course in the first week or two,

555
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:49,600
the professor said, the way you know if there are real energies corresponding to states that

556
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:57,200
are stable, unchanging in time and equilibrium. If the energy is real, the states will not be

557
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:07,520
changing their physical properties. This is the condition of hermiticity. Here,

558
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:17,200
I am talking about physical systems that are not hermitian and yet they're not changing in time.

559
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:25,920
This is a whole new class of quantum mechanical and classical mechanical systems,

560
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,960
like the pales of water that shows classical physics, which are connected to their environments

561
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:46,080
and yet they're stable. This requires the use of complex variables.

562
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:57,360
The mathematical underpinning is based on complex numbers, but we know that complex numbers are

563
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,400
really there in physics that are required. At the very beginning of quantum mechanics,

564
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:08,960
you have complex numbers. It's funny. I should point out that when I went through my physics

565
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:15,280
undergrad, this condition, this hermiticity condition is still hammered into you. The

566
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,080
quantum mechanics grates Heisenberg and from there onwards, I suppose, this has been hammered

567
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,160
into person after person after person. It's so heavily ingrained that it really is shocking.

568
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:36,880
There are physical systems. You can go away and you can do an experiment. This has quite wide

569
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:43,120
applicability. Let me say it just to make sure. Let me say it right. I'm not saying there's anything

570
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:53,600
wrong about hermiticity. The statement is, if you have a physical system that is described

571
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:00,720
as a Hermitian one, that is the equations for the system are Hermitian,

572
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,800
then the energies will be real. I'm not saying there's anything wrong about that.

573
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:16,000
What I am saying is that if the system is not Hermitian, which means that you are working in

574
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:23,920
the complex plane, the energies can still be real and the system can still live in a stable state.

575
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,960
That's the surprise. What it means is that there are huge numbers of new physical systems

576
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:44,560
that we can study. If you want a serious example that has been performed in a laboratory

577
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:54,560
to verify the equations that we have written down, here it is. Here's an example. Imagine you have

578
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:02,720
a fiber, a very thin fiber, and light is flowing through the fiber. This was the earliest

579
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:13,120
example, an incredibly beautiful example of a non-Hermitian PT symmetric system.

580
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:26,160
Light is just traveling down this fiber. We have a second fiber and light is also traveling down the

581
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:36,000
fiber. You put light in one end of the fiber and it comes out the other end. Is that clear?

582
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:45,440
So we have two fibers. Now, it's a physical fact that if you put two fibers close to each other,

583
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,120
light can leak out of one fiber into the other fiber. For example, if you have a fiber with no

584
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:04,720
light in it and a fiber with light flowing down the fiber, and the two fibers are in contact,

585
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:14,560
then light traveling down the blue fiber here will wind up in the black fiber. So no light

586
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:21,280
is going in at this end in the black fiber. Light is going into the blue fiber at this end.

587
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,920
But because they're near each other, most of the light is coming out of the blue fiber,

588
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:34,000
but some light has leaked into the black fiber and is coming out. That's just

589
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:43,680
straightforward optics. What I can do is consider an equilibrium situation. Remember,

590
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:49,680
we had an equilibrium situation with gain and loss. So imagine we have these two fibers.

591
01:20:51,360 --> 01:21:02,160
Let us remove light from the black fiber. So how do you remove light? How do you absorb it?

592
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:10,720
Well, one way is to plate the fiber, to cover the fiber with metal. So you just put a little chromium

593
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:17,680
on the fiber and the light energy will be sucked into the chromium and the light will disappear.

594
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:28,880
Okay. How do you put light into a fiber? Well, you shine a laser on it and that introduces

595
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:38,560
light into the fiber as it's flowing. So not at the where the fiber begins or where it ends,

596
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:46,240
but you just shine a laser light, say midway down the fiber and that will induce light to flow

597
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:51,520
down the fiber. So these are the two pales of water with loss and gain.

598
01:21:51,520 --> 01:22:00,160
Okay. And a pipe between them is simply that the fibers are touching each other.

599
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:14,080
Okay. And there's light leaking from this fiber into this. So this system is PT symmetric because

600
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:21,600
light flowing in and light flowing out, if we reverse time, it looks like this.

601
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:29,280
But if we reverse space, it looks like this. So you recover the original situation.

602
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:45,600
Okay. So that's an example. That was the very first experiment verifying the mathematics behind a

603
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:53,520
PT symmetric system. And since then, there have been countless numbers of experiments, many,

604
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:03,440
many, many experiments, mechanical experiments, electrical experiments. And these systems

605
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:12,880
have remarkable properties. They're new. They're very interesting. I mean, now there are something

606
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:25,680
like they're approaching 10,000 papers have been written on systems with PT symmetry. Okay. The

607
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:31,760
citation, you know, I mean, we're talking about published papers. By the end of this year, there

608
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:40,880
will be it will exceed 10,000 papers at the rate that it's going. So lots of people are working on

609
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:51,680
this. This is a very busy active field. Can I ask what makes a good quest? What makes a good question

610
01:23:51,680 --> 01:24:00,720
physics to study to work on? Let me tell you about me and my life at my university. So I love solving

611
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:08,560
problems. As you might guess, I love mathematics, I love solving problems. And there is an exam called

612
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:20,000
the Putnam exam, which is taken by college students. These are the Putnam exam is a six hour

613
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:31,920
mathematics contest. Okay, at the top, top, top mathematical, mathematically inclined

614
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:39,360
college students often take this exam every year. Several thousand students take the exam.

615
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:48,320
Okay, and the exam is six hours long. And there are 12 problems on the exam.

616
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:56,640
So you, in fact, the exam is three hours long in the morning, a two hour break for lunch and then

617
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,480
three more hours. So you have to solve six problems in the morning and six problems in the afternoon,

618
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:11,040
if you want a perfect score. Essentially, nobody gets a perfect score. Okay, solving one problem

619
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,680
means that you're pretty much in the upper quarter of the people taking the exam. It's a very, very

620
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:24,960
hard exam. And if you solve two problems, you are doing spectacularly well. I mean, it means that

621
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:32,800
you're very, very talented. So it's rare, but the, you know, the top person in the country,

622
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,520
there's there are big cash prizes and scholarships and so on. But the top person in the country

623
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:48,240
may solve typically nine problems, maybe even 10. In the past, it has happened

624
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:56,320
that someone has solved all 12. But basically, it's virtually hopeless to be able to do that.

625
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:02,640
Okay, so they give you a feeling. Okay, so I love solving problems. And when I began

626
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:16,720
my teaching here at Washington University, I noticed that nobody was coaching kids to prepare

627
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,240
for the Putnam exam. And I announced that I was the coach. I just said, I'm going to teach,

628
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:31,280
I'm going to have practice sessions to prepare you to take the Putnam exam. And lots of kids

629
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,200
were interested in mathematics, and they attended the practice sessions, and we learned how to solve

630
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:44,800
problems. Okay, which is an important aspect of being a physicist, you have to the theoretical

631
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:53,600
physicists, you have to learn how to solve problems. And this was very effective, because

632
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:02,160
that year, out of the hundreds of schools, who they're there's something like 400 and

633
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:13,200
over 400 schools, 425 schools, something like that, colleges, participated in the exam. Washington

634
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:20,800
University came out second. I mean, it helps to learn how to solve problems, hard problems,

635
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:32,560
really, really hard problems. And the year after, in fact, we came in first in the country,

636
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:44,240
top team in the country. Okay, and we were virtually always in the top 10. And it's because

637
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:50,160
the students are bright, but also the students learned how to solve problems in these practice

638
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:56,720
sessions, which is really good. Okay, and they really, it was wonderful, they did very well.

639
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:03,920
You would think that when they went on to become, if they became theoretical physicists, you might

640
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:14,400
think that these kids all became professors of physics, but they didn't. And that's because

641
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:22,800
there's another aspect of science, which they were not prepared for. And that is that in physics,

642
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:33,040
not all problems can be solved. But on the Putnam exam, every problem can be solved. That is,

643
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:40,640
it may be very hard, but you know, before you even see the problem, that there is a solution.

644
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:50,480
And that typically is beautiful. Okay, you know, you can do it. And that gives you a leg up.

645
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:59,600
Because knowing that there is a solution is the first step in being able to solve a problem.

646
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:06,960
I mean, it's what generates your, it's what brings up your intuition. It gets you into the right frame

647
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:17,840
of mind. The problem with physics is that not all problems can be solved. And if you're going to

648
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:27,120
be a successful physicist, you have to know how to pick a problem. So some of the top kids

649
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:37,360
in the Putnam exam never go on to a career, a scientific or a mathematical career, because

650
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:43,520
they don't have an intuitive feeling of how to pick a problem that you can solve.

651
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:52,640
It's not just solving the problem is that you have to find the problem. Okay, so there are

652
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:58,880
there are two ingredients to being a successful physicist or a mathematician. You have to pick

653
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:07,200
a problem that is hard enough to be deep and interesting. You know, you don't say, I'm going

654
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:12,560
to publish your paper on how much one and what is that stupid, right? So you have to pick a problem

655
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:21,920
which is deep and subtle, but still within the realm of possibility of being solved.

656
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:31,280
And finding a problem is a rare, a very rare ability finding an appropriate problem

657
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,760
to make that is it's a big enough advance in physics to be significant,

658
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:46,080
but a small enough advance that you can solve it. Because I can add, I mean, I can pose for you

659
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:55,920
a very hard problem in physics, but I have no idea how to solve it. So I wouldn't attempt to solve it.

660
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,440
Okay, there are lots of these problems. Okay, I mean, for example,

661
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:10,160
the nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons, but they have different masses.

662
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:19,360
How do you calculate the difference in the mass of a proton and a neutron? And why is the mass

663
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:29,520
different? And can you quantitatively calculate that amount of mass difference? They don't weigh

664
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:36,960
the same amount. Okay, that's a very, very hard problem. And at this point in my life,

665
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,640
I wouldn't try to solve that problem, because I don't know how to begin. And I could waste a lot of

666
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:52,320
time trying to solve something that I'm not equipped to solve. Okay, so I've learned, so

667
01:31:53,040 --> 01:32:00,560
the most brilliant problem solvers don't necessarily become effective physicists,

668
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:08,000
effective physicists, or scientists in general, know how to pick a problem that they can solve,

669
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,680
but will still be significant. That's a very hard thing to teach. I don't know how to teach that.

670
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:23,600
It's something that you have to have a tremendous amount of experience,

671
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:32,240
but it's not something you can teach as a rote piece of information in a lecture. This is

672
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:38,720
how you behave as a physicist. Okay. It's a little bit of a shame that there's no pathway to couple

673
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,000
those students that are really good at solving problems with those students that are really

674
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:55,760
good at picking problems. In fact, that does happen. There are sometimes groups of, I mean,

675
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:02,000
this is why physicists are very sociable. I mean, they don't work alone. And they talk. This is the

676
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,880
reason why physicists talk with experiment, you know, theoretical physicists talk with

677
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:13,920
experimentalists. This is why we have seminars and colloquia, so we can learn about problems

678
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:21,120
that are interesting and important. And then if we're a good problem solver, we might focus on

679
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:28,640
maybe not the whole problem, but an aspect of the problem. For example, although I don't know

680
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:35,760
how to solve the question I just asked about a proton and a neutron, I can make a model

681
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:45,040
okay. So instead of taking a proton and a neutron in our four dimensional space,

682
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:51,360
what about a proton and a neutron in one dimensional space? That's a much simpler question.

683
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:59,600
And I can solve that problem. Okay, so I can simplify the problem by making a model

684
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:06,800
and develop, learn about aspects of the problem without

685
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,960
doing a complete solution. I mean, if you solve that problem, you're going to win a Nobel Prize,

686
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,600
right? In general, if you solve a really, really hard problem, that's very rare,

687
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:24,480
but you still have to earn money, you know, so you pick a problem that's not so hard,

688
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,720
but it's still interesting.

689
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,720
There's a famous saying from Feynman. He said a lot of things, but one of the things he said,

690
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:41,600
every physicist has heard this shut up and calculate mantra, right? Can you say,

691
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,880
what are your thoughts then on that way of thinking?

692
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:59,760
Well, let me tell you about Feynman. So to begin with, Feynman, so my uncle was a high school

693
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:11,040
teacher, a high school physics teacher, in fact, and he was Feynman's high school physics teacher.

694
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,080
Feynman in high school was very, very smart, and my uncle just put him in the back room and said,

695
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:27,920
here's a book, read this, but you don't need to sit in my class. Okay, so I had a lot of interaction

696
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:41,200
with Feynman and also his sister, who's very smart, and so I and two colleagues worked on

697
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:48,960
some papers over the summer at Caltech where Feynman was, and we used to eat lunch with Feynman.

698
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,000
He happened to be around that summer and we ate lunch and we, and he would always say,

699
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,800
so how's it going? In fact, he didn't say that. He would say, how's it going?

700
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:13,040
Okay, and the three of us would say, well, we showed this and this, and we were able to

701
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:22,160
calculate this and we established this. And he would say, very good, very good.

702
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:36,480
And then he would say, BS, except he would say that word right away. And he would say, no,

703
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:44,800
you're wrong because of this and this and this and this is inconsistent and it's not correct.

704
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,600
And we would be stunned because Feynman was very, very smart and very, very fast. In fact,

705
01:36:53,600 --> 01:37:05,840
he's the fastest guy I've ever known. And the three of us didn't have an answer. I mean,

706
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:12,400
he had picked apart our calculation because he looked at it not in a technical way,

707
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,280
but he looked at it from above and he brought to bear some basic physical

708
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:30,400
theorems and questioned our assumptions and so on and found what was apparent. He found apparent

709
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:39,840
violations of sensible physical outcome. And we would go back to the office and work together

710
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,440
with the three of us all afternoon arguing with each other about what to do and why this happened

711
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:53,520
and what was the violation due to. And much more often than not, we found that there was a flaw.

712
01:37:54,480 --> 01:38:00,640
There was an assumption that Feynman had made in his argument that we couldn't catch

713
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:08,400
on the fly sitting and sitting around a cafeteria table. We couldn't do that. But

714
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:19,840
we saw through it and we would include this take account, this fact. And we got it to work again.

715
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:27,840
And the next day at lunch, Feynman would say, so how's it going? And we would say, well,

716
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:36,960
you assumed that this and this were true, but they aren't because we made this delicate assumption

717
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:44,000
at the beginning, which forbids this possibility from occurring. And so there is no contradiction.

718
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:53,520
And he would say, oh, very good, very good. And he was never, by the way, he was wonderful

719
01:38:53,520 --> 01:39:06,240
because it was never a destructive criticism. He didn't benefit by putting us down. He was

720
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:13,600
only interested in physics being done right and things being done logically and correctly.

721
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:20,800
And if he saw that it was working, he would say very, very good. But very often it would turn out

722
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:29,040
that he would say, ah, but you're wrong because of this. And once again, we'd have to go back to

723
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:34,000
the office to repeat the process over and over and over. You can imagine by the end of the summer,

724
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:42,320
boy, did we have a fantastic piece of work. We published four papers at the end of the summer

725
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:49,120
on our research effort. And that was wonderful. That was an incredible experience,

726
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:58,480
okay, because physics is a very social endeavor. It's not sitting in your room alone. It's

727
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:05,760
interacting with people and bouncing ideas off each other. And it's because physics is not

728
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:14,640
entirely rigorous. It's based on certain assumptions. The mathematics can be a little bit vague.

729
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:26,480
And making precise statements is very difficult. So physics is interesting because of that, right?

730
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:35,600
It's not, it's not like a dry axiomatic mathematical system. So it's very mathematical

731
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:42,560
and you have to be very careful. So I would say this is sort of care, great care, but not necessarily

732
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:51,120
rigor. Okay, and physics has something that mathematics doesn't. Because after you come

733
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:55,920
up with a finished product, you can test it in the laboratory and see if you're right.

734
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:05,280
Okay, and mathematics is mathematics. It's either rigorously right. That is, it's in agreement with

735
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:13,440
your axioms or it conflicts with an axiom. So physics is very similar, but it isn't rigorous.

736
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,480
Okay, and in physics, you can make approximations. So long as they don't destroy,

737
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:31,280
they're not in conflict with your assumptions. Okay, so this is a distinct field. You know,

738
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,480
it's an interaction between what you see in the laboratory and what you do on paper.

739
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,360
Okay, mathematics doesn't have a laboratory. You are the writer wall.

740
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:51,440
So in some sense, you can, you can run much faster by dropping rigor,

741
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,200
because at the end of the day, you can do the experiment.

742
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:01,120
Yes, you can, I don't know if you say run faster because there are times when you're really

743
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:19,520
slogging along at a slow pace. But yes, you can, if you drop rigor, it is true

744
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:27,840
that you can get lots of results that appear to be correct, but have to be verified.

745
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:35,600
And some of them will in the end not be valid. And that's because your experimental test

746
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:40,000
is violated. And it, your conclusion is not correct.

747
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,120
That's just not jumping off the cliff and building the bridge underneath yourself as you go,

748
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:54,720
in some sense. Yeah, it's, it's, it may be that you're, that one of your axioms is seriously an error.

749
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:03,680
Um, so as far as PT symmetry, it may be that the assumption of PT symmetry, which is more general,

750
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:12,080
is that there may be something flawed about it. Of course, that's not going to happen because

751
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:18,800
there are already many PT symmetric systems that have been studied and the predictions are correct.

752
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:27,680
But it could be that down the road, we will make wrong assumptions about how the world is

753
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:34,080
supposed to behave and it doesn't behave that way. So far, things are going very well, however, which

754
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:46,880
is nice. So let me just ask in brief detail then, we've already discussed the role of rigor in physics.

755
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,560
What role does beauty play or what role should it play in solving a problem?

756
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:00,080
Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Different people

757
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:07,040
see beauty in different, I mean, you may see something as being beautiful when I don't think

758
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:18,480
it's beautiful at all. Um, beautiful, I think for me means that it's a result that it's deep

759
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:30,080
and unexpected and surprising. Okay. And beautiful also means that there is an extremely clever and

760
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:46,000
unexpected argument for producing that result. Would you like an example of something beautiful

761
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,200
and unexpected? I think this is actually quite important because for non-mathematicians and

762
01:44:53,200 --> 01:45:00,720
people who aren't doing mathematics regularly, I imagine it's quite difficult to understand

763
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:05,360
what physicists and mathematicians mean when they say that a set of equations is beautiful or that

764
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:11,840
some system is beautiful or that, you know, you have these situations where you're solving something

765
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:17,600
and it just sort of leaps out at you. I'd like to somehow give that feeling to listeners.

766
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:32,080
Right. So I could give you, I could give you an example of a problem with a, what I would regard

767
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:40,640
as a beautiful result, a beautiful answer. I could even give you a simple problem,

768
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:51,920
I mean, sorry, not a simple problem, but a simple sounding problem, which I would say is beautiful.

769
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:58,880
Okay. I don't know which, maybe I should do both because they're very different, but

770
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:09,040
here's an example of a problem from the Putnam exam, which we talked about before.

771
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,760
Okay. It's a very, very hard problem and it's a yes or no problem.

772
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:25,360
Okay. So you have a plane. Okay. And there are an infinite number of points in the plane.

773
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,880
And the question is, can you color all of the points in the plane

774
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:42,880
assign a color to each point in the plane, assign one of three colors to each of the points in the

775
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:50,400
plane. So you could color this point red and this point green and this point blue. And so

776
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:56,880
you walk around in this infinite plane and you assign a color to each point in the plane,

777
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:05,520
red or green or blue. Okay. And the question is, I mean, you can do that. You're going to

778
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:14,000
assign, you know, if you have a point at this location, it's blue. The question is, can this

779
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:22,240
be done in such a way that if two points are one inch apart, they do not have the same color?

780
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:33,040
So the criterion, do you understand? So the criterion, this is, there's also like a

781
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:38,560
cartography related question like this, right? Yes, it's a little bit, it's a cut down version

782
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:45,440
of the four color theorem, if you like. But this is, if you can call it the three color theorem.

783
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:50,960
So if, if two points are one inch apart, they may not have the same color,

784
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,160
they, but they could have different colors, of course,

785
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:01,680
can you assign a color to every point in the plane such that this is true? This is a very,

786
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:09,440
very hard problem. But the solution is what I would call beautiful, because it's so simple.

787
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,640
But you have to see your way through the solution and I can give it to you if you like.

788
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,840
Sure, please. Okay, I'll get a piece of paper.

789
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:26,640
So,

790
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,800
so here are three points,

791
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:49,360
and they are all one inch apart. So this is one, and one, and one. Okay. Now,

792
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:56,320
they're, this is an equilateral triangle here, they're one inch apart. So they must all have

793
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:07,600
different colors. Okay, so if this point, for example, is red, this must be blue or green.

794
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:16,400
So, so for example, if this point is red, then this point would have to be different from red,

795
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:24,160
so it might be blue, and this might be green. Or this might, these two guys at the bottom

796
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:36,720
could be switched, but they can't be red. Okay, so we already now know the answer to the problem.

797
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:49,520
So the question is why? Okay, so what I'm going to do is draw another equilateral triangle back to back.

798
01:49:50,400 --> 01:50:03,360
Okay, so if this point is red, these two points must be blue and green,

799
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,880
but since these two points are blue and green, this point must be red again.

800
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:16,560
Right? So now we know that if two points are the square root of two inches apart,

801
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:24,160
they're the same color. Right. So therefore, and it doesn't matter,

802
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:30,640
square root of two, square root of three, who cares? But we can clearly see that this

803
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:37,440
distance is bigger than one. It's one point something. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

804
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,640
So we'll just say that this distance is D. There are D inches from here to here,

805
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:51,360
and those two points have to be the same color. And the point is that D is bigger than one,

806
01:50:51,360 --> 01:51:00,080
and you can just see that from the picture. So therefore, all I need to do is to take a point

807
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:08,400
in the plane, which is red, and draw a circle about that point of radius D.

808
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:19,280
So there's a circle of radius D, and every single point on this circle

809
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:28,000
is D distance away from this red point over here. And therefore, every single point on this circle

810
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:37,760
on this entire circle is red. So therefore, I will simply draw an arc

811
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:45,200
a chord, I don't need an arc, a chord in the circle that is one inch long.

812
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:54,160
And these two points are both red, but there's a one inch separation between them.

813
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:02,080
That's not possible. So the assumption is not possible that you can't do it.

814
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:11,920
And that's the proof. And that proof, in my opinion, is beautiful because it is so elegant.

815
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:21,840
It's so clever. And that's an example of something that I regard as beautiful. It was the

816
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:30,560
it was the elegance of the argument that I gave to prove bid. The simplicity,

817
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:43,200
the argument made, didn't make use of any other extraneous clever things about mathematics. It was

818
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:50,960
simply cold logic that led to the answer. It was sharply directed toward getting the answer.

819
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:57,200
And I didn't say anything irrelevant. A high school student could have come up with it if

820
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:02,960
they were bright. Of course, of course, of course. In this case, what was what made it beautiful

821
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:13,680
was the technique of proving it. The actual answer is not so interesting. I mean, do you really care

822
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:21,440
whether or not the answer is yes or no? So here the beauty lies in the proof,

823
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:28,240
much more in the proof than in the answer, because, you know, saying, okay, so you can't do it. So who

824
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:33,520
cared? I mean, that I wouldn't say that's beautiful, but the proof is beautiful. But let me give you

825
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:48,880
an example where where the answer is beautiful. Okay, where the proof is more elaborate.

826
01:53:50,160 --> 01:54:01,200
But the answer is astonishing and surprising and incredible. Okay, so here's here's a favorite

827
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:12,240
problem of mine. It's a game. It's just a very simple game with incredibly simple rules. Okay.

828
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:25,040
And the game the rules of the game are this. You have an opponent who and you're not actually

829
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:33,760
fighting your opponent, the opponent is just your, your, your double who's setting up a problem for

830
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:44,160
you. That's all. So what what this guy does is he takes a bunch of slipped pieces of little pieces

831
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:50,720
of paper. And on each piece of paper, he writes a different number down real number.

832
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:56,320
Okay, for simplicity, we can assume all the numbers are positive, but it doesn't matter,

833
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:03,200
they could be positive and negative. I don't care, but they're all different. Okay, and there are many

834
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:12,320
pieces of paper. Okay, and he writes a number on each piece of paper and he puts it in a box.

835
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:20,960
And the game is that you have to figure out what the biggest number is.

836
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:29,680
You have to find the biggest number. Okay, now this, this is, this is how these are the rules.

837
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:38,960
They're very simple. You pick the piece of paper out of the box. Okay. And you open it up and you

838
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:49,680
read the number. And now you have two possibilities. You can say, I think this is the biggest number.

839
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,120
And if you're right, you win. And if you're wrong, you lose the game.

840
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:11,120
Okay. Okay. However, if you're right, if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number.

841
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:17,360
And if again, you're wrong because it was the biggest number, you lose the game right away.

842
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,080
If you say anything wrong, you lose the game. You don't get a second chance.

843
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:29,680
But if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number, that's a correct statement.

844
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:35,360
So you're allowed to proceed. So then you pick another piece of paper out of the box.

845
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,960
Okay, another piece of paper, you look at it and you once again, you say,

846
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:49,920
now I think this is the biggest number. If you write, you win. If you're wrong, you lose.

847
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:55,520
But if you say, I still don't think this is the biggest number, then you can play again.

848
01:56:56,640 --> 01:57:01,200
If you're right, if it was the biggest number, you lose. Okay. Now the question,

849
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:05,200
do you understand the rules? It's very simple. So the question is,

850
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,840
what if there were 100 pieces of paper in the box?

851
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,680
What do you think your chances are of winning this game?

852
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:25,040
So you would look at a bunch of pieces of paper and eventually you would get more and more nervous.

853
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:32,080
And eventually you would say, well, I think maybe this is finally the biggest piece of paper and you

854
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:38,640
guess. So what do you think the chances are of winning the game?

855
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,120
Well, of course, it depends on your strategy.

856
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:53,920
Well, that's right. You're right. There is a strategy. And the question is, what is the strategy?

857
01:57:56,080 --> 01:58:03,760
And the numbers don't have to be regular. They're not like in order. One, two, three,

858
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:12,800
four, five. One number is 1.6 and the other one is pi. The other one is 3,048 million and so on.

859
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:18,880
So there's no regularity in these numbers. I would say that if I was going to give a solution

860
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:24,080
without thinking too much about it, I would say this probably, you probably want to

861
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:32,000
turn over a certain number of cards to a certain point and then the next biggest one that you find,

862
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,560
it'll be something like this. But I don't know where that point would be though.

863
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:42,800
Okay. So that's absolutely correct. You're absolutely right. There is a strategy.

864
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:52,240
It's so simple. I mean, it's almost trivial. Of course, we use this process all the time.

865
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,320
How do you find the person that you're going to marry?

866
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:03,920
Okay. You date somebody. You say, nah, you date another person. You say, nah,

867
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:10,160
you date another person. Nah, eventually you come to a person who's better than all the previous

868
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:18,240
people and you say, this is the one for me. Now, it's the best I'll do. Well, you could be wrong

869
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:25,920
because if you intended to date a hundred people, you might have picked a person who was like

870
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:34,880
number 10 in the list and you didn't get the best person. So the question is, if you were going to

871
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:43,520
date a hundred people, how many people should you date before you decide to take the next

872
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:51,040
better one that comes along? And what's your chance of, in the end, the question really is,

873
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:58,800
what is the chance of winning the game? So would you give me one out of three odds that I can find

874
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:14,480
the best person in a hundred? Probably not, but I imagine I'm going to be proven wrong.

875
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,960
Well, okay, let's make it a harder game. What if there were a million

876
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:29,040
numbers in the box? You're going to date one million people before you decide. What's your

877
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:39,840
chance of finding the best one in that one million? Would you say that, would you give me

878
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:47,760
one in a thousand that I might get the best person in a million? Or would you say I have a

879
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:54,800
better or worse chance? I mean, that's the question. Yeah, so let's say we start with one box,

880
02:00:55,440 --> 02:01:03,120
one piece of paper in the first problem. Right, so it does depend on the number of

881
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:11,680
pieces of paper to a certain extent, right? It does. To an extent, it does.

882
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,080
But I don't think I'm going to be able to work this out on camera.

883
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:33,040
No, don't even try. What is amazing is that this is a way of defining a transcendental

884
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:47,120
number. Okay, so a very, very famous transcendental number is E. Okay, E numerically is

885
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:57,360
a little bit smaller than three. It's 2.718281828. Something, something, it goes on.

886
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:19,840
So it's roughly 2.7. Okay, so one over 2.7 is about 37.37. Okay, so now I'm going to tell you

887
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:30,240
the strategy for winning the game. You should date 30% of all of the girls that you intend to date

888
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:43,360
or boys, whatever you, okay, and don't choose any of them. The next bigger one that comes along

889
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:53,280
is what you pick. So to optimize your strategy, you should look at 37% of all of the numbers.

890
02:02:55,040 --> 02:03:04,480
And your chance of then winning the game will be 37% again.

891
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:13,440
But shouldn't it be the percentage of no, no, it's not. And that's,

892
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:20,000
I mean, this is a mathematical calculation that I can show you. It's pretty easy,

893
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:27,840
but it involves Taylor series. But the point here is it doesn't matter how many numbers there are,

894
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:38,080
there can be a billion numbers. But what you do is you look, your strategy is to look at 37%

895
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:47,920
of a billion, which is 370 million. So you look at the first 370 million numbers

896
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:55,600
and you say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not the biggest number. No, no, no. And you keep

897
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:02,720
saying that 370 million times. Now, of course, you could be wrong, in which case you'll lose the game.

898
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:13,120
Okay. But you may be right. And then your objective is to take the next bigger number

899
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:20,800
that comes along. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, it could be, of course, that the next bigger number

900
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:26,320
that comes along is not the biggest number, in which case, once again, you'll lose the game.

901
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:34,400
But the chance of you winning the game is also 37%. So it's better than one out of three.

902
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:43,920
And if you don't believe me, you can try it at home. Take 27 numbers, different numbers,

903
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:52,960
have your friend write it on 27 different pieces of paper, pick the first 10, say no,

904
02:04:52,960 --> 02:05:00,480
no, no, no, no, 10 times, and take the next bigger one that comes along. And you could make a,

905
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:08,480
if you do this over and over and over again, you'll see that your history, your probability of

906
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:23,520
winning the game is 37%, which is extraordinary, right? So 37% of 27 is about 10. So you look at

907
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:30,960
10 numbers and then you take the next bigger one and better than one out of three times,

908
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:38,240
you will win the game with that strategy. Okay. And as far as anybody knows, that's the optimal

909
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:42,960
strategy. That's the best possible strategy you can use. So you want to always win,

910
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,040
but you'll win more than one out of three times. No matter how many numbers there are,

911
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:57,600
that is beautiful. And it's not beautiful. It's not the argument so much. This is different from

912
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:08,320
the other example I gave you. It's that the answer is beautiful because it's amazing,

913
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:18,160
because it's so counterintuitive. Who would have thought that who could possibly have imagined

914
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:27,040
that your chance of winning the game, it doesn't make any difference how many numbers there are.

915
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:33,120
Your chance of winning the game is better if there are many numbers, of course. So it is very,

916
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:38,160
very slightly, as you pointed out, dependent on the number of numbers because if there's only one,

917
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:45,520
the chance is 100%. But as you get more and more numbers, it drops down to

918
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:56,000
1 over E or 37%. So for anyone out there who is on the dating scene and they think they're going

919
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:01,680
to be dating from, say, 20 through to 40, those are the years they have available,

920
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:10,240
and they date, say, one person a year, then after eight years of being frivolous with their dates,

921
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:16,240
they should then settle down for the next best person. Pick the next person who's better than

922
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:23,280
everything they came before. The problem is, there may not be. It may be that you've passed

923
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:32,240
your optimal mate. That's entirely the chance of screwing this up or choosing too early.

924
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:36,640
That is, you might pick the next better one that comes along, but there's an even better one.

925
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:46,000
So let's finish on... That's a very powerful strategy, don't you think? That's beautiful.

926
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,560
As you said at the beginning, this is what people actually do to a certain extent.

927
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:56,960
They date around when they're young, and then at some point,

928
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:01,280
they do settle down when they're... I don't know what the average is,

929
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:06,080
average marriage age. It might be about 30. So it sounds about right, actually.

930
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:14,240
Right. But the divorce rate is roughly 50%.

931
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,480
So both numbers work out.

932
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:25,600
Yeah. I mean, they're pretty close, right? I mean, if you just say, this is the one for me.

933
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,400
Okay. Of course, that person may look at you and say, well, you're not the one for me.

934
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,280
But of course, you could have numbers that are very close together.

935
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,120
So the next best number might not be so bad.

936
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:45,840
Right. That's right. And that's the human

937
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,280
feature. I mean, there may be lots of people who in the end would be a perfect mate,

938
02:08:53,280 --> 02:09:03,760
or not a perfect mate, but an excellent mate. And maybe we could define an excellent marriage

939
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:09,200
as one that doesn't end in divorce. Now, that may not be the right way to define a good marriage.

940
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:17,760
I mean, it may not be a happy one. But the chance of a happy marriage is not zero.

941
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,480
So you date a bunch of people and then you take the next better one that comes along.

942
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:30,800
That's the strategy that people basically tend to use. Sometimes they circle back to,

943
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:36,480
you have that option. In this game, you don't have the option of circling back.

944
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:44,800
Maybe the fact that the divorce rate is 50%, not 67% or something,

945
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,640
is the fact that people are allowed to circle back after they realize that they're screwing up

946
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,800
and they missed out. And sometimes you can fix the problem, right?

947
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:06,000
So let's end on, this is sort of a combined question.

948
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:16,400
But I'll put the combination of questions together. In 1900, Hilbert came up with his

949
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:22,000
famous Hilbert problems. There are these 23, some say 24 Hilbert problems, depending on how you

950
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:33,280
count. I would say just right away, this is a crucial turning point in the development of

951
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:47,200
mathematics. Because by doing this, what he essentially did was to split the field of mathematics

952
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:56,080
into two fields. What he said was that mathematics is beautiful, and that we solve problems in

953
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:02,000
mathematics not because they're going to be useful, but because they're just beautiful.

954
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:09,920
Okay. And there's a very elaborate way of defining beauty, as we know.

955
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:24,720
But he said mathematics certainly doesn't have to be useful. So if you want to know

956
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:32,400
how many six-dimensional balls, what is the optimal number, the maximum number of

957
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:37,280
six-dimensional spheres that will fit into a six-dimensional box?

958
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:49,200
You might say, who cares? And furthermore, even if I knew the answer, I couldn't test it in the

959
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:58,720
laboratory. Okay, that's how a physicist would respond. But more importantly, it wasn't important

960
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:06,320
if mathematics could be used by other branches of science. So that mathematics community, two

961
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:14,000
thirds of that community, followed Hilbert and said it doesn't have to be useful. It doesn't have to be

962
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:20,320
applicable. Roughly one third, or at least that's what the count is today,

963
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:32,320
have stayed in the, with the point of view that it has to be useful. It has to be relevant,

964
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:40,240
meaning it can be built on and eventually have a connection with reality, because we do know

965
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:48,160
that the physical world obeys mathematics. It really does, really seems to.

966
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:55,040
So these mathematicians are now called applied mathematicians,

967
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:03,680
and Hilbert's mathematicians became pure mathematicians, and mathematicians didn't have that

968
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:14,000
distinction. It was just mathematics. Okay, I am definitely of the one third variety.

969
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:28,560
And so to me, mathematics is a tool, and it is a lot of fun, and it's beautiful.

970
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:38,320
But ultimately, it should be useful. So for example,

971
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:50,240
a lot, my, one of my expertise, you know, in mathematics is the idea that, that although

972
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:58,560
almost all equations are impossible to solve, you have to learn what the answer is like.

973
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:04,320
What are the properties of the answer, even if you can't solve the problem exactly. So you have

974
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:12,960
to learn how to do approximate mathematics. And approximate mathematics, again, is something

975
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:20,880
that requires great care, but not rigor. And that's what I do. Okay, and that's the kind of

976
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:27,040
mathematics that's relevant in physics, because if you are, if you encounter a new physics problem,

977
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:33,040
you can't solve it. There's no chance that you're going to find the answer to a physics problem.

978
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:37,440
I mean, essentially, all of the problems that you can solve exactly have been solved.

979
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:46,800
And they all involve systems that are too simple to be realistic. Okay, so life is complicated.

980
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:52,960
You know, how do you predict the weather? Well, you can't predict the weather exactly.

981
02:14:53,520 --> 02:15:00,000
But the question is, what is the best approximation that you can make? And probably there's an

982
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:08,080
upper bound. You can't, you can't give better, maybe then a 80% accurate approximation, if you

983
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:15,680
want the weather two days from now. But how do you get the optimal approximation? Okay, this is

984
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:23,600
applied mathematics. And that is my, that is what I love to do. I love to be able to solve a problem

985
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:30,320
approximately and understand what the answer is like, to a high degree of approximation

986
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:36,400
without solving the problem exactly. If you had to pick your Hilbert problems,

987
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:46,320
what would you choose? It's, I could make up problems, but they wouldn't really be

988
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:53,840
of interest to me. They just wouldn't. I mean, you know, an example.

989
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:57,360
Oh, I meant for physics. I meant the ones you're interested in.

990
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,320
Oh, in physics.

991
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,680
I mean, your Hilbert problems.

992
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:05,280
Oh, oh, oh, Hilbert problems in physics. I don't think there are any.

993
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:10,640
No, no, I mean your version. Like, so, so Hilbert gave his 23 that he thought that were the most

994
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:18,080
important for mathematics to him personally. I mean, if you had to pick, you had your pick,

995
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:22,880
and you're now going to influence the, you're going to split the field of physics, you're going to

996
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:27,920
influence the future of the field. You don't have to pick 23, but there might be one or two

997
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:30,800
that you think are particularly close to your heart.

998
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:35,200
Well, there's certainly a bunch of problems that I would love to see answered.

999
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:43,600
Um, uh, one of them has to do with the acceleration and the expansion of the universe.

1000
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:53,040
The reason that I think this is such an interesting problem is that it may be an example of a problem

1001
02:16:53,040 --> 02:17:07,440
where, uh, where PT symmetry comes into play. Okay. Um, and the point is that, um,

1002
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:18,160
you know, this goes under the, under the heading of alternative theories of gravity.

1003
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,840
Okay. Because we know that gravity is attractive.

1004
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,840
Okay. But the universe is expanding and accelerating.

1005
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,040
So isn't gravity pulling back on it and stopping it from accelerating?

1006
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:42,560
And the answer is that, um, not the answer. Sorry. Be very careful. Not the answer, but a possible

1007
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:50,240
answer is that, you know, in electrodynamics, a positive and a negative charge attract.

1008
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:58,160
And they attract just as if there were, they were attracting gravitationally. They both have a one

1009
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:08,480
over R, uh, force. Okay. Or one over, I should say one over R potential. Okay. One over R squared

1010
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:18,160
Newtonian force. Okay. And a positive and negative charge attract. But you can make

1011
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:32,000
a PT symmetric theoretical model of electrodynamics. Okay. Where the electric charge is not a real

1012
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:39,920
number, but it's an imaginary number. Okay. But everything else is the same.

1013
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:49,520
And now you can ask, what happens? Well, what you find is that a positive and negative charge repel.

1014
02:18:49,760 --> 02:19:05,440
Okay. So one interesting possibility is that gravity at short distances, where short means on

1015
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:19,760
the scale of a galaxy at short distances, way out on a galactic scales, galaxy gravity is attractive.

1016
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:29,360
But on the scale of the universe, on very large scales, gravity is repulsive. So you can imagine

1017
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:39,200
a theory of gravity, which is where two masses attract. And all you need to do is to look at

1018
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:48,400
this theory in the complex plane. And now two masses repel. And if we have a bridge over

1019
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:56,640
distances shorter than some characteristic distance, gravity is attractive, but larger than

1020
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:04,560
this characteristic distance, it's repulsive, then we can understand something about the structure

1021
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:12,240
of the universe. And I think this is an example of a very hard, but very interesting problem.

1022
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:20,640
And so the idea is that PT symmetry is then broken at short distance scales and then not

1023
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:24,080
at long scales or right out. Okay.

1024
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:33,440
That's exactly right. So if you imagine that you begin with a universe that is PT symmetric,

1025
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:42,560
but it has a broken PT symmetry, that is, it has the symmetry, but it's not, it's like the water

1026
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:49,680
pales that are not connected with a pipe. Okay, it's PT symmetric, but it's still not an equilibrium

1027
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:56,800
because one pot is filling up and the other one is emptying out. So that has broken PT symmetry.

1028
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:04,960
But if you connect it with a pipe, it's unbroken PT symmetry. So therefore,

1029
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:15,920
you imagine the universe at great distances being somehow connected by a pipe, sort of.

1030
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:30,160
Okay. Well, we can imagine it being broken or unbroken, but the point here is that

1031
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:37,360
depending on the separation, it either is repulsive or it's attractive and there is

1032
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:47,600
some change over distance. That's the idea. So that's, I mean, that would be an example of a

1033
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:56,080
beautiful, wonderful problem. If you could solve it, of course, it seems to me you would deserve

1034
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:04,880
a Nobel Prize and that's a very, that would be a beautiful

1035
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:16,720
application of the ideas of PT symmetry. Okay. And use of the complex world to understand what

1036
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:25,920
is going on. This is work with Philip Mannheim, is it? Philip and I have done some work with

1037
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:31,200
of course, with that objective in mind, Philip is very smart, and he's very knowledgeable about

1038
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:38,800
ATG's, alternative theories of gravity. He's worked on conformal gravity and so on. In fact,

1039
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:48,880
I'm in discussion with a guy in London where I'm going in a few days, whose name is, he's actually

1040
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:57,520
in Greece, but he's coming to London, a guy named Marvo Matos, who is very knowledgeable about

1041
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:06,000
modern physics and gravitation. And we've been talking about this problem for a long time.

1042
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I mean, this would be a wonderful application of PT symmetry.

1043
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:16,080
Well, Carl, it's been an absolute pleasure having you on the podcast. Thanks for coming along.

1044
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:31,280
Pleasure to chat with you. I had lots of fun.
