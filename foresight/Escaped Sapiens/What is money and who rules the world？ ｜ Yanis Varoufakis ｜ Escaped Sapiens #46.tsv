0	2160	Who really runs the world today?
2160	4880	Is it politicians or multinational banks?
4880	6800	Or is it social media and tech giants?
7840	10000	In this conversation, I speak with economists,
10000	13120	politician and author Yanis Varoufakis,
13120	14960	who served as the Greek minister of finance
14960	17680	during the 2015 Greek credit crisis.
18640	20320	We discuss how economies crash,
20320	22560	the winners and losers of bank bailouts,
22560	24400	dysfunctions within the EU,
24400	27040	and the real power that politicians have access to
27040	28800	in the face of their political rivals
28880	32000	and the rising influence of social media and tech monopolies.
33120	34400	I'm Shane Farnsworth,
34400	36560	and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast.
37280	38560	These conversations are supported

46560	48960	And now, here's Yanis Varoufakis.
49840	50640	I hope you enjoy.
55840	58320	Just to make this more pleasurable though,
58320	60000	would you like a little bit of an overview,
60000	61840	or are you just happy to jump in?
61840	63040	Let's go straight in.
63040	64080	Let's go straight in.
64080	66640	Because I was originally going to ask you questions like,
66640	67040	what's the best place to go?
67040	68560	You ask me any questions you want.
68560	70320	Just don't give me any advance warning.
71040	72880	Feel free to ask anything you want.
72880	73760	I don't mind.
73760	75920	So what's the best place to go swimming in Greece then?
78080	83520	There is a cove on a barren island of the island where I live,
84080	87200	which is where I've asked my wife to scatter my ashes
87200	88160	when I'm done.
90080	91360	I don't even know what it's called,
91360	92640	because it's a barren island.
92640	95280	There's no name, at least not that I know.
95280	96720	For me, that's the spot.
97280	98880	But I'm not going to tell you how to find it.
98880	100160	I'm not going to give you the coordinates,
100160	101840	because it's a very well-kept secret.
103440	104080	But why?
104640	106240	What's the beautiful thing about the island?
106240	107120	What draws you to it?
109120	114000	Well, look, we live on an island about a stone's throw from Athens.
114800	118560	And because where we are, it looks to the other side of Athens,
118560	121360	so you can't see the aggliness of the cement blocks.
122320	125040	And we can see the beautiful mountains of the Peloponnese.
125040	130560	It feels as if we are a very, very long way from civilization.
131120	131680	But we're not.
131680	134080	We're only one hour's ferry, right?
134080	141040	And then on our little boat, we sail to this tiny island,
141040	144480	which is 20 minutes away, at 15 knots.
145280	147040	And on the other side of the island,
147600	151280	there is this little cove with deep blue waters
151840	154400	and pine trees coming all the way down to the sea.
155120	158880	And that's like being a million miles away.
160800	164160	And it's the human scale.
164160	169520	The trees are my height, a bit taller, maybe double my height.
170480	173840	The stones, the rocks, the fish, they're all, you know,
176240	178320	as I said, they're the human scale.
178320	179600	They're no sharks.
179600	180480	They're no cairns.
181040	185920	It is just like it was designed by some divinity for us.
187040	189760	So that's the best I can do.
190560	193360	So when you're dealing with politics and the economy all day,
193360	194640	just getting back and being a human.
194640	195680	It's all those old ways.
195680	199360	I just go there, put some music on, and I am away.
199760	201760	I'm in paradise.
202640	205200	And also the proximity, the fact that it's so close,
205200	206480	I can do this every day almost.
208400	210800	So let's do it in theory.
213440	215280	Well, especially when you're not anywhere and you agree,
215280	216320	so you can't do it.
216320	220320	But let's jump into the economy and politics then.
221520	224320	There's two real questions I want to ask you,
224320	225760	and they're very basic.
225760	227680	I basically want to ask you what money is
228480	231440	and who holds power in the world.
231440	233840	So these are the two questions.
233840	237600	And I thought I'd start off at a very basic level.
237600	240720	You used to be, oh, you've worked as an economics professor.
241440	244240	And so what I want to know is, in your mind,
245120	249120	is economics more like the study of psychology
249120	252800	or more like, say, physics in your mind?
254480	257040	Okay, big questions.
257680	258880	What's money?
258880	261360	The best definition of money I've come across
261360	262400	is by Karl Marx.
263920	269040	He defined money as the alienated ability of humankind.
270400	274400	I think it's such a poetic and accurate description
274400	279520	because money, you see, is a bit like in physics,
279520	280480	since you are a physicist.
280480	281360	It's a bit like light.
281840	287280	For centuries, there were deep divisions between scientists
287280	292240	on whether it's a stream of particles or a wave.
293040	295680	So you had huge disagreements.
295680	297440	Newton thought it was particles.
297440	298880	Maxon thought it was waves.
298880	300960	Democracy thought it was particles.
300960	302960	Pickle thought it was waves.
302960	305680	Antiline Stein comes on and says, guys, it's both.
305840	308800	Which is very difficult for the human mind
308800	311760	to wrap itself around the idea that it can be both
311760	314400	two things that are contradictory.
318240	322800	Now, in physics, you can actually prove these hypotheses.
323600	326000	You conduct experiments under controlled conditions,
326000	327200	and you can actually prove it.
328640	330800	Money is very similar in the sense
330800	332320	that it's got two different,
332400	335760	natures that seem absolutely incompatible with one another.
335760	337840	And yet, money is both those things.
339520	343520	The equivalent of the particle theory of light for money
343520	345920	is that it is a thing, that money is a thing.
345920	346880	It's a commodity.
348080	350080	You have wheat.
351200	355280	You have corn that can be used to eat.
356000	358560	It can be used to plow the fields.
359120	361280	And the form of seeds, that's capital.
362080	364880	But it can also be used in order to exchange.
364880	370720	So you exchange a pound of corn for a bundle of butter or something.
372160	376160	So there is a tendency to think of, especially the gold bugs,
376160	381200	those who believe that money has to be something tangible,
381200	383200	like gold, like a metal.
383200	385200	It must be substantial.
385600	390560	Not the figment of our imagination, like digital money, or paper money.
391680	398480	They tend to think of money as a thing, a commodity, a tangible.
399760	402080	And then there is a completely different view,
403760	408720	that money is nothing more than a transferable form of debt.
411120	414720	So, you can see that there is a big difference
414800	418960	so if you look at archaeological evidence, there is plenty of it,
419920	425200	that money did not emerge as a thing, but it emerged as a form of debt.
426080	438000	In Syria, in the Mesopotamia, we have evidence that the first form of widely, widely, widely
438240	446000	used money, were shards of clay with number zone.
447600	455600	And the idea was that the hedgewam, the landlord, the king, the tyrant, whatever,
456480	459840	would use these pieces of clay with number zone
460720	465360	to pay advanced payment of the wheat, the corn,
465360	470880	that had not already been produced, that would be produced after the harvest, to workers.
470880	475200	So, workers would go home at the end of each day, every week,
476320	481040	with one of those pieces of clay, with a number, and that's how numbers were invented.
482160	488640	That's how accounting happened. This is how writing was discovered or invented.
489840	494320	The first instances of writing had to do with these payment systems.
495520	501600	So, if it had the number two, it meant two pounds or ounces or something of wheat was owed to you,
501600	504640	because you had worked in the fields, so you'd have to wait for it.
504640	510880	Now, the beauty of it was, of course, that you didn't have to wait to cash it in for wheat.
510880	515520	You could use these pieces of clay to go to your next-door neighbor and say,
515520	518080	listen, you've got a goat, can I have some of its milk?
518080	526880	And here is a piece of clay that is like a tidal deed to an ounce of wheat in three months' time.
529680	534240	So, what is money? Is it a thing? Is it a promise?
535680	541440	Dead? And the answer is that it is both, in the same way that light is both.
542000	549600	So, that's the best I can do in order to introduce our audience to the complexity of money,
549600	554640	and why I love the definition of Marx, that it is the alienated ability of humankind.
555280	557920	It's been alienated from us, it's been abstracted,
558880	563280	but it reflects our ability to do things individually and collectively.
565280	568240	Your second question, I forgot because I'm getting old.
568240	571440	Well, we'll get into that towards the end of it. So, ultimately, we'll touch on
572720	574320	that's where we're going to end up.
575280	579760	Hopefully. We may not, but it depends where we take things.
581280	587680	So, this abstraction then, this is how I picture money as a shared fiction,
588400	592960	and I guess the next obvious question that I want to ask is,
593920	598400	when our economy crashes, when we go through some turbulent economic times,
599360	602960	what's happening there? Is it that the abstraction is breaking down,
602960	607760	that our shared fiction is breaking, or is something else going on at the lowest level?
610400	618080	Well, the shared fiction breaks down because promises have been made that cannot be kept.
619600	621680	That's what's going on. That's what the crisis is.
622960	628960	So, to the extent that the liquidity of an economic system
630560	635760	is a form of debt that is transferable, what's debt? It's a promise.
637520	643600	You give me the pint of milk, and I promise you something at the end of the month,
645760	649120	some wheat or pounds or sterling or whatever.
649760	664880	Now, in the old epochs, eras, you would have war, you would have pestilence,
664880	670240	you would have bad weather. That was the cause of the crisis really, earthquakes.
670240	682640	You didn't have a collapse of economic forces feeding into a kind of domino effect.
684000	692800	There were occasions when poverty or overextending a military effort, kings that
693600	699280	made too many promises to their people and to their soldiers as to how much loot they would get
699280	704400	if they pursue a war together and then if the war didn't go well, all these promises broke down.
704400	708960	But this was not an endogenous economic crisis. It was not a crisis of the economy. It was a
708960	715920	crisis of politics. It was a crisis of the weather. It was a crisis of a military campaign gone wrong.
716800	724960	It was the advent of capitalism that gave rise to purely economic crisis. The reason for that is
725520	734800	there's been a great transformation somewhere around the 18th century when we moved from
734800	744000	feudalism to capitalism. Because if you think about it, under feudalism, the order of play
744720	750160	was rather straightforward. First, you had production. The peasants toiled the land.
750960	757360	They produced goods, agricultural goods. That was the production phase. Production came first.
759040	765840	Second came the distribution phase. The lord would send the sheriff to the peasants,
767520	775360	armed and dangerous. The sheriff would steal a percentage of the harvest on behalf of the landlord.
775440	780880	It was just pure theft on behalf of legalized theft. That's what feudalism was, right?
781440	789840	So you had distribution. This second phase, violent phase, at least potentially violent phase,
790640	794480	determined how much of the produce would stay with the peasants, how much would go with the landlord.
795040	799200	And then the third phase was financialization. The landlord could not eat all that stuff.
799920	806240	So the landlord would sell it in rudimentary markets that were marginal to production,
806240	815920	but nevertheless important, get cash and use that cash either to arm his soldiers or to build
815920	824160	a better castle or to found a church or to lend it. Because the lords were the money lenders as
824160	830080	well, because they were the only ones who had money. So you had production, distribution and
830080	837280	financialization. In societies like that, it was impossible to have an endogenous economic crisis.
838080	845200	But with the advent of capitalism, the transformation, when the peasants were expelled from the land,
845200	851280	they were replaced by sheep in England, in Scotland, in Wales, because wool was an international
851280	855200	commodity by then, due to the discovery of international trade rules and the creation of
855200	861760	international trade rules. You have the creation of a working class, which is landless. They've
861760	871920	been evicted. They live in slums now, outside the land. The land now is commodified. It is leased
872480	878800	to former peasants or to the sheriff or whoever, who now becomes a proto-capitalist who hires laborers
879760	888720	now and pays rent to the landlord. But these proto-capitalists, to make business work,
889520	895600	to start production, first they had to borrow, because they had to pay wages up in upfront,
896240	900480	so that the workers would not die of hunger, not because they were nice people, but because
900480	904480	otherwise they wouldn't be able to get them to work. And also they had to pay the landlord
904880	913840	rent before the harvest came in. So suddenly what you have is a complete reversal. It used to be
913840	918560	production, distribution, finance. Now it's finance, distribution, and finally production.
920160	931120	And this reversal unleashed tremendous productive powers. Workers were forced to be far more
931120	938080	efficient. The entrepreneurs, the proto-capitalists, because they were struggling themselves to keep
938080	944000	their nose above water, they had to improve efficiency. They had to invest in machinery
945200	950080	in order to enhance labor productivity, because they were in competition with one another and
950080	960640	anyone who didn't do it simply went bankrupt. So because finance now is at the beginning
960640	966400	of this production process. Finance is the linchpin for this new system called capitalism.
967440	977120	Bankers begin to emerge as the liquidity providers of this system, the lubricants,
977120	984000	the lubricators of the system. And the more this system becomes efficient, the greater the cut
984000	992800	that the bankers retain. So the way I've described this is in a book a few years ago,
992800	1001920	was to say that it is a bit like bankers had time traveling hands. They would push their hand
1001920	1009120	through the membrane of the timeline and extract value from the future that has not been created
1009120	1014800	yet. Bring it to the present to fund the production that will produce the values of the future.
1015520	1023520	And that of course made them central in this chain and allowed them to become very rich.
1023520	1029360	And the more they lend, the more value they extracted from the future to bring to the present,
1030400	1036720	the richer they go. But that meant that at some point they extracted so much value from the future
1037600	1041920	that the present could not be delivered. The present could not repay the future.
1041920	1048000	And that's when promises are broken. Debt are issued that cannot be repaid. And when those
1048000	1054000	accumulate at some point, like grains of sand that you lay one on top of the other at some point,
1054880	1058800	there's going to be an implosion. And that's an economic crisis. At that point,
1059760	1066320	you have a situation where the alienated ability of humankind is in crisis,
1066960	1076640	it's in a vortex, and you've got unpayable debts. And that's when you have the eradication of debts,
1077280	1080560	because debts that cannot be paid will not be paid.
1081520	1090240	So in 2008, where we had the bailout of the banks, I want to understand how dirty this
1090240	1095920	process was. Because if I follow what you're saying, what I understand is happening is that the
1095920	1100560	banks have a whole bunch of assets that have accumulated that are not good, they're toxic
1100560	1104480	in some sense, like loans that will never be repaid, this sort of thing. And so then the
1104480	1110640	central bank steps in and buys them all out at some price. That's sort of, in some sense,
1110640	1114560	if I understand you putting the hand into the future, I want to understand.
1114560	1118960	Ah, no, no, it's not the same thing. Because you see, when you put your hand into the future,
1118960	1124800	you extract value to bring it in to produce new value. What happened with the central banks was
1124800	1135920	none of that. It was simply printing money to make failed bets all. Not the same thing. There
1135920	1145760	was never any productive benefit from doing this. They salvaged the banks by creating money to replace
1145760	1151440	their busted flushes, their busted wages, their busted bets.
1152400	1159520	I guess then the question that I have is, ultimately, who wins and who loses? Who is it
1159520	1164880	that's paying to buy out those busted bets, the toxic assets?
1168160	1174240	Well, it depends on what's happening in the rest of the economy as well. I'm quite relaxed about
1174960	1183680	you know, forgiving debts and writing them off. You have to do it. As I said, an unpayable debt
1183680	1188880	will not be paid. So you need to write it off. There are two ways of writing it off. One is to
1188880	1196720	just write it off. Really, very simple. Say, okay, this IOU is going to be torn up because it
1196720	1204320	cannot be paid. That, to me, is the honest and uncomplicated way of doing it. But if you want to
1204320	1214000	pretend that the debt is sacred and it will be repaid, then the only way of pretending that an
1214000	1226640	unpayable debt can be repaid is by constantly rolling it over, lending the busted entity,
1226640	1234800	the failed banker, for instance, money, continue to give him liquidity in the form of, you know,
1234800	1242880	short-term, medium-term, long-term debt, so as to allow him to pretend that he is honoring the
1242880	1250640	IOUs that he's issued. Now, again, it really is no skin of my nose whether you excuse him the debt
1251280	1258480	or whether you roll it over. So the question is, what else is happening, however, around this little
1258480	1265520	drama? Because the tragedy of 2008 and beyond was that while we had socialism for the bankers,
1266160	1274800	you know, the central banks were printing state money to give it almost philosophically to the
1274800	1282240	bankers, they were imposing harsh austerity on the innocence of the people who had not done
1282240	1287920	nothing wrong and who had not benefited for years and years and years through financialization, through
1288640	1297600	betting on impossible horses in the financial sector. So when you have socialism for the
1298960	1304160	very few who happen to be the financiers and austerity for everybody else, you end up with a
1304160	1311200	catastrophe that we've experienced over the last ten years, because the financiers get their money,
1311360	1319600	there is the ethical question as well, right? The people who created the crisis
1320560	1327040	get power and money. And the people who suffered the crisis and who never benefited from the
1328000	1333360	makings of the crisis, the many, are suffering austerity, they can't put food on the table.
1333600	1342880	They can't go to sleep at night because they are so surrounded, so much in the clasps of angst
1342880	1348080	about how they're going to make ends meet by the end of the week. But besides the ethical
1348080	1356000	point, there's a macroeconomic point as well, because the industrialists, the people who benefited
1356000	1362320	from socialism for the very few for the oligarchy, look at, you know, they have all this money which
1362320	1366400	is being printed by the central banks and given to them, right? But they're never going to invest it,
1367040	1371920	because not because they don't want to invest, they would like it, they would like to invest it,
1371920	1380160	but they look out there and they see the masses, the multitudes being impecunious and finding it
1380160	1386000	very hard to make ends meet and they think, I'm not going to produce snazzy expensive products
1386000	1392160	for them, they won't be able to afford it. So if you're Volkswagen in 2009, you're not going to say
1392240	1399440	I'm going to produce an alternative to a Tesla, an expensive $100,000 electric car,
1399440	1405040	because who the hell is going to buy it? Look at them. I'll make little golfs with stupid little
1405040	1413360	polluting diesel engines, as I was doing before. I will fake their exhaustive measurements as well
1413360	1419120	and, you know, make money out of that, out of the little people with, you know, small dirty little
1419200	1426480	cars that sell to them. So you've got very low levels of investments and that also augurs really
1426480	1431760	badly for the green transition, because for 13 years we have not invested in the green transition
1431760	1438480	as we should have and we can see the effects on the environment now. You can see it on electricity,
1438480	1449040	I mean, we have under invested for 13 years. So the tragedy, the crime of the post 2008 period
1449040	1457840	is not just that you have excused those busted wages of the finances and that you have printed
1457840	1463760	money as if in the context of socialism for the rich to give to them. It's also that the austerity
1463760	1468640	you've imposed upon people in the European Union, people in the United Kingdom, people in the United
1468640	1475760	States, I mean, here in this country where the champions were stated, world record record holders
1475760	1481440	when it came to state, to idiotic austerity, self-defeating austerity. And the result is that
1481440	1486560	you have very low levels of investment. And when you have very low levels of investment,
1486560	1493600	what does this mean? It means that demand is low and it means that the only way you can keep
1494400	1501760	finances in health, in better commerce or alive or zombified, call it what you might, may
1502320	1505680	is to keep printing money to give to them because they're not going to get it from the
1505680	1509920	little people because the little people don't have any and because there's no investment to produce
1509920	1517120	new wells for the bankers to benefit. So for 13 years after 2008, we have had rude health
1517840	1526480	in the financial markets, which was, however, driven by state money that was printed and printed,
1527120	1534240	to keep the finances, boisterous, while the rest of the economy was shrinking.
1537440	1543200	So how long can you push this for? There's sort of two questions I want to ask. The first is,
1543200	1547440	what would you have done instead? What's the alternative? Did you have to inject the money
1547440	1552880	up to the level of banks or could have you given money to the people who made the,
1553840	1557040	you know, did you have to inject money at the level of the banks or could have been at the
1557040	1565120	level of the people? And what is the long-term impact if we continue to do quantitative easing
1565120	1569040	and we continue to give austerity to the people and not the banks?
1570480	1576640	Well, the first question that came out of your mouth was, how long can this last for? The answer
1576640	1582880	was until the pandemic, because now it's all collapsing around us. We can see that.
1583760	1588880	But before I explain why that is happening, let me answer your other question. What could
1588880	1596000	we have done instead? And I think you already embedded into your question the proper answer.
1597680	1603440	The first thing you do is, of course, you save the banks because banks are not like other businesses.
1603440	1610720	If a bike shop shuts down, okay, you don't have bikes. But a bank, for better or for worse,
1610720	1620000	I think for worse, the banks own the payment system. Forget credit. You know, whenever you want to buy
1620000	1627520	coffee these days or buy a book or go to the movies or whatever, you need to make a payment.
1628080	1635600	And you make a payment using your debit card or credit card or even some ATM from which you
1635600	1641840	withdraw money. And that's all owned by the banking system, by the early gobbling of the banksters.
1643520	1647600	So you need to save those banks. You can't allow the ATMs to shut down and the payment system to
1647600	1652480	collapse because then you'll have another great depression like we had after 1949.
1653120	1660320	And only monsters, Nazis and fascists emerge from that. But it's one thing to say you should save
1660320	1667520	the banks. It's quite another to say that you must save the bankers. So what I would have done,
1667520	1671600	I would have picked up the phone and called them and say, I've got some good news and I've got
1671600	1676800	some bad news. We will save the bank. That's a good news. The bad news, we're not going to save you.
1676800	1684960	You are out. So shareholders are wiped out. Board of directors are fired.
1686080	1693040	They are nationalized and they're saved. And this is not buying the sky stuff.
1693040	1700480	This is precisely what happened in 1998 in South Korea. The Korean state got into the
1701200	1709440	failed private banks, took them over, drove out the board of directors. I remember I was having
1709440	1714960	a very intense conversation with the finance minister of South Korea. And I asked him, how did
1714960	1718800	you do that? Because we are having such difficulty. I mean, you know, bankers are so powerful people.
1720080	1724240	So powerful people. I mean, they have more powerful than they have more power than us
1724880	1730480	ministers of finance, you know, they can fire us. He said, well, we'll use them in a very,
1730480	1736720	very good institution in Korea. He said, what? He said, well, the Marines. I said the Marines in
1736720	1741440	and had them leave the building at gunpoint. I thought, that's a very good idea.
1744320	1747840	So they saved the banks and within a year and how they had sold them back to the private sector,
1747840	1752880	because they were not Marxists, they were left wing lingers like me, but they didn't save the bankers.
1753680	1762160	So the message to bankers was, if you, if you steer your bank onto the rocks,
1763200	1767440	and it starts sinking, we will save the vessel, but not you. So big.
1769280	1774000	Okay, that was number one thing that I would. Can I ask just quick quickly, did that have
1774000	1780640	a lasting effect? So what happened in 2008 and later on, did Korea have a sort of softer journey
1780640	1788480	as a result of that prior policy? Absolutely. Look at the data Korea had next to no crisis in 2008.
1789840	1796480	What had happened in 1998 shielded Korea from the vagaries of Wall Street, the city of London,
1796480	1801360	what's happening in the European Union, come from, from strength to strength.
1801840	1809920	And it wasn't just South Korea, it was six years before South Korea, it was Scandinavia.
1810800	1816320	The Scandinavian banks in 1992 went bust, all of them that made some stupid decisions,
1816320	1822560	and they all went bust, Swedish banks, Danish banks, Norwegian banks, Finnish banks,
1823280	1830720	and the states back then, they were social democratic back then, no longer, they,
1832080	1837040	they bailed out the banks, got rid of the bankers, nationalized the banks, and then sold them off
1837040	1843040	in within two years back to the private sector to different bankers. And they didn't have the same
1843040	1849280	problems in 2008 that the Anglo, the Anglo sphere had, as well as the European Union.
1850080	1855120	So that's one thing I would do, save the banks, not the bankers. The second thing I would do,
1855120	1862480	and you already foreshadowed that in your question, if I wanted to boost demand,
1863360	1867280	I would not give it to the financiers, I wouldn't print money to give to the financiers,
1867280	1873440	I would give it to the little people. I mean, Donald Trump did it, and then Joe Biden continued
1873520	1879760	with the checks in the mail too little bit. The Australian government did it in 2009
1880560	1886160	under Kevin Rudd, and the result was that Australia did not have a recession in 2009,
1886160	1891280	because every household, you probably recall that, got something between 10,000 and 20,000
1891280	1896400	Australian dollars. It missed me, unfortunately. I was a little bit annoyed about that.
1896400	1900080	Yeah, yeah, yeah, all my friends got the, yeah.
1902320	1907200	So, you know, even during the pandemic, when the central bank of Europe was printing,
1907200	1912720	as if there was no tomorrow, I was warning them, I was saying, you're creating a gigantic bubble
1912720	1918000	in the real estate, because the money will go from the central bank, the financiers,
1918000	1921520	from the financiers to their mates, their mates are going to take the stock exchange
1921600	1927120	or buy flats in Berlin. Asset prices will go through the roof. That will create asset
1927120	1935360	price inflation. That will increase the shortfall, actually reduce further investment,
1936240	1940480	and that's going to shrink aggregate supply of goods and services. And then at some point,
1940480	1944240	some of that money will leak into the economy, and there's going to be inflation,
1944800	1951680	and then you'll be stopped, which is where they are. So the alternative proposition was,
1952800	1961360	why don't you just send some like 500 euros I proposed, or 1,000 years, or 2,000 years,
1961360	1969680	depending on the length of the pandemic, send it to people's bank accounts. And the most astonishing
1969680	1975920	answer I got from German colleagues, politicians and bankers and so on, is you can't do that.
1975920	1983280	So why can't you do it? He said, we don't have the know-how. So what? Because our social security
1983280	1989280	numbers are not connected to our banking system, and therefore technically we cannot even send
1989280	1996160	them money. We can't do what Trump and Biden did. And I thought, my goodness, this is the state of
1996160	2004240	Europe. The great German efficient state cannot even find its citizens and give them some money.
2004880	2012560	They can take them, they can't give it. Okay, so this makes me think of something else that
2012560	2021840	I'm quite curious about, which is that in Europe, we don't have big tech competitors. So for example,
2021840	2029360	there's no, you know, French Twitter. There's no, why is it that on these technical grounds,
2030160	2033760	people seem more competent in the United States? Why is it that you have these,
2035040	2037760	you know, blossoming tech companies that are missing here?
2040560	2050000	Well, the hegemon always produces cutting edge technologies. Before America rose,
2050400	2056400	almost every important technological breakthrough was made in Cambridge, Oxford,
2056400	2062000	the University College of London, in Britain. Britain was the empire. It produced the technological
2062000	2069520	advances. Before that, it was Rome. So there's nothing terribly surprising about that.
2070400	2077440	Size also matters. You have a very large economy in the United States. You've got English.
2077440	2082800	You've got the size of America. You've got English. So if you were going to start Twitter
2085120	2091840	in France, it wouldn't really go that far. Twitter went far because from day one,
2092480	2098640	it was used by us Greeks, by Australians, by the Portuguese and so on and so forth.
2100160	2106080	And first mover advantage is everything. So once you created Facebook, there can't be another
2106080	2112800	Facebook even in the United States, even in the United States. If you and I had a much better
2112800	2124720	software for a Facebook competitor, it wouldn't matter because if anyone wants to join
2126880	2132880	something like Facebook, they will go to where their friends are. So there is the first mover
2132960	2139760	advantage, which is really very strong. Now, the only country that has developed competitors,
2139760	2145600	real competitors, substantial competitors, very strong competitors to big tech is China.
2146400	2155680	But that's because there was a political project to do so. They understood really very well that
2155680	2164240	if the whole of the Chinese political economy and society enter Facebook, Twitter,
2165760	2173360	buy everything from Amazon.com and so on, any possibility of autonomous growth and development
2173360	2183520	in China is gone. Europe never understood that. And we now are in this kind of
2185280	2191200	semi-war between Europe and America over social media. You've got the European Commission
2191200	2199680	constantly sniping at Twitter, at Facebook, at Google, at Apple, imposing fines. Ms. Westager,
2199680	2205440	she does well. I mean, she's right on many of the issues that she's got. But as you pointed out,
2207840	2214800	this is just a defensive war. There is no attempt or capacity of the European Union,
2214800	2218880	despite the fact that we are more than the Americans put together. We're richer than the
2218880	2223920	Americans put together. We have a lot of technologies. We cannot bring it together
2224800	2230720	and create either competitive to Amazon.com or to Alibaba in China.
2231360	2236160	So with every crisis and every technological advance, Europe falls behind both China and
2236160	2240240	the United States of America. It still surprises me that you say this because
2241200	2247360	we had, for example, MySpace, which was taken over by Facebook. And I guess now Facebook shares
2247360	2253680	are really tumbling in the last weeks. And I guess TikTok is sort of rolling over YouTube.
2253680	2257920	So there are examples of other tech companies rising up.
2269280	2276480	Do you think the EU is taking appropriate steps then to break up these monopolies?
2276640	2285200	No. You think they should go further? Or how should they help companies in their own sort
2285200	2292000	of domain develop competitors? How about having a lobotomy to begin with and start in a fresh
2292560	2300240	because the situation with the European Union is beyond a joke. They have completely failed
2300240	2307440	to rise up to the great challenges of the time. And what are the great challenges of the time?
2307440	2313040	The banking crisis of 2008, the European Union made a complete and utter mess of it. The result
2313040	2318160	now is that we have 13 years of centrifugal forces tearing the European Union of Art.
2318800	2323840	And that has never subsided. They just threw a lot of printed money on the problem
2324720	2329600	under Mario Draghi. But without solving the underlying centrifugal forces that are tearing
2329600	2340160	us apart. So banking crisis, disaster. Green energy, catastrophe, catastrophe. I mean,
2340160	2342960	think about it. We have something called the European Union, but we do not have
2344720	2351360	an energy plan for Europe. Germany has its own plans. And we saw how great those were
2352320	2362800	when put in invaded the Ukraine. France has its own polyonic nuclear based plan.
2363600	2367520	Half of the nuclear power stations now that they're necessary because the
2368160	2376000	height and price of natural gas are now defunct. They're out of commission. Greece has its own
2376000	2383600	plan. It's pathetic. I wish we had a European Union. We do not. We have something that
2383600	2391760	pretends to be a union. Artificial intelligence, nothing, zero. There's no plan for artificial
2391760	2399040	intelligence. There are pockets of AI here and there. But nothing like the concentrated
2399040	2404240	investment on AI that the Japanese have, that the Koreans have, that the Chinese have. Of course,
2404240	2415280	the Americans. You've got a lot of rent seeking in Europe. There is hardly any entrepreneurship
2415280	2421440	happening. They're all, you know, the big wigs are simply trying to extract whatever value has
2421440	2431040	already been created without producing new value. And we do not have a government. We have a bureaucracy
2432000	2438400	whose job in Brussels is to behave like the bureaucracy of a cartel. The nearest
2439200	2446400	parallel analog to the European Union Commission is OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
2446400	2452880	Countries. They have a bureaucracy. Their purpose is to coordinate the activities of the different
2452880	2458560	countries with a view to simply maximizing the extraction of ransom on the rest of the world.
2459440	2467440	But this can never be the source of innovative thinking about creating new values. It's only
2468160	2474080	innovative thinking about how to corner existing markets. That's what the European Union Commission
2474080	2478320	is. And whenever they have a good idea, because there are some good ideas that come out of the
2478320	2489360	commission, since I remember in the 1990s, they've all been vetoed by Berlin, all of them,
2489360	2494880	every single one of them. In some European Union Council has been vetoed by Berlin. And if not
2494880	2500800	by Berlin, by one of the 100 maidens of Berlin, because sometimes Berlin doesn't want to be seen
2500880	2511440	to be the bad guy or girl in the case of Berlin. So they asked the Slovak or the Dutch to veto it
2511440	2518320	on their behalf. So then what does the US have that the EU is lacking? What is it that makes
2518320	2523600	the US function, which doesn't allow the EU to function a similar way?
2523920	2534080	Common debt, treasury bills. You know the treasury, the US treasury. We have a central bank here in
2534080	2541120	Europe and they have a central bank. But if you think of how we constructed it, it was as if
2541120	2549840	constructed by morons in order to serve slaves. Because what we did, we created the central bank
2549840	2557040	without a state behind it. There's no state that can have the back of the European central bank.
2559440	2566080	And you have 19 states, now it's 20 states that use this central bank for the money, but cannot
2566080	2572800	rely on it in case there's a banking crisis to bail them out. Because by its constitution,
2572800	2577120	it's not allowed to bail them out. So they had to bend the constitution of the ECB,
2577120	2582080	the charter of the ECB in order to bail them out. But to do this, they had to get the permission
2582080	2588880	from Berlin to do it. So it's a catastrophe. It's exactly what Alexander Hamilton in the United
2588880	2594960	States was trying to avoid and succeeded in avoiding. Situation where you have different
2594960	2602320	states, different formal colonies, supposedly one country, but without common debt. Common debt is
2602320	2610240	everything. It's what binds states together. What binds the British together is not so much,
2610240	2619920	you know, the Royal Family. It is the bound and the fact that the north of England and the south
2619920	2627440	of England share the debt, the national debt. That's what gives substance to countries. How long
2627520	2634480	with languages and traditions and conventions and all that jazz, as they say?
2635760	2641760	I don't want to sound too conspiratorial. You mentioned the system is created as though by
2641760	2650160	morons. But could it be that it was constructed in this way to force federation further down the
2650160	2656240	line? Is there some sort of intent behind a system which seems not to work currently in your mind?
2658080	2667280	Look, there were some smart people who thought of the Euro and the European Central Bank in those terms.
2668240	2674320	And one of them was President Mitterrand of France, François Mitterrand, in the 80s and 90s.
2676800	2682560	I have done good authority, I've written about this. I put a friend of mine who was in the room
2682560	2689360	in 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty, which is the foundational treaty of the Euro,
2689360	2695680	and the European Central Bank, was signed. There was a discussion between the President of France,
2695680	2701600	François Mitterrand, and the President of the European Commission at the time, Jacques Delors,
2701600	2704960	who was a friend of Mitterrand and who had been his finance minister many years before,
2705680	2710880	with a friend of mine in the room. And Jacques Delors, representing the European Commission at
2710880	2717600	the time, was trying to convince the French president that it is important to have two
2717600	2727520	pylons, two legs for the Eurozone. One should be the Central Bank to guarantee monetary stability,
2727520	2735680	and another one should be something like an investment ministry or a treasury that would
2736240	2743200	borrow on behalf of the whole of the Eurozone area in order to invest, so there would be the
2743200	2751120	stability leg and the growth or development leg, which of course meant a political union.
2752080	2757280	It meant that if you have a common debt, you have to have common rules, who borrows,
2757920	2763280	you need to have a common parliament or parliamentary process to approve the common debt.
2764240	2769280	And François Mitterrand turned around and said what he said. He said, listen, Jacques,
2770960	2777040	that would be great to do that. We can't do it. We don't have the political clouds to do it at the
2777040	2785680	moment. What we can do is we can create a monetary union, and this is where the old fox, François Mitterrand,
2786160	2796720	proved yet very clear vision of the future. He said, when the next large financial crisis comes,
2797680	2803280	our successors will have to choose between letting this whole thing collapse or federating
2804080	2809920	or doing what you're suggesting. So this is precisely what you're saying. However,
2810880	2818800	he was wrong. And he was wrong for reasons that a British Cambridge economist
2820400	2830080	had foreseen in 1971, in April 1971, Nicolas Calder was his name, a well-known economist
2830080	2835520	of the Cambridge tradition, who was actually Eurofiled. He wanted the European Union to come
2835600	2842800	together, and he was writing that paper as somebody who's worried about the future of the
2842800	2849040	European common market back then, the European Union today. So this is now April 1971, just before,
2849040	2854320	a few months before the collapse of the Bretton Wood system and the fixed exchange rates, when the
2854320	2859840	Europeans could see that it was happening, that the exchange rates would no longer be fixed. They
2859840	2864720	needed the exchange rates to be fixed because the European Union was a cartel. They were trying to
2864720	2869920	sell, to fix the price of coal, to fix the price of steel, to fix the price of cars. If exchange
2869920	2874080	rates between France and Germany and Italy and Holland go up and down, it's very difficult to
2874080	2879120	fix prices. So they needed the fixed exchange rates that the Americans were providing under
2879120	2883760	the Bretton Woods. And they could see that these fixed exchange rates would blow up. So they were
2883760	2890960	already planning a common currency or fixed exchange rates in Europe as a prelude to the
2890960	2898240	Euro back in 1971. And Caldor in the news statement said this. He said it would be a gross mistake.
2899040	2903680	I don't have his names now, his words in my head to tell you about, but I can assure you,
2903680	2909920	you can look it up. I've republished that paper as well in my books, in a couple of my books.
2910480	2918960	He said, if we make the mistake of thinking that through a monetary union,
2919840	2929520	we create a stepping stone towards federation. We will have killed off, maybe that was not
2929520	2935280	the words used. We will have annulled the possibility of a political union. Because he explains,
2936480	2942000	a monetary union without a political union is like putting the cart before the horses.
2942720	2949040	A monetary union without a political union in common debt is going to create a gigantic financial
2949040	2959120	crisis by itself. And when it hits, we are going to suffer massive centrifugal forces,
2959120	2965680	politically, socially, at the level of discourse, and the Europeans will not be able to politically
2965680	2969280	to unite after that. And I think that this is exactly what happens.
2971120	2976880	I suppose you're alluding to the rise of sort of right-leaning politicians and...
2978880	2985120	Not just. After, you know, when the banking crisis happened, it started in Wall Street,
2985120	2992480	as it usually does. Like 1929, it started in 2007, 2008 in Wall Street. Then very soon after that,
2992480	2997600	we realized that the French and the German banks were kaput, gone. Okay.
3000880	3006720	A domino effect starts. Once the German and the French banks are bankrupt, they can no longer
3006720	3012560	roll over the Greek government debt, the Italian government debt, the Irish government debt,
3012560	3018160	because they were the banks that were lending those dates. And then there is, of course,
3018160	3027680	a feedback loop, because once the front page of newspapers is full of news of the Greek
3028320	3034880	state's bankruptcy, and everybody knows that the Greek state owes 120, 130 billion euros
3034880	3040880	to the German banks and another 100 to the French banks, then that makes the position
3040880	3046640	of the French and the German banks even worse. And then what happens is, then politicians start
3047200	3052800	pointing accusatory fingers at one another. The German politicians are pointing their fingers
3052800	3058800	at the Greeks. You messed this thing up. It is because you were so spendthrift and because you
3058800	3065120	sung and played the Buzuki under the sun in the summer and it didn't work. And then the Greeks
3065120	3069200	turn around and the pointing accusatory fingers at the German in the beginning, you're Nazis.
3069200	3073600	You've never been anything other than Nazis. That's it. It's finished. At that moment,
3074400	3078640	you have centrifugal forces at the cultural level, the political level, the ethical level,
3079680	3088400	the every level. And you go now to any German or any Greek, any Dutchman or woman or French person
3088400	3094000	and say, do you think it's a good idea that we should federate in Europe? They say, bugger off
3094960	3103120	immediately, which would not be the case before 2010. So I think that Nicolas Calder was
3103120	3111040	completely present. So sort of shot ourselves in the foot. I noticed that so in respect for the
3111040	3119840	time, we're going to have to wrap up fairly soon. Can I just ask with a few and with a few quick
3119840	3130800	questions about power? So the main one is who holds the power today? Is it Musk? Is it Biden?
3130800	3136000	Is it the head of the IMF or Goldman Sachs? Where does power really reside today?
3140160	3147280	The hardest aspect of contemporary society to comprehend
3149120	3154480	is that we live in a capitalist world or post capitalist world,
3154960	3161360	where power has been concentrated tremendously
3164640	3170080	inside the confines of a new form of capital
3172880	3180400	without any human being, Musk, Biden, whoever, being in command of it.
3181040	3187760	If you look at Musk on a minute-by-minute basis, if you actually watch him work,
3187760	3192880	you can see that this is a driven man who's got enormous resources at his disposal,
3192880	3201680	but given his ambition and his different projects, he's very constrained. He feels the pressure.
3201680	3206320	He doesn't feel like somebody who can do anything. He doesn't feel like God. Similarly, Jeff Bezos,
3207280	3214800	he's got hundreds of billions stashed away in terms of wealth, but he too feels constrained.
3216160	3220000	So this is a great tragedy and a great paradox. It's like an ancient Greek tragedy.
3220640	3224400	If you're watching or Shakespeare, if you're watching a Shakespearean play,
3225440	3233440	this is the third. What do you see? You see powerful men on a stage who nevertheless,
3233440	3238080	their great tragedy is that the more power they have, the more powerless they feel,
3239840	3245120	and it's the nature of the game which extracts power from the many,
3245840	3249600	concentrates in the hands of a few who are tragic figures and therefore powerless.
3250320	3254640	This is how I understand the capitalist post-capitalist system we live in,
3254640	3260320	and that's why I continue to be a leftist who thinks that capitalism is neither natural nor
3260400	3267840	pleasant or stable for that matter. In the end, we've created magnificent machines
3269040	3275840	that had the capacity of being our slaves. I'm a tech enthusiast. I love machinery.
3275840	3281280	I love technology, but in the end, we become the slaves of the machines, and that is not
3281280	3285680	simply to say that this is the rich versus the poor. There is, of course, the rich versus the poor.
3285680	3293200	We see this on a daily basis, but in the end, even the rich, even the Elon Musk's of the world,
3293760	3300800	the Jeff Bezos's of the world, they are also victims of this enslavement of the whole of
3300800	3307600	humanity to our artifacts. A kind of Dr. Frankenstein who created the thing, this capitalist thing,
3308320	3316000	which has taken over and is threatening our very existentialist condition.
3316800	3322480	Did you also feel that at your core, in the place of the finance minister of Greece,
3323280	3328320	did you feel that you had less or more power than what you anticipated when you entered the role?
3329280	3333360	Oh, I had exactly as much power as I had anticipated, precisely zero.
3334160	3340560	I knew I would have none. I knew I would have none because, remember, the only reason why I was
3340560	3346480	elected was because we had a massive bankruptcy, and I had become the finance minister of the most
3346480	3353360	bankrupt state in the world after Puerto Rico, maybe. I knew that I wouldn't have any power.
3353360	3361360	The only power I had was the power to say no, not to put my signature on another credit card
3361360	3368080	on behalf of my people. That's why I was so demonized and so despised by the powers that be.
3368080	3375680	They could not believe that I had the audacity not to take their money. Okay, guys.
3378000	3384000	So let me end by asking you. I mean, you took the job.
3384000	3388480	I didn't take the job. I mean, you're a moral imperative.
3389680	3397200	Yeah. So let me end by asking, it's actually two questions. How do you decide,
3397920	3404800	as a Marxist or a socialist, which trenches to die in? So for example, do you buy shares? Do you
3407200	3413680	shop in Amazon? Where do you decide on moral or ethical grounds? No, I'm not going to go down
3413680	3419040	that path. So that's the first question. And to wrap up, let me answer it because I won't
3419040	3425920	forget it. Firstly, I don't buy shares. I have a natural and antipathy and ideological opposition
3425920	3431600	to share markets. That's why my last book, which was a science fiction novel and other now,
3432160	3438400	where I try to imagine a different world, there are no share markets. So no, I don't believe in
3438400	3443200	horse races. I don't believe in the stock exchange. I hate derivatives. I don't do it.
3444640	3452160	Only, you know, everybody shares indirectly when I can't stop it due to the super valuation fund
3452160	3456960	buying shares on my behalf without asking me, right? But I would never buy consciously and
3456960	3464800	purposefully shares. Do I buy Amazon.com stuff? Of course I do. Because we live in capitalism.
3464800	3472240	I'm not going to survive if I simply eat and consume products produced under socialist order,
3472240	3480320	which doesn't exist. When do I choose to do something like, for instance, accepting the
3480320	3488480	Ministry of Finance? Well, that election in January 2015 was the election of a political party that
3488480	3496480	had a reason from 4% to almost 40% in two years as a result of a popular rebellion against
3497440	3505120	the dead bondage of whole people. The reason I said yes was because for four years I was
3505120	3512240	criticizing what the parts that we were doing. My proposals, similar to what I was discussing with
3512240	3519920	you about what to do with the banks, what to do with furlough wages, how to empower the many,
3520880	3526000	these proposals were accepted and embraced by a young man who's going to be prime minister,
3526720	3531600	very improbable prime minister, because as I said, up until two years before he had 4% of the vote.
3533120	3541360	And people were eating out of rubbish bins. As a result of this enslavement,
3541360	3546080	dead bondage, it was like, Greece had become like something like a Victorian workhouse.
3546160	3552960	And I was elected. I didn't think I was going to, you know, affect the transition from capitalism
3552960	3558320	to socialism or anything stupid like that. I had one task that I wanted to accomplish.
3558320	3562960	And I was planning to resign the moment that task was accomplished or the moment I realized
3562960	3570400	I could not accomplish it. And the task was to haircut the Greek debt so that we no longer
3570400	3576320	took more credit cards on conditions of further austerity that forced more people to eat out of
3576320	3583600	rubbish bins. So that's when, you know, my ethos tells me, do it. This is a job that you should
3583600	3592960	try to do, even if the probability of success is low. So let me finish by just asking you simply
3594080	3598640	what makes you happy and what makes you look forward to the future? What is it that really
3598640	3608320	drives you and gives you hope? Well, besides being with the people that I love and listening
3608320	3616560	to the music that permits me to forget who I am, for me, good art, good music, good cinema,
3618000	3624720	must help me forget who I am. But I need to lose myself in this. So when I lose myself in good
3624800	3630720	stuff, stuff that other talented people have created, I'm at I think at my happiest. That's
3630720	3638080	why I'm married to an artist as well. But more generally, I'll give you the answer that Captain
3638080	3643120	Picard gives in the next generation of Star Trek, which is of course a major source of
3643120	3647520	philosophical insights for me, because I'm a trekking. I don't know whether you know that.
3648080	3659200	When he's asked, so they find in space in one of the episodes in the very last episode of Season 1,
3659840	3667600	they find some frozen people from the 20th century, industrialists, who froze themselves and had
3667600	3674240	themselves their bodies covered in space in case they're rescued and fixed and cured in the future.
3674240	3681200	Of course, this happens 24th century. And one of these unfrozen businessmen from the 20th century
3682080	3688480	says to Picard, so you have no money here. There are no markets. Everybody gets what
3689920	3696160	their basic needs covered. So what do you do? What's the point of your existence?
3697040	3705360	And Picard says, my friend, to improve yourself. I think anything that you're doing to improve
3705360	3714240	yourself in a self-motivated way, you play the piano a little bit better. You write a better
3714240	3723680	article, a better book. You learn how to appreciate a beautiful sunset more maturely than you did
3723680	3727760	the previous day or the previous year. That's the stuff of life.
3729520	3736320	You make the world just that little bit more beautiful. Yanis, it's been an absolute pleasure.
3736320	3741360	Welcome back anytime. Thanks for coming on. Thank you, Shane. That was fun.
