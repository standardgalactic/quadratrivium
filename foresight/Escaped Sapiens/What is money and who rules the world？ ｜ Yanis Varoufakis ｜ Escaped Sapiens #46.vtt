00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Who really runs the world today?

00:02.160 --> 00:04.880
Is it politicians or multinational banks?

00:04.880 --> 00:06.800
Or is it social media and tech giants?

00:07.840 --> 00:10.000
In this conversation, I speak with economists,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.120
politician and author Yanis Varoufakis,

00:13.120 --> 00:14.960
who served as the Greek minister of finance

00:14.960 --> 00:17.680
during the 2015 Greek credit crisis.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.320
We discuss how economies crash,

00:20.320 --> 00:22.560
the winners and losers of bank bailouts,

00:22.560 --> 00:24.400
dysfunctions within the EU,

00:24.400 --> 00:27.040
and the real power that politicians have access to

00:27.040 --> 00:28.800
in the face of their political rivals

00:28.880 --> 00:32.000
and the rising influence of social media and tech monopolies.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.400
I'm Shane Farnsworth,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.560
and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.560
These conversations are supported

00:38.560 --> 00:40.240
by the Andrea von Braun Foundation.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.960
And now, here's Yanis Varoufakis.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.640
I hope you enjoy.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.320
Just to make this more pleasurable though,

00:58.320 --> 01:00.000
would you like a little bit of an overview,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.840
or are you just happy to jump in?

01:01.840 --> 01:03.040
Let's go straight in.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.080
Let's go straight in.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.640
Because I was originally going to ask you questions like,

01:06.640 --> 01:07.040
what's the best place to go?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.560
You ask me any questions you want.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.320
Just don't give me any advance warning.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.880
Feel free to ask anything you want.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.760
I don't mind.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.920
So what's the best place to go swimming in Greece then?

01:18.080 --> 01:23.520
There is a cove on a barren island of the island where I live,

01:24.080 --> 01:27.200
which is where I've asked my wife to scatter my ashes

01:27.200 --> 01:28.160
when I'm done.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.360
I don't even know what it's called,

01:31.360 --> 01:32.640
because it's a barren island.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.280
There's no name, at least not that I know.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.720
For me, that's the spot.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.880
But I'm not going to tell you how to find it.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.160
I'm not going to give you the coordinates,

01:40.160 --> 01:41.840
because it's a very well-kept secret.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.080
But why?

01:44.640 --> 01:46.240
What's the beautiful thing about the island?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.120
What draws you to it?

01:49.120 --> 01:54.000
Well, look, we live on an island about a stone's throw from Athens.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.560
And because where we are, it looks to the other side of Athens,

01:58.560 --> 02:01.360
so you can't see the aggliness of the cement blocks.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.040
And we can see the beautiful mountains of the Peloponnese.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.560
It feels as if we are a very, very long way from civilization.

02:11.120 --> 02:11.680
But we're not.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.080
We're only one hour's ferry, right?

02:14.080 --> 02:21.040
And then on our little boat, we sail to this tiny island,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.480
which is 20 minutes away, at 15 knots.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.040
And on the other side of the island,

02:27.600 --> 02:31.280
there is this little cove with deep blue waters

02:31.840 --> 02:34.400
and pine trees coming all the way down to the sea.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.880
And that's like being a million miles away.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.160
And it's the human scale.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.520
The trees are my height, a bit taller, maybe double my height.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.840
The stones, the rocks, the fish, they're all, you know,

02:56.240 --> 02:58.320
as I said, they're the human scale.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.600
They're no sharks.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.480
They're no cairns.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.920
It is just like it was designed by some divinity for us.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.760
So that's the best I can do.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.360
So when you're dealing with politics and the economy all day,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.640
just getting back and being a human.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.680
It's all those old ways.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.360
I just go there, put some music on, and I am away.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.760
I'm in paradise.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.200
And also the proximity, the fact that it's so close,

03:25.200 --> 03:26.480
I can do this every day almost.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.800
So let's do it in theory.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.280
Well, especially when you're not anywhere and you agree,

03:35.280 --> 03:36.320
so you can't do it.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.320
But let's jump into the economy and politics then.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.320
There's two real questions I want to ask you,

03:44.320 --> 03:45.760
and they're very basic.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.680
I basically want to ask you what money is

03:48.480 --> 03:51.440
and who holds power in the world.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.840
So these are the two questions.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.600
And I thought I'd start off at a very basic level.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.720
You used to be, oh, you've worked as an economics professor.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.240
And so what I want to know is, in your mind,

04:05.120 --> 04:09.120
is economics more like the study of psychology

04:09.120 --> 04:12.800
or more like, say, physics in your mind?

04:14.480 --> 04:17.040
Okay, big questions.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.880
What's money?

04:18.880 --> 04:21.360
The best definition of money I've come across

04:21.360 --> 04:22.400
is by Karl Marx.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.040
He defined money as the alienated ability of humankind.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.400
I think it's such a poetic and accurate description

04:34.400 --> 04:39.520
because money, you see, is a bit like in physics,

04:39.520 --> 04:40.480
since you are a physicist.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.360
It's a bit like light.

04:41.840 --> 04:47.280
For centuries, there were deep divisions between scientists

04:47.280 --> 04:52.240
on whether it's a stream of particles or a wave.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.680
So you had huge disagreements.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.440
Newton thought it was particles.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.880
Maxon thought it was waves.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.960
Democracy thought it was particles.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.960
Pickle thought it was waves.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.680
Antiline Stein comes on and says, guys, it's both.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.800
Which is very difficult for the human mind

05:08.800 --> 05:11.760
to wrap itself around the idea that it can be both

05:11.760 --> 05:14.400
two things that are contradictory.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.800
Now, in physics, you can actually prove these hypotheses.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.000
You conduct experiments under controlled conditions,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.200
and you can actually prove it.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.800
Money is very similar in the sense

05:30.800 --> 05:32.320
that it's got two different,

05:32.400 --> 05:35.760
natures that seem absolutely incompatible with one another.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.840
And yet, money is both those things.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.520
The equivalent of the particle theory of light for money

05:43.520 --> 05:45.920
is that it is a thing, that money is a thing.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.880
It's a commodity.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
You have wheat.

05:51.200 --> 05:55.280
You have corn that can be used to eat.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.560
It can be used to plow the fields.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.280
And the form of seeds, that's capital.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.880
But it can also be used in order to exchange.

06:04.880 --> 06:10.720
So you exchange a pound of corn for a bundle of butter or something.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.160
So there is a tendency to think of, especially the gold bugs,

06:16.160 --> 06:21.200
those who believe that money has to be something tangible,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.200
like gold, like a metal.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
It must be substantial.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.560
Not the figment of our imagination, like digital money, or paper money.

06:31.680 --> 06:38.480
They tend to think of money as a thing, a commodity, a tangible.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.080
And then there is a completely different view,

06:43.760 --> 06:48.720
that money is nothing more than a transferable form of debt.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.720
So, you can see that there is a big difference

06:54.800 --> 06:58.960
so if you look at archaeological evidence, there is plenty of it,

06:59.920 --> 07:05.200
that money did not emerge as a thing, but it emerged as a form of debt.

07:06.080 --> 07:18.000
In Syria, in the Mesopotamia, we have evidence that the first form of widely, widely, widely

07:18.240 --> 07:26.000
used money, were shards of clay with number zone.

07:27.600 --> 07:35.600
And the idea was that the hedgewam, the landlord, the king, the tyrant, whatever,

07:36.480 --> 07:39.840
would use these pieces of clay with number zone

07:40.720 --> 07:45.360
to pay advanced payment of the wheat, the corn,

07:45.360 --> 07:50.880
that had not already been produced, that would be produced after the harvest, to workers.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.200
So, workers would go home at the end of each day, every week,

07:56.320 --> 08:01.040
with one of those pieces of clay, with a number, and that's how numbers were invented.

08:02.160 --> 08:08.640
That's how accounting happened. This is how writing was discovered or invented.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.320
The first instances of writing had to do with these payment systems.

08:15.520 --> 08:21.600
So, if it had the number two, it meant two pounds or ounces or something of wheat was owed to you,

08:21.600 --> 08:24.640
because you had worked in the fields, so you'd have to wait for it.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.880
Now, the beauty of it was, of course, that you didn't have to wait to cash it in for wheat.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.520
You could use these pieces of clay to go to your next-door neighbor and say,

08:35.520 --> 08:38.080
listen, you've got a goat, can I have some of its milk?

08:38.080 --> 08:46.880
And here is a piece of clay that is like a tidal deed to an ounce of wheat in three months' time.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.240
So, what is money? Is it a thing? Is it a promise?

08:55.680 --> 09:01.440
Dead? And the answer is that it is both, in the same way that light is both.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.600
So, that's the best I can do in order to introduce our audience to the complexity of money,

09:09.600 --> 09:14.640
and why I love the definition of Marx, that it is the alienated ability of humankind.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.920
It's been alienated from us, it's been abstracted,

09:18.880 --> 09:23.280
but it reflects our ability to do things individually and collectively.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.240
Your second question, I forgot because I'm getting old.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.440
Well, we'll get into that towards the end of it. So, ultimately, we'll touch on

09:32.720 --> 09:34.320
that's where we're going to end up.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.760
Hopefully. We may not, but it depends where we take things.

09:41.280 --> 09:47.680
So, this abstraction then, this is how I picture money as a shared fiction,

09:48.400 --> 09:52.960
and I guess the next obvious question that I want to ask is,

09:53.920 --> 09:58.400
when our economy crashes, when we go through some turbulent economic times,

09:59.360 --> 10:02.960
what's happening there? Is it that the abstraction is breaking down,

10:02.960 --> 10:07.760
that our shared fiction is breaking, or is something else going on at the lowest level?

10:10.400 --> 10:18.080
Well, the shared fiction breaks down because promises have been made that cannot be kept.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.680
That's what's going on. That's what the crisis is.

10:22.960 --> 10:28.960
So, to the extent that the liquidity of an economic system

10:30.560 --> 10:35.760
is a form of debt that is transferable, what's debt? It's a promise.

10:37.520 --> 10:43.600
You give me the pint of milk, and I promise you something at the end of the month,

10:45.760 --> 10:49.120
some wheat or pounds or sterling or whatever.

10:49.760 --> 11:04.880
Now, in the old epochs, eras, you would have war, you would have pestilence,

11:04.880 --> 11:10.240
you would have bad weather. That was the cause of the crisis really, earthquakes.

11:10.240 --> 11:22.640
You didn't have a collapse of economic forces feeding into a kind of domino effect.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.800
There were occasions when poverty or overextending a military effort, kings that

11:33.600 --> 11:39.280
made too many promises to their people and to their soldiers as to how much loot they would get

11:39.280 --> 11:44.400
if they pursue a war together and then if the war didn't go well, all these promises broke down.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.960
But this was not an endogenous economic crisis. It was not a crisis of the economy. It was a

11:48.960 --> 11:55.920
crisis of politics. It was a crisis of the weather. It was a crisis of a military campaign gone wrong.

11:56.800 --> 12:04.960
It was the advent of capitalism that gave rise to purely economic crisis. The reason for that is

12:05.520 --> 12:14.800
there's been a great transformation somewhere around the 18th century when we moved from

12:14.800 --> 12:24.000
feudalism to capitalism. Because if you think about it, under feudalism, the order of play

12:24.720 --> 12:30.160
was rather straightforward. First, you had production. The peasants toiled the land.

12:30.960 --> 12:37.360
They produced goods, agricultural goods. That was the production phase. Production came first.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.840
Second came the distribution phase. The lord would send the sheriff to the peasants,

12:47.520 --> 12:55.360
armed and dangerous. The sheriff would steal a percentage of the harvest on behalf of the landlord.

12:55.440 --> 13:00.880
It was just pure theft on behalf of legalized theft. That's what feudalism was, right?

13:01.440 --> 13:09.840
So you had distribution. This second phase, violent phase, at least potentially violent phase,

13:10.640 --> 13:14.480
determined how much of the produce would stay with the peasants, how much would go with the landlord.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.200
And then the third phase was financialization. The landlord could not eat all that stuff.

13:19.920 --> 13:26.240
So the landlord would sell it in rudimentary markets that were marginal to production,

13:26.240 --> 13:35.920
but nevertheless important, get cash and use that cash either to arm his soldiers or to build

13:35.920 --> 13:44.160
a better castle or to found a church or to lend it. Because the lords were the money lenders as

13:44.160 --> 13:50.080
well, because they were the only ones who had money. So you had production, distribution and

13:50.080 --> 13:57.280
financialization. In societies like that, it was impossible to have an endogenous economic crisis.

13:58.080 --> 14:05.200
But with the advent of capitalism, the transformation, when the peasants were expelled from the land,

14:05.200 --> 14:11.280
they were replaced by sheep in England, in Scotland, in Wales, because wool was an international

14:11.280 --> 14:15.200
commodity by then, due to the discovery of international trade rules and the creation of

14:15.200 --> 14:21.760
international trade rules. You have the creation of a working class, which is landless. They've

14:21.760 --> 14:31.920
been evicted. They live in slums now, outside the land. The land now is commodified. It is leased

14:32.480 --> 14:38.800
to former peasants or to the sheriff or whoever, who now becomes a proto-capitalist who hires laborers

14:39.760 --> 14:48.720
now and pays rent to the landlord. But these proto-capitalists, to make business work,

14:49.520 --> 14:55.600
to start production, first they had to borrow, because they had to pay wages up in upfront,

14:56.240 --> 15:00.480
so that the workers would not die of hunger, not because they were nice people, but because

15:00.480 --> 15:04.480
otherwise they wouldn't be able to get them to work. And also they had to pay the landlord

15:04.880 --> 15:13.840
rent before the harvest came in. So suddenly what you have is a complete reversal. It used to be

15:13.840 --> 15:18.560
production, distribution, finance. Now it's finance, distribution, and finally production.

15:20.160 --> 15:31.120
And this reversal unleashed tremendous productive powers. Workers were forced to be far more

15:31.120 --> 15:38.080
efficient. The entrepreneurs, the proto-capitalists, because they were struggling themselves to keep

15:38.080 --> 15:44.000
their nose above water, they had to improve efficiency. They had to invest in machinery

15:45.200 --> 15:50.080
in order to enhance labor productivity, because they were in competition with one another and

15:50.080 --> 16:00.640
anyone who didn't do it simply went bankrupt. So because finance now is at the beginning

16:00.640 --> 16:06.400
of this production process. Finance is the linchpin for this new system called capitalism.

16:07.440 --> 16:17.120
Bankers begin to emerge as the liquidity providers of this system, the lubricants,

16:17.120 --> 16:24.000
the lubricators of the system. And the more this system becomes efficient, the greater the cut

16:24.000 --> 16:32.800
that the bankers retain. So the way I've described this is in a book a few years ago,

16:32.800 --> 16:41.920
was to say that it is a bit like bankers had time traveling hands. They would push their hand

16:41.920 --> 16:49.120
through the membrane of the timeline and extract value from the future that has not been created

16:49.120 --> 16:54.800
yet. Bring it to the present to fund the production that will produce the values of the future.

16:55.520 --> 17:03.520
And that of course made them central in this chain and allowed them to become very rich.

17:03.520 --> 17:09.360
And the more they lend, the more value they extracted from the future to bring to the present,

17:10.400 --> 17:16.720
the richer they go. But that meant that at some point they extracted so much value from the future

17:17.600 --> 17:21.920
that the present could not be delivered. The present could not repay the future.

17:21.920 --> 17:28.000
And that's when promises are broken. Debt are issued that cannot be repaid. And when those

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
accumulate at some point, like grains of sand that you lay one on top of the other at some point,

17:34.880 --> 17:38.800
there's going to be an implosion. And that's an economic crisis. At that point,

17:39.760 --> 17:46.320
you have a situation where the alienated ability of humankind is in crisis,

17:46.960 --> 17:56.640
it's in a vortex, and you've got unpayable debts. And that's when you have the eradication of debts,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.560
because debts that cannot be paid will not be paid.

18:01.520 --> 18:10.240
So in 2008, where we had the bailout of the banks, I want to understand how dirty this

18:10.240 --> 18:15.920
process was. Because if I follow what you're saying, what I understand is happening is that the

18:15.920 --> 18:20.560
banks have a whole bunch of assets that have accumulated that are not good, they're toxic

18:20.560 --> 18:24.480
in some sense, like loans that will never be repaid, this sort of thing. And so then the

18:24.480 --> 18:30.640
central bank steps in and buys them all out at some price. That's sort of, in some sense,

18:30.640 --> 18:34.560
if I understand you putting the hand into the future, I want to understand.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.960
Ah, no, no, it's not the same thing. Because you see, when you put your hand into the future,

18:38.960 --> 18:44.800
you extract value to bring it in to produce new value. What happened with the central banks was

18:44.800 --> 18:55.920
none of that. It was simply printing money to make failed bets all. Not the same thing. There

18:55.920 --> 19:05.760
was never any productive benefit from doing this. They salvaged the banks by creating money to replace

19:05.760 --> 19:11.440
their busted flushes, their busted wages, their busted bets.

19:12.400 --> 19:19.520
I guess then the question that I have is, ultimately, who wins and who loses? Who is it

19:19.520 --> 19:24.880
that's paying to buy out those busted bets, the toxic assets?

19:28.160 --> 19:34.240
Well, it depends on what's happening in the rest of the economy as well. I'm quite relaxed about

19:34.960 --> 19:43.680
you know, forgiving debts and writing them off. You have to do it. As I said, an unpayable debt

19:43.680 --> 19:48.880
will not be paid. So you need to write it off. There are two ways of writing it off. One is to

19:48.880 --> 19:56.720
just write it off. Really, very simple. Say, okay, this IOU is going to be torn up because it

19:56.720 --> 20:04.320
cannot be paid. That, to me, is the honest and uncomplicated way of doing it. But if you want to

20:04.320 --> 20:14.000
pretend that the debt is sacred and it will be repaid, then the only way of pretending that an

20:14.000 --> 20:26.640
unpayable debt can be repaid is by constantly rolling it over, lending the busted entity,

20:26.640 --> 20:34.800
the failed banker, for instance, money, continue to give him liquidity in the form of, you know,

20:34.800 --> 20:42.880
short-term, medium-term, long-term debt, so as to allow him to pretend that he is honoring the

20:42.880 --> 20:50.640
IOUs that he's issued. Now, again, it really is no skin of my nose whether you excuse him the debt

20:51.280 --> 20:58.480
or whether you roll it over. So the question is, what else is happening, however, around this little

20:58.480 --> 21:05.520
drama? Because the tragedy of 2008 and beyond was that while we had socialism for the bankers,

21:06.160 --> 21:14.800
you know, the central banks were printing state money to give it almost philosophically to the

21:14.800 --> 21:22.240
bankers, they were imposing harsh austerity on the innocence of the people who had not done

21:22.240 --> 21:27.920
nothing wrong and who had not benefited for years and years and years through financialization, through

21:28.640 --> 21:37.600
betting on impossible horses in the financial sector. So when you have socialism for the

21:38.960 --> 21:44.160
very few who happen to be the financiers and austerity for everybody else, you end up with a

21:44.160 --> 21:51.200
catastrophe that we've experienced over the last ten years, because the financiers get their money,

21:51.360 --> 21:59.600
there is the ethical question as well, right? The people who created the crisis

22:00.560 --> 22:07.040
get power and money. And the people who suffered the crisis and who never benefited from the

22:08.000 --> 22:13.360
makings of the crisis, the many, are suffering austerity, they can't put food on the table.

22:13.600 --> 22:22.880
They can't go to sleep at night because they are so surrounded, so much in the clasps of angst

22:22.880 --> 22:28.080
about how they're going to make ends meet by the end of the week. But besides the ethical

22:28.080 --> 22:36.000
point, there's a macroeconomic point as well, because the industrialists, the people who benefited

22:36.000 --> 22:42.320
from socialism for the very few for the oligarchy, look at, you know, they have all this money which

22:42.320 --> 22:46.400
is being printed by the central banks and given to them, right? But they're never going to invest it,

22:47.040 --> 22:51.920
because not because they don't want to invest, they would like it, they would like to invest it,

22:51.920 --> 23:00.160
but they look out there and they see the masses, the multitudes being impecunious and finding it

23:00.160 --> 23:06.000
very hard to make ends meet and they think, I'm not going to produce snazzy expensive products

23:06.000 --> 23:12.160
for them, they won't be able to afford it. So if you're Volkswagen in 2009, you're not going to say

23:12.240 --> 23:19.440
I'm going to produce an alternative to a Tesla, an expensive $100,000 electric car,

23:19.440 --> 23:25.040
because who the hell is going to buy it? Look at them. I'll make little golfs with stupid little

23:25.040 --> 23:33.360
polluting diesel engines, as I was doing before. I will fake their exhaustive measurements as well

23:33.360 --> 23:39.120
and, you know, make money out of that, out of the little people with, you know, small dirty little

23:39.200 --> 23:46.480
cars that sell to them. So you've got very low levels of investments and that also augurs really

23:46.480 --> 23:51.760
badly for the green transition, because for 13 years we have not invested in the green transition

23:51.760 --> 23:58.480
as we should have and we can see the effects on the environment now. You can see it on electricity,

23:58.480 --> 24:09.040
I mean, we have under invested for 13 years. So the tragedy, the crime of the post 2008 period

24:09.040 --> 24:17.840
is not just that you have excused those busted wages of the finances and that you have printed

24:17.840 --> 24:23.760
money as if in the context of socialism for the rich to give to them. It's also that the austerity

24:23.760 --> 24:28.640
you've imposed upon people in the European Union, people in the United Kingdom, people in the United

24:28.640 --> 24:35.760
States, I mean, here in this country where the champions were stated, world record record holders

24:35.760 --> 24:41.440
when it came to state, to idiotic austerity, self-defeating austerity. And the result is that

24:41.440 --> 24:46.560
you have very low levels of investment. And when you have very low levels of investment,

24:46.560 --> 24:53.600
what does this mean? It means that demand is low and it means that the only way you can keep

24:54.400 --> 25:01.760
finances in health, in better commerce or alive or zombified, call it what you might, may

25:02.320 --> 25:05.680
is to keep printing money to give to them because they're not going to get it from the

25:05.680 --> 25:09.920
little people because the little people don't have any and because there's no investment to produce

25:09.920 --> 25:17.120
new wells for the bankers to benefit. So for 13 years after 2008, we have had rude health

25:17.840 --> 25:26.480
in the financial markets, which was, however, driven by state money that was printed and printed,

25:27.120 --> 25:34.240
to keep the finances, boisterous, while the rest of the economy was shrinking.

25:37.440 --> 25:43.200
So how long can you push this for? There's sort of two questions I want to ask. The first is,

25:43.200 --> 25:47.440
what would you have done instead? What's the alternative? Did you have to inject the money

25:47.440 --> 25:52.880
up to the level of banks or could have you given money to the people who made the,

25:53.840 --> 25:57.040
you know, did you have to inject money at the level of the banks or could have been at the

25:57.040 --> 26:05.120
level of the people? And what is the long-term impact if we continue to do quantitative easing

26:05.120 --> 26:09.040
and we continue to give austerity to the people and not the banks?

26:10.480 --> 26:16.640
Well, the first question that came out of your mouth was, how long can this last for? The answer

26:16.640 --> 26:22.880
was until the pandemic, because now it's all collapsing around us. We can see that.

26:23.760 --> 26:28.880
But before I explain why that is happening, let me answer your other question. What could

26:28.880 --> 26:36.000
we have done instead? And I think you already embedded into your question the proper answer.

26:37.680 --> 26:43.440
The first thing you do is, of course, you save the banks because banks are not like other businesses.

26:43.440 --> 26:50.720
If a bike shop shuts down, okay, you don't have bikes. But a bank, for better or for worse,

26:50.720 --> 27:00.000
I think for worse, the banks own the payment system. Forget credit. You know, whenever you want to buy

27:00.000 --> 27:07.520
coffee these days or buy a book or go to the movies or whatever, you need to make a payment.

27:08.080 --> 27:15.600
And you make a payment using your debit card or credit card or even some ATM from which you

27:15.600 --> 27:21.840
withdraw money. And that's all owned by the banking system, by the early gobbling of the banksters.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.600
So you need to save those banks. You can't allow the ATMs to shut down and the payment system to

27:27.600 --> 27:32.480
collapse because then you'll have another great depression like we had after 1949.

27:33.120 --> 27:40.320
And only monsters, Nazis and fascists emerge from that. But it's one thing to say you should save

27:40.320 --> 27:47.520
the banks. It's quite another to say that you must save the bankers. So what I would have done,

27:47.520 --> 27:51.600
I would have picked up the phone and called them and say, I've got some good news and I've got

27:51.600 --> 27:56.800
some bad news. We will save the bank. That's a good news. The bad news, we're not going to save you.

27:56.800 --> 28:04.960
You are out. So shareholders are wiped out. Board of directors are fired.

28:06.080 --> 28:13.040
They are nationalized and they're saved. And this is not buying the sky stuff.

28:13.040 --> 28:20.480
This is precisely what happened in 1998 in South Korea. The Korean state got into the

28:21.200 --> 28:29.440
failed private banks, took them over, drove out the board of directors. I remember I was having

28:29.440 --> 28:34.960
a very intense conversation with the finance minister of South Korea. And I asked him, how did

28:34.960 --> 28:38.800
you do that? Because we are having such difficulty. I mean, you know, bankers are so powerful people.

28:40.080 --> 28:44.240
So powerful people. I mean, they have more powerful than they have more power than us

28:44.880 --> 28:50.480
ministers of finance, you know, they can fire us. He said, well, we'll use them in a very,

28:50.480 --> 28:56.720
very good institution in Korea. He said, what? He said, well, the Marines. I said the Marines in

28:56.720 --> 29:01.440
and had them leave the building at gunpoint. I thought, that's a very good idea.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.840
So they saved the banks and within a year and how they had sold them back to the private sector,

29:07.840 --> 29:12.880
because they were not Marxists, they were left wing lingers like me, but they didn't save the bankers.

29:13.680 --> 29:22.160
So the message to bankers was, if you, if you steer your bank onto the rocks,

29:23.200 --> 29:27.440
and it starts sinking, we will save the vessel, but not you. So big.

29:29.280 --> 29:34.000
Okay, that was number one thing that I would. Can I ask just quick quickly, did that have

29:34.000 --> 29:40.640
a lasting effect? So what happened in 2008 and later on, did Korea have a sort of softer journey

29:40.640 --> 29:48.480
as a result of that prior policy? Absolutely. Look at the data Korea had next to no crisis in 2008.

29:49.840 --> 29:56.480
What had happened in 1998 shielded Korea from the vagaries of Wall Street, the city of London,

29:56.480 --> 30:01.360
what's happening in the European Union, come from, from strength to strength.

30:01.840 --> 30:09.920
And it wasn't just South Korea, it was six years before South Korea, it was Scandinavia.

30:10.800 --> 30:16.320
The Scandinavian banks in 1992 went bust, all of them that made some stupid decisions,

30:16.320 --> 30:22.560
and they all went bust, Swedish banks, Danish banks, Norwegian banks, Finnish banks,

30:23.280 --> 30:30.720
and the states back then, they were social democratic back then, no longer, they,

30:32.080 --> 30:37.040
they bailed out the banks, got rid of the bankers, nationalized the banks, and then sold them off

30:37.040 --> 30:43.040
in within two years back to the private sector to different bankers. And they didn't have the same

30:43.040 --> 30:49.280
problems in 2008 that the Anglo, the Anglo sphere had, as well as the European Union.

30:50.080 --> 30:55.120
So that's one thing I would do, save the banks, not the bankers. The second thing I would do,

30:55.120 --> 31:02.480
and you already foreshadowed that in your question, if I wanted to boost demand,

31:03.360 --> 31:07.280
I would not give it to the financiers, I wouldn't print money to give to the financiers,

31:07.280 --> 31:13.440
I would give it to the little people. I mean, Donald Trump did it, and then Joe Biden continued

31:13.520 --> 31:19.760
with the checks in the mail too little bit. The Australian government did it in 2009

31:20.560 --> 31:26.160
under Kevin Rudd, and the result was that Australia did not have a recession in 2009,

31:26.160 --> 31:31.280
because every household, you probably recall that, got something between 10,000 and 20,000

31:31.280 --> 31:36.400
Australian dollars. It missed me, unfortunately. I was a little bit annoyed about that.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all my friends got the, yeah.

31:42.320 --> 31:47.200
So, you know, even during the pandemic, when the central bank of Europe was printing,

31:47.200 --> 31:52.720
as if there was no tomorrow, I was warning them, I was saying, you're creating a gigantic bubble

31:52.720 --> 31:58.000
in the real estate, because the money will go from the central bank, the financiers,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.520
from the financiers to their mates, their mates are going to take the stock exchange

32:01.600 --> 32:07.120
or buy flats in Berlin. Asset prices will go through the roof. That will create asset

32:07.120 --> 32:15.360
price inflation. That will increase the shortfall, actually reduce further investment,

32:16.240 --> 32:20.480
and that's going to shrink aggregate supply of goods and services. And then at some point,

32:20.480 --> 32:24.240
some of that money will leak into the economy, and there's going to be inflation,

32:24.800 --> 32:31.680
and then you'll be stopped, which is where they are. So the alternative proposition was,

32:32.800 --> 32:41.360
why don't you just send some like 500 euros I proposed, or 1,000 years, or 2,000 years,

32:41.360 --> 32:49.680
depending on the length of the pandemic, send it to people's bank accounts. And the most astonishing

32:49.680 --> 32:55.920
answer I got from German colleagues, politicians and bankers and so on, is you can't do that.

32:55.920 --> 33:03.280
So why can't you do it? He said, we don't have the know-how. So what? Because our social security

33:03.280 --> 33:09.280
numbers are not connected to our banking system, and therefore technically we cannot even send

33:09.280 --> 33:16.160
them money. We can't do what Trump and Biden did. And I thought, my goodness, this is the state of

33:16.160 --> 33:24.240
Europe. The great German efficient state cannot even find its citizens and give them some money.

33:24.880 --> 33:32.560
They can take them, they can't give it. Okay, so this makes me think of something else that

33:32.560 --> 33:41.840
I'm quite curious about, which is that in Europe, we don't have big tech competitors. So for example,

33:41.840 --> 33:49.360
there's no, you know, French Twitter. There's no, why is it that on these technical grounds,

33:50.160 --> 33:53.760
people seem more competent in the United States? Why is it that you have these,

33:55.040 --> 33:57.760
you know, blossoming tech companies that are missing here?

34:00.560 --> 34:10.000
Well, the hegemon always produces cutting edge technologies. Before America rose,

34:10.400 --> 34:16.400
almost every important technological breakthrough was made in Cambridge, Oxford,

34:16.400 --> 34:22.000
the University College of London, in Britain. Britain was the empire. It produced the technological

34:22.000 --> 34:29.520
advances. Before that, it was Rome. So there's nothing terribly surprising about that.

34:30.400 --> 34:37.440
Size also matters. You have a very large economy in the United States. You've got English.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.800
You've got the size of America. You've got English. So if you were going to start Twitter

34:45.120 --> 34:51.840
in France, it wouldn't really go that far. Twitter went far because from day one,

34:52.480 --> 34:58.640
it was used by us Greeks, by Australians, by the Portuguese and so on and so forth.

35:00.160 --> 35:06.080
And first mover advantage is everything. So once you created Facebook, there can't be another

35:06.080 --> 35:12.800
Facebook even in the United States, even in the United States. If you and I had a much better

35:12.800 --> 35:24.720
software for a Facebook competitor, it wouldn't matter because if anyone wants to join

35:26.880 --> 35:32.880
something like Facebook, they will go to where their friends are. So there is the first mover

35:32.960 --> 35:39.760
advantage, which is really very strong. Now, the only country that has developed competitors,

35:39.760 --> 35:45.600
real competitors, substantial competitors, very strong competitors to big tech is China.

35:46.400 --> 35:55.680
But that's because there was a political project to do so. They understood really very well that

35:55.680 --> 36:04.240
if the whole of the Chinese political economy and society enter Facebook, Twitter,

36:05.760 --> 36:13.360
buy everything from Amazon.com and so on, any possibility of autonomous growth and development

36:13.360 --> 36:23.520
in China is gone. Europe never understood that. And we now are in this kind of

36:25.280 --> 36:31.200
semi-war between Europe and America over social media. You've got the European Commission

36:31.200 --> 36:39.680
constantly sniping at Twitter, at Facebook, at Google, at Apple, imposing fines. Ms. Westager,

36:39.680 --> 36:45.440
she does well. I mean, she's right on many of the issues that she's got. But as you pointed out,

36:47.840 --> 36:54.800
this is just a defensive war. There is no attempt or capacity of the European Union,

36:54.800 --> 36:58.880
despite the fact that we are more than the Americans put together. We're richer than the

36:58.880 --> 37:03.920
Americans put together. We have a lot of technologies. We cannot bring it together

37:04.800 --> 37:10.720
and create either competitive to Amazon.com or to Alibaba in China.

37:11.360 --> 37:16.160
So with every crisis and every technological advance, Europe falls behind both China and

37:16.160 --> 37:20.240
the United States of America. It still surprises me that you say this because

37:21.200 --> 37:27.360
we had, for example, MySpace, which was taken over by Facebook. And I guess now Facebook shares

37:27.360 --> 37:33.680
are really tumbling in the last weeks. And I guess TikTok is sort of rolling over YouTube.

37:33.680 --> 37:37.920
So there are examples of other tech companies rising up.

37:49.280 --> 37:56.480
Do you think the EU is taking appropriate steps then to break up these monopolies?

37:56.640 --> 38:05.200
No. You think they should go further? Or how should they help companies in their own sort

38:05.200 --> 38:12.000
of domain develop competitors? How about having a lobotomy to begin with and start in a fresh

38:12.560 --> 38:20.240
because the situation with the European Union is beyond a joke. They have completely failed

38:20.240 --> 38:27.440
to rise up to the great challenges of the time. And what are the great challenges of the time?

38:27.440 --> 38:33.040
The banking crisis of 2008, the European Union made a complete and utter mess of it. The result

38:33.040 --> 38:38.160
now is that we have 13 years of centrifugal forces tearing the European Union of Art.

38:38.800 --> 38:43.840
And that has never subsided. They just threw a lot of printed money on the problem

38:44.720 --> 38:49.600
under Mario Draghi. But without solving the underlying centrifugal forces that are tearing

38:49.600 --> 39:00.160
us apart. So banking crisis, disaster. Green energy, catastrophe, catastrophe. I mean,

39:00.160 --> 39:02.960
think about it. We have something called the European Union, but we do not have

39:04.720 --> 39:11.360
an energy plan for Europe. Germany has its own plans. And we saw how great those were

39:12.320 --> 39:22.800
when put in invaded the Ukraine. France has its own polyonic nuclear based plan.

39:23.600 --> 39:27.520
Half of the nuclear power stations now that they're necessary because the

39:28.160 --> 39:36.000
height and price of natural gas are now defunct. They're out of commission. Greece has its own

39:36.000 --> 39:43.600
plan. It's pathetic. I wish we had a European Union. We do not. We have something that

39:43.600 --> 39:51.760
pretends to be a union. Artificial intelligence, nothing, zero. There's no plan for artificial

39:51.760 --> 39:59.040
intelligence. There are pockets of AI here and there. But nothing like the concentrated

39:59.040 --> 40:04.240
investment on AI that the Japanese have, that the Koreans have, that the Chinese have. Of course,

40:04.240 --> 40:15.280
the Americans. You've got a lot of rent seeking in Europe. There is hardly any entrepreneurship

40:15.280 --> 40:21.440
happening. They're all, you know, the big wigs are simply trying to extract whatever value has

40:21.440 --> 40:31.040
already been created without producing new value. And we do not have a government. We have a bureaucracy

40:32.000 --> 40:38.400
whose job in Brussels is to behave like the bureaucracy of a cartel. The nearest

40:39.200 --> 40:46.400
parallel analog to the European Union Commission is OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting

40:46.400 --> 40:52.880
Countries. They have a bureaucracy. Their purpose is to coordinate the activities of the different

40:52.880 --> 40:58.560
countries with a view to simply maximizing the extraction of ransom on the rest of the world.

40:59.440 --> 41:07.440
But this can never be the source of innovative thinking about creating new values. It's only

41:08.160 --> 41:14.080
innovative thinking about how to corner existing markets. That's what the European Union Commission

41:14.080 --> 41:18.320
is. And whenever they have a good idea, because there are some good ideas that come out of the

41:18.320 --> 41:29.360
commission, since I remember in the 1990s, they've all been vetoed by Berlin, all of them,

41:29.360 --> 41:34.880
every single one of them. In some European Union Council has been vetoed by Berlin. And if not

41:34.880 --> 41:40.800
by Berlin, by one of the 100 maidens of Berlin, because sometimes Berlin doesn't want to be seen

41:40.880 --> 41:51.440
to be the bad guy or girl in the case of Berlin. So they asked the Slovak or the Dutch to veto it

41:51.440 --> 41:58.320
on their behalf. So then what does the US have that the EU is lacking? What is it that makes

41:58.320 --> 42:03.600
the US function, which doesn't allow the EU to function a similar way?

42:03.920 --> 42:14.080
Common debt, treasury bills. You know the treasury, the US treasury. We have a central bank here in

42:14.080 --> 42:21.120
Europe and they have a central bank. But if you think of how we constructed it, it was as if

42:21.120 --> 42:29.840
constructed by morons in order to serve slaves. Because what we did, we created the central bank

42:29.840 --> 42:37.040
without a state behind it. There's no state that can have the back of the European central bank.

42:39.440 --> 42:46.080
And you have 19 states, now it's 20 states that use this central bank for the money, but cannot

42:46.080 --> 42:52.800
rely on it in case there's a banking crisis to bail them out. Because by its constitution,

42:52.800 --> 42:57.120
it's not allowed to bail them out. So they had to bend the constitution of the ECB,

42:57.120 --> 43:02.080
the charter of the ECB in order to bail them out. But to do this, they had to get the permission

43:02.080 --> 43:08.880
from Berlin to do it. So it's a catastrophe. It's exactly what Alexander Hamilton in the United

43:08.880 --> 43:14.960
States was trying to avoid and succeeded in avoiding. Situation where you have different

43:14.960 --> 43:22.320
states, different formal colonies, supposedly one country, but without common debt. Common debt is

43:22.320 --> 43:30.240
everything. It's what binds states together. What binds the British together is not so much,

43:30.240 --> 43:39.920
you know, the Royal Family. It is the bound and the fact that the north of England and the south

43:39.920 --> 43:47.440
of England share the debt, the national debt. That's what gives substance to countries. How long

43:47.520 --> 43:54.480
with languages and traditions and conventions and all that jazz, as they say?

43:55.760 --> 44:01.760
I don't want to sound too conspiratorial. You mentioned the system is created as though by

44:01.760 --> 44:10.160
morons. But could it be that it was constructed in this way to force federation further down the

44:10.160 --> 44:16.240
line? Is there some sort of intent behind a system which seems not to work currently in your mind?

44:18.080 --> 44:27.280
Look, there were some smart people who thought of the Euro and the European Central Bank in those terms.

44:28.240 --> 44:34.320
And one of them was President Mitterrand of France, François Mitterrand, in the 80s and 90s.

44:36.800 --> 44:42.560
I have done good authority, I've written about this. I put a friend of mine who was in the room

44:42.560 --> 44:49.360
in 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty, which is the foundational treaty of the Euro,

44:49.360 --> 44:55.680
and the European Central Bank, was signed. There was a discussion between the President of France,

44:55.680 --> 45:01.600
François Mitterrand, and the President of the European Commission at the time, Jacques Delors,

45:01.600 --> 45:04.960
who was a friend of Mitterrand and who had been his finance minister many years before,

45:05.680 --> 45:10.880
with a friend of mine in the room. And Jacques Delors, representing the European Commission at

45:10.880 --> 45:17.600
the time, was trying to convince the French president that it is important to have two

45:17.600 --> 45:27.520
pylons, two legs for the Eurozone. One should be the Central Bank to guarantee monetary stability,

45:27.520 --> 45:35.680
and another one should be something like an investment ministry or a treasury that would

45:36.240 --> 45:43.200
borrow on behalf of the whole of the Eurozone area in order to invest, so there would be the

45:43.200 --> 45:51.120
stability leg and the growth or development leg, which of course meant a political union.

45:52.080 --> 45:57.280
It meant that if you have a common debt, you have to have common rules, who borrows,

45:57.920 --> 46:03.280
you need to have a common parliament or parliamentary process to approve the common debt.

46:04.240 --> 46:09.280
And François Mitterrand turned around and said what he said. He said, listen, Jacques,

46:10.960 --> 46:17.040
that would be great to do that. We can't do it. We don't have the political clouds to do it at the

46:17.040 --> 46:25.680
moment. What we can do is we can create a monetary union, and this is where the old fox, François Mitterrand,

46:26.160 --> 46:36.720
proved yet very clear vision of the future. He said, when the next large financial crisis comes,

46:37.680 --> 46:43.280
our successors will have to choose between letting this whole thing collapse or federating

46:44.080 --> 46:49.920
or doing what you're suggesting. So this is precisely what you're saying. However,

46:50.880 --> 46:58.800
he was wrong. And he was wrong for reasons that a British Cambridge economist

47:00.400 --> 47:10.080
had foreseen in 1971, in April 1971, Nicolas Calder was his name, a well-known economist

47:10.080 --> 47:15.520
of the Cambridge tradition, who was actually Eurofiled. He wanted the European Union to come

47:15.600 --> 47:22.800
together, and he was writing that paper as somebody who's worried about the future of the

47:22.800 --> 47:29.040
European common market back then, the European Union today. So this is now April 1971, just before,

47:29.040 --> 47:34.320
a few months before the collapse of the Bretton Wood system and the fixed exchange rates, when the

47:34.320 --> 47:39.840
Europeans could see that it was happening, that the exchange rates would no longer be fixed. They

47:39.840 --> 47:44.720
needed the exchange rates to be fixed because the European Union was a cartel. They were trying to

47:44.720 --> 47:49.920
sell, to fix the price of coal, to fix the price of steel, to fix the price of cars. If exchange

47:49.920 --> 47:54.080
rates between France and Germany and Italy and Holland go up and down, it's very difficult to

47:54.080 --> 47:59.120
fix prices. So they needed the fixed exchange rates that the Americans were providing under

47:59.120 --> 48:03.760
the Bretton Woods. And they could see that these fixed exchange rates would blow up. So they were

48:03.760 --> 48:10.960
already planning a common currency or fixed exchange rates in Europe as a prelude to the

48:10.960 --> 48:18.240
Euro back in 1971. And Caldor in the news statement said this. He said it would be a gross mistake.

48:19.040 --> 48:23.680
I don't have his names now, his words in my head to tell you about, but I can assure you,

48:23.680 --> 48:29.920
you can look it up. I've republished that paper as well in my books, in a couple of my books.

48:30.480 --> 48:38.960
He said, if we make the mistake of thinking that through a monetary union,

48:39.840 --> 48:49.520
we create a stepping stone towards federation. We will have killed off, maybe that was not

48:49.520 --> 48:55.280
the words used. We will have annulled the possibility of a political union. Because he explains,

48:56.480 --> 49:02.000
a monetary union without a political union is like putting the cart before the horses.

49:02.720 --> 49:09.040
A monetary union without a political union in common debt is going to create a gigantic financial

49:09.040 --> 49:19.120
crisis by itself. And when it hits, we are going to suffer massive centrifugal forces,

49:19.120 --> 49:25.680
politically, socially, at the level of discourse, and the Europeans will not be able to politically

49:25.680 --> 49:29.280
to unite after that. And I think that this is exactly what happens.

49:31.120 --> 49:36.880
I suppose you're alluding to the rise of sort of right-leaning politicians and...

49:38.880 --> 49:45.120
Not just. After, you know, when the banking crisis happened, it started in Wall Street,

49:45.120 --> 49:52.480
as it usually does. Like 1929, it started in 2007, 2008 in Wall Street. Then very soon after that,

49:52.480 --> 49:57.600
we realized that the French and the German banks were kaput, gone. Okay.

50:00.880 --> 50:06.720
A domino effect starts. Once the German and the French banks are bankrupt, they can no longer

50:06.720 --> 50:12.560
roll over the Greek government debt, the Italian government debt, the Irish government debt,

50:12.560 --> 50:18.160
because they were the banks that were lending those dates. And then there is, of course,

50:18.160 --> 50:27.680
a feedback loop, because once the front page of newspapers is full of news of the Greek

50:28.320 --> 50:34.880
state's bankruptcy, and everybody knows that the Greek state owes 120, 130 billion euros

50:34.880 --> 50:40.880
to the German banks and another 100 to the French banks, then that makes the position

50:40.880 --> 50:46.640
of the French and the German banks even worse. And then what happens is, then politicians start

50:47.200 --> 50:52.800
pointing accusatory fingers at one another. The German politicians are pointing their fingers

50:52.800 --> 50:58.800
at the Greeks. You messed this thing up. It is because you were so spendthrift and because you

50:58.800 --> 51:05.120
sung and played the Buzuki under the sun in the summer and it didn't work. And then the Greeks

51:05.120 --> 51:09.200
turn around and the pointing accusatory fingers at the German in the beginning, you're Nazis.

51:09.200 --> 51:13.600
You've never been anything other than Nazis. That's it. It's finished. At that moment,

51:14.400 --> 51:18.640
you have centrifugal forces at the cultural level, the political level, the ethical level,

51:19.680 --> 51:28.400
the every level. And you go now to any German or any Greek, any Dutchman or woman or French person

51:28.400 --> 51:34.000
and say, do you think it's a good idea that we should federate in Europe? They say, bugger off

51:34.960 --> 51:43.120
immediately, which would not be the case before 2010. So I think that Nicolas Calder was

51:43.120 --> 51:51.040
completely present. So sort of shot ourselves in the foot. I noticed that so in respect for the

51:51.040 --> 51:59.840
time, we're going to have to wrap up fairly soon. Can I just ask with a few and with a few quick

51:59.840 --> 52:10.800
questions about power? So the main one is who holds the power today? Is it Musk? Is it Biden?

52:10.800 --> 52:16.000
Is it the head of the IMF or Goldman Sachs? Where does power really reside today?

52:20.160 --> 52:27.280
The hardest aspect of contemporary society to comprehend

52:29.120 --> 52:34.480
is that we live in a capitalist world or post capitalist world,

52:34.960 --> 52:41.360
where power has been concentrated tremendously

52:44.640 --> 52:50.080
inside the confines of a new form of capital

52:52.880 --> 53:00.400
without any human being, Musk, Biden, whoever, being in command of it.

53:01.040 --> 53:07.760
If you look at Musk on a minute-by-minute basis, if you actually watch him work,

53:07.760 --> 53:12.880
you can see that this is a driven man who's got enormous resources at his disposal,

53:12.880 --> 53:21.680
but given his ambition and his different projects, he's very constrained. He feels the pressure.

53:21.680 --> 53:26.320
He doesn't feel like somebody who can do anything. He doesn't feel like God. Similarly, Jeff Bezos,

53:27.280 --> 53:34.800
he's got hundreds of billions stashed away in terms of wealth, but he too feels constrained.

53:36.160 --> 53:40.000
So this is a great tragedy and a great paradox. It's like an ancient Greek tragedy.

53:40.640 --> 53:44.400
If you're watching or Shakespeare, if you're watching a Shakespearean play,

53:45.440 --> 53:53.440
this is the third. What do you see? You see powerful men on a stage who nevertheless,

53:53.440 --> 53:58.080
their great tragedy is that the more power they have, the more powerless they feel,

53:59.840 --> 54:05.120
and it's the nature of the game which extracts power from the many,

54:05.840 --> 54:09.600
concentrates in the hands of a few who are tragic figures and therefore powerless.

54:10.320 --> 54:14.640
This is how I understand the capitalist post-capitalist system we live in,

54:14.640 --> 54:20.320
and that's why I continue to be a leftist who thinks that capitalism is neither natural nor

54:20.400 --> 54:27.840
pleasant or stable for that matter. In the end, we've created magnificent machines

54:29.040 --> 54:35.840
that had the capacity of being our slaves. I'm a tech enthusiast. I love machinery.

54:35.840 --> 54:41.280
I love technology, but in the end, we become the slaves of the machines, and that is not

54:41.280 --> 54:45.680
simply to say that this is the rich versus the poor. There is, of course, the rich versus the poor.

54:45.680 --> 54:53.200
We see this on a daily basis, but in the end, even the rich, even the Elon Musk's of the world,

54:53.760 --> 55:00.800
the Jeff Bezos's of the world, they are also victims of this enslavement of the whole of

55:00.800 --> 55:07.600
humanity to our artifacts. A kind of Dr. Frankenstein who created the thing, this capitalist thing,

55:08.320 --> 55:16.000
which has taken over and is threatening our very existentialist condition.

55:16.800 --> 55:22.480
Did you also feel that at your core, in the place of the finance minister of Greece,

55:23.280 --> 55:28.320
did you feel that you had less or more power than what you anticipated when you entered the role?

55:29.280 --> 55:33.360
Oh, I had exactly as much power as I had anticipated, precisely zero.

55:34.160 --> 55:40.560
I knew I would have none. I knew I would have none because, remember, the only reason why I was

55:40.560 --> 55:46.480
elected was because we had a massive bankruptcy, and I had become the finance minister of the most

55:46.480 --> 55:53.360
bankrupt state in the world after Puerto Rico, maybe. I knew that I wouldn't have any power.

55:53.360 --> 56:01.360
The only power I had was the power to say no, not to put my signature on another credit card

56:01.360 --> 56:08.080
on behalf of my people. That's why I was so demonized and so despised by the powers that be.

56:08.080 --> 56:15.680
They could not believe that I had the audacity not to take their money. Okay, guys.

56:18.000 --> 56:24.000
So let me end by asking you. I mean, you took the job.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.480
I didn't take the job. I mean, you're a moral imperative.

56:29.680 --> 56:37.200
Yeah. So let me end by asking, it's actually two questions. How do you decide,

56:37.920 --> 56:44.800
as a Marxist or a socialist, which trenches to die in? So for example, do you buy shares? Do you

56:47.200 --> 56:53.680
shop in Amazon? Where do you decide on moral or ethical grounds? No, I'm not going to go down

56:53.680 --> 56:59.040
that path. So that's the first question. And to wrap up, let me answer it because I won't

56:59.040 --> 57:05.920
forget it. Firstly, I don't buy shares. I have a natural and antipathy and ideological opposition

57:05.920 --> 57:11.600
to share markets. That's why my last book, which was a science fiction novel and other now,

57:12.160 --> 57:18.400
where I try to imagine a different world, there are no share markets. So no, I don't believe in

57:18.400 --> 57:23.200
horse races. I don't believe in the stock exchange. I hate derivatives. I don't do it.

57:24.640 --> 57:32.160
Only, you know, everybody shares indirectly when I can't stop it due to the super valuation fund

57:32.160 --> 57:36.960
buying shares on my behalf without asking me, right? But I would never buy consciously and

57:36.960 --> 57:44.800
purposefully shares. Do I buy Amazon.com stuff? Of course I do. Because we live in capitalism.

57:44.800 --> 57:52.240
I'm not going to survive if I simply eat and consume products produced under socialist order,

57:52.240 --> 58:00.320
which doesn't exist. When do I choose to do something like, for instance, accepting the

58:00.320 --> 58:08.480
Ministry of Finance? Well, that election in January 2015 was the election of a political party that

58:08.480 --> 58:16.480
had a reason from 4% to almost 40% in two years as a result of a popular rebellion against

58:17.440 --> 58:25.120
the dead bondage of whole people. The reason I said yes was because for four years I was

58:25.120 --> 58:32.240
criticizing what the parts that we were doing. My proposals, similar to what I was discussing with

58:32.240 --> 58:39.920
you about what to do with the banks, what to do with furlough wages, how to empower the many,

58:40.880 --> 58:46.000
these proposals were accepted and embraced by a young man who's going to be prime minister,

58:46.720 --> 58:51.600
very improbable prime minister, because as I said, up until two years before he had 4% of the vote.

58:53.120 --> 59:01.360
And people were eating out of rubbish bins. As a result of this enslavement,

59:01.360 --> 59:06.080
dead bondage, it was like, Greece had become like something like a Victorian workhouse.

59:06.160 --> 59:12.960
And I was elected. I didn't think I was going to, you know, affect the transition from capitalism

59:12.960 --> 59:18.320
to socialism or anything stupid like that. I had one task that I wanted to accomplish.

59:18.320 --> 59:22.960
And I was planning to resign the moment that task was accomplished or the moment I realized

59:22.960 --> 59:30.400
I could not accomplish it. And the task was to haircut the Greek debt so that we no longer

59:30.400 --> 59:36.320
took more credit cards on conditions of further austerity that forced more people to eat out of

59:36.320 --> 59:43.600
rubbish bins. So that's when, you know, my ethos tells me, do it. This is a job that you should

59:43.600 --> 59:52.960
try to do, even if the probability of success is low. So let me finish by just asking you simply

59:54.080 --> 59:58.640
what makes you happy and what makes you look forward to the future? What is it that really

59:58.640 --> 01:00:08.320
drives you and gives you hope? Well, besides being with the people that I love and listening

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:16.560
to the music that permits me to forget who I am, for me, good art, good music, good cinema,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.720
must help me forget who I am. But I need to lose myself in this. So when I lose myself in good

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.720
stuff, stuff that other talented people have created, I'm at I think at my happiest. That's

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:38.080
why I'm married to an artist as well. But more generally, I'll give you the answer that Captain

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.120
Picard gives in the next generation of Star Trek, which is of course a major source of

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.520
philosophical insights for me, because I'm a trekking. I don't know whether you know that.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:59.200
When he's asked, so they find in space in one of the episodes in the very last episode of Season 1,

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:07.600
they find some frozen people from the 20th century, industrialists, who froze themselves and had

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:14.240
themselves their bodies covered in space in case they're rescued and fixed and cured in the future.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:21.200
Of course, this happens 24th century. And one of these unfrozen businessmen from the 20th century

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.480
says to Picard, so you have no money here. There are no markets. Everybody gets what

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:36.160
their basic needs covered. So what do you do? What's the point of your existence?

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:45.360
And Picard says, my friend, to improve yourself. I think anything that you're doing to improve

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:54.240
yourself in a self-motivated way, you play the piano a little bit better. You write a better

01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:03.680
article, a better book. You learn how to appreciate a beautiful sunset more maturely than you did

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.760
the previous day or the previous year. That's the stuff of life.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:16.320
You make the world just that little bit more beautiful. Yanis, it's been an absolute pleasure.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.360
Welcome back anytime. Thanks for coming on. Thank you, Shane. That was fun.
