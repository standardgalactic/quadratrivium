0	6000	my intuition is that in order to understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live
6560	11520	in a complex world but are only able to perceive real things.
14400	22160	And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into the real world and so on.
22560	32640	But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to approach this problem.
32640	38480	Okay, I just, I don't know enough and I mean, it's a really, really hard question and I wouldn't
38480	44960	even begin to fake it. In the following conversation, I speak with one of the world's most creative
44960	49440	and renowned applied mathematicians, Carl Bender from Washington University.
50400	54960	Carl was also one of my own favorite lecturers. I invited him on the podcast because he has a
54960	60720	unique talent for making complicated mathematical ideas, not just understandable, but conceptually
60720	66000	beautiful. In the following, we discuss the history of imaginary numbers and how they fit
66000	71280	in with reality. We also discuss Carl's interactions with Richard Feynman and his own
71280	77200	research in quantum mechanics. I'm Shane Farnsworth and this is the Escape Sapiens podcast
77200	82400	supported by the Andrew von Braun Foundation. If you value this content, you can have a direct
82400	91040	impact on its success by liking, subscribing and sharing. And now, here's Carl Bender. I hope you
91040	102560	enjoy. Escape Sapiens. So let's start with some philosophy of mathematics. Is the effectiveness
102560	108560	of mathematics in describing the natural world in some sense unreasonable or mysterious?
111040	120480	Now, that's an interesting question. Mathematics is a subject in itself. It's a contained
120480	130080	subject. It's internally self-consistent or not. The question is, can it be applied
130720	136000	to describe the real world? And that's a very interesting question because it isn't obvious
136000	142800	that mathematics has anything whatsoever to do with the real world. And it's an extraordinarily
142800	150720	amazing thing that it does. And the recognition that mathematics, in some sense, describes
150720	156080	what's going on in the real world, that took centuries for people to become aware of that,
156240	164960	right? I mean, orbital mechanics is a typical example. When you can predict the positions of
164960	171920	the planets or you can predict an eclipse, that's extraordinary because there's no obvious reason
171920	181600	why nature should obey any kind of mathematical formula. So yes, that's a deep question. Why
181600	189840	should mathematics have anything whatsoever to do with reality as we perceive it? And of course,
189840	199120	in a dream, if you can distinguish reality from a dream, but in a dream, you look around and things
199120	205840	are happening without cause. And they do things that are unpredictable. You could be floating in
205840	211200	the air. You could be whizzing through the air and so on. And mathematically, there's absolutely
211200	216720	no possible way to explain that. So what's the difference between dream and reality?
216720	225920	Is mathematics an essential description of reality? I don't know. It appears to be,
225920	238320	of course, and people have been able to predict mathematical consequences and observe them in
238400	249600	reality with incredible precision. So the bottom line is that mathematics appears to be a complete
249600	255600	and total description of what happens in the real world. But I have no idea why.
258880	267920	I don't have a deep explanation of why. I mean, I can walk into the laboratory
267920	274080	and show you experiment after experiment where I make a prediction about what's going to happen
274080	278560	and measure it with great precision. And what I predicted really happens.
280320	286160	But I can't give you a deep, deep reason why it should.
288000	292000	Do you think there might come day where we hit a limit? So for example, at the moment,
292000	297200	we're trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity. And that's the biggest, I suppose,
297200	300800	most difficult question that physicists are currently working with. And here I'm thinking
300800	304880	along the line of Goethe's theorem or something like this. Do you think there's going to come a
304880	309360	time when really everything breaks down and we can't go any further?
311200	324480	Actually, yes, I do. Yes, I do. There are now amazing experiments where you can measure
324480	330320	extraordinarily short times, phenomena happening on extraordinarily short times.
330320	336240	But if it happens on a short enough time, then quantum mechanics comes into play.
337360	346560	And if we're talking about times of order 10 to the minus 20 seconds,
346560	356160	how does a particle move over a time scale that short? And it isn't at all clear.
356960	363920	That is, if you are making measurements of a millionth of a second, now you're still talking
363920	375600	about motion on the distance scale, say, of a bacterium or something. But when you're talking
375680	381840	about 10 to the minus, that's 10 to the minus six. But when you get down to 10 to the minus 20,
381840	388720	the uncertainty principle comes into play. It's not at all clear what is happening.
388720	396080	It may actually look like a fantasy world on that kind of a time scale. So you ask,
396080	407440	will mathematics continue to apply forever? I have my doubts. At very, very short time scales,
407440	414880	things may just look like a soup and they may be undescribable. That's a very interesting question.
416560	422000	Do you think perhaps in those cases, it could be the case that we just need a different set of
422880	426800	mathematics doesn't break down, but we're just using the wrong axioms, but potentially.
427360	440400	I have no idea. It could be that in extreme physical cases, the current theories of physics,
440400	447120	how physics works, may no longer be valid. And it's conceivable that there's a new physics
447120	456480	that happens at a micromicroscopic level, very, very short times, very short space distances.
459360	467600	But maybe it just is sort of looking at a bowl of jello and that what we're seeing
467600	473840	is in some sense an average of all of these microscopic things all happening together.
478080	485440	That could be. That could be. It's not at all, I wouldn't even guess what's going to happen
486640	493440	as you make finer and finer measurements. That's a really good question. I just have
493440	500640	absolutely no idea. I don't even know whether I should formulate an opinion because it's not
500720	507680	based on anything. But it is clear that there are many things that happen,
508880	517200	and already it's very hard to describe the process. When a particle tunnels,
519200	529840	what is happening while it's tunneling? Where is the particle? You make up a word
529920	533680	if you're a physicist to cover up the fact that you don't understand.
534880	541280	Like dark matter or dark energy. That's right. And in this case, when a particle is tunneling,
542960	547760	you call it a virtual particle, but that doesn't explain anything. It's just a word.
550160	559680	So the question is, how does, if there's a potential hill, the particle strikes the hill,
559760	564640	classically it would bounce back. Quantum mechanically, every once in a while,
564640	572160	the particle goes through whatever that means and reappears on the other side and keeps going.
574000	579680	But then here it seems like this is not a case that fits what we're talking about exactly,
579680	586240	right? Because we can predict to extraordinarily high precision the tunneling rate, for instance.
586240	591920	So that seems to be something that does fit within the realms of what mathematics can describe.
591920	596400	That's right. That's a quantity that you can
597760	605840	calculate, such as the tunneling time. However, you cannot predict whether or not a given particle
605840	619040	is going to tunnel. And if it does, while it's tunneling, so we have this vision of continuity.
619040	623600	We live in a world where things are continuous. So if I throw a baseball,
624800	632640	that baseball is always visible to me. And it's moving in a continuous way through a medium.
633600	641120	Okay? But when a particle tunnels, you can't say where the particle is as it's tunneling.
641120	648320	So I lose sight of the particle on one side of a potential hill. And then I see it again on the
648320	654480	other side. And I don't even know if it's the same particle. If it's an elementary particle,
655040	662720	if an electron strikes a potential barrier, and an electron comes out the other side,
662720	671040	is it the same? Or is it a different electron? And where was the electron as it went from one side
671040	679760	to the other? Okay? And so we have this, in our world, we see things happening continuously.
679760	684400	We don't pick up a rock and throw it. It disappears from view, and then it reappears,
684960	692400	you know, 10 feet later. It doesn't do that. But in quantum mechanics, it seems to. Okay? Now,
692400	699200	I would argue that that thing, that tunneling object, that tunneling particle, is actually going
699200	707120	through the complex plane. But that may just be a mathematical description of this tunneling phenomenon.
707840	712720	This might be a good point, I think, to jump in. Because the complex numbers are going to be
713280	719760	appearing throughout the discussion, it might be a good opportunity to introduce them. For the
719760	725520	person who has no physics background, no mathematics background, are you able to describe,
726480	732880	I can remind you of the list, but what are imaginary numbers? What are complex numbers?
733840	743840	And how do we first come up with them? Right. So when numbers were first invented,
744640	753440	that is, you know, you were counting your toes or counting your fingers, it's clear that even
753520	766000	some animals understand small integers, one, two, three, four. Okay? But it eventually became
766000	772400	clear that there were other numbers, because you could add one, one, and get another number.
773120	780320	But if you subtracted one from one, you got a new number, which was zero. And it took a while
780960	791760	to to absorb the fact that zero is also a number. Okay? But it wasn't what we're not done yet,
791760	798320	because although there's no problem with addition now, you know, if you start with one number and
798320	805120	add it to another number, you get a third number, no problem. One plus two equals three, and three is
805200	815360	a positive integer. But now subtraction gives us a problem. Okay, because two minus one is one.
816320	826000	And that's fine. But one minus two, what do we mean by that? Okay. And so we need to append
826000	832000	the negative integers, just because we understand that we can subtract as well as add.
832960	839680	Okay, I can give something away, as well as taking something in. Okay, now multiplication is fine.
841040	845680	Also, I can multiply, I can say two sets of five is 10.
847920	854480	But division again, gives me a problem. So just the way the inverse of addition,
854480	859600	which is subtraction, gave me a problem. The inverse of multiplication, which is division,
860480	866960	leads to a new problem. Okay, what is two divided by three? And that's no longer a number. And I'm
866960	875520	forced to append the rational numbers. Okay, so every time I have a new mathematical operation,
876560	882720	I may have to extend the number system. And this is worrying, because I may think of an
882720	888320	operation and then have to make the number system bigger and bigger and bigger. So for example,
888320	897600	the operation of taking a square root. Okay, so if I take the square root of four, I get two.
898240	905280	And if I take the square root of nine, I get three. But if I take the square root of two,
907280	915760	it isn't a fraction. It isn't a rational number. Okay, so I have to append a new set of numbers
915760	923360	called irrational numbers. And then of course, I can take other roots, I can take third cube roots,
924080	932720	fourth roots, fifth roots, and so on. And these, fortunately, don't generate new kinds of numbers.
932720	938720	But we have both rational numbers. And now we have irrational numbers. And eventually,
938800	946480	we have transcendental numbers. Okay, these are new kinds of irrational numbers, like pi.
948400	956880	Okay. But we're not done yet. And this is the really interesting case.
958400	965120	One kind of mathematical operation is to solve an equation. So I can write down an equation
965440	977680	like x squared equals one. And I can say, what's x? And the solution is either plus one or minus one.
978320	983440	And you come to realize that if you have an equation that contains a square, there are two answers,
984400	992720	which might happen to be the same. But they're not more than two. And if I have a cubic equation,
992720	1001280	there are three answers. But so I have a new mathematical operation called solving an equation.
1002640	1005760	But what about the equation x squared equals minus one?
1008320	1019120	Okay, so what number when you square it gives minus one? And it was recognized very early
1019120	1022480	that there must either we can't write down that equation.
1024240	1029280	Or if we want to be able to solve the equation, we have to invent a new number.
1030480	1037760	And this is a very strange number. And it's called I for imaginary. Okay. And I is a number
1038560	1046320	by definition, whose property is as one property that I squared is minus one.
1047280	1053200	And so I can solve the equation x squared equals minus one by inventing one new number,
1053200	1064240	just one. Okay. And now we have to, it took a long time to agree that I is a number.
1066000	1073840	Because it doesn't look like other numbers. Okay, it's imaginary. But it was accepted after a while.
1074800	1081200	But the first, and it was recognized that when you write down a quadratic equation,
1081200	1092400	like x squared equals minus one, a root can be imaginary. Okay, or it can be complex,
1092400	1100880	that is, it can be a combination of a real number like three, and an imaginary number like say six i.
1104000	1111840	Okay, so that we'll call, we'll call that a complex number. Okay. But now we're not done.
1113600	1125520	Because now a miracle happens. Okay. This was back in the 1500s, or somewhere around 1535 or 1540.
1125760	1141120	So imaginary numbers were already being accepted. Okay. But Cardano realized that you could have,
1142880	1152080	you could write down a cubic equation. And once again, not all the roots of a cubic algebraic
1152080	1162640	equation can be, it's not obvious whether or not those roots that are not real,
1163840	1170480	are also complex in the sense that those roots are combinations of a real number and an imaginary
1170480	1179200	number. They may be, they may require a new number yet. And the miracle is, they don't.
1179680	1186800	And that's an amazing fact. Okay. It's, it's amazing. Now, he was very interested in cubic
1186800	1195200	equations. And, and he spent his life thinking about it many, many years. And he understood it.
1195200	1200880	He came up with a cubic formula, like the quadratic formula that you learn in high school.
1201440	1214880	And then later on, shortly thereafter, it became clear that higher degree equations, like
1214880	1223040	quartic equations and so on, don't have, don't require new numbers. In other words, it appears
1223680	1233200	as if you have filled out the number system. And there aren't any ways of generating new kinds of
1233200	1242960	numbers. Okay. Now there are new kinds of mathematical systems. Okay. There are systems of matrices
1242960	1251120	and so on. But in terms of numbers, just numbers, and I'll say what, what I mean by that in a second.
1251840	1262400	Um, but the, that these numbers are now complete. But the real numbers, which includes the positive
1262400	1269360	numbers, the negative numbers, the irrational and irrational numbers. And then this, those real
1269360	1278160	numbers multiplied by I together. So A plus I times B, where A and B are real numbers.
1279120	1288320	Those numbers fill out the complex number system. And it's remarkable that there aren't any operations
1289360	1298160	that force us to bring in new kinds of numbers. There are new kinds of number systems that exist
1298160	1305360	with, with, with even more advanced kinds of numbers belonging to those systems. But this system
1305360	1313520	is complete. And this is a beautiful, beautiful result. And the complex number system
1315040	1321840	needs to be there. Okay. It has to be there because what is happening
1322640	1328080	in the, in the complex, in the system of complex numbers is connected to what is happening
1328960	1336320	just on the real, just for the real numbers, we would say on the real axis. So the real numbers
1336320	1343440	are on a number line, a one-dimensional number line. The complex numbers lie in a plane. This is
1343440	1350960	the imaginary direction, the I direction. This is the real direction. Okay. And any point in the
1350960	1359760	plane has the form A plus I times B. A is how far you are in this direction. B is how far you
1359760	1366800	are in the imaginary direction. And you multiply that by I to keep track of that. So A plus I,
1366800	1374960	B is a point in the complex plane. In order to describe, to understand what is happening with
1374960	1382080	the real numbers, you need to know what is happening in the complex plane. There are all kinds of
1385680	1392480	phenomena that cannot be simply described just in terms of real numbers. And that's remarkable.
1394240	1400480	Could you give an intuitive picture of how these are actually used in engineering and science?
1401280	1404160	So what sort of scenarios arise where you might need them?
1405200	1416080	Well, first of all, in mathematics. Okay. So if you take the function one over one plus x square,
1417600	1427120	okay, one divided by one plus x squared, if you plot that function, it is a very smooth
1427200	1437680	function on the real axis. So a kid in junior high school can make a plot of the function
1437680	1446400	one over one plus x squared. The plot looks like this. It has a nice smooth bump in the middle.
1447040	1451120	It falls off to zero as you go off to infinity. Could it be smoother?
1451680	1459600	Okay. And if you know calculus, this function can be infinitely differentiated.
1460560	1469200	So it can be differentiated an infinite number of times. It has no discontinuities. It is perfectly
1469200	1480800	smooth. However, if you expand this function in a series, just by expanding it in a geometric
1480800	1487680	series, you know, one over one plus x squared is equal to one minus x squared plus x to the fourth
1487680	1499680	minus x to the sixth and so on. That series diverges if x is bigger than is one or more.
1500560	1510400	Why? Why does the series diverge? Is it one over one minus x squared?
1512960	1520480	No, that has a place where it's infinite. One over one minus x squared becomes infinite
1520480	1527040	when x is plus or minus one. So you could say, oh, I know why the series for that function diverges
1527040	1534720	is because the function becomes infinite. Okay. So the series for that function converges until
1534720	1542720	the function becomes infinite. Okay. I can buy that. But what about one over one plus x squared?
1542720	1551040	That function is perfectly smooth. It doesn't ever become infinite. And yet the series that
1551040	1560240	represents that function ceases to converge. It becomes infinite when x equals one or when x equals
1560240	1570080	minus one. Why is that? And the answer is that there are places where that function does become
1570080	1576720	infinite, but not on the real axis. It becomes infinite in the complex plane. And in the complex
1576800	1585120	plane, it becomes infinite at x equals i and x equals minus i. And that's because i squared is minus
1585120	1594080	one. So one over one plus x squared becomes one over zero. And so it blows up. So the function
1595040	1606480	is becomes singular. That means infinite in the complex plane. But the fact that it is
1606480	1611680	infinite in the complex plane, one unit away from the origin in the vertical direction,
1612480	1618320	apparently affects what is happening one unit away in the horizontal direction.
1619040	1628400	That is incredible. So what is happening on the real axis is controlled by what is happening in
1628400	1638720	the complex plane. So there is a connection. So we live on the real axis. Everything that we
1638720	1646560	perceive is real. When you look in your wallet, you have a real number of dollars. Okay.
1647280	1658640	When you measure your IQ, it's real. Okay. When you measure a quantity of anything, you count it
1658640	1667680	in terms of real numbers. And indeed, if you ask how many spoonfuls are there in this container here,
1668480	1679280	it may be a rational number, but it's a real rational number. Okay. But the complex numbers
1679280	1686400	do affect how the real numbers behave and how operations on the real numbers
1687040	1693760	are performed and how effective they are. Okay. So when you represent a function by a series,
1694640	1702400	that series may cease to converge. And when it does, the explanation has to do with what's going
1702400	1719440	on in the complex plane. Okay. And there are interesting physical examples of how the complex
1719440	1730960	plane is affecting the physical behavior of objects. Okay. So that's quite subtle and quite
1730960	1741920	interesting. And we can see it even in elementary, we don't have to go to quantum mechanics to see
1742640	1753040	problems like this. We can see it in the case of classical mechanics, just simple classical
1753040	1760160	motion. We can see things that are happening that are very hard to explain with real numbers alone.
1760960	1771760	But there are also real problems that we cannot understand without using complex numbers.
1773120	1777600	So if a student who is just learning about imaginary numbers came to you and asked,
1779040	1784640	are these things real? Or are they just a mathematical trick? I suppose then your answer
1784640	1790240	would be, we can measure it, right? We can go ahead and there are functions that we can calculate
1790240	1795360	and they behave the way they do only because of the existence of the imaginary numbers and
1795360	1800000	their behavior can only be explained by the existence of the complex numbers. So in that sense,
1800640	1805200	there is real as real numbers. There is measurable as real numbers.
1805200	1811520	What I'm arguing is that the complex plane is not just a beautiful mathematical construct,
1812400	1821680	but starting in the 1920s, which is very late, people began to realize that the complex plane
1822320	1830560	is necessary to describe some physical processes, namely microscopic physical processes.
1830560	1838400	Macroscopic physical processes don't seem to require the complex plane, although
1839120	1846480	complex mathematics is very useful in understanding equations. So you understand,
1846480	1857840	so all of the classical theories like classical mechanics, astronomical motion, orbital motion,
1857840	1865920	and so on, fluid dynamics, electricity, those are 19th century theories.
1868000	1876640	I mean, we're developed to a very high level by the 19th century and even in the 20th century,
1876640	1884160	relativity, special relativity and general relativity, gravity, don't seem to require
1884560	1895760	complex numbers. In fact, later on, it was discovered that they do, but before the 1920s,
1895760	1905280	nobody had any idea that you were required to use the number I. But even in special relativity,
1905280	1916000	you do need to use the number I, and I can talk about that later. But what I'm saying is that
1917920	1924640	you can't avoid it. The complex number system is actually, I was going to say really,
1924640	1933680	but I shouldn't do that. That's a pun. It's actually present and determines not just the
1933760	1940800	behavior of mathematics, real mathematics, but it determines the behavior of real physics that
1940800	1948560	we are measuring. And that is what quantum mechanics does. So one scenario that immediately
1948560	1956080	pops into my mind is electrons bound in an atom, right? When you first learn about quantum mechanics,
1956080	1961760	we learned that electrons can't take any sort of energy with inside the atom, but they exist
1961760	1967680	in sort of quantized states, and that they transition between these states. Do you have
1967680	1973280	a picture for what happens as they're transitioning between the states? Is that similar, where there's
1973280	1983760	sort of a complex space in which they travel through? Yeah. So a long time ago, when I
1983760	1993600	wrote my thesis, I began to realize that this picture that we have of what you're describing
1993600	2004000	is the quantum mechanics that was being developed in the 1920s and later in the 1930s. And we say
2004960	2012800	that a particle in a potential, so this time it's a right-side-up potential,
2014480	2021280	so if you had a classical particle in a right-side-up potential,
2022320	2029120	it would be a particle that's rolling back and forth in a potential hill. And
2029760	2036960	classically, you would say you can give this particle any amount of energy that you like,
2039280	2046800	but quantum mechanically, we learn that only discrete energy levels are allowed.
2048240	2054000	Could I stop you just for one second? So there will be lots of people who don't understand the
2054000	2058400	connection between the potential and the atom scenario, where you have an electron that's
2058880	2062560	bound. Could you just say a few words there for just to clarify for some people?
2062560	2074080	Right. So a potential is described using units of energy. So in general, a particle has a certain
2074080	2080960	amount of energy. It has kinetic energy, which is energy of motion. If it's moving faster,
2080960	2088080	it has more energy. And it also has potential energy. So if it is subject to forces,
2088080	2094960	such as the force of gravity, a particle, if you raise it up, has more potential,
2095840	2101840	because it's higher up in the gravitational field. So it's not moving, but it has more energy.
2106960	2113040	If a particle is moving in a gravitational field, some of the energy of the particle is
2113920	2119360	the energy of the motion called kinetic energy. And some of the energy is potential energy,
2119360	2126560	which means how high the particle is. If the particle goes lower, it will be going faster.
2127680	2132880	And if it's higher, it will be going slower. If you throw a ball up into the air, at first it's
2132880	2138560	going fast. It then goes higher and higher and higher. And some of its energy, its energy of
2138560	2147600	motion becomes potential energy. And that potential energy is being stored in that particle.
2149040	2154880	Eventually, it may stop and then start falling down again. And as it falls,
2154880	2163120	it loses potential energy, but it gains kinetic energy. In an atom, you don't have gravity,
2163120	2171440	but you have electrical forces that are holding the electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.
2173040	2181200	If you think of this as a classical system, you might think of it as a solar system, where the
2182160	2189200	planets that are far from the, all the planets are held together by the force of the sun,
2189200	2194720	the gravitational force. The planets close to the sun are moving very quickly. The planets far
2194720	2206800	from the sun are moving slowly, but they have a lot more potential energy. So if you think of an atom
2206800	2213520	that way, which means classically, you would say, I can put a planet in any orbit I like.
2214160	2225200	It could be at a radius of 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, 7.9 miles. It doesn't matter, okay, but
2228640	2234480	quantum mechanically, that's not what happens. It's very interesting that planets,
2236640	2242240	which are acting classically, can be any distance from the sun and they can have any amount of
2242240	2254480	energy you want them to have. But in an atom, an electron can only be, can only have a given
2254480	2261600	amount of energy and that can be demonstrated in the laboratory, okay. So the naive picture,
2261600	2267360	if you want to think of the electrons as being, as moving in a real
2267760	2275840	sense, that is, you know, moving about back and forth inside the atom, you have some sort of
2275840	2281440	fog of electrons that are moving around. You don't know where any of the electrons are,
2282720	2289760	but a given electron cannot have, is not allowed to have any amount of energy at once.
2290160	2300480	I can't do that. It has discrete energy levels and these are called, these are called energy
2300480	2306160	levels or states and the electron can be in a state of this much energy, this much energy,
2306160	2312240	this much energy, and so on. Okay, those are energy levels and you can see those energy levels
2312240	2320240	when, when you allow the atom to interact with light and you can see, you know, when you look at
2320240	2326240	a spec, you do a spectral analysis, you can see the specific energy levels, okay, they're very
2326240	2333200	visible. Okay, now, and furthermore, you can predict them mathematically. But what is very
2334160	2341280	very interesting is that the picture is more complicated than that. So, you can,
2342160	2348480	instead of studying the atom on the real axis, you can study the atom in the complex plane.
2350720	2358320	And in the complex plane, you can see that the electron is moving in a certain direction,
2358400	2369760	in the complex plane. And in the complex plane, the, the possible energies for the electron
2370640	2379440	are continuous. They're not discrete. Okay, that's an amazing result. This is
2380400	2386000	the work that I did in my thesis, in fact, a long time ago. And
2388000	2397280	so why is it that they look discrete? And that's because we live on the real axis. And so when
2397280	2406000	we see an electron, it can only have this much energy, this much energy, and so on. But, but
2406320	2416080	in the complex plane, the electron can move, can have any energy, as it moves off into the complex
2416080	2423600	plane. But when it crosses the real axis, it can only have these discrete energies. So what
2423600	2429600	with continuous is actually, what, what is discrete is actually at a higher level at the
2429680	2436400	higher level at the complex level is actually now continuous. The way I describe this, if I'm giving
2436400	2444640	a lecture on this, is I say, imagine a parking garage. Okay, you enter the parking garage,
2446160	2453840	and you see that the parking garage has distinct levels, it may be the five level parking garage,
2453840	2462080	you drive into it. But in fact, you can continuously drive from one level to the next to the next to
2462080	2469680	the next. Okay, but if you were to take a gigantic saw, and cut the parking garage, cut right through
2469680	2476400	the parking garage and pull it apart, what you would see is discrete levels. But the complex
2476400	2483440	plane says that there's something much more sophisticated going on. And that the levels
2483920	2490000	in this parking garage are continuous. Okay, and you can go continuously
2490000	2495600	from one level to the next to the next, just by moving through the complex plane.
2495600	2500240	And does the dynamics in the complex plane also work, the calculations you can do?
2500240	2506880	Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. You can look at the motion as the particles are traveling in the
2506880	2516000	complex plane. And if you want to understand motion on the real axis, you look at the limit
2516640	2523200	as you approach the real axis. And the complex motion is very complicated. But as you approach
2523200	2528960	the real axis, it becomes recognizable as what we know and love. You know, what happens when you
2529040	2535840	throw a baseball. Okay, but in the complex plane, you have more interesting motion.
2537840	2542640	So famously, quantum mechanics has a number of different interpretations. There's sort of the
2542640	2547920	Copenhagen interpretation and pilot wave interpretations, many worlds and so on. Does
2547920	2555280	this shed, does this sort of idea shed any light on which of these interpretations may be correct?
2555280	2561200	Or are you able to say something deeper because of this insight, this analytic continuation?
2562400	2572160	So when I was a graduate student, and I was getting ready to begin my thesis work,
2573440	2584080	you have to take a qualifying exam to demonstrate that you are qualified. You've successfully
2586080	2596080	passed all of your required courses to go on to a PhD, to write a PhD thesis that you've sufficiently
2596080	2602160	mastered what you've learned in your courses. This is a qualifying exam and it can be a very
2602160	2607600	difficult exam. It may be an all day exam, maybe an oral exam, maybe a written exam and so on.
2608000	2616480	In my case, it was an oral exam, very frightening because the first time I ever stood up in front
2616480	2624480	of a committee of people who were throwing questions at me, very hard questions. My friends who had
2624480	2630720	already passed the exam, of course, gave me some advice. And the advice was, if you don't know
2630720	2641040	the answer to a question, don't try to fake it. Say you don't know because if you try to fake it,
2642240	2648560	they will ask you harder and harder and harder questions until they show that you don't know
2648560	2653360	what you're talking about. But if you honestly say, I don't know, let me think about it.
2653600	2667040	You don't back yourself into a corner. And indeed, when I had my exam,
2671120	2679760	I was asked a very hard question and I said, I don't know. And one of the people on my committee
2679760	2685920	said the answer must be this. And another person on the committee said, no, you're wrong. And my whole
2685920	2690720	committee started arguing with each other because nobody was certain about what the answer was to
2690720	2700800	the question. And I felt great because they were ignoring me. Well, you've asked me a very hard
2700800	2712160	question about the, I mean, quantum mechanics is not, it depends on how you approach quantum
2712160	2718720	mechanics. If your approach is that of a mathematician, and you'd like to solve the
2718720	2726640	Schrodinger equation, for example, as a mathematical problem, that I can do. But if you want to go
2726640	2733200	into deep philosophical interpretation, and there are many different interpretations
2733760	2743920	about quantum mechanics, many worlds and so on. I would say my intuition is that in order to
2743920	2750880	understand quantum mechanics, you have to understand that we live in a complex world, but are only able
2750880	2762000	to perceive real things. And that particles can visit the complex world and come back out into
2762000	2772640	the real world and so on. But I don't know, I can't give you a serious answer about how to
2772640	2778480	approach this problem. Okay, I just, I don't know enough. And I mean, it's a really, really hard
2778480	2785520	question. And I wouldn't even begin to fake it. Okay, I mean, I can, I can tell you about solutions
2785520	2793680	to equations. But when it comes to a very high level philosophical interpretation about what
2795520	2801120	quantum mechanics is very strange. And there are these different interpretations of quantum
2801120	2809360	mechanics. What should I say? My choice is not to say anything at this point. That's a long answer.
2811440	2817440	I'm not, I'm not trying to evade the question, although that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
2818400	2823280	Okay, I also don't know the question. I also don't know the answer. So I'm like one of the people in
2823280	2831520	your one of the examiners. But yeah, yeah, there was a very, very hard question. And you can see
2831520	2842960	people arguing about, you know, what is quantum mechanics? Okay, I mean, quantum mechanics goes
2842960	2852720	beyond our perception of the world. Okay, because it's what happens in
2855120	2863040	to very, very small masses. And what happens over distance scales that are very, very small.
2863680	2869520	And there are now people are doing macroscopic quantum quantum mechanical experiments.
2869760	2878640	But quantum behavior is, is described in the small, okay, and it's different from our perception of the
2878640	2883840	real world. What is also happening is that there are now strange things that are happening in the
2883840	2895280	large, okay, that is, gravity may be repulsive at gigantic distances, which is very interesting. Okay,
2895520	2905440	okay. And, and so is this, is this PT symmetric conformal gravity type directions or
2908320	2915600	I can talk about that. I mean, it would be, it would be more of a more discussion, but I'm happy
2915600	2920480	to chat about it. I think, I think that would be a mistake for the scope of this interview,
2920560	2925840	because I think it will, I think it would take too many steps to get there. But what we can do
2925840	2930800	is we can talk about your research more generally in PT symmetry. Because I think, I think that is
2931840	2939200	something that's very interesting that people will be able to follow in a confined bit of time.
2940400	2945920	So, so let's do that then. If you're happy with that, let's jump into with just very the basic
2945920	2955920	question. What is PT symmetry and what does it mean conceptually? Yeah, so P, the letter P stands for
2955920	2965680	parity, which means reflecting space. Okay, so it's what you see when you look in a mirror.
2967120	2974160	When you look in a mirror, your left hand becomes your right hand and so on. So it is a
2975040	2981440	spatially reversed picture that you see. Okay.
2985760	2994160	So, so that's parity. Okay, and it refers to space reflection, reflection through a mirror.
2994400	3005520	Okay, T means time reversal. And we can't physically reverse time. But mathematically,
3005520	3016560	we can imagine time flowing backward. Okay, and in fact, Wigner showed that time reversal
3016800	3027680	corresponds to changing the sign of I in the complex numbers. Okay, so there's this deep connection
3028800	3039600	between time reversal and complex number theory. Okay. And so PT symmetric quantum mechanics,
3039600	3047360	what is that? Before I say anything about quantum mechanics, let me still
3049280	3057280	remind you about classical mechanics. Okay, so, you know, Einstein's gigantic breakthrough
3057280	3065840	at the beginning of the 20th century was the discovery of special relativity.
3066160	3076720	Okay, it's a fantastic discovery. And what he basically said was that if you do
3078160	3090640	a Lorentz transformation, which means that you go from one dynamical system,
3091520	3096720	okay, to another dynamical system, moving relative to you. That's why it's called relativity.
3096720	3102560	It's moving. So you're moving through space like this. Another system is moving at a greater speed
3103200	3109440	through space. Okay, they can look at each other. And the question is, what about the relative
3111280	3116480	physics between, you know, what is when one person in one space looks at a person in the other,
3116800	3123680	in one platform that looks at a person on the other platform, what do they see? And they see
3123680	3130480	time dilation and space contraction and so on. They see things that are that are relativistic.
3130480	3144400	Okay. At a slightly higher level, you describe how one person looks at another person or how
3144400	3151280	one person is related to another person in terms of a mathematical object called a group.
3152080	3158320	Okay. And they talk about the Lorentz group. So when you perform a Lorentz transformation,
3159280	3166320	you go from one object floating through space to another object flowing through space. Okay. So
3166320	3181920	you transform from here to here. Okay. Is that clear? So Einstein gave us something that we
3181920	3188880	didn't have before. He pointed out that, and this is not quantum mechanics. This is classical
3188880	3198080	mechanics. That classical mechanics, in fact, is, doesn't behave the way you think it's behaving,
3198080	3206480	because all of your, your world experiences are connected with slowly moving things.
3207760	3214080	When I say slowly moving, I mean much slower than the speed of light. And he shows us,
3214080	3220400	Einstein shows us that the speed of light is the fastest you can go. And as you go faster and
3220400	3227760	faster and faster, new effects come into play, which you could never have imagined. Okay. Namely,
3227760	3241760	time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and so on. So the Lorentz group is all possible ways
3242720	3247360	of transforming, of performing a Lorentz transformation, transforming from one frame of
3247360	3255440	reference to another frame of reference. Is that clear? I can show on screen as well some aides.
3256240	3267840	Okay. Good. So what's an example of a Lorentz transformation? So one, the simplest possible
3268000	3272800	transformation is you don't do anything. You just stay in your same frame of reference.
3273360	3281040	So that's unity. You don't do anything. Another Lorentz transformation is to,
3281040	3286880	suddenly, is to jump onto a platform that's moving five miles an hour faster than you are.
3287760	3294560	Okay. But another very interesting kind of Lorentz transformation would be to reflect space.
3295280	3306400	Okay. That's a transformation. So what is happening is now a mirror image. So you're
3306400	3311920	moving this way, and you jump onto something moving at the same speed, but going that way.
3312560	3316320	That would be, that would be a possible transformation.
3317280	3323280	And even fancier transformation would be to reflect time.
3326880	3337040	Okay. So after the discovery of the Lorentz group, which is the set of all possible transformations,
3337040	3344800	infinite numbers of possible transformations, it was believed that if you had a laboratory that
3344800	3350400	was going forward in time, and another laboratory that was going backward in time,
3351120	3355440	and they each did an experiment, they would always get the same result. For example,
3355440	3361920	if they measured how long it took for a radioactive particle to decay, or they did a chemical
3361920	3369600	experiment or someone, it would be the same. And it was also believed that if you reflected a
3369600	3377520	laboratory through a mirror, you looked at a mirror image. Okay. And you did an experiment
3377520	3383600	in this reflected world, things would be the same. Now, in fact, we don't experience this because
3384320	3394080	there are, you know, proteins are in the shape of a helix, as you know, DNA is in helix.
3394800	3403120	And there is a left-handed helix and a right-handed helix going in opposite directions.
3404320	3409520	And we only deal with proteins that spiral one way, not the other way.
3411120	3417760	Okay. However, in principle, you could have left-handed life and right-handed life,
3418000	3430080	but we don't see that. And it was believed that a reflection in space and a reflection in time
3430880	3437920	are to be included in the set of all possible transformations. Okay. And it was believed for
3437920	3449360	many years. So Einstein is at the beginning, you know, 1905, right? But much later, 50 years later,
3449360	3457520	more than 50 years later, it was realized that space reflection is not, in fact, an allowed
3457520	3464800	Lorentz transformation. Because if you do a space reflection, you get different physics.
3465120	3473840	And that's unbelievable. I mean, it's amazing. I would never have believed it. And that, of course,
3474880	3480240	was, you know, Li and Yang, and they won the Nobel Prize for it.
3481200	3488400	So could I stop and sort of reiterate what you've said, just to make sure I understand exactly,
3488400	3493920	and that others are following? So you have this symmetry group. You can change your frame of
3493920	3499440	reference. You can do rotations of your reference frame, for instance. But you're talking about
3499440	3505920	discrete transformations, like reflection symmetry. So you turn a right-handed frame
3505920	3512640	into a left-handed frame. And it was believed that those were also symmetries of nature, just like...
3513360	3519760	Because they are elements of the Lorentz group, as it was mathematically formulated.
3520400	3525680	Okay. But then you do an experiment. But then you do an experiment, it's not.
3525680	3533920	To put it differently, there is a light cone, which basically says that the speed of light
3533920	3539520	is a unique speed. A particle moving it, if we were moving at the speed of light,
3540320	3547520	would satisfy an equation called the light cone condition. And that says that x squared plus
3547520	3556240	y squared plus z squared minus t squared is a constant. And a space reflection means x goes
3556240	3566240	to minus x, y goes to minus y, and z goes to minus z. But they're squared. So the minus sign
3566240	3573680	doesn't make any difference. So it's obvious that parity should be a symmetry. Why should it be that
3573680	3579760	if you look in the mirror, there's a different world. And nobody imagined that possibility.
3580640	3584560	But it is different. They are not the same world.
3585200	3588560	So through... This is the weak force, right? Which is chiral.
3588560	3593200	Right. Right. Very, very good. So strong forces.
3593200	3599120	So do you mind if I pause? Sorry, because I think this is a topic that will confuse people.
3600000	3606960	So what you're saying very basically at its core is physics shouldn't depend on the way that you
3606960	3613600	look at it. It should be invariant under Bob or Sue looking at it from different directions.
3614400	3621120	And so you can change the frame at which you're looking at the physics. And so that includes
3621120	3628000	rotations, these sort of things, as I said before. And we assumed a different way of looking at things
3628000	3632880	that wouldn't change the physics was just doing one of these inversions sort of in space,
3632880	3637440	this sort of changing from a left frame to a right-handed frame. But in experiment, that's not
3637440	3644160	true. We find surprisingly, amazingly, that this is not just a different way of looking at nature,
3644160	3647040	but that it really is different physics if you change the frame.
3648000	3658320	Right on. Right on. Now, there's a second discovery that happened after Lee and Young,
3659360	3667520	which was verified by experiments that Madame Wu did the year later. So they did the theory and
3667600	3679760	Madame Wu did the experiment. It was realized by Cronin and Fitch, who also won the Nobel Prize,
3679760	3687680	that time reversal changes the physics. That is, a laboratory going backward in time
3689680	3693840	will get different experimental results than a laboratory going forward in time.
3694080	3705120	Okay. So the group of Lorentz transformations is much smaller because it cannot include the
3705120	3715280	element P or the element T. Could I ask you just, sorry, this is something that people are going
3715280	3720720	to wonder about. How on earth do you set up an experiment that's going back in time?
3721600	3735120	Oh, of course, you can't. But you can have such a laboratory. But you can interpret
3735120	3741520	a particle spinning one way as a particle that spins the other way, but is going backward in
3741520	3749440	time. That sort of thing. Okay. So you can spin it up this way and you could spin it up that way.
3750080	3756160	And so it's the motions of the particle that are reversed. But of course, you can't go backward
3756160	3762960	in time. You can't directly do that. So yes, the experiment is inferential in that sense.
3763600	3771920	Okay. But it is a clear experiment. Okay. So physics that is time reversed is different physics.
3772400	3780560	Okay. And this raises a very, very interesting question. What happens if you reverse space
3780560	3788000	and time? Okay. So, you know, the point about the Lorentz group is that we're talking about
3788000	3793920	space time. And if you want to be mathematical about it, we don't want to distinguish between
3793920	3801440	space and time. It's simply four dimensional space. Okay. And if you reflect part of it,
3802240	3808640	that's no good. And if you reflect the other part of it, if you reflect the three space dimensions,
3808640	3817200	no good. The one time dimension, no good. But what if you reflect all four? That seems to be
3818160	3825200	much more symmetric in a way because we're talking about four dimensional space, change the sign of
3825200	3836240	all four dimensions. Okay. Now, there is a theorem, a very famous theorem called the CPT theorem.
3836320	3849360	And what it says is that if you reflect space and you reflect time and you change
3849360	3857840	particles into antiparticles, then you will get the same result. Okay. Now, not everybody
3857840	3864400	believes the CPT theorem and people do experiments to see if they can find violations of that theorem,
3864400	3870880	but they haven't been found. So there's something very special about the product of P and T.
3872160	3882960	Not P separately or T separately, but PT. Okay. And what we were talking about very early about
3883040	3892640	the classical physics and infinity and complex motion and so on,
3895200	3907360	those are PT, we did PT reflections. I didn't call it that, but those are PT reflections. So
3908320	3919040	let's put it this way. What would PT symmetry, what is PT symmetry? Okay. So imagine that I have
3919920	3926880	a pail and I'm pouring water into this pail. Well, the pail will be filling up with water,
3926880	3931440	so the pail is not in equilibrium. There's more and more water all the time.
3932160	3942000	Okay. And suppose I have another pail over here and there's a hole in this pail and the water in
3942000	3949120	the pail is draining out. That pail is not in equilibrium because it has less and less water.
3949120	3957520	This situation, however, is PT symmetric. Okay. In the following sense,
3958480	3966800	if I reflect space, then the pails are interchanged. But if I reflect time,
3968000	3973280	the water going out becomes the water going in and the water going in becomes the water going
3973280	3980960	out. It reverses direction. Now it's the same. So if I switch the buckets and reverse time,
3980960	3987600	the image remains the same. Right. So that's an example of a PT symmetric reflection.
3988400	4000880	And it's the same. Okay. Now we can do something else. We can connect the two pails with a pipe.
4003120	4009520	And now this system is a very strange system because water is flowing into one pail.
4009520	4015120	It's now flowing through the pipe into the other pail where it's flowing out.
4017600	4024800	Okay. This system is in dynamical equilibrium. So the water level in each pail
4024800	4030800	stays exactly the same. It's not changing. Why? Because water is flowing in. It flows to the
4030800	4037360	other pail. It flows out and the level of water in each pail is the same. Normally physicists
4037360	4044160	would say that there are two types of physical systems. There are systems that are isolated. So
4044160	4052880	an atom sitting all by itself, not interacting with a beam of light or x-rays or it's completely
4052880	4062080	isolated from the rest of the world. This system has a given set of energy levels. Okay. And all
4062080	4069520	those energies are real. Okay. But there's another kind of system which is interacting with the outside
4069520	4078720	world. Stuff is going into the system and stuff is going out of the system. Okay. And that is a
4078720	4087840	system in contact with its environment. Okay. And this system may not be in equilibrium because
4087840	4093760	you may be putting more stuff in than you're taking out and the system is filling up with stuff,
4093760	4098000	with whatever the stuff is. It could be energy, it could be number of particles,
4098000	4105760	it could be the amount of water. It doesn't matter. Okay. But PT symmetric systems are systems which
4105760	4112880	are similar to both. Okay. In the sense that they are in contact with the environment,
4113440	4120560	stuff is going in and stuff is going out in a balanced PT symmetric fashion. Okay.
4121280	4132240	But at the same time, they are in dynamic equilibrium. Okay. So these are special new kinds
4132240	4139120	of systems and they behave very much like systems of one type, isolated systems,
4140080	4146400	and systems of another type which are not isolated. They're in contact with the environment. So
4148000	4158640	in what ways are they the same? Well, they have real energies or they may have real energies to
4158640	4166320	be more precise. Can I ask? Okay. So the pitch that you paint is sort of, it's very intuitive
4167280	4171680	and because I can imagine a system which is in this sort of dynamical equilibrium,
4171680	4176000	I can imagine closed systems which have no energy or other things coming in and out,
4176720	4181920	and then I can imagine open systems or systems that are in contact with the external world,
4181920	4190160	whether it's a flow of energy or temperature or heat rather, or particles. It doesn't seem so
4190160	4197040	crazy to consider these three options, but yet when you first started playing, it was around
4197040	4201760	the year 2000, right? When you started playing around with PT symmetry and quantum mechanics,
4201760	4211680	why? Yeah, it was just around 2000 and it was shocking, right? I was completely shocked and
4211680	4219920	appalled. I was completely thrown by this. So this is a picture that I want to somehow paint
4220160	4227280	for people. Why was this shocking? Why? Because of course, you've given us this nice intuitive
4227280	4233120	picture. Can you sort of reel us back and explain why that somehow wasn't expected,
4233120	4235920	that you would find these three sorts of systems in quantum mechanics?
4236800	4253200	Right. So this isn't easy, but let me try. So when you take an elementary course
4253200	4258480	in quantum mechanics, your very first encounter with quantum mechanics,
4259440	4270400	what you learn is that the very first thing that you study or among the first things that you study
4270400	4276080	is a simple atom, like a hydrogen atom. And you learn that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom
4276080	4283200	are all real and all real energies. There is a ground state and there are various excited states
4283840	4295840	and these energies are real. Of course, that's an isolated hydrogen atom. If you connect the hydrogen
4295840	4304720	atom to its environment, the energies are not real. Why is that? Because if you have a hydrogen
4304720	4312160	atom in an excited state, what can that atom do? The atom can drop to a lower energy state
4313120	4320160	and radiate a photon which carries away some of that energy. Energy is conserved,
4320160	4332720	but a photon, a tiny burst of light will come out. When we look at a neon light at night,
4333680	4343120	and street signs, especially a neon light or an argon light, what you're seeing
4343680	4353520	is electrons in excited neon atoms dropping to lower energy levels and giving off light,
4353520	4363680	characteristic color of neon light. Since those systems are not stable,
4365040	4372000	we interpret that as meaning that the energies are actually complex. In any case, you take
4372000	4376640	your elementary course in quantum mechanics and the very first question, kind of question,
4376720	4383600	that arises is, when are the energy levels real and when are the energy levels complex?
4384960	4393440	There is a condition, a very famous condition, called hermiticity. You say that a hermitian
4393440	4398640	system has real energy levels and you learned this at the very beginning.
4399440	4415440	The reason that ptsymmetric systems are shocking is that they can be systems that are not hermitian
4416720	4425520	but still have real energy levels. In the sense that in that funny classical model I had of a ball
4425520	4431680	rolling up the hill and going on and then coming back from infinity, it continues on. It's not
4431680	4438960	changing. It's in a fixed state. It's in a fixed energy level state and yet it's connected to its
4438960	4448640	environment because stuff is going out to infinity and coming in from infinity. It should definitely
4448720	4455040	not have a real energy level. What should happen, you would think, is that all the stuff
4456560	4461040	runs off to infinity and it's gone. It runs downhill and there's no more energy. All the
4461040	4472080	energy has radiated out to infinity and it's gone. That's sort of our intuitive picture.
4472880	4479120	If you have something hot, what does it do? It radiates energy. The energy flows away off
4479120	4488480	to infinity and it's gone. The state was not in a stable state. Yet what I've argued is that if
4488480	4495040	you include the complex plane, now you can have states that are connected to their environment.
4495600	4501520	Particles can flow out to infinity and come in from infinity and the state is stable.
4503760	4512720	It's in dynamic equilibrium. It can radiate. It can be connected to its environment and yet
4512720	4524320	not change. I'm not going to give you the mathematical condition, but this is a state
4524400	4531520	that violates this elementary condition of hermiticity and yet has real energies.
4533920	4539440	As I say, when I first took my quantum mechanics course in the first week or two,
4540640	4549600	the professor said, the way you know if there are real energies corresponding to states that
4549600	4557200	are stable, unchanging in time and equilibrium. If the energy is real, the states will not be
4557200	4567520	changing their physical properties. This is the condition of hermiticity. Here,
4569360	4577200	I am talking about physical systems that are not hermitian and yet they're not changing in time.
4578160	4585920	This is a whole new class of quantum mechanical and classical mechanical systems,
4586800	4592960	like the pales of water that shows classical physics, which are connected to their environments
4595360	4606080	and yet they're stable. This requires the use of complex variables.
4606960	4617360	The mathematical underpinning is based on complex numbers, but we know that complex numbers are
4617360	4622400	really there in physics that are required. At the very beginning of quantum mechanics,
4622400	4628960	you have complex numbers. It's funny. I should point out that when I went through my physics
4628960	4635280	undergrad, this condition, this hermiticity condition is still hammered into you. The
4635360	4640080	quantum mechanics grates Heisenberg and from there onwards, I suppose, this has been hammered
4640080	4646160	into person after person after person. It's so heavily ingrained that it really is shocking.
4650720	4656880	There are physical systems. You can go away and you can do an experiment. This has quite wide
4656880	4663120	applicability. Let me say it just to make sure. Let me say it right. I'm not saying there's anything
4663120	4673600	wrong about hermiticity. The statement is, if you have a physical system that is described
4674400	4680720	as a Hermitian one, that is the equations for the system are Hermitian,
4681760	4686800	then the energies will be real. I'm not saying there's anything wrong about that.
4686800	4696000	What I am saying is that if the system is not Hermitian, which means that you are working in
4696000	4703920	the complex plane, the energies can still be real and the system can still live in a stable state.
4704800	4712960	That's the surprise. What it means is that there are huge numbers of new physical systems
4713600	4724560	that we can study. If you want a serious example that has been performed in a laboratory
4725280	4734560	to verify the equations that we have written down, here it is. Here's an example. Imagine you have
4735120	4742720	a fiber, a very thin fiber, and light is flowing through the fiber. This was the earliest
4744800	4753120	example, an incredibly beautiful example of a non-Hermitian PT symmetric system.
4753360	4766160	Light is just traveling down this fiber. We have a second fiber and light is also traveling down the
4766160	4776000	fiber. You put light in one end of the fiber and it comes out the other end. Is that clear?
4776560	4785440	So we have two fibers. Now, it's a physical fact that if you put two fibers close to each other,
4786560	4793120	light can leak out of one fiber into the other fiber. For example, if you have a fiber with no
4793120	4804720	light in it and a fiber with light flowing down the fiber, and the two fibers are in contact,
4806560	4814560	then light traveling down the blue fiber here will wind up in the black fiber. So no light
4814560	4821280	is going in at this end in the black fiber. Light is going into the blue fiber at this end.
4822800	4827920	But because they're near each other, most of the light is coming out of the blue fiber,
4827920	4834000	but some light has leaked into the black fiber and is coming out. That's just
4834720	4843680	straightforward optics. What I can do is consider an equilibrium situation. Remember,
4843680	4849680	we had an equilibrium situation with gain and loss. So imagine we have these two fibers.
4851360	4862160	Let us remove light from the black fiber. So how do you remove light? How do you absorb it?
4862160	4870720	Well, one way is to plate the fiber, to cover the fiber with metal. So you just put a little chromium
4872400	4877680	on the fiber and the light energy will be sucked into the chromium and the light will disappear.
4879600	4888880	Okay. How do you put light into a fiber? Well, you shine a laser on it and that introduces
4888880	4898560	light into the fiber as it's flowing. So not at the where the fiber begins or where it ends,
4898560	4906240	but you just shine a laser light, say midway down the fiber and that will induce light to flow
4906240	4911520	down the fiber. So these are the two pales of water with loss and gain.
4911520	4920160	Okay. And a pipe between them is simply that the fibers are touching each other.
4922640	4934080	Okay. And there's light leaking from this fiber into this. So this system is PT symmetric because
4934080	4941600	light flowing in and light flowing out, if we reverse time, it looks like this.
4942800	4949280	But if we reverse space, it looks like this. So you recover the original situation.
4949600	4965600	Okay. So that's an example. That was the very first experiment verifying the mathematics behind a
4965600	4973520	PT symmetric system. And since then, there have been countless numbers of experiments, many,
4973520	4983440	many, many experiments, mechanical experiments, electrical experiments. And these systems
4984480	4992880	have remarkable properties. They're new. They're very interesting. I mean, now there are something
4992880	5005680	like they're approaching 10,000 papers have been written on systems with PT symmetry. Okay. The
5005680	5011760	citation, you know, I mean, we're talking about published papers. By the end of this year, there
5011760	5020880	will be it will exceed 10,000 papers at the rate that it's going. So lots of people are working on
5020880	5031680	this. This is a very busy active field. Can I ask what makes a good quest? What makes a good question
5031680	5040720	physics to study to work on? Let me tell you about me and my life at my university. So I love solving
5040720	5048560	problems. As you might guess, I love mathematics, I love solving problems. And there is an exam called
5048560	5060000	the Putnam exam, which is taken by college students. These are the Putnam exam is a six hour
5060880	5071920	mathematics contest. Okay, at the top, top, top mathematical, mathematically inclined
5071920	5079360	college students often take this exam every year. Several thousand students take the exam.
5080320	5088320	Okay, and the exam is six hours long. And there are 12 problems on the exam.
5090080	5096640	So you, in fact, the exam is three hours long in the morning, a two hour break for lunch and then
5096640	5102480	three more hours. So you have to solve six problems in the morning and six problems in the afternoon,
5103120	5111040	if you want a perfect score. Essentially, nobody gets a perfect score. Okay, solving one problem
5111680	5117680	means that you're pretty much in the upper quarter of the people taking the exam. It's a very, very
5117680	5124960	hard exam. And if you solve two problems, you are doing spectacularly well. I mean, it means that
5124960	5132800	you're very, very talented. So it's rare, but the, you know, the top person in the country,
5133600	5139520	there's there are big cash prizes and scholarships and so on. But the top person in the country
5140880	5148240	may solve typically nine problems, maybe even 10. In the past, it has happened
5149200	5156320	that someone has solved all 12. But basically, it's virtually hopeless to be able to do that.
5156960	5162640	Okay, so they give you a feeling. Okay, so I love solving problems. And when I began
5164240	5176720	my teaching here at Washington University, I noticed that nobody was coaching kids to prepare
5176800	5184240	for the Putnam exam. And I announced that I was the coach. I just said, I'm going to teach,
5185520	5191280	I'm going to have practice sessions to prepare you to take the Putnam exam. And lots of kids
5192240	5197200	were interested in mathematics, and they attended the practice sessions, and we learned how to solve
5197200	5204800	problems. Okay, which is an important aspect of being a physicist, you have to the theoretical
5204800	5213600	physicists, you have to learn how to solve problems. And this was very effective, because
5214960	5222160	that year, out of the hundreds of schools, who they're there's something like 400 and
5224320	5233200	over 400 schools, 425 schools, something like that, colleges, participated in the exam. Washington
5233200	5240800	University came out second. I mean, it helps to learn how to solve problems, hard problems,
5241520	5252560	really, really hard problems. And the year after, in fact, we came in first in the country,
5253440	5264240	top team in the country. Okay, and we were virtually always in the top 10. And it's because
5264240	5270160	the students are bright, but also the students learned how to solve problems in these practice
5270160	5276720	sessions, which is really good. Okay, and they really, it was wonderful, they did very well.
5277200	5283920	You would think that when they went on to become, if they became theoretical physicists, you might
5283920	5294400	think that these kids all became professors of physics, but they didn't. And that's because
5294400	5302800	there's another aspect of science, which they were not prepared for. And that is that in physics,
5303520	5313040	not all problems can be solved. But on the Putnam exam, every problem can be solved. That is,
5313920	5320640	it may be very hard, but you know, before you even see the problem, that there is a solution.
5321200	5330480	And that typically is beautiful. Okay, you know, you can do it. And that gives you a leg up.
5331200	5339600	Because knowing that there is a solution is the first step in being able to solve a problem.
5339600	5346960	I mean, it's what generates your, it's what brings up your intuition. It gets you into the right frame
5346960	5357840	of mind. The problem with physics is that not all problems can be solved. And if you're going to
5357840	5367120	be a successful physicist, you have to know how to pick a problem. So some of the top kids
5367680	5377360	in the Putnam exam never go on to a career, a scientific or a mathematical career, because
5377360	5383520	they don't have an intuitive feeling of how to pick a problem that you can solve.
5384080	5392640	It's not just solving the problem is that you have to find the problem. Okay, so there are
5392640	5398880	there are two ingredients to being a successful physicist or a mathematician. You have to pick
5398880	5407200	a problem that is hard enough to be deep and interesting. You know, you don't say, I'm going
5407200	5412560	to publish your paper on how much one and what is that stupid, right? So you have to pick a problem
5413520	5421920	which is deep and subtle, but still within the realm of possibility of being solved.
5422880	5431280	And finding a problem is a rare, a very rare ability finding an appropriate problem
5432800	5437760	to make that is it's a big enough advance in physics to be significant,
5438480	5446080	but a small enough advance that you can solve it. Because I can add, I mean, I can pose for you
5448240	5455920	a very hard problem in physics, but I have no idea how to solve it. So I wouldn't attempt to solve it.
5456960	5461440	Okay, there are lots of these problems. Okay, I mean, for example,
5462320	5470160	the nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons, but they have different masses.
5472880	5479360	How do you calculate the difference in the mass of a proton and a neutron? And why is the mass
5479360	5489520	different? And can you quantitatively calculate that amount of mass difference? They don't weigh
5489520	5496960	the same amount. Okay, that's a very, very hard problem. And at this point in my life,
5496960	5502640	I wouldn't try to solve that problem, because I don't know how to begin. And I could waste a lot of
5502640	5512320	time trying to solve something that I'm not equipped to solve. Okay, so I've learned, so
5513040	5520560	the most brilliant problem solvers don't necessarily become effective physicists,
5520560	5528000	effective physicists, or scientists in general, know how to pick a problem that they can solve,
5528000	5535680	but will still be significant. That's a very hard thing to teach. I don't know how to teach that.
5536240	5543600	It's something that you have to have a tremendous amount of experience,
5545040	5552240	but it's not something you can teach as a rote piece of information in a lecture. This is
5552240	5558720	how you behave as a physicist. Okay. It's a little bit of a shame that there's no pathway to couple
5559760	5564000	those students that are really good at solving problems with those students that are really
5564080	5575760	good at picking problems. In fact, that does happen. There are sometimes groups of, I mean,
5575760	5582000	this is why physicists are very sociable. I mean, they don't work alone. And they talk. This is the
5582000	5586880	reason why physicists talk with experiment, you know, theoretical physicists talk with
5586880	5593920	experimentalists. This is why we have seminars and colloquia, so we can learn about problems
5593920	5601120	that are interesting and important. And then if we're a good problem solver, we might focus on
5602720	5608640	maybe not the whole problem, but an aspect of the problem. For example, although I don't know
5609200	5615760	how to solve the question I just asked about a proton and a neutron, I can make a model
5617040	5625040	okay. So instead of taking a proton and a neutron in our four dimensional space,
5625040	5631360	what about a proton and a neutron in one dimensional space? That's a much simpler question.
5631360	5639600	And I can solve that problem. Okay, so I can simplify the problem by making a model
5640480	5646800	and develop, learn about aspects of the problem without
5648480	5652960	doing a complete solution. I mean, if you solve that problem, you're going to win a Nobel Prize,
5652960	5657600	right? In general, if you solve a really, really hard problem, that's very rare,
5658160	5664480	but you still have to earn money, you know, so you pick a problem that's not so hard,
5665440	5666720	but it's still interesting.
5668960	5674720	There's a famous saying from Feynman. He said a lot of things, but one of the things he said,
5675920	5681600	every physicist has heard this shut up and calculate mantra, right? Can you say,
5682480	5686880	what are your thoughts then on that way of thinking?
5687600	5699760	Well, let me tell you about Feynman. So to begin with, Feynman, so my uncle was a high school
5699760	5711040	teacher, a high school physics teacher, in fact, and he was Feynman's high school physics teacher.
5712000	5718080	Feynman in high school was very, very smart, and my uncle just put him in the back room and said,
5718080	5727920	here's a book, read this, but you don't need to sit in my class. Okay, so I had a lot of interaction
5727920	5741200	with Feynman and also his sister, who's very smart, and so I and two colleagues worked on
5741840	5748960	some papers over the summer at Caltech where Feynman was, and we used to eat lunch with Feynman.
5748960	5754000	He happened to be around that summer and we ate lunch and we, and he would always say,
5754000	5760800	so how's it going? In fact, he didn't say that. He would say, how's it going?
5764000	5773040	Okay, and the three of us would say, well, we showed this and this, and we were able to
5773040	5782160	calculate this and we established this. And he would say, very good, very good.
5785680	5796480	And then he would say, BS, except he would say that word right away. And he would say, no,
5796480	5804800	you're wrong because of this and this and this and this is inconsistent and it's not correct.
5807760	5813600	And we would be stunned because Feynman was very, very smart and very, very fast. In fact,
5813600	5825840	he's the fastest guy I've ever known. And the three of us didn't have an answer. I mean,
5825920	5832400	he had picked apart our calculation because he looked at it not in a technical way,
5832400	5837280	but he looked at it from above and he brought to bear some basic physical
5840400	5850400	theorems and questioned our assumptions and so on and found what was apparent. He found apparent
5850400	5859840	violations of sensible physical outcome. And we would go back to the office and work together
5859840	5865440	with the three of us all afternoon arguing with each other about what to do and why this happened
5865440	5873520	and what was the violation due to. And much more often than not, we found that there was a flaw.
5874480	5880640	There was an assumption that Feynman had made in his argument that we couldn't catch
5882320	5888400	on the fly sitting and sitting around a cafeteria table. We couldn't do that. But
5889440	5899840	we saw through it and we would include this take account, this fact. And we got it to work again.
5900080	5907840	And the next day at lunch, Feynman would say, so how's it going? And we would say, well,
5909360	5916960	you assumed that this and this were true, but they aren't because we made this delicate assumption
5917840	5924000	at the beginning, which forbids this possibility from occurring. And so there is no contradiction.
5924960	5933520	And he would say, oh, very good, very good. And he was never, by the way, he was wonderful
5933520	5946240	because it was never a destructive criticism. He didn't benefit by putting us down. He was
5946240	5953600	only interested in physics being done right and things being done logically and correctly.
5954080	5960800	And if he saw that it was working, he would say very, very good. But very often it would turn out
5960800	5969040	that he would say, ah, but you're wrong because of this. And once again, we'd have to go back to
5969040	5974000	the office to repeat the process over and over and over. You can imagine by the end of the summer,
5975040	5982320	boy, did we have a fantastic piece of work. We published four papers at the end of the summer
5983280	5989120	on our research effort. And that was wonderful. That was an incredible experience,
5989680	5998480	okay, because physics is a very social endeavor. It's not sitting in your room alone. It's
5998480	6005760	interacting with people and bouncing ideas off each other. And it's because physics is not
6005920	6014640	entirely rigorous. It's based on certain assumptions. The mathematics can be a little bit vague.
6016960	6026480	And making precise statements is very difficult. So physics is interesting because of that, right?
6026480	6035600	It's not, it's not like a dry axiomatic mathematical system. So it's very mathematical
6035600	6042560	and you have to be very careful. So I would say this is sort of care, great care, but not necessarily
6042560	6051120	rigor. Okay, and physics has something that mathematics doesn't. Because after you come
6051120	6055920	up with a finished product, you can test it in the laboratory and see if you're right.
6057440	6065280	Okay, and mathematics is mathematics. It's either rigorously right. That is, it's in agreement with
6065280	6073440	your axioms or it conflicts with an axiom. So physics is very similar, but it isn't rigorous.
6074800	6080480	Okay, and in physics, you can make approximations. So long as they don't destroy,
6080480	6091280	they're not in conflict with your assumptions. Okay, so this is a distinct field. You know,
6092000	6096480	it's an interaction between what you see in the laboratory and what you do on paper.
6098000	6103360	Okay, mathematics doesn't have a laboratory. You are the writer wall.
6104160	6111440	So in some sense, you can, you can run much faster by dropping rigor,
6112560	6115200	because at the end of the day, you can do the experiment.
6115920	6121120	Yes, you can, I don't know if you say run faster because there are times when you're really
6122000	6139520	slogging along at a slow pace. But yes, you can, if you drop rigor, it is true
6140240	6147840	that you can get lots of results that appear to be correct, but have to be verified.
6148560	6155600	And some of them will in the end not be valid. And that's because your experimental test
6156640	6160000	is violated. And it, your conclusion is not correct.
6161600	6165120	That's just not jumping off the cliff and building the bridge underneath yourself as you go,
6165760	6174720	in some sense. Yeah, it's, it's, it may be that you're, that one of your axioms is seriously an error.
6175200	6183680	Um, so as far as PT symmetry, it may be that the assumption of PT symmetry, which is more general,
6185520	6192080	is that there may be something flawed about it. Of course, that's not going to happen because
6192080	6198800	there are already many PT symmetric systems that have been studied and the predictions are correct.
6198880	6207680	But it could be that down the road, we will make wrong assumptions about how the world is
6207680	6214080	supposed to behave and it doesn't behave that way. So far, things are going very well, however, which
6214080	6226880	is nice. So let me just ask in brief detail then, we've already discussed the role of rigor in physics.
6227520	6232560	What role does beauty play or what role should it play in solving a problem?
6235200	6240080	Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Different people
6242080	6247040	see beauty in different, I mean, you may see something as being beautiful when I don't think
6247040	6258480	it's beautiful at all. Um, beautiful, I think for me means that it's a result that it's deep
6259600	6270080	and unexpected and surprising. Okay. And beautiful also means that there is an extremely clever and
6270080	6286000	unexpected argument for producing that result. Would you like an example of something beautiful
6286000	6293200	and unexpected? I think this is actually quite important because for non-mathematicians and
6293200	6300720	people who aren't doing mathematics regularly, I imagine it's quite difficult to understand
6300720	6305360	what physicists and mathematicians mean when they say that a set of equations is beautiful or that
6305360	6311840	some system is beautiful or that, you know, you have these situations where you're solving something
6311840	6317600	and it just sort of leaps out at you. I'd like to somehow give that feeling to listeners.
6318400	6332080	Right. So I could give you, I could give you an example of a problem with a, what I would regard
6332880	6340640	as a beautiful result, a beautiful answer. I could even give you a simple problem,
6341600	6351920	I mean, sorry, not a simple problem, but a simple sounding problem, which I would say is beautiful.
6353440	6358880	Okay. I don't know which, maybe I should do both because they're very different, but
6360720	6369040	here's an example of a problem from the Putnam exam, which we talked about before.
6369760	6375760	Okay. It's a very, very hard problem and it's a yes or no problem.
6378800	6385360	Okay. So you have a plane. Okay. And there are an infinite number of points in the plane.
6386800	6392880	And the question is, can you color all of the points in the plane
6392880	6402880	assign a color to each point in the plane, assign one of three colors to each of the points in the
6402880	6410400	plane. So you could color this point red and this point green and this point blue. And so
6410400	6416880	you walk around in this infinite plane and you assign a color to each point in the plane,
6416880	6425520	red or green or blue. Okay. And the question is, I mean, you can do that. You're going to
6425520	6434000	assign, you know, if you have a point at this location, it's blue. The question is, can this
6434640	6442240	be done in such a way that if two points are one inch apart, they do not have the same color?
6442400	6453040	So the criterion, do you understand? So the criterion, this is, there's also like a
6453040	6458560	cartography related question like this, right? Yes, it's a little bit, it's a cut down version
6458560	6465440	of the four color theorem, if you like. But this is, if you can call it the three color theorem.
6465440	6470960	So if, if two points are one inch apart, they may not have the same color,
6471840	6474160	they, but they could have different colors, of course,
6475600	6481680	can you assign a color to every point in the plane such that this is true? This is a very,
6481680	6489440	very hard problem. But the solution is what I would call beautiful, because it's so simple.
6490720	6494640	But you have to see your way through the solution and I can give it to you if you like.
6495520	6499840	Sure, please. Okay, I'll get a piece of paper.
6506320	6506640	So,
6515040	6516800	so here are three points,
6516960	6529360	and they are all one inch apart. So this is one, and one, and one. Okay. Now,
6530400	6536320	they're, this is an equilateral triangle here, they're one inch apart. So they must all have
6536320	6547600	different colors. Okay, so if this point, for example, is red, this must be blue or green.
6548480	6556400	So, so for example, if this point is red, then this point would have to be different from red,
6556400	6564160	so it might be blue, and this might be green. Or this might, these two guys at the bottom
6564160	6576720	could be switched, but they can't be red. Okay, so we already now know the answer to the problem.
6580320	6589520	So the question is why? Okay, so what I'm going to do is draw another equilateral triangle back to back.
6590400	6603360	Okay, so if this point is red, these two points must be blue and green,
6604400	6608880	but since these two points are blue and green, this point must be red again.
6609920	6616560	Right? So now we know that if two points are the square root of two inches apart,
6617520	6624160	they're the same color. Right. So therefore, and it doesn't matter,
6624160	6630640	square root of two, square root of three, who cares? But we can clearly see that this
6630640	6637440	distance is bigger than one. It's one point something. Who cares? It doesn't matter.
6638000	6644640	So we'll just say that this distance is D. There are D inches from here to here,
6644640	6651360	and those two points have to be the same color. And the point is that D is bigger than one,
6651360	6660080	and you can just see that from the picture. So therefore, all I need to do is to take a point
6660080	6668400	in the plane, which is red, and draw a circle about that point of radius D.
6669120	6679280	So there's a circle of radius D, and every single point on this circle
6680720	6688000	is D distance away from this red point over here. And therefore, every single point on this circle
6689920	6697760	on this entire circle is red. So therefore, I will simply draw an arc
6699360	6705200	a chord, I don't need an arc, a chord in the circle that is one inch long.
6708080	6714160	And these two points are both red, but there's a one inch separation between them.
6716560	6722080	That's not possible. So the assumption is not possible that you can't do it.
6723040	6731920	And that's the proof. And that proof, in my opinion, is beautiful because it is so elegant.
6731920	6741840	It's so clever. And that's an example of something that I regard as beautiful. It was the
6742800	6750560	it was the elegance of the argument that I gave to prove bid. The simplicity,
6752080	6763200	the argument made, didn't make use of any other extraneous clever things about mathematics. It was
6763200	6770960	simply cold logic that led to the answer. It was sharply directed toward getting the answer.
6770960	6777200	And I didn't say anything irrelevant. A high school student could have come up with it if
6777200	6782960	they were bright. Of course, of course, of course. In this case, what was what made it beautiful
6784560	6793680	was the technique of proving it. The actual answer is not so interesting. I mean, do you really care
6793760	6801440	whether or not the answer is yes or no? So here the beauty lies in the proof,
6803040	6808240	much more in the proof than in the answer, because, you know, saying, okay, so you can't do it. So who
6808240	6813520	cared? I mean, that I wouldn't say that's beautiful, but the proof is beautiful. But let me give you
6813520	6828880	an example where where the answer is beautiful. Okay, where the proof is more elaborate.
6830160	6841200	But the answer is astonishing and surprising and incredible. Okay, so here's here's a favorite
6841200	6852240	problem of mine. It's a game. It's just a very simple game with incredibly simple rules. Okay.
6853840	6865040	And the game the rules of the game are this. You have an opponent who and you're not actually
6865440	6873760	fighting your opponent, the opponent is just your, your, your double who's setting up a problem for
6873760	6884160	you. That's all. So what what this guy does is he takes a bunch of slipped pieces of little pieces
6884160	6890720	of paper. And on each piece of paper, he writes a different number down real number.
6891280	6896320	Okay, for simplicity, we can assume all the numbers are positive, but it doesn't matter,
6896320	6903200	they could be positive and negative. I don't care, but they're all different. Okay, and there are many
6903200	6912320	pieces of paper. Okay, and he writes a number on each piece of paper and he puts it in a box.
6912320	6920960	And the game is that you have to figure out what the biggest number is.
6924160	6929680	You have to find the biggest number. Okay, now this, this is, this is how these are the rules.
6929680	6938960	They're very simple. You pick the piece of paper out of the box. Okay. And you open it up and you
6939040	6949680	read the number. And now you have two possibilities. You can say, I think this is the biggest number.
6951760	6957120	And if you're right, you win. And if you're wrong, you lose the game.
6957120	6971120	Okay. Okay. However, if you're right, if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number.
6973040	6977360	And if again, you're wrong because it was the biggest number, you lose the game right away.
6978560	6982080	If you say anything wrong, you lose the game. You don't get a second chance.
6982320	6989680	But if you say, I don't think this is the biggest number, that's a correct statement.
6990480	6995360	So you're allowed to proceed. So then you pick another piece of paper out of the box.
6996000	7002960	Okay, another piece of paper, you look at it and you once again, you say,
7004960	7009920	now I think this is the biggest number. If you write, you win. If you're wrong, you lose.
7010560	7015520	But if you say, I still don't think this is the biggest number, then you can play again.
7016640	7021200	If you're right, if it was the biggest number, you lose. Okay. Now the question,
7021200	7025200	do you understand the rules? It's very simple. So the question is,
7028640	7031840	what if there were 100 pieces of paper in the box?
7034400	7037680	What do you think your chances are of winning this game?
7040080	7045040	So you would look at a bunch of pieces of paper and eventually you would get more and more nervous.
7045920	7052080	And eventually you would say, well, I think maybe this is finally the biggest piece of paper and you
7053120	7058640	guess. So what do you think the chances are of winning the game?
7061280	7063120	Well, of course, it depends on your strategy.
7063680	7073920	Well, that's right. You're right. There is a strategy. And the question is, what is the strategy?
7076080	7083760	And the numbers don't have to be regular. They're not like in order. One, two, three,
7083760	7092800	four, five. One number is 1.6 and the other one is pi. The other one is 3,048 million and so on.
7093120	7098880	So there's no regularity in these numbers. I would say that if I was going to give a solution
7098880	7104080	without thinking too much about it, I would say this probably, you probably want to
7104880	7112000	turn over a certain number of cards to a certain point and then the next biggest one that you find,
7112000	7116560	it'll be something like this. But I don't know where that point would be though.
7117200	7122800	Okay. So that's absolutely correct. You're absolutely right. There is a strategy.
7123440	7132240	It's so simple. I mean, it's almost trivial. Of course, we use this process all the time.
7132240	7134320	How do you find the person that you're going to marry?
7137120	7143920	Okay. You date somebody. You say, nah, you date another person. You say, nah,
7144720	7150160	you date another person. Nah, eventually you come to a person who's better than all the previous
7150160	7158240	people and you say, this is the one for me. Now, it's the best I'll do. Well, you could be wrong
7158960	7165920	because if you intended to date a hundred people, you might have picked a person who was like
7166880	7174880	number 10 in the list and you didn't get the best person. So the question is, if you were going to
7174880	7183520	date a hundred people, how many people should you date before you decide to take the next
7183520	7191040	better one that comes along? And what's your chance of, in the end, the question really is,
7191040	7198800	what is the chance of winning the game? So would you give me one out of three odds that I can find
7198800	7214480	the best person in a hundred? Probably not, but I imagine I'm going to be proven wrong.
7215440	7220960	Well, okay, let's make it a harder game. What if there were a million
7222000	7229040	numbers in the box? You're going to date one million people before you decide. What's your
7229040	7239840	chance of finding the best one in that one million? Would you say that, would you give me
7240320	7247760	one in a thousand that I might get the best person in a million? Or would you say I have a
7248640	7254800	better or worse chance? I mean, that's the question. Yeah, so let's say we start with one box,
7255440	7263120	one piece of paper in the first problem. Right, so it does depend on the number of
7263440	7271680	pieces of paper to a certain extent, right? It does. To an extent, it does.
7272880	7276080	But I don't think I'm going to be able to work this out on camera.
7277120	7293040	No, don't even try. What is amazing is that this is a way of defining a transcendental
7293280	7307120	number. Okay, so a very, very famous transcendental number is E. Okay, E numerically is
7309600	7317360	a little bit smaller than three. It's 2.718281828. Something, something, it goes on.
7318160	7339840	So it's roughly 2.7. Okay, so one over 2.7 is about 37.37. Okay, so now I'm going to tell you
7339840	7350240	the strategy for winning the game. You should date 30% of all of the girls that you intend to date
7352080	7363360	or boys, whatever you, okay, and don't choose any of them. The next bigger one that comes along
7363360	7373280	is what you pick. So to optimize your strategy, you should look at 37% of all of the numbers.
7375040	7384480	And your chance of then winning the game will be 37% again.
7385440	7393440	But shouldn't it be the percentage of no, no, it's not. And that's,
7395360	7400000	I mean, this is a mathematical calculation that I can show you. It's pretty easy,
7400000	7407840	but it involves Taylor series. But the point here is it doesn't matter how many numbers there are,
7407840	7418080	there can be a billion numbers. But what you do is you look, your strategy is to look at 37%
7419360	7427920	of a billion, which is 370 million. So you look at the first 370 million numbers
7429120	7435600	and you say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not the biggest number. No, no, no. And you keep
7435600	7442720	saying that 370 million times. Now, of course, you could be wrong, in which case you'll lose the game.
7444800	7453120	Okay. But you may be right. And then your objective is to take the next bigger number
7454160	7460800	that comes along. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, it could be, of course, that the next bigger number
7460800	7466320	that comes along is not the biggest number, in which case, once again, you'll lose the game.
7467120	7474400	But the chance of you winning the game is also 37%. So it's better than one out of three.
7476720	7483920	And if you don't believe me, you can try it at home. Take 27 numbers, different numbers,
7484000	7492960	have your friend write it on 27 different pieces of paper, pick the first 10, say no,
7492960	7500480	no, no, no, no, 10 times, and take the next bigger one that comes along. And you could make a,
7502480	7508480	if you do this over and over and over again, you'll see that your history, your probability of
7508480	7523520	winning the game is 37%, which is extraordinary, right? So 37% of 27 is about 10. So you look at
7523520	7530960	10 numbers and then you take the next bigger one and better than one out of three times,
7530960	7538240	you will win the game with that strategy. Okay. And as far as anybody knows, that's the optimal
7538240	7542960	strategy. That's the best possible strategy you can use. So you want to always win,
7544000	7549040	but you'll win more than one out of three times. No matter how many numbers there are,
7549840	7557600	that is beautiful. And it's not beautiful. It's not the argument so much. This is different from
7557600	7568320	the other example I gave you. It's that the answer is beautiful because it's amazing,
7569200	7578160	because it's so counterintuitive. Who would have thought that who could possibly have imagined
7579360	7587040	that your chance of winning the game, it doesn't make any difference how many numbers there are.
7587600	7593120	Your chance of winning the game is better if there are many numbers, of course. So it is very,
7593120	7598160	very slightly, as you pointed out, dependent on the number of numbers because if there's only one,
7599200	7605520	the chance is 100%. But as you get more and more numbers, it drops down to
7607040	7616000	1 over E or 37%. So for anyone out there who is on the dating scene and they think they're going
7616000	7621680	to be dating from, say, 20 through to 40, those are the years they have available,
7621680	7630240	and they date, say, one person a year, then after eight years of being frivolous with their dates,
7630240	7636240	they should then settle down for the next best person. Pick the next person who's better than
7636240	7643280	everything they came before. The problem is, there may not be. It may be that you've passed
7643280	7652240	your optimal mate. That's entirely the chance of screwing this up or choosing too early.
7652240	7656640	That is, you might pick the next better one that comes along, but there's an even better one.
7659120	7666000	So let's finish on... That's a very powerful strategy, don't you think? That's beautiful.
7667760	7672560	As you said at the beginning, this is what people actually do to a certain extent.
7673840	7676960	They date around when they're young, and then at some point,
7677760	7681280	they do settle down when they're... I don't know what the average is,
7681280	7686080	average marriage age. It might be about 30. So it sounds about right, actually.
7686960	7694240	Right. But the divorce rate is roughly 50%.
7696320	7698480	So both numbers work out.
7699440	7705600	Yeah. I mean, they're pretty close, right? I mean, if you just say, this is the one for me.
7707760	7712400	Okay. Of course, that person may look at you and say, well, you're not the one for me.
7713760	7717280	But of course, you could have numbers that are very close together.
7717840	7721120	So the next best number might not be so bad.
7721120	7725840	Right. That's right. And that's the human
7728000	7733280	feature. I mean, there may be lots of people who in the end would be a perfect mate,
7733280	7743760	or not a perfect mate, but an excellent mate. And maybe we could define an excellent marriage
7743760	7749200	as one that doesn't end in divorce. Now, that may not be the right way to define a good marriage.
7749200	7757760	I mean, it may not be a happy one. But the chance of a happy marriage is not zero.
7757760	7762480	So you date a bunch of people and then you take the next better one that comes along.
7763920	7770800	That's the strategy that people basically tend to use. Sometimes they circle back to,
7771520	7776480	you have that option. In this game, you don't have the option of circling back.
7776560	7784800	Maybe the fact that the divorce rate is 50%, not 67% or something,
7786000	7790640	is the fact that people are allowed to circle back after they realize that they're screwing up
7792000	7796800	and they missed out. And sometimes you can fix the problem, right?
7797760	7806000	So let's end on, this is sort of a combined question.
7808480	7816400	But I'll put the combination of questions together. In 1900, Hilbert came up with his
7816400	7822000	famous Hilbert problems. There are these 23, some say 24 Hilbert problems, depending on how you
7822000	7833280	count. I would say just right away, this is a crucial turning point in the development of
7833280	7847200	mathematics. Because by doing this, what he essentially did was to split the field of mathematics
7847200	7856080	into two fields. What he said was that mathematics is beautiful, and that we solve problems in
7856080	7862000	mathematics not because they're going to be useful, but because they're just beautiful.
7862960	7869920	Okay. And there's a very elaborate way of defining beauty, as we know.
7873440	7884720	But he said mathematics certainly doesn't have to be useful. So if you want to know
7884720	7892400	how many six-dimensional balls, what is the optimal number, the maximum number of
7892400	7897280	six-dimensional spheres that will fit into a six-dimensional box?
7899280	7909200	You might say, who cares? And furthermore, even if I knew the answer, I couldn't test it in the
7909200	7918720	laboratory. Okay, that's how a physicist would respond. But more importantly, it wasn't important
7919600	7926320	if mathematics could be used by other branches of science. So that mathematics community, two
7926320	7934000	thirds of that community, followed Hilbert and said it doesn't have to be useful. It doesn't have to be
7934640	7940320	applicable. Roughly one third, or at least that's what the count is today,
7942000	7952320	have stayed in the, with the point of view that it has to be useful. It has to be relevant,
7953120	7960240	meaning it can be built on and eventually have a connection with reality, because we do know
7960800	7968160	that the physical world obeys mathematics. It really does, really seems to.
7970080	7975040	So these mathematicians are now called applied mathematicians,
7977040	7983680	and Hilbert's mathematicians became pure mathematicians, and mathematicians didn't have that
7983680	7994000	distinction. It was just mathematics. Okay, I am definitely of the one third variety.
7996480	8008560	And so to me, mathematics is a tool, and it is a lot of fun, and it's beautiful.
8009520	8018320	But ultimately, it should be useful. So for example,
8020240	8030240	a lot, my, one of my expertise, you know, in mathematics is the idea that, that although
8030800	8038560	almost all equations are impossible to solve, you have to learn what the answer is like.
8039440	8044320	What are the properties of the answer, even if you can't solve the problem exactly. So you have
8044320	8052960	to learn how to do approximate mathematics. And approximate mathematics, again, is something
8052960	8060880	that requires great care, but not rigor. And that's what I do. Okay, and that's the kind of
8060880	8067040	mathematics that's relevant in physics, because if you are, if you encounter a new physics problem,
8067760	8073040	you can't solve it. There's no chance that you're going to find the answer to a physics problem.
8073040	8077440	I mean, essentially, all of the problems that you can solve exactly have been solved.
8077760	8086800	And they all involve systems that are too simple to be realistic. Okay, so life is complicated.
8087440	8092960	You know, how do you predict the weather? Well, you can't predict the weather exactly.
8093520	8100000	But the question is, what is the best approximation that you can make? And probably there's an
8100000	8108080	upper bound. You can't, you can't give better, maybe then a 80% accurate approximation, if you
8108080	8115680	want the weather two days from now. But how do you get the optimal approximation? Okay, this is
8115680	8123600	applied mathematics. And that is my, that is what I love to do. I love to be able to solve a problem
8123680	8130320	approximately and understand what the answer is like, to a high degree of approximation
8130320	8136400	without solving the problem exactly. If you had to pick your Hilbert problems,
8138320	8146320	what would you choose? It's, I could make up problems, but they wouldn't really be
8147280	8153840	of interest to me. They just wouldn't. I mean, you know, an example.
8154480	8157360	Oh, I meant for physics. I meant the ones you're interested in.
8157360	8158320	Oh, in physics.
8158320	8159680	I mean, your Hilbert problems.
8159680	8165280	Oh, oh, oh, Hilbert problems in physics. I don't think there are any.
8165280	8170640	No, no, I mean your version. Like, so, so Hilbert gave his 23 that he thought that were the most
8171600	8178080	important for mathematics to him personally. I mean, if you had to pick, you had your pick,
8178080	8182880	and you're now going to influence the, you're going to split the field of physics, you're going to
8182880	8187920	influence the future of the field. You don't have to pick 23, but there might be one or two
8187920	8190800	that you think are particularly close to your heart.
8191360	8195200	Well, there's certainly a bunch of problems that I would love to see answered.
8195680	8203600	Um, uh, one of them has to do with the acceleration and the expansion of the universe.
8204720	8213040	The reason that I think this is such an interesting problem is that it may be an example of a problem
8213040	8227440	where, uh, where PT symmetry comes into play. Okay. Um, and the point is that, um,
8231920	8238160	you know, this goes under the, under the heading of alternative theories of gravity.
8239120	8241840	Okay. Because we know that gravity is attractive.
8244160	8247840	Okay. But the universe is expanding and accelerating.
8249200	8253040	So isn't gravity pulling back on it and stopping it from accelerating?
8254160	8262560	And the answer is that, um, not the answer. Sorry. Be very careful. Not the answer, but a possible
8262560	8270240	answer is that, you know, in electrodynamics, a positive and a negative charge attract.
8271600	8278160	And they attract just as if there were, they were attracting gravitationally. They both have a one
8278160	8288480	over R, uh, force. Okay. Or one over, I should say one over R potential. Okay. One over R squared
8289440	8298160	Newtonian force. Okay. And a positive and negative charge attract. But you can make
8298880	8312000	a PT symmetric theoretical model of electrodynamics. Okay. Where the electric charge is not a real
8312080	8319920	number, but it's an imaginary number. Okay. But everything else is the same.
8322320	8329520	And now you can ask, what happens? Well, what you find is that a positive and negative charge repel.
8329760	8345440	Okay. So one interesting possibility is that gravity at short distances, where short means on
8345440	8359760	the scale of a galaxy at short distances, way out on a galactic scales, galaxy gravity is attractive.
8360960	8369360	But on the scale of the universe, on very large scales, gravity is repulsive. So you can imagine
8369360	8379200	a theory of gravity, which is where two masses attract. And all you need to do is to look at
8379200	8388400	this theory in the complex plane. And now two masses repel. And if we have a bridge over
8390320	8396640	distances shorter than some characteristic distance, gravity is attractive, but larger than
8396640	8404560	this characteristic distance, it's repulsive, then we can understand something about the structure
8404560	8412240	of the universe. And I think this is an example of a very hard, but very interesting problem.
8413920	8420640	And so the idea is that PT symmetry is then broken at short distance scales and then not
8420640	8424080	at long scales or right out. Okay.
8426880	8433440	That's exactly right. So if you imagine that you begin with a universe that is PT symmetric,
8434240	8442560	but it has a broken PT symmetry, that is, it has the symmetry, but it's not, it's like the water
8442880	8449680	pales that are not connected with a pipe. Okay, it's PT symmetric, but it's still not an equilibrium
8449680	8456800	because one pot is filling up and the other one is emptying out. So that has broken PT symmetry.
8459040	8464960	But if you connect it with a pipe, it's unbroken PT symmetry. So therefore,
8465600	8475920	you imagine the universe at great distances being somehow connected by a pipe, sort of.
8477360	8490160	Okay. Well, we can imagine it being broken or unbroken, but the point here is that
8490160	8497360	depending on the separation, it either is repulsive or it's attractive and there is
8497360	8507600	some change over distance. That's the idea. So that's, I mean, that would be an example of a
8509360	8516080	beautiful, wonderful problem. If you could solve it, of course, it seems to me you would deserve
8517040	8524880	a Nobel Prize and that's a very, that would be a beautiful
8528720	8536720	application of the ideas of PT symmetry. Okay. And use of the complex world to understand what
8536720	8545920	is going on. This is work with Philip Mannheim, is it? Philip and I have done some work with
8546080	8551200	of course, with that objective in mind, Philip is very smart, and he's very knowledgeable about
8551840	8558800	ATG's, alternative theories of gravity. He's worked on conformal gravity and so on. In fact,
8558800	8568880	I'm in discussion with a guy in London where I'm going in a few days, whose name is, he's actually
8568880	8577520	in Greece, but he's coming to London, a guy named Marvo Matos, who is very knowledgeable about
