Processing Overview for Zhang Jian
============================
Checking Zhang Jian/Keynote  The Value of Values - Rich Hickey.txt
1. **The Space Age in Programming**: We are now in the space age of programming, where "space" refers to unlimited resources and capabilities, akin to the vastness of space itself. This contrasts with the concept of "place," which is limited and fixed.

2. **Virtual Memory vs. GC**: The evolution from virtual memory to garbage collection has provided programmers with more abstracted and limitless access to resources, similar to how we think of space rather than a specific place.

3. **Programming with Space**: Modern systems like S3 (Simple Storage Service) allow for indefinite growth without failing, indicating that we are already moving towards a space-oriented approach in practice, even if our programming paradigms have not fully caught up.

4. **Garbage Collection in Storage**: As we extend the concept of "space" to storage, garbage collection principles will apply, managing different characteristics and reducing waste.

5. **Place-Oriented Programming**: Current programming languages and databases often still use a place-oriented approach, which was practical when computers were less powerful but is now outdated given our current capabilities.

6. **The Value Proposition**: There is a clear value proposition for space-oriented information systems that handle facts and information rather than transactions or logs confined to specific places.

7. **Big Data Demand**: The big data movement is indicative of businesses demanding comprehensive knowledge of all that has happened, rather than relying on limited logs or indexes. They want systems that maintain a complete picture of the facts, which are crucial for informed decision-making.

8. **Call to Action**: The speaker encourages developers and database designers to move beyond place-oriented programming to space-oriented systems that are more in line with the capabilities of modern computing resources. This shift would align with the demands of businesses and the realities of big data.

1. **Performance and Stability**: The Rappel framework has been performing well for one team, providing good performance and thread safety, which allows the team to focus on solving problems without worrying about concurrency issues.

2. **Immutable Data**: Immutability in closure has helped with thread safety, reducing concerns about heavy concurrency, objects, and thread safety in objects.

3. **Component Size**: Smaller components are being created due to closure's functional programming capabilities, which have led to increased flexibility and the ability to make significant changes by swapping out functions or passing in a map of functions.

4. **Training and Adoption**: The team is investing in training more members, with some already taking courses like CASCALOG for data analysis tasks.

5. **Hiring**: The company is hiring, indicating growth and an interest in expanding the team.

6. **closure-contrib**: There's a need for community engagement to maintain and update less actively maintained projects within closure-contrib. Contributors are encouraged to step forward and volunteer as maintainers for projects they rely on.

7. **Benchmarking**: Comparing performance across different types of applications (like dating platforms vs. Web Apps) can be challenging due to the unique nature of each application. It's important to find common tasks or to create like-for-like comparisons when benchmarking.

8. **JIRA and Contributors Agreement**: Some feel that the infrastructure and processes (like JIRA and the contributors agreement) in place for contributing to closure might be obstacles, but there's a call for community involvement to maintain projects within closure-contrib.

9. **Flexibility and Scalability**: The functional programming aspects of closure have proven beneficial for creating flexible and scalable codebases, with the potential to handle big data analysis through libraries like CASCALOG.

10. **Continued Engagement**: The speaker is open to continued discussion on these topics and welcomes questions and feedback from the community.
