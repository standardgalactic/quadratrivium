0	6560	10 years ago or 15 years ago, very few people realized that they had a battle on their hands.
6560	12880	Largely the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these movements, but now everybody around the
12880	18080	world knows there's a battle, they know what the issues are and people are getting up to speed on
18080	25040	them very quickly. Today I'm joined by Professor Stephen Hicks and very grateful to him for taking
25040	31600	the time to answer some questions in the hope of answering exactly what it is that is happening in
31600	37360	schools and universities and other educational institutions around the world. I think what
37360	45520	happened to me where presenting ideas for debate was deemed to be gross misconduct and a sackable
45520	52400	offense is something that has been taking place a little bit more commonly in the US.
53120	58320	So I'm hoping Professor Hicks can provide some insights about that, but first could you just
58320	63840	tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered your passion for philosophy please?
65280	70400	I'm a Canadian by birth, born and raised. I didn't come to the US until starting graduate school.
71920	76960	And philosophy came to be a bit late in life. I was not really serious about becoming a
76960	82880	philosophy professor until well into my 20s. I actually thought I was going to become a
82880	89280	civil engineer and architect and go into the real estate business with my dad. But I always had been
90000	94560	a reader. My parents were both readers and I loved reading kind of all kinds of books,
94560	100560	whatever I came across, whatever was on my parents' shelves. And then a couple things happened when
100560	107760	I started university. I took a course from a very dynamic political science professor,
108320	114160	but he was very much engaged with the great thinkers, John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche
114160	121040	and Thomas Hobbes and so forth. And this was my first really systematic engagement with these
121040	126320	great minds and sort of things that in my semi-adolescent way I'd thought about, but nothing
126320	132880	systematically. So I was largely blown away by what I was reading and thinking about and the idea
132880	140400	that you can think about those issues in a fundamental way. And realizing that what I was
140400	144960	most interested, even though this was of course in the politics department, was the underlying
144960	151360	philosophical issues about knowledge, about human nature, about how we decide what the good life is
151360	157440	that we are perhaps organizing all of our society in terms of. So that was going on at the same time
157440	165360	independently of reading Locke and Nietzsche. And I was also reading Ein Rand and Ludwig von Mises
165360	172480	and Friedrich Hayek. So it was an awesome first year of university for me. Yeah, it sounds fantastic.
172480	177200	And was there any particular book or idea that really seized you that you can recall?
178000	186000	I think it was, this might sound boring, but more methodological, you know, the idea that you could
186000	194480	think all the way down on these issues. And in a partly in a structured way, saying there's,
194480	198320	if you take this as an assumption, well, you're, you're, you're depending on this, that depends
198320	204400	on this. But at the same time, that is being challenged by this position and this position.
204400	209200	So you need to consider all of them, make up your mind here. And then if you accept this one,
209200	215040	then this follows and that follows. So that was a, you know, I don't want to sound too hippie at
215040	220720	this point, but that was mind blowing expansion, this thing for me at that time. Yeah, I like the
220720	227040	way you frame that as being very much a conversation or dialogue between different voices. And what
227040	233440	was exciting about education is being given an opportunity to join that great conversation across
233520	239120	centuries and new, new vistas sort of opening up that you'd been dimly aware of,
239120	246240	but now you saw the extent of them. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And to my, my professor's credit,
246240	252560	his name was Fred Vaughn. By the end of this course, I had no idea what his particular
252560	260400	views on any of these, these issues were. So we talked about safe spaces. I had entirely the
260400	267440	sense that I could safely explore any view and voice any opinion and my essays for that course,
267440	274320	try out any ideas that I was, was working through. So that was wonderful. Interesting. I think that
274320	279600	sadly is what many people feel is being increasingly lost in the educational world now.
281920	288640	I know you take the view that ultimately all discussions about what education is and what
288640	295040	its aims are are fundamentally philosophical ones. Could you go into a bit more detail about that?
295040	302240	So why is it that philosophy underlies education? Yeah, well, I know when we are professional
302240	307280	teachers, for example, you know, we have our particular passion, our particular specialization,
307840	313520	and we want the students to come to be more knowledgeable and more skillful and hopefully
313520	319760	passionate about, about our area of expertise. But if you think about any of the expertises
319760	327120	that we want to make a place for in the curriculum, they're always put in the curriculum by reference
327120	333360	to some conception of what the product of education should be or what the goal of education should
333360	338400	be. So if we're going to put mathematics in the curriculum, it's because we say, well,
338960	344720	you're going to need this later in life, or if we're going to put the arts in the curriculum,
344720	351360	it's because we say, well, all your life, there's this great universe of artistic product for you
351360	357760	to explore, enrich your life, or maybe you will yourself become a, so we're always thinking longer
357760	364480	term about what the child will grow up to be as a full adult. But then when we start saying
365280	369680	that conception or thinking about that conception explicitly, what is it to be
369680	376240	a full human adult? And then immediately we have to become very philosophical, right? So
376800	381920	we're saying, you know, what, what capacities needs to be developed? What are our genuine,
381920	387600	mature needs? What things really are worth pursuing? And what things really are not that
387600	393760	important? And how is it all going to fit together so that by the time the child leaves
393760	399680	our educational institution, and we're saying, you know, you were on your own, go out and live
399680	404800	your life, we have some conception of what kind of a life we are we're preparing that for. So,
405360	411520	you know, if you think about all of the great battles we have in education, sometimes it's
411520	416720	a matter of turf war, you know, are we going to put this in the curriculum or not? And oftentimes
416720	422000	that means to make room, we have to take something out in order to put something else in, we have
422080	427840	to make a value judgment about what really is going to serve the student well in the long term.
427840	434720	So, you know, in business courses at the high school level, there's, you know, teaching about
434720	439360	bookkeeping and finance and marketing and management and so on. Well, should we add a
439360	445520	course in entrepreneurship? And there, what we have to do is really make the case that students
445520	450960	need to learn how to be entrepreneurial in their life. And it's a different conception of preparing
450960	456080	students for, say, a business career of just, you know, someone will give you a job and you will
456080	461040	show up and they will tell you what to do. The entrepreneurial way of thinking is a different
461040	468640	philosophical mindset, right? Or, yeah, if we're going to say, should we teach Latin, right, or
468640	474640	Greek on the curriculum? Or should we substitute a modern language? Then what we're going to say is,
474640	479760	well, you know, there's, in many cases, a philosophical difference there. One side
479760	486400	wants to say we are inheritors of this great tradition, and students need to know that great
486400	491360	tradition, absorb it and pass it on to the next generation. Another side wants to say, well,
491360	495440	we're not so sure that those old traditions are all that great, so to speak, but the more
495440	501040	important thing is students live in the real world now. It's a global cosmopolitan world,
501040	506080	and for that they need to multiple languages and so on. So again, we're thinking very
506080	510640	philosophically differently about what kind of life we're preparing students for.
511200	516240	Yeah, the way you've put it there, you can see it ultimately depends on some of the
516960	522320	biggest philosophical questions there are. What is a human being? What is the good life for a human
522320	528240	being? The relationship between the individual and the state? All these things factor into some of
528240	534640	those big educational questions. Exactly right. Yes, that's right. And then some of the people
534640	542880	who've been most impactful on education just in the last century or so, John Dewey, Maria Montessori,
542880	550000	Paulo Freire and so on, all of them have deep philosophical frameworks that they are working
550000	555200	within, and then they're coming along and saying, we need to revolutionize education
555200	561920	based explicitly on that new philosophical framework. So you mentioned some key thinkers
561920	569120	in education there. Which philosophical battles would you say have had the longest lasting or
569120	577120	biggest impact on educational thinking? Yeah, that's a big question because we've been thinking
577120	584480	explicitly about education for millennia. So I'm going to cheat just a little bit and say,
584480	591360	just say in the last 600 years or so as we get into the modern world, and this is a debate that
591360	598400	still is with us in our generation, but I would say it's a twofold debate between some kind of
598960	608240	more religious paternalistic model of education and a more naturalistic and independence
608320	616240	generating model of education. So if we think of now our standard, but the one that's now being
616240	621280	beleaguered, standard model, nonetheless for the last couple of hundred years of liberal education.
621280	628480	So the idea is students need to have a broad base of knowledge. They need to be able to operationalize
628480	636320	that knowledge in terms of skills. It's not just abstract theory. And all of those things are very
636400	642960	complicated. And so students need to be aware of all of the issues and all of the major positions
642960	649680	that are rivals in there. And they need to be able themselves to think and enter into the debate
651040	656880	as participants. And the idea is that there's still a huge amount that we need to learn and
656880	663120	figure out the universe is more open ended. So students need to have a fairly strong mind,
663120	668720	many of them to be active discoverers of new knowledge or active creators of new things.
668720	674720	So that's kind of an idealized understanding of the liberal arts model. And so we are training
676800	681680	free minds. So we're going to free us from ignorance, free us from superstition,
681680	687040	and free us from all of the self doubts that we can actually go forth and make our own lives and
687760	694560	our society's better places. So then that is to say education is precisely about
695120	700160	training students how to do all of that. So we're going to have passionate experts in a lot of
700160	706800	different areas. Those experts will engagingly present all of the major theories, invite students
706800	712880	to learn about them. But at the end of the day, it's going to be that the student has to internalize
712880	719520	it and then find some way to demonstrate his or her best understanding of it. And then the person
719520	727920	is coached and so forth along that direction. Now that has been for the most part to your big
727920	736160	picture question for centuries. Its main contender has been a model that says liberal is not the
736160	742720	right part of education. Instead, education needs to be much more paternalistic and or
742720	748880	on that sliding scale even more authoritarian. And so rather than an active minded students,
748880	755120	students are expected to be more passive. They are receivers of inherited wisdom. And there are
755120	761280	authority figures who have basically figured out or had revealed to them all of the important
761280	768000	answers to life's questions. They are known, they are settled, and it's a top down transition.
768720	774320	And so you don't challenge who are you to challenge as a young person, the great minds of
774320	780240	minds of the past. In some cases overstating this, this is on a sliding scale. But nonetheless,
780240	785280	we have a traditional curriculum that's not going to change over time. And it's going to be
785280	792160	delivered in a hopefully benevolent paternalistic fashion. But then depending on how pessimistic
792160	797440	you are about students aptitude for learning, you might need to use some more authoritarian methods.
797440	804240	So that has been the great battle in the modern world. And in historians label, that's
804240	812000	sort of modern liberal education versus pre-modern or hardcore traditionalist pre-modern education.
813200	820080	And do you think that that is fundamentally the most important battle over education today?
820080	823760	Or do you think that it has shifted slightly? Some of what you described there
824400	831040	sounded as if we might be seeing a return to a more authoritarian model of education,
831040	840160	but a very different perspective. No longer a authority rooted in religious education traditions,
840160	847680	but that's very much secular, but has the same fundamental vantage point. So I expect you to
847680	852640	come into class and hear some things which ultimately I want you to believe because they are
852640	859360	correct and they shouldn't be challenged. Yes, no, absolutely. That's right. On my reading of
859360	868720	the big ideas, it's almost always a three-way debate on all of the fundamentals. So yes, to say
870160	874640	either we're going to be more supernaturalist and religious in our understanding of the way
874640	882160	the world works, or we're going to be more secular and naturalistic, that's two positions. And they
882160	887680	are those are huge ones, but there's a third position that is a skeptical position that says
887680	894080	the nature of reality. We don't know what that is. It's impossible to know. There is no such thing as
894080	900800	an objective God and a supernatural reality or an objective natural reality. Instead,
900800	907680	everything is some sort of subjective creation and ultimately I or we make up our own reality.
907680	914400	So that's a three-way debate. Just on the cognition issues that become very fundamental to
914400	922560	education, one side traditionally has wanted to say there is such a thing as truth. Typically,
922560	929440	it's truth with a capital T. It's in a higher dimension. And what we need to do is find some way
929440	936560	of accessing that higher dimension. Sometimes it will reveal itself to us through revelation
936560	942880	or some special individuals will have a mystical insight and or people who don't get those mystical
942880	948640	insights or revelations, they will need to have faith. And so there's been one traditional on the
948640	954720	model of knowledge that then gets applied in education circles that says it's a matter of
954720	961440	revelation, training people for mystical insight and or expecting them to have faith. And so then
961440	966560	you will base your model of education on that. In contrast to that, there's another position that
966560	972640	says no, no, objective knowledge is possible, but knowledge is of reality and reality is the
972640	978320	natural world, which is cause and effect. So we need to train our senses to observe it very
978320	984640	carefully and then to use our reason to categorize things and try out hypotheses and then develop all
984640	990400	the formal tools of scientific method. So we can get objective knowledge of reality, but by
990960	996560	not by faith and revelation, but rather by doing kind of hard, empirical and rational work.
996560	1001520	Now, the third position though, comes along and says, well, look, both of you guys are saying
1001520	1006880	that there's a reality out there that can be known and that there are ultimately truths,
1006880	1012640	but we're skeptical. We don't think there is any such thing as knowledge. We think mystical
1012640	1019920	insight, that's just a matter of wishful thinking, right? Faith is just dogmatic, following the leader
1019920	1026000	and not thinking for yourself. But at the same time, we think the senses are illusory. We think
1026000	1033920	logic is just made up word games, right? Math has no connection to actual reality. And so nobody
1033920	1040400	really knows anything. We all just have various sorts of subjective preferences that have been
1040400	1046160	instilled in us. And so we're skeptical, we're relativistic and so on. So again, we have a
1046160	1053040	three-way debate. So to come back to the first part of that, it is that third position. Philosophically,
1053600	1062560	we have been at a very skeptical place for the last century or so. The collapse of positivism,
1062560	1069440	the rise of existentialism, and any number of other movements that have become household names,
1069440	1077360	all of them are very skeptical at their core. And as a result of that, they doubt that there is such
1077360	1084320	a thing as truth, such a thing as knowledge, facts, and that we're in some sense trapped in a kind of
1084320	1090400	subjectivity. Now, that then could go in a couple of directions. One then is to say, well, you know,
1090400	1095120	if nobody really knows anything, then we should all just be very tolerant and let everybody do their
1095120	1100080	own thing and believe whatever, because nobody is in a position to say that I'm better and you're
1100080	1107040	worse on whatever the issue is. But the way it more often comes out is that it's very hard for
1107040	1112320	people to live that way, saying I don't know anything, nobody knows anything, and we're all just
1112320	1118240	going to go off and do our own things, because people want their lives to be meaningful. And
1118240	1124800	typically they want to be committed to something. And typically they have a social value framework
1124800	1130960	and in many cases a political framework that they want everybody to live in terms of. So what they
1130960	1136880	will then typically do is adopt what you're referring to as a new kind of authoritarianism.
1136880	1142400	If it is the case that nobody knows anything, there's no such thing as a true reality out
1142400	1148560	there. It's all just subjective value beliefs and the things that have been conditioned into us.
1148560	1152480	Well, I might as well just plunge into the fray, right? I might as well just say,
1152480	1157120	here's what I happen to believe. This is what seems significant and meaningful to me,
1157120	1163360	and I'm not going to claim that it's true or that it's objective. And I very well recognize
1163360	1167920	that there are lots of other frameworks out there, but really we're just a bunch of people
1167920	1173360	with our own subjective frameworks in competition with each other to see who's going to prevail.
1173360	1178640	And I just want my viewpoint to prevail. And so I'm going to use any techniques, including
1178640	1184960	authoritarian techniques, if it's going to enable my view to prevail. So you can get an
1184960	1191760	authoritarianism out of that kind of skepticism as well. You mentioned Nietzsche as one of the
1191760	1199120	thinkers who was influential for you as a young man just starting formal education and experiencing
1199120	1204960	your passion for philosophy for the first time. And the idea that there are no facts,
1205040	1211680	only interpretations is one which some historians of philosophy trace to Nietzsche. Much of what
1211680	1217600	you're describing there sounds like it's influenced by that idea. And Nietzsche has been called the
1217600	1225520	kind of grandfather of postmodernism. If we're left with just the interpretations and it's just
1225520	1231040	power narratives, is what you're suggesting that people just want to claim power for their own narrative?
1231840	1237200	Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And you're right to cite Nietzsche. I'm not a Nietzschean. I learned a
1237200	1244880	lot from Nietzsche, but I think he is the most influential philosopher for the last century
1244880	1251520	or so. And in some ways the dates are perfect because he died in 1900 and basically the 20th
1251520	1260320	century intellectually was largely a Nietzschean century. So the philosophers whom the current
1260400	1267840	social justice warriors, the wokists, the advocates of political correct authoritarianism and so on.
1268560	1274160	So they are the children or the grandchildren. They will go back and be citing figures like
1274160	1280240	Michel Foucault. They might not have read him at this point, but Foucault cites Nietzsche as a
1280240	1286640	formative influence. Or it might be Heidegger, another giant of 20th century philosophy. Martin
1287600	1295280	Heidegger is largely influenced by Nietzsche as well. So that grandfather, father,
1296560	1304000	grandchild narrative that works as well. So Nietzsche is a very fundamentally subjectivist
1305520	1311920	philosopher with respect to knowledge. He's standing at the end of a long tradition of
1311920	1318160	skeptical philosophy and he comes to believe on all of the major issues about perception,
1318160	1325680	about our forming of abstractions, about our memories, about our ability to do grammar and
1325680	1333280	linguistics and to form scientific theories and narrations and so on. All of that is driven by
1334000	1338560	skeptical arguments that have hollowed out any positive account of those. So we're just left
1338560	1345040	with subjectivism. And then there's a kind of relativism that comes out of that. So then
1345040	1352800	Nietzsche, though, is also first generation thinkers to grapple seriously with evolutionary
1352800	1364480	ideas. And partly this means that you don't see reality as fixed for all time in terms of one
1364480	1370960	stable framework, that reality itself, including humans as organisms are evolving. And so what's,
1370960	1375600	you know, good for this organism at this time is going to be different from what's good for
1376160	1382880	that kind of organism later. And so you have the idea that the rules of the game are evolving
1382880	1388320	over time instead of fixed absolute truths as well. But you also get this idea that, well, look,
1388320	1394400	if there's no such thing as truth, there's no such thing as your rationality is figuring out
1394400	1401040	objectively what the facts of the situation are. If it's all subjective, and this evolving
1402320	1410160	struggle and rivalry, then you do start to start using language like power a different way. So then
1410160	1417200	it is just a power struggle between the strong and the weak. And the strong have their narrative and
1417200	1422320	their subjective preferences and the weak have theirs. And it's not going to be decided by truth
1422320	1427760	and decency and universal rights, because we don't believe in those anymore. It's just going to be
1427760	1434960	a naked power struggle. So there a very adversarial understanding of power comes out of that. And
1434960	1441520	Nietzsche is one of the most clear sighted on that issue. And then the 20th century is largely,
1441520	1449120	largely inheriting that. Now, by contrast to that, and this is going to be closer to my own
1449120	1457200	views. So power is an important word. But so what do we mean by power? And there's a much more
1457200	1463600	optimistic benevolent understanding of power that is that is that is possible. Power is the
1463600	1470560	capacity to get stuff done. You're more powerful to the extent that you have the knowledge and the
1470640	1479200	skills and other kinds of resources to be able to accomplish stuff in the world. And so knowledge
1479200	1484880	comes in a lot of different forms of intellectual power. So here we think about Francis Bacon,
1484880	1490640	knowledge is power. And this then ties us back to education. So here we think about power as a good
1490640	1497600	thing. We want to empower our students to build up their cognitive power and their physical power
1497600	1504960	and their character power so that they can go forth and do good things in the world. And if you
1504960	1511360	cooble that with a more benevolent understanding of human beings, that human beings are competent
1511360	1517360	at acquiring knowledge, they are competent at working out socially and mutually beneficial
1517360	1522800	ways of living together as friends, as romantic partners, starting family, starting businesses,
1523360	1529040	even doing politics. Politics, of course, is about power, but we're going to do it in a democratic
1529040	1535440	and republican way that respects every individual's own power and their own agency, right, and so
1535440	1540800	forth. So here we have the idea that power is very important and we want more and more power.
1541600	1547440	But we think that that power, of course, it can be abused, but human beings can work out ways of
1547520	1554320	using power benevolently. So that understanding of power, though, has philosophical opposition to
1554320	1561120	those who say, no, human beings are much more irrational, much more impotent with respect to
1561120	1566960	cognitive matters, much more subjective and animalistic with respect to the formation of their
1566960	1573360	values. And so power becomes a much darker thing. So that battle over power is also part of what we
1573360	1580640	are engaged in right now. I think that's certainly the case and what people often first think of
1580640	1588080	when they think of power is hierarchy and therefore things no longer being equal. And I think this
1588080	1594720	idea of power and different power centers struggling to get the most power for themselves
1595280	1601600	is interpreted by many people as relating to the Marxist concept of oppression and struggle between
1601680	1608720	different classes. And do you think that the division of the world that Nietzsche puts forward
1608720	1614800	as struggling power centers is deeply related to Marxist concept of struggle, or have the two
1614800	1621040	become intertwined in the way that some thinkers have related the two of them? I think they are
1621040	1629680	variations on a fundamental theme. Both of them do have this idea of power completely dissociated
1629680	1637200	from truth, knowledge, and values. So it's not the idea that we can figure out what the truth is
1637760	1643120	and that we can figure out what's good in the world and then respect that all individuals have
1643120	1650080	the capacity for learning the truth and that all individuals have certain core value statuses that
1650080	1657040	we call that we call rights. So what we then will think is that we want those kinds of people to
1657040	1664320	have power, but it's in the service of discovering more truth and advancing their rights and advancing
1664320	1670400	genuine good in the world. If you reverse that, if you then say, no, really in the first place,
1670400	1677760	it's just power and all of these so-called truths and all these so-called values are just subjective
1677760	1685120	and variable across human beings, then what you're going to find is your truth is in the service of
1685200	1692160	power rather than power in the service of actual truth and so that fundamental reversal is there.
1692160	1699520	Now, to get to Marx and Nietzsche, what both of them do is start off with a very skeptical,
1699520	1706640	subjectivist understanding of the world and an adversarial understanding of human beings. So
1706640	1712800	for them, the difference between strong and weak centers of power, that is the fundamental
1713680	1720560	and on the basis of that, it really just is a question of where your sympathies are. So for Marx,
1720560	1728160	he's going to divide them into bourgeoisie and proletariat or those who own property and those
1728160	1733360	who economically sell their labor to those who have property. So you have these two different
1733360	1741120	classes and then you make them adversarial to each other. And so on the basis of that,
1741840	1746800	it's just a matter of are these guys power going to prevail in this rivalry or are these guys power
1746800	1754320	going to prevail in the rivalry? And in the case of Marx, his sympathies are just with the weaker
1754320	1759840	currently in the power struggle. But Nietzsche is going to give a very similar analysis. He's going
1759840	1766160	to say, not economically but rather biologically and psychobiologically, there are different centers
1766160	1771360	of power. Some of us are more predator-like, some of us are more prey-like, some of us are stronger,
1771360	1779120	some of us are weaker. And we are in adversarial relations to each other. But in the case of
1779120	1784000	Nietzsche, it's just that his sympathies are with the stronger, the more predatory light. So he's
1784000	1788400	going to say, no, these people over here are kind of pathetic. They're not the ones that are going
1788400	1794400	to advance the human species. So I'm going to go for them. So the Marxists are in favor of the weak
1794720	1799120	against the strong. The Nietzscheans are in favor of the strong against the weak. But both of them
1799120	1806480	are agreeing fundamentally that it's an adversarial you versus me power struggle. And there are no
1806480	1813520	such things as universal rights, universal goodness or objective truths. I think there's a lot of depth
1813520	1819440	to that. And one thought that I had about it is that if the Marxist sympathies are with the weak,
1820320	1826560	would it also be true to say that in order to equalize things, they themselves need to
1826560	1833040	be in a position of power? Yes, for sure. It's going to be the more Nietzschean position that says
1833040	1838880	the inequalities are natural, perhaps biologically driven. It's going to be the Marxist position
1838880	1847440	that all inequalities are artificial and driven primarily by social circumstances and so on.
1848400	1854800	But then yes, so the Nietzscheans then are going to say, you know, we have no problem with dramatic
1854800	1859840	inequalities across every single dimension, because it's going to be the high fliers. They're
1859840	1864240	the ones who are going to advance the human species. Whereas the Marxists want to level
1864240	1870480	everything on the ground, it's going to be through some sort of collectivity of equal human beings
1870480	1878560	that we're going to advance the human species. So yes, for both of them, the most fundamental debate
1878560	1889280	is this social power equality dimension. And so that makes them both going much more, I think,
1889280	1895680	in the postmodern direction. By contrast, the position I'm much more sympathetic than neither
1895680	1904960	Marxist nor nor Nietzschean is that equality is an important concept, but it's an equality
1904960	1911920	at a slightly abstract level. We are all equally human beings in the sense that we have our own
1911920	1917840	lives, we have our own cognitive capacities. And the important thing is that each of us is free
1917840	1924480	to develop our own capacities to our fullest extent. And that socially we need to be left
1924480	1931600	free in order to be able to do so. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And you can see the
1931600	1938720	temptation from a Marxist line of thinking, if everything is due to social inequality, and it's
1938720	1945120	socially constructed, then presumably it can all be reconstructed into a much more
1946560	1951120	amenable version of the world. I think that's a possibility, whereas the Nietzschean perspective
1951120	1958240	would be no, some of these things are built in. Yeah, absolutely. So another very fundamental
1958880	1963440	issue, and we've touched briefly on it, but I think it's worth stressing at this point is
1964160	1970560	who is going to be doing this restructuring. So we all say there's problems in the world,
1970560	1974720	and you might be more pessimistic or more optimistic. So there's problems in the world,
1974800	1982080	and we want to fix those problems. Well, then the question is, who is going to do the fixing?
1982640	1989840	And what you do get out of Marxism is the idea that it has to be some sort of powerful group,
1989840	1996720	the vanguard of the proletariat, who takes it and uses basically all of society's resources in
1996720	2003280	order to change it. And the Nietzscheans are also going to argue that whatever improvements
2003280	2008800	they're going to come from certain special individuals, and both of them are contrasted to
2009600	2016240	the position that says it's the individual, all of us, who have agency in our own lives.
2016800	2023600	And if you want to change your circumstance, all fundamentally it is up to you to develop your
2023600	2029840	individual capacities in order to change the world in the way you want to go. And what's very important
2029840	2038320	here is how both the Nietzscheans and the Marxists, the Marxists even more so. And then there are
2038320	2046080	second, third generation inheritors now who deny individual agency fundamentally. They will say,
2046800	2054880	this is the birth of victimhood culture. So the victim is the person who is the ultimate
2054880	2061680	lack of agency. I am who I am because I've been pushed around by all of these social forces beyond
2061680	2070160	my control. I have no agency. And anything that's nasty in my life is somebody else's fault. And
2070160	2078720	anytime we say, well, maybe you could do something about it. Or maybe you are in part to blame for
2078720	2084160	your circumstance right now. That is just swept off the table. You're blaming the victim or you're
2084160	2092480	doing some other kind of sin from that particular lexicon. So this issue really does come down to
2092480	2100000	that old, again, philosophical debate about volition or free will versus some sort of determinism.
2100000	2106240	And another important part of this is that the Marxists and the cultural Marxists and the Neo
2107040	2114320	postmodernists and so on, all of them do advocate very strongly forms of determinism.
2115280	2123200	That says that really the human being is just a lump of plasticine born into a world shaped by
2123200	2130000	social forces and other environmental forces beyond his control. And all you can really do if
2130000	2136720	you have any measure of agency is just decide to accept where you are and then commit yourself in a
2136720	2142400	non-rational way to advancing that set of interests. But of course, everybody else is doing the same
2142400	2153040	thing. It does become a power struggle. Now, that deterministic view of human beings, does that
2153040	2161120	shed any light on why we most often tend to see the the proclivity to cancel debate
2162720	2169440	among postmodernist perspectives. So rather than answering speech with more speech and
2169440	2174880	emphasizing the importance of debate, instead, what we get is no, you're not allowed to hear that
2174880	2182000	perspective or that view is somehow beyond the law. Yes. Why aren't people trusted to listen and
2182000	2188720	make up their own minds? Yes. No, that's a great, great question. And it goes to the heart of what
2188720	2196000	liberal education should be. So the last part of your phrase that we're going to trust individuals
2196000	2202240	to make up their own minds. So make up your own mind. That's an agency point. Yeah. So part of the
2202240	2207920	answer is going to be we don't think individuals have agency or the middle part of it. Individuals,
2208800	2216240	the postmoderns, and they don't believe in individuals. You are a social construct. You
2216240	2223280	are fundamentally a part of a group that has shaped you. So the identity politics, it's actually the
2223280	2227680	identity part that's the most important there. It's not really primarily about politics. It's
2227680	2233280	about what is your identity. And what we find is that they are arguing is that your identity is
2233280	2239360	not as an individual, or most the individual just is the thing of all of the Venn diagram
2239360	2244320	constructions. You're the overlap of a whole bunch of group identities. So you are a
2244320	2252480	collectivized individual. So you're a collective being that is shaped by forces rather than
2252480	2258080	individuals who are going to make up their own minds. But then also if you think about debate
2258160	2266720	as a formal educational device, the assumptions of debate are that here's a controversy,
2266720	2271440	and we're going to acknowledge that this is a controversy, that there are at least two positions
2272560	2277440	and that they're both important positions. And probably most of us don't know what position
2277440	2282560	we should accept yet. So we're going to go through a certain formal process to get there.
2282560	2289600	And we are going to respect advocates of both positions that are going to be there.
2289600	2295840	And that we are interested in the truth, or at least the best approximation of the truth that
2295840	2301360	we can get right now. So we still believe in truth. We believe in respect. We believe that there are
2301360	2309280	genuine controversies. And we think that the way we should proceed is by using a formal reason.
2309280	2315280	You put a position out there, you develop an argument for it. The other person then critiques
2315840	2320320	that argument saying, you know, your factual basis is incorrect here, or you've made an error
2320320	2328800	of logic there. So we're talking about facts and logic and argumentation. And the world is complex
2328800	2334640	and we're going to be rational. And then of course, in a debate, again, we're back to where you ended
2334720	2340320	in your formulation, we're going to leave it up to each member of the audience to make up his or
2340320	2348640	her own mind after hopefully having carefully considered. So that whole apparatus is necessary
2348640	2355360	if you're going to think that debate is a useful and important pedagogical device. But then what
2355360	2362640	we find is that by the time you get to strong skepticism, strong kind of adversarial, cynical
2362640	2369360	power understandings of the world, strong collective collectivity, and lack of agency,
2369360	2374320	everything goes out the window. We're not rational. Logic is a myth. There are no facts.
2374880	2380960	Respect for each other. You got to be kidding me. It's all just an uncivil power struggle.
2380960	2386880	And so what you then do is that whatever institution you are, is you don't listen
2386880	2394400	respectfully and engage the debate. Instead, you act as a member of the adversarial power struggle.
2394400	2402000	You try to shut down the debate by using intimidation tactics or just physical shouting over the
2402000	2409280	person or using threats and so on. So you're fundamentally opposed to everything that goes
2409280	2414560	into making debate possible. And so that's why cancel culture is on the rise.
2415520	2422720	I think that gets right to the heart of the matter. And it's, it's sad to hear it put succinctly
2422720	2429200	like that because fundamentally what's under attack is the commitment to rationality itself.
2429200	2434800	Exactly. That primary component of education. So there's just no value in debate because
2434800	2439600	traditionally the value of free speech and debate has been both parties are somehow interested in
2439600	2445600	working together collaboratively to struggle towards the truth together. And if that is taken
2445600	2452240	away, then there's no point in it. That's right. There's no truth. There's no collaboration, right?
2452240	2459760	We are in a different philosophical universe altogether. There's a really chilling line
2459760	2465920	in Victor Clemperer's book on the language of the Third Reich. I'll just read this so I get it right.
2465920	2472560	He said that words are like tiny doses of arsenic swallowed unnoticed
2472560	2479520	and then after a while the toxic reaction sets in. I'm wondering whether we're starting to
2479520	2486960	experience a toxic reaction to some words that have been in the political educational culture
2486960	2492560	for some time now, but it's only now that the impact is really being felt. Do you have any thoughts
2492560	2499760	on that? No, absolutely right. That weaponization of language is a very useful phrase and
2501040	2507600	accurately descriptive of what's going on. And it's part of a self-conscious strategy. So if we
2507600	2516880	think of concepts like racist and sexist and privilege and the structural part of structural
2516880	2526240	whatever pathology we're interested, those can all be legitimate concepts, but they are all
2526240	2532640	concepts that at least in my language are used as anti-concepts. That's partly a technical
2532640	2539200	term of art, so let me say a little bit about that. But an anti-concept is meant to be a word
2539200	2547200	or a phrase that's used to dismantle language and undercut communication and nonetheless
2547200	2553840	in an adversarial concept or context rather to put your adversary in a defensive position.
2554640	2563280	And so the weaponization part is absolutely right there. So here again we have to get deep.
2563280	2570800	So what's the purpose of language? What is language about? And partly the standard modern
2571840	2577920	view has been that language is a tool of cognition. We have a big brain, we can form abstractions
2577920	2583520	and concepts and then start developing complex propositions and putting them together in narratives
2583520	2591040	and theories and so on. But ultimately we use language as rational animals to figure out and
2591040	2595920	carry around a map or a representation or a set of theories of the world in our heads. So
2595920	2602960	fundamentally language is a tool of cognition. But of course a lot of that we do socially,
2602960	2608720	so we want to connect with each other and so language is also a tool of communication.
2608720	2613920	But if we're going to communicate then we have to make sure that you're using words in the same
2613920	2619520	way that I'm using words and so definition and concept formation and all of that exercise that
2619520	2624560	we go through sometimes frustrating to make sure we're on the same page. That's very important
2624560	2630880	because we are interested in communication as a form of collaboration. Now of course sometimes
2630880	2637360	we are in an adversarial situations and so we're also going to use language as rhetorical weapons
2637360	2642160	in that particular. But that's hopefully a last resort and that's really a sign that something
2642160	2648240	has gone terribly wrong because fundamentally language should be about helping us understand
2648240	2654400	the world and communicate with each other. So the weaponization of language though as a prevailing
2654400	2660240	tactic as your first course, you start off with an insult, you start off with an accusation,
2661280	2667200	you start trying to get inside the person's head to put them on the defensive that is coming out of
2667920	2675040	an ideological strategy that says no we don't cognize the world and life is not about social
2675040	2684080	communication. It is a dog eat dog war and language is just one tool in that war but the kind of tool
2684080	2690640	you need in that war is weapons and so you become very good at using language as a weapon in whatever
2690640	2697920	social where you're going. So racism for example that's a very important concept in the modern
2697920	2703280	world and we all need to think about what it means or what are the psychological and the social
2704000	2708720	underpinnings of it to what extent are the person's intent and their knowledge and their
2708720	2714720	commitments and their values and so forth are organized and the same thing for sexism and so
2714720	2720960	on. So all of these concepts do need careful understanding and careful definition and at
2720960	2728320	the same time we should recognize that particularly now that we are well into the modern world we're
2728320	2736000	believers in rights and human dignity and human freedom and equality under the law that racism
2736000	2741600	is a pathology but we've made great progress on that and so yes there are racists out there but
2741600	2748160	we really should use that word in a very targeted way and before we accuse someone of being a racist
2748160	2755840	we better have done our homework and make sure that we're using this highly important concept
2755920	2761440	accurately but what we of course find right now is that that's not at all what's going on right the
2761440	2768480	word racism is very promiscuously applied and people have not done their homework they're
2768480	2774160	just throwing it out there they've never met you they don't know anything about you in particular
2774160	2778160	but that's what they that's what they lead with and in many cases you know people who are leading
2778160	2785440	seminars in business they will go in and you know just throw out very gross generalities about the
2785520	2790720	racial attitudes of entire groups of people and take it for granted and so on so that is very
2790720	2798800	clearly a weaponization of language but racism then is being used to put people on the defensive
2798800	2804640	right because you know they know very well for example if you accuse someone of being a racist
2804640	2810480	in the early 21st century right the person's reaction is going to be you know immediately
2810480	2816400	defensive what me i'm not a racist and then they start doing some self-examination here
2817440	2821840	but then you immediately put that person on the defensive and disoriented that person and then
2821840	2827600	that puts you in an advantageous position for how the how the argument is going to go or how the
2827600	2835840	proceedings are are going to go so you know each of these has a story but how racism sexism privilege
2835840	2843120	and structural in structural racism are used right now there is a a worked out academic literature
2843120	2849920	over the last now two generations and so these do come to be terms of art and it is part of a
2849920	2856240	strategy about how to use these words to advance certain rhetorical goals and those are in the
2856240	2864560	context of a certain kind of broader ideological goal as well so i don't know if we want to drill
2864560	2870720	down into those more specifically you know maybe structural racism would be a good one to examine
2870720	2878720	or the concept of privilege but i will follow your lead on that well the way you explained how it
2878720	2884480	puts people on the back foot puts them on the defensive hmm i'm wondering whether some of the
2885200	2891280	the key words that many people have noticed in contemporary culture words like diversity for
2891280	2899200	example or inclusion or equity some of those just sound attractive and it seems like they can work
2899200	2907920	like a trojan horse so they're a way of sneaking in almost by stealth some prior or fundamental
2907920	2913840	assumed concepts that not everyone has really thought about deeply and yet those words get them
2913840	2920000	in and that's a new vantage point to attack from do you think that's exactly right exactly right
2920000	2926000	for sure in some cases these are you know technical terms of art and there's a whole package of
2926000	2931360	associated beliefs and assumptions that are that are built into it and the the people who are
2931360	2937920	coining these terms that's what academics do in their areas of expertise they always are choosing
2937920	2943680	words carefully you know because and part of it is if you're trained in rhetoric you know
2944320	2949120	you sometimes can't nakedly state what your position is about you have to come up with an
2949120	2955680	attractive label and at the same time you know that many of the labels that are out there and are
2955680	2962160	popular or have cachet in the culture are coming from a different philosophical tradition and
2962160	2967680	you want to get those ones taken off the table so to speak and one way of doing that is by
2968480	2974800	hollowing them out and one way that typically happens is you know here's here's a word that's
2974800	2981360	now has a current understanding and then you will just add an adjective to that and then that adjective
2981360	2985600	brings with it a certain number of assumptions and it sounds like you're just engaging in the debate
2985600	2990880	but over time the adjectives assumptions comes to dominate and this part gets hollowed out so I
2990880	2998000	think structural racism is a very good example of that or the concept of privilege as it is used now
2998080	3005360	the concept of diversity which has a genuine meaning equity is a another new kid on the block
3005360	3012080	those are all very good examples of exactly that strategy and we find strangely as well that
3012640	3019200	these words end up in practice meaning almost the opposite of the kind of untutored reading of
3019200	3025520	them so diversity ends up being no we don't do diversity of thought it's very much a monoculture
3026080	3032560	that's right that's right so the standard liberal arts ideal embraces diversity because it
3032560	3037440	understands from the get-go that individuals are individuals you know partly it's that we
3037440	3043440	are different in many respects as individuals so we have to be respectful of individual diversity
3043440	3048640	but also the world is very complicated and there's a lot of things we don't know yet
3048640	3054000	so built into the liberal education model is that people are going to come up with
3054000	3060560	diverse interpretations of the world as they are working them out and so we need to respect
3060560	3067680	and in some cases tolerate a lot of diversity of individuality and a lot of diversity of opinion
3067680	3073840	and so that is a beautiful concept and that is the established concept but then if you come along
3073840	3079040	and you have a very different philosophical agenda that is one of the concepts that you need to
3079040	3084720	hollow out and replace with a different understanding of diversity and that's what has been happening
3084720	3092720	over the last two centuries the two generations yeah I'm wondering whether based on what
3092720	3099440	some concerned teachers have been expressing to me privately have we seen a hollowing out of the
3099440	3105840	term education itself some people are starting to feel like there are institutions increasingly
3105840	3112400	which on the face of it aim at education but really are aiming at some form of indoctrination
3112960	3122560	yes no that that's exactly right so we're having a huge philosophical ideological battle over
3123280	3130240	over what education should be and to a large extent it's also a politicized battle
3130880	3138640	not only because government funding of education is a significant part of the story in the modern
3138640	3145040	world so yeah so we do as teachers and as parents and I would say parents are going to become
3145600	3152640	increasingly important in this generation because you know for a century or so we have as parents
3152640	3158320	been able to assume that education is a certain thing and that there are people who are experts
3158400	3163040	in that they are benevolent and we can you know turn our kids over to them and give them
3164080	3170000	hundreds of thousands of pounds to to do something significant with my my children and now parents
3170000	3175680	I think are are properly realizing no I need to do some rethinking about about what's going on here
3175680	3182800	so what what is education and I think the the word you use indoctrination is the right word to
3182800	3191840	contrast it to so indoctrination used to have a bad label because the idea there is there is a
3191840	3200880	doctrine a doctrine and it is set it is known and the people in charge of of education they know
3200880	3208400	what it is and as the word means literally you take the doctrine and you put it in the students
3208400	3216400	and the students are conceived of as being more passive they they absorb it they don't question
3216400	3221840	it and then they regurgitate it in the approved kinds of forms now that model of education of
3221840	3228160	course it's it's ancient but it does seem that it's coming back in a new form in in our in our
3228160	3234560	current generation it's for all of the reasons that that we've we've been talking about you know
3234560	3241760	is there such a thing as a doctrine that I believe and I'm committed to no matter what
3241760	3247200	an important thing for me as a teacher is that this gets into the students heads and I will use
3247200	3253120	any tactics or any techniques to make sure that that one doctrine gets in their heads to the extent
3253120	3260400	that you go down that road and all of us in the privacy of our own minds as as teachers we make
3260400	3265680	this strategic choice but I think to the extent that any individual teacher goes down that road
3265680	3274240	they are profoundly irresponsible they should not go into education and I think to the extent
3274240	3280400	that those of us who are fellow teachers parents in any sort of position of power on school boards
3280400	3289600	and so forth have as part of our moral responsibility not to let indoctrinators become teachers in the
3289600	3295120	first place of course there's a trial period if we're going to give them tenure at some point
3296240	3303040	not give them them tenure it's a total ultimate sabotage of of education I think what you've
3303040	3311440	described there about the threats of growing indoctrination in education rings true for many
3311440	3316640	people working in schools and universities seeing this happening around them but they aren't sure
3316720	3322080	what to do about it what would your advice be for people wanting to resist it it's a very
3322080	3328640	difficult question because people don't want to end up in my position for example sacked over
3328640	3332720	what many people regard as a free speech issue even though there might be many people
3333680	3337040	want to speak out they're not sure what an effective way to do it is
3337920	3350080	Yeah well I would say the first thing is be confident in yourself realize that you are a good person
3350640	3357520	you are a reasonable person and I think anybody who is committed to being a parent anybody
3358960	3364800	in our generation as a young person has decided they want to become a teacher I think the default
3364800	3372720	position in in vast majority of cases is because you are a good person you know what it is to be
3372720	3377360	a racist maybe not you know you don't have all of the history and all of the psychology what
3377360	3387520	sexism is what what unfairness is so trust your own judgment on all of those issues and of course
3387520	3394640	we're lifelong learners all of those cliches and so on but don't let anybody who wants to sabotage
3394720	3403760	your sense of your moral worth and your competence as a rational adult have any space in your in
3403760	3409920	your psyche at all when you recognize that you're dealing with a person like that recognize
3409920	3415840	a need or if something smells wrong here and that the problem is with the other person and then
3415840	3421040	of course be benevolent be civil to the extent that you think you're dealing with this kind of
3421120	3426400	person but don't let them get under your skin I think that's the the most important thing I think
3426400	3432400	the second thing is to recognize and realize that you are more powerful than you think
3434160	3441200	as soon as your peers and your students your peers as teachers your peers in the broader
3441200	3446960	education community yeah we're all very good at sizing each other up are you a decent person are
3446960	3453280	you a smart person are you passionate about your your field are you a fair-minded person and so on
3454720	3461120	your reputation will give you more power than you think even in the case where this this should
3461120	3466240	happen in education that we have disagreements about all kinds of important things political
3466240	3473600	religious social right and so forth that as long as people know that you are a decent smart well
3473680	3480720	meaning person they will cut you a lot of slack and even if they're one of the quieter ones who's
3480720	3486240	not or are not as much interested in speaking up and so forth to the extent that you speak up
3486240	3491440	you are you're putting forth reasonable positions you're listening to the opposition you're responding
3491440	3497760	and so forth you will have more influence than you think you might otherwise you might otherwise
3497760	3504480	have so that's partly a point about self-confidence but it's also of course a point about courage
3505840	3510960	and we all know that we want to particularly if we are decent people we want to get along
3510960	3517040	with people we want to to build the win-win relationships and so it is a little bit unsettling
3517040	3522800	to be attacked and to realize that at some point we do have to stand up on principle and fight for
3523040	3529040	our values so the virtue of courage that the philosophers at least all the good philosophers
3529040	3535360	have returned to generation after generation is an important one important one to attend to
3535360	3542640	that's necessarily mean to go on you know martyr yourself right right off the bat you have to choose
3542640	3550080	your battles carefully but ultimately we all do need to work on our courage as well and to be
3550640	3556400	willing to fight for our important values particularly in our profession's educational
3556400	3563440	values all of our careers it's it's part of the job yeah I think that's absolutely key and
3564160	3572000	sometimes courage or fortitude is more important than prudence and it's the the primary virtue
3572000	3578240	for that reason I think people underestimate what impact one person displaying it can have
3578320	3584400	there's a knock on effect it's a little bit like if you look at the nature documentaries if the whole
3584400	3592160	herd turns on a predator all at once then that's it the the wolf won't chase the bison but if they
3592160	3598240	all flee suddenly the wolf is emboldened so you need people to stand together and sometimes it takes
3598240	3605440	one or two to be able to get a turn of face and I don't think appeasement exactly right compromise
3605440	3610320	it's likely to work in many cases because of the nature of the ideology you're dealing with
3610320	3616480	we're all familiar with the example of a tank man in Tiananmen Square exactly the the arresting
3616480	3623200	image of uh uh I think it was Boris Yeltsin in uh Redscary jumping on top of the the tank you
3623200	3629920	know both involving tanks but that one individual willing to stand up and they I'm drawing a line
3629920	3635440	here that does embolden huge numbers of other people in this and is very inspiring some of
3635440	3642480	what we've been saying so far is broadly pessimistic in that we've been looking at problems do you
3642480	3649600	think that there might be some causes for hope on the horizon some solutions oh yeah absolutely yes
3649600	3656400	we've been uh diagnosing diagnosing some very negative friends uh for for much of this this
3656400	3662240	discussion here but I am ultimately optimistic about this I do think it's going to be ugly
3663200	3668400	and to some extent brutal for the next five years to 10 years I'm not going to do too much
3668400	3673760	crystal ball gazing because we're in the midst of the the battle right now but what I'm optimistic
3673760	3681040	about is uh is several things one is uh 10 years ago or 15 years ago very few people realized
3681120	3686400	that they had a battle on their hands largely the the groundwork was being laid for a lot of
3686400	3692800	these movements but now everybody around the world knows there's a battle they know what the issues
3692800	3699760	are and people are getting up to speed on them on them very quickly and to uh to a large extent
3699760	3706880	you know it's true about sunlight being the best disinfectant to a large extent these pathological
3706880	3713920	movements have been able to do their work in the dark without people realizing but now that we are
3713920	3720320	aware shining the light on them they are a lot of them in defensive mode they have fairly radical
3720320	3724640	ambitions but now they're backpedaling and say oh no no we're saying is this that and the other thing
3724640	3732320	and that's a a sign that's a good sign I do think technologically there's a lot to be optimistic
3732320	3737760	about uh I'm a great believer in the power of the internet of course there's a huge amount of
3737760	3743920	crap out there but young people especially who are much more uh have much more facility right
3743920	3748800	with these devices and to the extent that they recognize they are getting crap in their formal
3748800	3755040	schooling uh there's still young people and they go off and they've got a huge amount of awesome
3755040	3761360	wonderful beautiful stuff at low cost available to them and the more intellectually curious of
3761360	3768560	them are going to go off and do so and then of course uh the all of the new technologies
3768560	3774880	really are bringing the cost of education down enormously that's it's amazing the the reduction
3774880	3780240	in the cost of of educational materials and educational delivery systems and they're also
3780240	3786000	enabling uh all sorts of people who have some entrepreneurial ambitions but are thinking in
3786000	3792080	education to do all sorts of experimenting with alternative uh mod models of education and so
3792080	3798640	on so uh the fact that things have gone downhill so badly and so much of the formal education
3798640	3804480	system is spawning a kind of entrepreneurial revolution early stages but I'm I'm optimistic
3804480	3810880	about that the main thing though I'm optimistic about though is uh uh it's more philosophical you
3811120	3817840	human beings are are human beings and uh particularly young people when I think it is
3817840	3825280	natural for young people to be energetic and ambitious and wants to do something significant
3825280	3830800	and meaningful with their with their lives I think that's built into to human conditions and I think
3830800	3838720	it takes a lot to sabotage that uh uh and and to undercut it and I think a lot of times uh human
3838720	3843920	beings young human beings they've already got good resources psychologically and physically and
3843920	3849360	and hopefully a social support network when they are experiencing the negativity they know how to
3849360	3854960	shut it out they know how to develop their own resources and look elsewhere for for healthy
3854960	3859200	healthy developments and I do you know you're speaking from a British context I'm from a
3859200	3866320	North American context you know here we live in extraordinarily rich societies with so many
3866320	3872720	opportunities out there so many resources available to us but I think the the next generation of
3872720	3878400	younger people come up they will be affected by the negative trends but that's that's sad but at
3878400	3882880	the same time they do need to learn about them and be aware of them but they will become better
3882880	3888960	armed and they will have the energy and the resources available to go off and do awesome stuff so
3889680	3895520	ultimately I'm I'm I'm excited about the future yeah I think lots of people share that excitement
3895520	3903280	and it it might not be going too far to say that the internet could have perhaps an even
3903920	3910240	greater impact on education than the invention of the printing press did I hope we see something
3910240	3914880	coming from that I think your your excitement about the internet's potential is definitely well
3914880	3923760	placed great yeah good good and thanks for giving such detailed answers to the questions I think
3923760	3929280	taken together those will provide many people with some important clarity about these topics
3929280	3936080	that concern so many where can people find out more about you and your work well I do have a
3936080	3944160	personal slash professional website it's just stevenhicks.org and then you know my commentaries
3944160	3948960	on various things short and long and then my publications and so on typically end up there
3948960	3954080	at some point so I would recommend that as as a starting point but let me also say to you thank
3954080	3961040	you for for being an example of integrity your name is now right known around the world for
3961680	3967440	for your your commitment to education and not being willing to back down so I'm glad to know
3967440	3974080	you and thank you for inviting me onto your show it's been a pleasure and you're welcome I've got
3974080	3980400	no regrets because as I said in an interview I felt that the career had vanished before my eyes
3980400	3986000	while I was doing it and for me it's fundamentally about integrity and what kind of institutions
3986000	3993120	we leave to future generations yeah well said thank you very much it's been a pleasure to speak with
3993120	3996160	you all right for me too thanks
