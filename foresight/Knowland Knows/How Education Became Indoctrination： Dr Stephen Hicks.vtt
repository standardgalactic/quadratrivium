00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
10 years ago or 15 years ago, very few people realized that they had a battle on their hands.

00:06.560 --> 00:12.880
Largely the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these movements, but now everybody around the

00:12.880 --> 00:18.080
world knows there's a battle, they know what the issues are and people are getting up to speed on

00:18.080 --> 00:25.040
them very quickly. Today I'm joined by Professor Stephen Hicks and very grateful to him for taking

00:25.040 --> 00:31.600
the time to answer some questions in the hope of answering exactly what it is that is happening in

00:31.600 --> 00:37.360
schools and universities and other educational institutions around the world. I think what

00:37.360 --> 00:45.520
happened to me where presenting ideas for debate was deemed to be gross misconduct and a sackable

00:45.520 --> 00:52.400
offense is something that has been taking place a little bit more commonly in the US.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.320
So I'm hoping Professor Hicks can provide some insights about that, but first could you just

00:58.320 --> 01:03.840
tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered your passion for philosophy please?

01:05.280 --> 01:10.400
I'm a Canadian by birth, born and raised. I didn't come to the US until starting graduate school.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.960
And philosophy came to be a bit late in life. I was not really serious about becoming a

01:16.960 --> 01:22.880
philosophy professor until well into my 20s. I actually thought I was going to become a

01:22.880 --> 01:29.280
civil engineer and architect and go into the real estate business with my dad. But I always had been

01:30.000 --> 01:34.560
a reader. My parents were both readers and I loved reading kind of all kinds of books,

01:34.560 --> 01:40.560
whatever I came across, whatever was on my parents' shelves. And then a couple things happened when

01:40.560 --> 01:47.760
I started university. I took a course from a very dynamic political science professor,

01:48.320 --> 01:54.160
but he was very much engaged with the great thinkers, John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche

01:54.160 --> 02:01.040
and Thomas Hobbes and so forth. And this was my first really systematic engagement with these

02:01.040 --> 02:06.320
great minds and sort of things that in my semi-adolescent way I'd thought about, but nothing

02:06.320 --> 02:12.880
systematically. So I was largely blown away by what I was reading and thinking about and the idea

02:12.880 --> 02:20.400
that you can think about those issues in a fundamental way. And realizing that what I was

02:20.400 --> 02:24.960
most interested, even though this was of course in the politics department, was the underlying

02:24.960 --> 02:31.360
philosophical issues about knowledge, about human nature, about how we decide what the good life is

02:31.360 --> 02:37.440
that we are perhaps organizing all of our society in terms of. So that was going on at the same time

02:37.440 --> 02:45.360
independently of reading Locke and Nietzsche. And I was also reading Ein Rand and Ludwig von Mises

02:45.360 --> 02:52.480
and Friedrich Hayek. So it was an awesome first year of university for me. Yeah, it sounds fantastic.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.200
And was there any particular book or idea that really seized you that you can recall?

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
I think it was, this might sound boring, but more methodological, you know, the idea that you could

03:06.000 --> 03:14.480
think all the way down on these issues. And in a partly in a structured way, saying there's,

03:14.480 --> 03:18.320
if you take this as an assumption, well, you're, you're, you're depending on this, that depends

03:18.320 --> 03:24.400
on this. But at the same time, that is being challenged by this position and this position.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.200
So you need to consider all of them, make up your mind here. And then if you accept this one,

03:29.200 --> 03:35.040
then this follows and that follows. So that was a, you know, I don't want to sound too hippie at

03:35.040 --> 03:40.720
this point, but that was mind blowing expansion, this thing for me at that time. Yeah, I like the

03:40.720 --> 03:47.040
way you frame that as being very much a conversation or dialogue between different voices. And what

03:47.040 --> 03:53.440
was exciting about education is being given an opportunity to join that great conversation across

03:53.520 --> 03:59.120
centuries and new, new vistas sort of opening up that you'd been dimly aware of,

03:59.120 --> 04:06.240
but now you saw the extent of them. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And to my, my professor's credit,

04:06.240 --> 04:12.560
his name was Fred Vaughn. By the end of this course, I had no idea what his particular

04:12.560 --> 04:20.400
views on any of these, these issues were. So we talked about safe spaces. I had entirely the

04:20.400 --> 04:27.440
sense that I could safely explore any view and voice any opinion and my essays for that course,

04:27.440 --> 04:34.320
try out any ideas that I was, was working through. So that was wonderful. Interesting. I think that

04:34.320 --> 04:39.600
sadly is what many people feel is being increasingly lost in the educational world now.

04:41.920 --> 04:48.640
I know you take the view that ultimately all discussions about what education is and what

04:48.640 --> 04:55.040
its aims are are fundamentally philosophical ones. Could you go into a bit more detail about that?

04:55.040 --> 05:02.240
So why is it that philosophy underlies education? Yeah, well, I know when we are professional

05:02.240 --> 05:07.280
teachers, for example, you know, we have our particular passion, our particular specialization,

05:07.840 --> 05:13.520
and we want the students to come to be more knowledgeable and more skillful and hopefully

05:13.520 --> 05:19.760
passionate about, about our area of expertise. But if you think about any of the expertises

05:19.760 --> 05:27.120
that we want to make a place for in the curriculum, they're always put in the curriculum by reference

05:27.120 --> 05:33.360
to some conception of what the product of education should be or what the goal of education should

05:33.360 --> 05:38.400
be. So if we're going to put mathematics in the curriculum, it's because we say, well,

05:38.960 --> 05:44.720
you're going to need this later in life, or if we're going to put the arts in the curriculum,

05:44.720 --> 05:51.360
it's because we say, well, all your life, there's this great universe of artistic product for you

05:51.360 --> 05:57.760
to explore, enrich your life, or maybe you will yourself become a, so we're always thinking longer

05:57.760 --> 06:04.480
term about what the child will grow up to be as a full adult. But then when we start saying

06:05.280 --> 06:09.680
that conception or thinking about that conception explicitly, what is it to be

06:09.680 --> 06:16.240
a full human adult? And then immediately we have to become very philosophical, right? So

06:16.800 --> 06:21.920
we're saying, you know, what, what capacities needs to be developed? What are our genuine,

06:21.920 --> 06:27.600
mature needs? What things really are worth pursuing? And what things really are not that

06:27.600 --> 06:33.760
important? And how is it all going to fit together so that by the time the child leaves

06:33.760 --> 06:39.680
our educational institution, and we're saying, you know, you were on your own, go out and live

06:39.680 --> 06:44.800
your life, we have some conception of what kind of a life we are we're preparing that for. So,

06:45.360 --> 06:51.520
you know, if you think about all of the great battles we have in education, sometimes it's

06:51.520 --> 06:56.720
a matter of turf war, you know, are we going to put this in the curriculum or not? And oftentimes

06:56.720 --> 07:02.000
that means to make room, we have to take something out in order to put something else in, we have

07:02.080 --> 07:07.840
to make a value judgment about what really is going to serve the student well in the long term.

07:07.840 --> 07:14.720
So, you know, in business courses at the high school level, there's, you know, teaching about

07:14.720 --> 07:19.360
bookkeeping and finance and marketing and management and so on. Well, should we add a

07:19.360 --> 07:25.520
course in entrepreneurship? And there, what we have to do is really make the case that students

07:25.520 --> 07:30.960
need to learn how to be entrepreneurial in their life. And it's a different conception of preparing

07:30.960 --> 07:36.080
students for, say, a business career of just, you know, someone will give you a job and you will

07:36.080 --> 07:41.040
show up and they will tell you what to do. The entrepreneurial way of thinking is a different

07:41.040 --> 07:48.640
philosophical mindset, right? Or, yeah, if we're going to say, should we teach Latin, right, or

07:48.640 --> 07:54.640
Greek on the curriculum? Or should we substitute a modern language? Then what we're going to say is,

07:54.640 --> 07:59.760
well, you know, there's, in many cases, a philosophical difference there. One side

07:59.760 --> 08:06.400
wants to say we are inheritors of this great tradition, and students need to know that great

08:06.400 --> 08:11.360
tradition, absorb it and pass it on to the next generation. Another side wants to say, well,

08:11.360 --> 08:15.440
we're not so sure that those old traditions are all that great, so to speak, but the more

08:15.440 --> 08:21.040
important thing is students live in the real world now. It's a global cosmopolitan world,

08:21.040 --> 08:26.080
and for that they need to multiple languages and so on. So again, we're thinking very

08:26.080 --> 08:30.640
philosophically differently about what kind of life we're preparing students for.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.240
Yeah, the way you've put it there, you can see it ultimately depends on some of the

08:36.960 --> 08:42.320
biggest philosophical questions there are. What is a human being? What is the good life for a human

08:42.320 --> 08:48.240
being? The relationship between the individual and the state? All these things factor into some of

08:48.240 --> 08:54.640
those big educational questions. Exactly right. Yes, that's right. And then some of the people

08:54.640 --> 09:02.880
who've been most impactful on education just in the last century or so, John Dewey, Maria Montessori,

09:02.880 --> 09:10.000
Paulo Freire and so on, all of them have deep philosophical frameworks that they are working

09:10.000 --> 09:15.200
within, and then they're coming along and saying, we need to revolutionize education

09:15.200 --> 09:21.920
based explicitly on that new philosophical framework. So you mentioned some key thinkers

09:21.920 --> 09:29.120
in education there. Which philosophical battles would you say have had the longest lasting or

09:29.120 --> 09:37.120
biggest impact on educational thinking? Yeah, that's a big question because we've been thinking

09:37.120 --> 09:44.480
explicitly about education for millennia. So I'm going to cheat just a little bit and say,

09:44.480 --> 09:51.360
just say in the last 600 years or so as we get into the modern world, and this is a debate that

09:51.360 --> 09:58.400
still is with us in our generation, but I would say it's a twofold debate between some kind of

09:58.960 --> 10:08.240
more religious paternalistic model of education and a more naturalistic and independence

10:08.320 --> 10:16.240
generating model of education. So if we think of now our standard, but the one that's now being

10:16.240 --> 10:21.280
beleaguered, standard model, nonetheless for the last couple of hundred years of liberal education.

10:21.280 --> 10:28.480
So the idea is students need to have a broad base of knowledge. They need to be able to operationalize

10:28.480 --> 10:36.320
that knowledge in terms of skills. It's not just abstract theory. And all of those things are very

10:36.400 --> 10:42.960
complicated. And so students need to be aware of all of the issues and all of the major positions

10:42.960 --> 10:49.680
that are rivals in there. And they need to be able themselves to think and enter into the debate

10:51.040 --> 10:56.880
as participants. And the idea is that there's still a huge amount that we need to learn and

10:56.880 --> 11:03.120
figure out the universe is more open ended. So students need to have a fairly strong mind,

11:03.120 --> 11:08.720
many of them to be active discoverers of new knowledge or active creators of new things.

11:08.720 --> 11:14.720
So that's kind of an idealized understanding of the liberal arts model. And so we are training

11:16.800 --> 11:21.680
free minds. So we're going to free us from ignorance, free us from superstition,

11:21.680 --> 11:27.040
and free us from all of the self doubts that we can actually go forth and make our own lives and

11:27.760 --> 11:34.560
our society's better places. So then that is to say education is precisely about

11:35.120 --> 11:40.160
training students how to do all of that. So we're going to have passionate experts in a lot of

11:40.160 --> 11:46.800
different areas. Those experts will engagingly present all of the major theories, invite students

11:46.800 --> 11:52.880
to learn about them. But at the end of the day, it's going to be that the student has to internalize

11:52.880 --> 11:59.520
it and then find some way to demonstrate his or her best understanding of it. And then the person

11:59.520 --> 12:07.920
is coached and so forth along that direction. Now that has been for the most part to your big

12:07.920 --> 12:16.160
picture question for centuries. Its main contender has been a model that says liberal is not the

12:16.160 --> 12:22.720
right part of education. Instead, education needs to be much more paternalistic and or

12:22.720 --> 12:28.880
on that sliding scale even more authoritarian. And so rather than an active minded students,

12:28.880 --> 12:35.120
students are expected to be more passive. They are receivers of inherited wisdom. And there are

12:35.120 --> 12:41.280
authority figures who have basically figured out or had revealed to them all of the important

12:41.280 --> 12:48.000
answers to life's questions. They are known, they are settled, and it's a top down transition.

12:48.720 --> 12:54.320
And so you don't challenge who are you to challenge as a young person, the great minds of

12:54.320 --> 13:00.240
minds of the past. In some cases overstating this, this is on a sliding scale. But nonetheless,

13:00.240 --> 13:05.280
we have a traditional curriculum that's not going to change over time. And it's going to be

13:05.280 --> 13:12.160
delivered in a hopefully benevolent paternalistic fashion. But then depending on how pessimistic

13:12.160 --> 13:17.440
you are about students aptitude for learning, you might need to use some more authoritarian methods.

13:17.440 --> 13:24.240
So that has been the great battle in the modern world. And in historians label, that's

13:24.240 --> 13:32.000
sort of modern liberal education versus pre-modern or hardcore traditionalist pre-modern education.

13:33.200 --> 13:40.080
And do you think that that is fundamentally the most important battle over education today?

13:40.080 --> 13:43.760
Or do you think that it has shifted slightly? Some of what you described there

13:44.400 --> 13:51.040
sounded as if we might be seeing a return to a more authoritarian model of education,

13:51.040 --> 14:00.160
but a very different perspective. No longer a authority rooted in religious education traditions,

14:00.160 --> 14:07.680
but that's very much secular, but has the same fundamental vantage point. So I expect you to

14:07.680 --> 14:12.640
come into class and hear some things which ultimately I want you to believe because they are

14:12.640 --> 14:19.360
correct and they shouldn't be challenged. Yes, no, absolutely. That's right. On my reading of

14:19.360 --> 14:28.720
the big ideas, it's almost always a three-way debate on all of the fundamentals. So yes, to say

14:30.160 --> 14:34.640
either we're going to be more supernaturalist and religious in our understanding of the way

14:34.640 --> 14:42.160
the world works, or we're going to be more secular and naturalistic, that's two positions. And they

14:42.160 --> 14:47.680
are those are huge ones, but there's a third position that is a skeptical position that says

14:47.680 --> 14:54.080
the nature of reality. We don't know what that is. It's impossible to know. There is no such thing as

14:54.080 --> 15:00.800
an objective God and a supernatural reality or an objective natural reality. Instead,

15:00.800 --> 15:07.680
everything is some sort of subjective creation and ultimately I or we make up our own reality.

15:07.680 --> 15:14.400
So that's a three-way debate. Just on the cognition issues that become very fundamental to

15:14.400 --> 15:22.560
education, one side traditionally has wanted to say there is such a thing as truth. Typically,

15:22.560 --> 15:29.440
it's truth with a capital T. It's in a higher dimension. And what we need to do is find some way

15:29.440 --> 15:36.560
of accessing that higher dimension. Sometimes it will reveal itself to us through revelation

15:36.560 --> 15:42.880
or some special individuals will have a mystical insight and or people who don't get those mystical

15:42.880 --> 15:48.640
insights or revelations, they will need to have faith. And so there's been one traditional on the

15:48.640 --> 15:54.720
model of knowledge that then gets applied in education circles that says it's a matter of

15:54.720 --> 16:01.440
revelation, training people for mystical insight and or expecting them to have faith. And so then

16:01.440 --> 16:06.560
you will base your model of education on that. In contrast to that, there's another position that

16:06.560 --> 16:12.640
says no, no, objective knowledge is possible, but knowledge is of reality and reality is the

16:12.640 --> 16:18.320
natural world, which is cause and effect. So we need to train our senses to observe it very

16:18.320 --> 16:24.640
carefully and then to use our reason to categorize things and try out hypotheses and then develop all

16:24.640 --> 16:30.400
the formal tools of scientific method. So we can get objective knowledge of reality, but by

16:30.960 --> 16:36.560
not by faith and revelation, but rather by doing kind of hard, empirical and rational work.

16:36.560 --> 16:41.520
Now, the third position though, comes along and says, well, look, both of you guys are saying

16:41.520 --> 16:46.880
that there's a reality out there that can be known and that there are ultimately truths,

16:46.880 --> 16:52.640
but we're skeptical. We don't think there is any such thing as knowledge. We think mystical

16:52.640 --> 16:59.920
insight, that's just a matter of wishful thinking, right? Faith is just dogmatic, following the leader

16:59.920 --> 17:06.000
and not thinking for yourself. But at the same time, we think the senses are illusory. We think

17:06.000 --> 17:13.920
logic is just made up word games, right? Math has no connection to actual reality. And so nobody

17:13.920 --> 17:20.400
really knows anything. We all just have various sorts of subjective preferences that have been

17:20.400 --> 17:26.160
instilled in us. And so we're skeptical, we're relativistic and so on. So again, we have a

17:26.160 --> 17:33.040
three-way debate. So to come back to the first part of that, it is that third position. Philosophically,

17:33.600 --> 17:42.560
we have been at a very skeptical place for the last century or so. The collapse of positivism,

17:42.560 --> 17:49.440
the rise of existentialism, and any number of other movements that have become household names,

17:49.440 --> 17:57.360
all of them are very skeptical at their core. And as a result of that, they doubt that there is such

17:57.360 --> 18:04.320
a thing as truth, such a thing as knowledge, facts, and that we're in some sense trapped in a kind of

18:04.320 --> 18:10.400
subjectivity. Now, that then could go in a couple of directions. One then is to say, well, you know,

18:10.400 --> 18:15.120
if nobody really knows anything, then we should all just be very tolerant and let everybody do their

18:15.120 --> 18:20.080
own thing and believe whatever, because nobody is in a position to say that I'm better and you're

18:20.080 --> 18:27.040
worse on whatever the issue is. But the way it more often comes out is that it's very hard for

18:27.040 --> 18:32.320
people to live that way, saying I don't know anything, nobody knows anything, and we're all just

18:32.320 --> 18:38.240
going to go off and do our own things, because people want their lives to be meaningful. And

18:38.240 --> 18:44.800
typically they want to be committed to something. And typically they have a social value framework

18:44.800 --> 18:50.960
and in many cases a political framework that they want everybody to live in terms of. So what they

18:50.960 --> 18:56.880
will then typically do is adopt what you're referring to as a new kind of authoritarianism.

18:56.880 --> 19:02.400
If it is the case that nobody knows anything, there's no such thing as a true reality out

19:02.400 --> 19:08.560
there. It's all just subjective value beliefs and the things that have been conditioned into us.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.480
Well, I might as well just plunge into the fray, right? I might as well just say,

19:12.480 --> 19:17.120
here's what I happen to believe. This is what seems significant and meaningful to me,

19:17.120 --> 19:23.360
and I'm not going to claim that it's true or that it's objective. And I very well recognize

19:23.360 --> 19:27.920
that there are lots of other frameworks out there, but really we're just a bunch of people

19:27.920 --> 19:33.360
with our own subjective frameworks in competition with each other to see who's going to prevail.

19:33.360 --> 19:38.640
And I just want my viewpoint to prevail. And so I'm going to use any techniques, including

19:38.640 --> 19:44.960
authoritarian techniques, if it's going to enable my view to prevail. So you can get an

19:44.960 --> 19:51.760
authoritarianism out of that kind of skepticism as well. You mentioned Nietzsche as one of the

19:51.760 --> 19:59.120
thinkers who was influential for you as a young man just starting formal education and experiencing

19:59.120 --> 20:04.960
your passion for philosophy for the first time. And the idea that there are no facts,

20:05.040 --> 20:11.680
only interpretations is one which some historians of philosophy trace to Nietzsche. Much of what

20:11.680 --> 20:17.600
you're describing there sounds like it's influenced by that idea. And Nietzsche has been called the

20:17.600 --> 20:25.520
kind of grandfather of postmodernism. If we're left with just the interpretations and it's just

20:25.520 --> 20:31.040
power narratives, is what you're suggesting that people just want to claim power for their own narrative?

20:31.840 --> 20:37.200
Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And you're right to cite Nietzsche. I'm not a Nietzschean. I learned a

20:37.200 --> 20:44.880
lot from Nietzsche, but I think he is the most influential philosopher for the last century

20:44.880 --> 20:51.520
or so. And in some ways the dates are perfect because he died in 1900 and basically the 20th

20:51.520 --> 21:00.320
century intellectually was largely a Nietzschean century. So the philosophers whom the current

21:00.400 --> 21:07.840
social justice warriors, the wokists, the advocates of political correct authoritarianism and so on.

21:08.560 --> 21:14.160
So they are the children or the grandchildren. They will go back and be citing figures like

21:14.160 --> 21:20.240
Michel Foucault. They might not have read him at this point, but Foucault cites Nietzsche as a

21:20.240 --> 21:26.640
formative influence. Or it might be Heidegger, another giant of 20th century philosophy. Martin

21:27.600 --> 21:35.280
Heidegger is largely influenced by Nietzsche as well. So that grandfather, father,

21:36.560 --> 21:44.000
grandchild narrative that works as well. So Nietzsche is a very fundamentally subjectivist

21:45.520 --> 21:51.920
philosopher with respect to knowledge. He's standing at the end of a long tradition of

21:51.920 --> 21:58.160
skeptical philosophy and he comes to believe on all of the major issues about perception,

21:58.160 --> 22:05.680
about our forming of abstractions, about our memories, about our ability to do grammar and

22:05.680 --> 22:13.280
linguistics and to form scientific theories and narrations and so on. All of that is driven by

22:14.000 --> 22:18.560
skeptical arguments that have hollowed out any positive account of those. So we're just left

22:18.560 --> 22:25.040
with subjectivism. And then there's a kind of relativism that comes out of that. So then

22:25.040 --> 22:32.800
Nietzsche, though, is also first generation thinkers to grapple seriously with evolutionary

22:32.800 --> 22:44.480
ideas. And partly this means that you don't see reality as fixed for all time in terms of one

22:44.480 --> 22:50.960
stable framework, that reality itself, including humans as organisms are evolving. And so what's,

22:50.960 --> 22:55.600
you know, good for this organism at this time is going to be different from what's good for

22:56.160 --> 23:02.880
that kind of organism later. And so you have the idea that the rules of the game are evolving

23:02.880 --> 23:08.320
over time instead of fixed absolute truths as well. But you also get this idea that, well, look,

23:08.320 --> 23:14.400
if there's no such thing as truth, there's no such thing as your rationality is figuring out

23:14.400 --> 23:21.040
objectively what the facts of the situation are. If it's all subjective, and this evolving

23:22.320 --> 23:30.160
struggle and rivalry, then you do start to start using language like power a different way. So then

23:30.160 --> 23:37.200
it is just a power struggle between the strong and the weak. And the strong have their narrative and

23:37.200 --> 23:42.320
their subjective preferences and the weak have theirs. And it's not going to be decided by truth

23:42.320 --> 23:47.760
and decency and universal rights, because we don't believe in those anymore. It's just going to be

23:47.760 --> 23:54.960
a naked power struggle. So there a very adversarial understanding of power comes out of that. And

23:54.960 --> 24:01.520
Nietzsche is one of the most clear sighted on that issue. And then the 20th century is largely,

24:01.520 --> 24:09.120
largely inheriting that. Now, by contrast to that, and this is going to be closer to my own

24:09.120 --> 24:17.200
views. So power is an important word. But so what do we mean by power? And there's a much more

24:17.200 --> 24:23.600
optimistic benevolent understanding of power that is that is that is possible. Power is the

24:23.600 --> 24:30.560
capacity to get stuff done. You're more powerful to the extent that you have the knowledge and the

24:30.640 --> 24:39.200
skills and other kinds of resources to be able to accomplish stuff in the world. And so knowledge

24:39.200 --> 24:44.880
comes in a lot of different forms of intellectual power. So here we think about Francis Bacon,

24:44.880 --> 24:50.640
knowledge is power. And this then ties us back to education. So here we think about power as a good

24:50.640 --> 24:57.600
thing. We want to empower our students to build up their cognitive power and their physical power

24:57.600 --> 25:04.960
and their character power so that they can go forth and do good things in the world. And if you

25:04.960 --> 25:11.360
cooble that with a more benevolent understanding of human beings, that human beings are competent

25:11.360 --> 25:17.360
at acquiring knowledge, they are competent at working out socially and mutually beneficial

25:17.360 --> 25:22.800
ways of living together as friends, as romantic partners, starting family, starting businesses,

25:23.360 --> 25:29.040
even doing politics. Politics, of course, is about power, but we're going to do it in a democratic

25:29.040 --> 25:35.440
and republican way that respects every individual's own power and their own agency, right, and so

25:35.440 --> 25:40.800
forth. So here we have the idea that power is very important and we want more and more power.

25:41.600 --> 25:47.440
But we think that that power, of course, it can be abused, but human beings can work out ways of

25:47.520 --> 25:54.320
using power benevolently. So that understanding of power, though, has philosophical opposition to

25:54.320 --> 26:01.120
those who say, no, human beings are much more irrational, much more impotent with respect to

26:01.120 --> 26:06.960
cognitive matters, much more subjective and animalistic with respect to the formation of their

26:06.960 --> 26:13.360
values. And so power becomes a much darker thing. So that battle over power is also part of what we

26:13.360 --> 26:20.640
are engaged in right now. I think that's certainly the case and what people often first think of

26:20.640 --> 26:28.080
when they think of power is hierarchy and therefore things no longer being equal. And I think this

26:28.080 --> 26:34.720
idea of power and different power centers struggling to get the most power for themselves

26:35.280 --> 26:41.600
is interpreted by many people as relating to the Marxist concept of oppression and struggle between

26:41.680 --> 26:48.720
different classes. And do you think that the division of the world that Nietzsche puts forward

26:48.720 --> 26:54.800
as struggling power centers is deeply related to Marxist concept of struggle, or have the two

26:54.800 --> 27:01.040
become intertwined in the way that some thinkers have related the two of them? I think they are

27:01.040 --> 27:09.680
variations on a fundamental theme. Both of them do have this idea of power completely dissociated

27:09.680 --> 27:17.200
from truth, knowledge, and values. So it's not the idea that we can figure out what the truth is

27:17.760 --> 27:23.120
and that we can figure out what's good in the world and then respect that all individuals have

27:23.120 --> 27:30.080
the capacity for learning the truth and that all individuals have certain core value statuses that

27:30.080 --> 27:37.040
we call that we call rights. So what we then will think is that we want those kinds of people to

27:37.040 --> 27:44.320
have power, but it's in the service of discovering more truth and advancing their rights and advancing

27:44.320 --> 27:50.400
genuine good in the world. If you reverse that, if you then say, no, really in the first place,

27:50.400 --> 27:57.760
it's just power and all of these so-called truths and all these so-called values are just subjective

27:57.760 --> 28:05.120
and variable across human beings, then what you're going to find is your truth is in the service of

28:05.200 --> 28:12.160
power rather than power in the service of actual truth and so that fundamental reversal is there.

28:12.160 --> 28:19.520
Now, to get to Marx and Nietzsche, what both of them do is start off with a very skeptical,

28:19.520 --> 28:26.640
subjectivist understanding of the world and an adversarial understanding of human beings. So

28:26.640 --> 28:32.800
for them, the difference between strong and weak centers of power, that is the fundamental

28:33.680 --> 28:40.560
and on the basis of that, it really just is a question of where your sympathies are. So for Marx,

28:40.560 --> 28:48.160
he's going to divide them into bourgeoisie and proletariat or those who own property and those

28:48.160 --> 28:53.360
who economically sell their labor to those who have property. So you have these two different

28:53.360 --> 29:01.120
classes and then you make them adversarial to each other. And so on the basis of that,

29:01.840 --> 29:06.800
it's just a matter of are these guys power going to prevail in this rivalry or are these guys power

29:06.800 --> 29:14.320
going to prevail in the rivalry? And in the case of Marx, his sympathies are just with the weaker

29:14.320 --> 29:19.840
currently in the power struggle. But Nietzsche is going to give a very similar analysis. He's going

29:19.840 --> 29:26.160
to say, not economically but rather biologically and psychobiologically, there are different centers

29:26.160 --> 29:31.360
of power. Some of us are more predator-like, some of us are more prey-like, some of us are stronger,

29:31.360 --> 29:39.120
some of us are weaker. And we are in adversarial relations to each other. But in the case of

29:39.120 --> 29:44.000
Nietzsche, it's just that his sympathies are with the stronger, the more predatory light. So he's

29:44.000 --> 29:48.400
going to say, no, these people over here are kind of pathetic. They're not the ones that are going

29:48.400 --> 29:54.400
to advance the human species. So I'm going to go for them. So the Marxists are in favor of the weak

29:54.720 --> 29:59.120
against the strong. The Nietzscheans are in favor of the strong against the weak. But both of them

29:59.120 --> 30:06.480
are agreeing fundamentally that it's an adversarial you versus me power struggle. And there are no

30:06.480 --> 30:13.520
such things as universal rights, universal goodness or objective truths. I think there's a lot of depth

30:13.520 --> 30:19.440
to that. And one thought that I had about it is that if the Marxist sympathies are with the weak,

30:20.320 --> 30:26.560
would it also be true to say that in order to equalize things, they themselves need to

30:26.560 --> 30:33.040
be in a position of power? Yes, for sure. It's going to be the more Nietzschean position that says

30:33.040 --> 30:38.880
the inequalities are natural, perhaps biologically driven. It's going to be the Marxist position

30:38.880 --> 30:47.440
that all inequalities are artificial and driven primarily by social circumstances and so on.

30:48.400 --> 30:54.800
But then yes, so the Nietzscheans then are going to say, you know, we have no problem with dramatic

30:54.800 --> 30:59.840
inequalities across every single dimension, because it's going to be the high fliers. They're

30:59.840 --> 31:04.240
the ones who are going to advance the human species. Whereas the Marxists want to level

31:04.240 --> 31:10.480
everything on the ground, it's going to be through some sort of collectivity of equal human beings

31:10.480 --> 31:18.560
that we're going to advance the human species. So yes, for both of them, the most fundamental debate

31:18.560 --> 31:29.280
is this social power equality dimension. And so that makes them both going much more, I think,

31:29.280 --> 31:35.680
in the postmodern direction. By contrast, the position I'm much more sympathetic than neither

31:35.680 --> 31:44.960
Marxist nor nor Nietzschean is that equality is an important concept, but it's an equality

31:44.960 --> 31:51.920
at a slightly abstract level. We are all equally human beings in the sense that we have our own

31:51.920 --> 31:57.840
lives, we have our own cognitive capacities. And the important thing is that each of us is free

31:57.840 --> 32:04.480
to develop our own capacities to our fullest extent. And that socially we need to be left

32:04.480 --> 32:11.600
free in order to be able to do so. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And you can see the

32:11.600 --> 32:18.720
temptation from a Marxist line of thinking, if everything is due to social inequality, and it's

32:18.720 --> 32:25.120
socially constructed, then presumably it can all be reconstructed into a much more

32:26.560 --> 32:31.120
amenable version of the world. I think that's a possibility, whereas the Nietzschean perspective

32:31.120 --> 32:38.240
would be no, some of these things are built in. Yeah, absolutely. So another very fundamental

32:38.880 --> 32:43.440
issue, and we've touched briefly on it, but I think it's worth stressing at this point is

32:44.160 --> 32:50.560
who is going to be doing this restructuring. So we all say there's problems in the world,

32:50.560 --> 32:54.720
and you might be more pessimistic or more optimistic. So there's problems in the world,

32:54.800 --> 33:02.080
and we want to fix those problems. Well, then the question is, who is going to do the fixing?

33:02.640 --> 33:09.840
And what you do get out of Marxism is the idea that it has to be some sort of powerful group,

33:09.840 --> 33:16.720
the vanguard of the proletariat, who takes it and uses basically all of society's resources in

33:16.720 --> 33:23.280
order to change it. And the Nietzscheans are also going to argue that whatever improvements

33:23.280 --> 33:28.800
they're going to come from certain special individuals, and both of them are contrasted to

33:29.600 --> 33:36.240
the position that says it's the individual, all of us, who have agency in our own lives.

33:36.800 --> 33:43.600
And if you want to change your circumstance, all fundamentally it is up to you to develop your

33:43.600 --> 33:49.840
individual capacities in order to change the world in the way you want to go. And what's very important

33:49.840 --> 33:58.320
here is how both the Nietzscheans and the Marxists, the Marxists even more so. And then there are

33:58.320 --> 34:06.080
second, third generation inheritors now who deny individual agency fundamentally. They will say,

34:06.800 --> 34:14.880
this is the birth of victimhood culture. So the victim is the person who is the ultimate

34:14.880 --> 34:21.680
lack of agency. I am who I am because I've been pushed around by all of these social forces beyond

34:21.680 --> 34:30.160
my control. I have no agency. And anything that's nasty in my life is somebody else's fault. And

34:30.160 --> 34:38.720
anytime we say, well, maybe you could do something about it. Or maybe you are in part to blame for

34:38.720 --> 34:44.160
your circumstance right now. That is just swept off the table. You're blaming the victim or you're

34:44.160 --> 34:52.480
doing some other kind of sin from that particular lexicon. So this issue really does come down to

34:52.480 --> 35:00.000
that old, again, philosophical debate about volition or free will versus some sort of determinism.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.240
And another important part of this is that the Marxists and the cultural Marxists and the Neo

35:07.040 --> 35:14.320
postmodernists and so on, all of them do advocate very strongly forms of determinism.

35:15.280 --> 35:23.200
That says that really the human being is just a lump of plasticine born into a world shaped by

35:23.200 --> 35:30.000
social forces and other environmental forces beyond his control. And all you can really do if

35:30.000 --> 35:36.720
you have any measure of agency is just decide to accept where you are and then commit yourself in a

35:36.720 --> 35:42.400
non-rational way to advancing that set of interests. But of course, everybody else is doing the same

35:42.400 --> 35:53.040
thing. It does become a power struggle. Now, that deterministic view of human beings, does that

35:53.040 --> 36:01.120
shed any light on why we most often tend to see the the proclivity to cancel debate

36:02.720 --> 36:09.440
among postmodernist perspectives. So rather than answering speech with more speech and

36:09.440 --> 36:14.880
emphasizing the importance of debate, instead, what we get is no, you're not allowed to hear that

36:14.880 --> 36:22.000
perspective or that view is somehow beyond the law. Yes. Why aren't people trusted to listen and

36:22.000 --> 36:28.720
make up their own minds? Yes. No, that's a great, great question. And it goes to the heart of what

36:28.720 --> 36:36.000
liberal education should be. So the last part of your phrase that we're going to trust individuals

36:36.000 --> 36:42.240
to make up their own minds. So make up your own mind. That's an agency point. Yeah. So part of the

36:42.240 --> 36:47.920
answer is going to be we don't think individuals have agency or the middle part of it. Individuals,

36:48.800 --> 36:56.240
the postmoderns, and they don't believe in individuals. You are a social construct. You

36:56.240 --> 37:03.280
are fundamentally a part of a group that has shaped you. So the identity politics, it's actually the

37:03.280 --> 37:07.680
identity part that's the most important there. It's not really primarily about politics. It's

37:07.680 --> 37:13.280
about what is your identity. And what we find is that they are arguing is that your identity is

37:13.280 --> 37:19.360
not as an individual, or most the individual just is the thing of all of the Venn diagram

37:19.360 --> 37:24.320
constructions. You're the overlap of a whole bunch of group identities. So you are a

37:24.320 --> 37:32.480
collectivized individual. So you're a collective being that is shaped by forces rather than

37:32.480 --> 37:38.080
individuals who are going to make up their own minds. But then also if you think about debate

37:38.160 --> 37:46.720
as a formal educational device, the assumptions of debate are that here's a controversy,

37:46.720 --> 37:51.440
and we're going to acknowledge that this is a controversy, that there are at least two positions

37:52.560 --> 37:57.440
and that they're both important positions. And probably most of us don't know what position

37:57.440 --> 38:02.560
we should accept yet. So we're going to go through a certain formal process to get there.

38:02.560 --> 38:09.600
And we are going to respect advocates of both positions that are going to be there.

38:09.600 --> 38:15.840
And that we are interested in the truth, or at least the best approximation of the truth that

38:15.840 --> 38:21.360
we can get right now. So we still believe in truth. We believe in respect. We believe that there are

38:21.360 --> 38:29.280
genuine controversies. And we think that the way we should proceed is by using a formal reason.

38:29.280 --> 38:35.280
You put a position out there, you develop an argument for it. The other person then critiques

38:35.840 --> 38:40.320
that argument saying, you know, your factual basis is incorrect here, or you've made an error

38:40.320 --> 38:48.800
of logic there. So we're talking about facts and logic and argumentation. And the world is complex

38:48.800 --> 38:54.640
and we're going to be rational. And then of course, in a debate, again, we're back to where you ended

38:54.720 --> 39:00.320
in your formulation, we're going to leave it up to each member of the audience to make up his or

39:00.320 --> 39:08.640
her own mind after hopefully having carefully considered. So that whole apparatus is necessary

39:08.640 --> 39:15.360
if you're going to think that debate is a useful and important pedagogical device. But then what

39:15.360 --> 39:22.640
we find is that by the time you get to strong skepticism, strong kind of adversarial, cynical

39:22.640 --> 39:29.360
power understandings of the world, strong collective collectivity, and lack of agency,

39:29.360 --> 39:34.320
everything goes out the window. We're not rational. Logic is a myth. There are no facts.

39:34.880 --> 39:40.960
Respect for each other. You got to be kidding me. It's all just an uncivil power struggle.

39:40.960 --> 39:46.880
And so what you then do is that whatever institution you are, is you don't listen

39:46.880 --> 39:54.400
respectfully and engage the debate. Instead, you act as a member of the adversarial power struggle.

39:54.400 --> 40:02.000
You try to shut down the debate by using intimidation tactics or just physical shouting over the

40:02.000 --> 40:09.280
person or using threats and so on. So you're fundamentally opposed to everything that goes

40:09.280 --> 40:14.560
into making debate possible. And so that's why cancel culture is on the rise.

40:15.520 --> 40:22.720
I think that gets right to the heart of the matter. And it's, it's sad to hear it put succinctly

40:22.720 --> 40:29.200
like that because fundamentally what's under attack is the commitment to rationality itself.

40:29.200 --> 40:34.800
Exactly. That primary component of education. So there's just no value in debate because

40:34.800 --> 40:39.600
traditionally the value of free speech and debate has been both parties are somehow interested in

40:39.600 --> 40:45.600
working together collaboratively to struggle towards the truth together. And if that is taken

40:45.600 --> 40:52.240
away, then there's no point in it. That's right. There's no truth. There's no collaboration, right?

40:52.240 --> 40:59.760
We are in a different philosophical universe altogether. There's a really chilling line

40:59.760 --> 41:05.920
in Victor Clemperer's book on the language of the Third Reich. I'll just read this so I get it right.

41:05.920 --> 41:12.560
He said that words are like tiny doses of arsenic swallowed unnoticed

41:12.560 --> 41:19.520
and then after a while the toxic reaction sets in. I'm wondering whether we're starting to

41:19.520 --> 41:26.960
experience a toxic reaction to some words that have been in the political educational culture

41:26.960 --> 41:32.560
for some time now, but it's only now that the impact is really being felt. Do you have any thoughts

41:32.560 --> 41:39.760
on that? No, absolutely right. That weaponization of language is a very useful phrase and

41:41.040 --> 41:47.600
accurately descriptive of what's going on. And it's part of a self-conscious strategy. So if we

41:47.600 --> 41:56.880
think of concepts like racist and sexist and privilege and the structural part of structural

41:56.880 --> 42:06.240
whatever pathology we're interested, those can all be legitimate concepts, but they are all

42:06.240 --> 42:12.640
concepts that at least in my language are used as anti-concepts. That's partly a technical

42:12.640 --> 42:19.200
term of art, so let me say a little bit about that. But an anti-concept is meant to be a word

42:19.200 --> 42:27.200
or a phrase that's used to dismantle language and undercut communication and nonetheless

42:27.200 --> 42:33.840
in an adversarial concept or context rather to put your adversary in a defensive position.

42:34.640 --> 42:43.280
And so the weaponization part is absolutely right there. So here again we have to get deep.

42:43.280 --> 42:50.800
So what's the purpose of language? What is language about? And partly the standard modern

42:51.840 --> 42:57.920
view has been that language is a tool of cognition. We have a big brain, we can form abstractions

42:57.920 --> 43:03.520
and concepts and then start developing complex propositions and putting them together in narratives

43:03.520 --> 43:11.040
and theories and so on. But ultimately we use language as rational animals to figure out and

43:11.040 --> 43:15.920
carry around a map or a representation or a set of theories of the world in our heads. So

43:15.920 --> 43:22.960
fundamentally language is a tool of cognition. But of course a lot of that we do socially,

43:22.960 --> 43:28.720
so we want to connect with each other and so language is also a tool of communication.

43:28.720 --> 43:33.920
But if we're going to communicate then we have to make sure that you're using words in the same

43:33.920 --> 43:39.520
way that I'm using words and so definition and concept formation and all of that exercise that

43:39.520 --> 43:44.560
we go through sometimes frustrating to make sure we're on the same page. That's very important

43:44.560 --> 43:50.880
because we are interested in communication as a form of collaboration. Now of course sometimes

43:50.880 --> 43:57.360
we are in an adversarial situations and so we're also going to use language as rhetorical weapons

43:57.360 --> 44:02.160
in that particular. But that's hopefully a last resort and that's really a sign that something

44:02.160 --> 44:08.240
has gone terribly wrong because fundamentally language should be about helping us understand

44:08.240 --> 44:14.400
the world and communicate with each other. So the weaponization of language though as a prevailing

44:14.400 --> 44:20.240
tactic as your first course, you start off with an insult, you start off with an accusation,

44:21.280 --> 44:27.200
you start trying to get inside the person's head to put them on the defensive that is coming out of

44:27.920 --> 44:35.040
an ideological strategy that says no we don't cognize the world and life is not about social

44:35.040 --> 44:44.080
communication. It is a dog eat dog war and language is just one tool in that war but the kind of tool

44:44.080 --> 44:50.640
you need in that war is weapons and so you become very good at using language as a weapon in whatever

44:50.640 --> 44:57.920
social where you're going. So racism for example that's a very important concept in the modern

44:57.920 --> 45:03.280
world and we all need to think about what it means or what are the psychological and the social

45:04.000 --> 45:08.720
underpinnings of it to what extent are the person's intent and their knowledge and their

45:08.720 --> 45:14.720
commitments and their values and so forth are organized and the same thing for sexism and so

45:14.720 --> 45:20.960
on. So all of these concepts do need careful understanding and careful definition and at

45:20.960 --> 45:28.320
the same time we should recognize that particularly now that we are well into the modern world we're

45:28.320 --> 45:36.000
believers in rights and human dignity and human freedom and equality under the law that racism

45:36.000 --> 45:41.600
is a pathology but we've made great progress on that and so yes there are racists out there but

45:41.600 --> 45:48.160
we really should use that word in a very targeted way and before we accuse someone of being a racist

45:48.160 --> 45:55.840
we better have done our homework and make sure that we're using this highly important concept

45:55.920 --> 46:01.440
accurately but what we of course find right now is that that's not at all what's going on right the

46:01.440 --> 46:08.480
word racism is very promiscuously applied and people have not done their homework they're

46:08.480 --> 46:14.160
just throwing it out there they've never met you they don't know anything about you in particular

46:14.160 --> 46:18.160
but that's what they that's what they lead with and in many cases you know people who are leading

46:18.160 --> 46:25.440
seminars in business they will go in and you know just throw out very gross generalities about the

46:25.520 --> 46:30.720
racial attitudes of entire groups of people and take it for granted and so on so that is very

46:30.720 --> 46:38.800
clearly a weaponization of language but racism then is being used to put people on the defensive

46:38.800 --> 46:44.640
right because you know they know very well for example if you accuse someone of being a racist

46:44.640 --> 46:50.480
in the early 21st century right the person's reaction is going to be you know immediately

46:50.480 --> 46:56.400
defensive what me i'm not a racist and then they start doing some self-examination here

46:57.440 --> 47:01.840
but then you immediately put that person on the defensive and disoriented that person and then

47:01.840 --> 47:07.600
that puts you in an advantageous position for how the how the argument is going to go or how the

47:07.600 --> 47:15.840
proceedings are are going to go so you know each of these has a story but how racism sexism privilege

47:15.840 --> 47:23.120
and structural in structural racism are used right now there is a a worked out academic literature

47:23.120 --> 47:29.920
over the last now two generations and so these do come to be terms of art and it is part of a

47:29.920 --> 47:36.240
strategy about how to use these words to advance certain rhetorical goals and those are in the

47:36.240 --> 47:44.560
context of a certain kind of broader ideological goal as well so i don't know if we want to drill

47:44.560 --> 47:50.720
down into those more specifically you know maybe structural racism would be a good one to examine

47:50.720 --> 47:58.720
or the concept of privilege but i will follow your lead on that well the way you explained how it

47:58.720 --> 48:04.480
puts people on the back foot puts them on the defensive hmm i'm wondering whether some of the

48:05.200 --> 48:11.280
the key words that many people have noticed in contemporary culture words like diversity for

48:11.280 --> 48:19.200
example or inclusion or equity some of those just sound attractive and it seems like they can work

48:19.200 --> 48:27.920
like a trojan horse so they're a way of sneaking in almost by stealth some prior or fundamental

48:27.920 --> 48:33.840
assumed concepts that not everyone has really thought about deeply and yet those words get them

48:33.840 --> 48:40.000
in and that's a new vantage point to attack from do you think that's exactly right exactly right

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
for sure in some cases these are you know technical terms of art and there's a whole package of

48:46.000 --> 48:51.360
associated beliefs and assumptions that are that are built into it and the the people who are

48:51.360 --> 48:57.920
coining these terms that's what academics do in their areas of expertise they always are choosing

48:57.920 --> 49:03.680
words carefully you know because and part of it is if you're trained in rhetoric you know

49:04.320 --> 49:09.120
you sometimes can't nakedly state what your position is about you have to come up with an

49:09.120 --> 49:15.680
attractive label and at the same time you know that many of the labels that are out there and are

49:15.680 --> 49:22.160
popular or have cachet in the culture are coming from a different philosophical tradition and

49:22.160 --> 49:27.680
you want to get those ones taken off the table so to speak and one way of doing that is by

49:28.480 --> 49:34.800
hollowing them out and one way that typically happens is you know here's here's a word that's

49:34.800 --> 49:41.360
now has a current understanding and then you will just add an adjective to that and then that adjective

49:41.360 --> 49:45.600
brings with it a certain number of assumptions and it sounds like you're just engaging in the debate

49:45.600 --> 49:50.880
but over time the adjectives assumptions comes to dominate and this part gets hollowed out so I

49:50.880 --> 49:58.000
think structural racism is a very good example of that or the concept of privilege as it is used now

49:58.080 --> 50:05.360
the concept of diversity which has a genuine meaning equity is a another new kid on the block

50:05.360 --> 50:12.080
those are all very good examples of exactly that strategy and we find strangely as well that

50:12.640 --> 50:19.200
these words end up in practice meaning almost the opposite of the kind of untutored reading of

50:19.200 --> 50:25.520
them so diversity ends up being no we don't do diversity of thought it's very much a monoculture

50:26.080 --> 50:32.560
that's right that's right so the standard liberal arts ideal embraces diversity because it

50:32.560 --> 50:37.440
understands from the get-go that individuals are individuals you know partly it's that we

50:37.440 --> 50:43.440
are different in many respects as individuals so we have to be respectful of individual diversity

50:43.440 --> 50:48.640
but also the world is very complicated and there's a lot of things we don't know yet

50:48.640 --> 50:54.000
so built into the liberal education model is that people are going to come up with

50:54.000 --> 51:00.560
diverse interpretations of the world as they are working them out and so we need to respect

51:00.560 --> 51:07.680
and in some cases tolerate a lot of diversity of individuality and a lot of diversity of opinion

51:07.680 --> 51:13.840
and so that is a beautiful concept and that is the established concept but then if you come along

51:13.840 --> 51:19.040
and you have a very different philosophical agenda that is one of the concepts that you need to

51:19.040 --> 51:24.720
hollow out and replace with a different understanding of diversity and that's what has been happening

51:24.720 --> 51:32.720
over the last two centuries the two generations yeah I'm wondering whether based on what

51:32.720 --> 51:39.440
some concerned teachers have been expressing to me privately have we seen a hollowing out of the

51:39.440 --> 51:45.840
term education itself some people are starting to feel like there are institutions increasingly

51:45.840 --> 51:52.400
which on the face of it aim at education but really are aiming at some form of indoctrination

51:52.960 --> 52:02.560
yes no that that's exactly right so we're having a huge philosophical ideological battle over

52:03.280 --> 52:10.240
over what education should be and to a large extent it's also a politicized battle

52:10.880 --> 52:18.640
not only because government funding of education is a significant part of the story in the modern

52:18.640 --> 52:25.040
world so yeah so we do as teachers and as parents and I would say parents are going to become

52:25.600 --> 52:32.640
increasingly important in this generation because you know for a century or so we have as parents

52:32.640 --> 52:38.320
been able to assume that education is a certain thing and that there are people who are experts

52:38.400 --> 52:43.040
in that they are benevolent and we can you know turn our kids over to them and give them

52:44.080 --> 52:50.000
hundreds of thousands of pounds to to do something significant with my my children and now parents

52:50.000 --> 52:55.680
I think are are properly realizing no I need to do some rethinking about about what's going on here

52:55.680 --> 53:02.800
so what what is education and I think the the word you use indoctrination is the right word to

53:02.800 --> 53:11.840
contrast it to so indoctrination used to have a bad label because the idea there is there is a

53:11.840 --> 53:20.880
doctrine a doctrine and it is set it is known and the people in charge of of education they know

53:20.880 --> 53:28.400
what it is and as the word means literally you take the doctrine and you put it in the students

53:28.400 --> 53:36.400
and the students are conceived of as being more passive they they absorb it they don't question

53:36.400 --> 53:41.840
it and then they regurgitate it in the approved kinds of forms now that model of education of

53:41.840 --> 53:48.160
course it's it's ancient but it does seem that it's coming back in a new form in in our in our

53:48.160 --> 53:54.560
current generation it's for all of the reasons that that we've we've been talking about you know

53:54.560 --> 54:01.760
is there such a thing as a doctrine that I believe and I'm committed to no matter what

54:01.760 --> 54:07.200
an important thing for me as a teacher is that this gets into the students heads and I will use

54:07.200 --> 54:13.120
any tactics or any techniques to make sure that that one doctrine gets in their heads to the extent

54:13.120 --> 54:20.400
that you go down that road and all of us in the privacy of our own minds as as teachers we make

54:20.400 --> 54:25.680
this strategic choice but I think to the extent that any individual teacher goes down that road

54:25.680 --> 54:34.240
they are profoundly irresponsible they should not go into education and I think to the extent

54:34.240 --> 54:40.400
that those of us who are fellow teachers parents in any sort of position of power on school boards

54:40.400 --> 54:49.600
and so forth have as part of our moral responsibility not to let indoctrinators become teachers in the

54:49.600 --> 54:55.120
first place of course there's a trial period if we're going to give them tenure at some point

54:56.240 --> 55:03.040
not give them them tenure it's a total ultimate sabotage of of education I think what you've

55:03.040 --> 55:11.440
described there about the threats of growing indoctrination in education rings true for many

55:11.440 --> 55:16.640
people working in schools and universities seeing this happening around them but they aren't sure

55:16.720 --> 55:22.080
what to do about it what would your advice be for people wanting to resist it it's a very

55:22.080 --> 55:28.640
difficult question because people don't want to end up in my position for example sacked over

55:28.640 --> 55:32.720
what many people regard as a free speech issue even though there might be many people

55:33.680 --> 55:37.040
want to speak out they're not sure what an effective way to do it is

55:37.920 --> 55:50.080
Yeah well I would say the first thing is be confident in yourself realize that you are a good person

55:50.640 --> 55:57.520
you are a reasonable person and I think anybody who is committed to being a parent anybody

55:58.960 --> 56:04.800
in our generation as a young person has decided they want to become a teacher I think the default

56:04.800 --> 56:12.720
position in in vast majority of cases is because you are a good person you know what it is to be

56:12.720 --> 56:17.360
a racist maybe not you know you don't have all of the history and all of the psychology what

56:17.360 --> 56:27.520
sexism is what what unfairness is so trust your own judgment on all of those issues and of course

56:27.520 --> 56:34.640
we're lifelong learners all of those cliches and so on but don't let anybody who wants to sabotage

56:34.720 --> 56:43.760
your sense of your moral worth and your competence as a rational adult have any space in your in

56:43.760 --> 56:49.920
your psyche at all when you recognize that you're dealing with a person like that recognize

56:49.920 --> 56:55.840
a need or if something smells wrong here and that the problem is with the other person and then

56:55.840 --> 57:01.040
of course be benevolent be civil to the extent that you think you're dealing with this kind of

57:01.120 --> 57:06.400
person but don't let them get under your skin I think that's the the most important thing I think

57:06.400 --> 57:12.400
the second thing is to recognize and realize that you are more powerful than you think

57:14.160 --> 57:21.200
as soon as your peers and your students your peers as teachers your peers in the broader

57:21.200 --> 57:26.960
education community yeah we're all very good at sizing each other up are you a decent person are

57:26.960 --> 57:33.280
you a smart person are you passionate about your your field are you a fair-minded person and so on

57:34.720 --> 57:41.120
your reputation will give you more power than you think even in the case where this this should

57:41.120 --> 57:46.240
happen in education that we have disagreements about all kinds of important things political

57:46.240 --> 57:53.600
religious social right and so forth that as long as people know that you are a decent smart well

57:53.680 --> 58:00.720
meaning person they will cut you a lot of slack and even if they're one of the quieter ones who's

58:00.720 --> 58:06.240
not or are not as much interested in speaking up and so forth to the extent that you speak up

58:06.240 --> 58:11.440
you are you're putting forth reasonable positions you're listening to the opposition you're responding

58:11.440 --> 58:17.760
and so forth you will have more influence than you think you might otherwise you might otherwise

58:17.760 --> 58:24.480
have so that's partly a point about self-confidence but it's also of course a point about courage

58:25.840 --> 58:30.960
and we all know that we want to particularly if we are decent people we want to get along

58:30.960 --> 58:37.040
with people we want to to build the win-win relationships and so it is a little bit unsettling

58:37.040 --> 58:42.800
to be attacked and to realize that at some point we do have to stand up on principle and fight for

58:43.040 --> 58:49.040
our values so the virtue of courage that the philosophers at least all the good philosophers

58:49.040 --> 58:55.360
have returned to generation after generation is an important one important one to attend to

58:55.360 --> 59:02.640
that's necessarily mean to go on you know martyr yourself right right off the bat you have to choose

59:02.640 --> 59:10.080
your battles carefully but ultimately we all do need to work on our courage as well and to be

59:10.640 --> 59:16.400
willing to fight for our important values particularly in our profession's educational

59:16.400 --> 59:23.440
values all of our careers it's it's part of the job yeah I think that's absolutely key and

59:24.160 --> 59:32.000
sometimes courage or fortitude is more important than prudence and it's the the primary virtue

59:32.000 --> 59:38.240
for that reason I think people underestimate what impact one person displaying it can have

59:38.320 --> 59:44.400
there's a knock on effect it's a little bit like if you look at the nature documentaries if the whole

59:44.400 --> 59:52.160
herd turns on a predator all at once then that's it the the wolf won't chase the bison but if they

59:52.160 --> 59:58.240
all flee suddenly the wolf is emboldened so you need people to stand together and sometimes it takes

59:58.240 --> 01:00:05.440
one or two to be able to get a turn of face and I don't think appeasement exactly right compromise

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.320
it's likely to work in many cases because of the nature of the ideology you're dealing with

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:16.480
we're all familiar with the example of a tank man in Tiananmen Square exactly the the arresting

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.200
image of uh uh I think it was Boris Yeltsin in uh Redscary jumping on top of the the tank you

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.920
know both involving tanks but that one individual willing to stand up and they I'm drawing a line

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.440
here that does embolden huge numbers of other people in this and is very inspiring some of

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:42.480
what we've been saying so far is broadly pessimistic in that we've been looking at problems do you

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:49.600
think that there might be some causes for hope on the horizon some solutions oh yeah absolutely yes

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:56.400
we've been uh diagnosing diagnosing some very negative friends uh for for much of this this

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.240
discussion here but I am ultimately optimistic about this I do think it's going to be ugly

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.400
and to some extent brutal for the next five years to 10 years I'm not going to do too much

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.760
crystal ball gazing because we're in the midst of the the battle right now but what I'm optimistic

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:21.040
about is uh is several things one is uh 10 years ago or 15 years ago very few people realized

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.400
that they had a battle on their hands largely the the groundwork was being laid for a lot of

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:32.800
these movements but now everybody around the world knows there's a battle they know what the issues

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:39.760
are and people are getting up to speed on them on them very quickly and to uh to a large extent

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.880
you know it's true about sunlight being the best disinfectant to a large extent these pathological

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.920
movements have been able to do their work in the dark without people realizing but now that we are

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.320
aware shining the light on them they are a lot of them in defensive mode they have fairly radical

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.640
ambitions but now they're backpedaling and say oh no no we're saying is this that and the other thing

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:12.320
and that's a a sign that's a good sign I do think technologically there's a lot to be optimistic

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.760
about uh I'm a great believer in the power of the internet of course there's a huge amount of

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.920
crap out there but young people especially who are much more uh have much more facility right

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.800
with these devices and to the extent that they recognize they are getting crap in their formal

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:35.040
schooling uh there's still young people and they go off and they've got a huge amount of awesome

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.360
wonderful beautiful stuff at low cost available to them and the more intellectually curious of

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:48.560
them are going to go off and do so and then of course uh the all of the new technologies

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.880
really are bringing the cost of education down enormously that's it's amazing the the reduction

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.240
in the cost of of educational materials and educational delivery systems and they're also

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:06.000
enabling uh all sorts of people who have some entrepreneurial ambitions but are thinking in

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.080
education to do all sorts of experimenting with alternative uh mod models of education and so

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.640
on so uh the fact that things have gone downhill so badly and so much of the formal education

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.480
system is spawning a kind of entrepreneurial revolution early stages but I'm I'm optimistic

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.880
about that the main thing though I'm optimistic about though is uh uh it's more philosophical you

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.840
human beings are are human beings and uh particularly young people when I think it is

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:45.280
natural for young people to be energetic and ambitious and wants to do something significant

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.800
and meaningful with their with their lives I think that's built into to human conditions and I think

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:58.720
it takes a lot to sabotage that uh uh and and to undercut it and I think a lot of times uh human

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.920
beings young human beings they've already got good resources psychologically and physically and

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.360
and hopefully a social support network when they are experiencing the negativity they know how to

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.960
shut it out they know how to develop their own resources and look elsewhere for for healthy

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.200
healthy developments and I do you know you're speaking from a British context I'm from a

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:26.320
North American context you know here we live in extraordinarily rich societies with so many

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.720
opportunities out there so many resources available to us but I think the the next generation of

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.400
younger people come up they will be affected by the negative trends but that's that's sad but at

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.880
the same time they do need to learn about them and be aware of them but they will become better

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.960
armed and they will have the energy and the resources available to go off and do awesome stuff so

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:55.520
ultimately I'm I'm I'm excited about the future yeah I think lots of people share that excitement

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:03.280
and it it might not be going too far to say that the internet could have perhaps an even

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.240
greater impact on education than the invention of the printing press did I hope we see something

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.880
coming from that I think your your excitement about the internet's potential is definitely well

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:23.760
placed great yeah good good and thanks for giving such detailed answers to the questions I think

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.280
taken together those will provide many people with some important clarity about these topics

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:36.080
that concern so many where can people find out more about you and your work well I do have a

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:44.160
personal slash professional website it's just stevenhicks.org and then you know my commentaries

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.960
on various things short and long and then my publications and so on typically end up there

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.080
at some point so I would recommend that as as a starting point but let me also say to you thank

01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:01.040
you for for being an example of integrity your name is now right known around the world for

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:07.440
for your your commitment to education and not being willing to back down so I'm glad to know

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:14.080
you and thank you for inviting me onto your show it's been a pleasure and you're welcome I've got

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.400
no regrets because as I said in an interview I felt that the career had vanished before my eyes

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.000
while I was doing it and for me it's fundamentally about integrity and what kind of institutions

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.120
we leave to future generations yeah well said thank you very much it's been a pleasure to speak with

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.160
you all right for me too thanks
