{"text": " 10 years ago or 15 years ago, very few people realized that they had a battle on their hands. Largely the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these movements, but now everybody around the world knows there's a battle, they know what the issues are and people are getting up to speed on them very quickly. Today I'm joined by Professor Stephen Hicks and very grateful to him for taking the time to answer some questions in the hope of answering exactly what it is that is happening in schools and universities and other educational institutions around the world. I think what happened to me where presenting ideas for debate was deemed to be gross misconduct and a sackable offense is something that has been taking place a little bit more commonly in the US. So I'm hoping Professor Hicks can provide some insights about that, but first could you just tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered your passion for philosophy please? I'm a Canadian by birth, born and raised. I didn't come to the US until starting graduate school. And philosophy came to be a bit late in life. I was not really serious about becoming a philosophy professor until well into my 20s. I actually thought I was going to become a civil engineer and architect and go into the real estate business with my dad. But I always had been a reader. My parents were both readers and I loved reading kind of all kinds of books, whatever I came across, whatever was on my parents' shelves. And then a couple things happened when I started university. I took a course from a very dynamic political science professor, but he was very much engaged with the great thinkers, John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche and Thomas Hobbes and so forth. And this was my first really systematic engagement with these great minds and sort of things that in my semi-adolescent way I'd thought about, but nothing systematically. So I was largely blown away by what I was reading and thinking about and the idea that you can think about those issues in a fundamental way. And realizing that what I was most interested, even though this was of course in the politics department, was the underlying philosophical issues about knowledge, about human nature, about how we decide what the good life is that we are perhaps organizing all of our society in terms of. So that was going on at the same time independently of reading Locke and Nietzsche. And I was also reading Ein Rand and Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. So it was an awesome first year of university for me. Yeah, it sounds fantastic. And was there any particular book or idea that really seized you that you can recall? I think it was, this might sound boring, but more methodological, you know, the idea that you could think all the way down on these issues. And in a partly in a structured way, saying there's, if you take this as an assumption, well, you're, you're, you're depending on this, that depends on this. But at the same time, that is being challenged by this position and this position. So you need to consider all of them, make up your mind here. And then if you accept this one, then this follows and that follows. So that was a, you know, I don't want to sound too hippie at this point, but that was mind blowing expansion, this thing for me at that time. Yeah, I like the way you frame that as being very much a conversation or dialogue between different voices. And what was exciting about education is being given an opportunity to join that great conversation across centuries and new, new vistas sort of opening up that you'd been dimly aware of, but now you saw the extent of them. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And to my, my professor's credit, his name was Fred Vaughn. By the end of this course, I had no idea what his particular views on any of these, these issues were. So we talked about safe spaces. I had entirely the sense that I could safely explore any view and voice any opinion and my essays for that course, try out any ideas that I was, was working through. So that was wonderful. Interesting. I think that sadly is what many people feel is being increasingly lost in the educational world now. I know you take the view that ultimately all discussions about what education is and what its aims are are fundamentally philosophical ones. Could you go into a bit more detail about that? So why is it that philosophy underlies education? Yeah, well, I know when we are professional teachers, for example, you know, we have our particular passion, our particular specialization, and we want the students to come to be more knowledgeable and more skillful and hopefully passionate about, about our area of expertise. But if you think about any of the expertises that we want to make a place for in the curriculum, they're always put in the curriculum by reference to some conception of what the product of education should be or what the goal of education should be. So if we're going to put mathematics in the curriculum, it's because we say, well, you're going to need this later in life, or if we're going to put the arts in the curriculum, it's because we say, well, all your life, there's this great universe of artistic product for you to explore, enrich your life, or maybe you will yourself become a, so we're always thinking longer term about what the child will grow up to be as a full adult. But then when we start saying that conception or thinking about that conception explicitly, what is it to be a full human adult? And then immediately we have to become very philosophical, right? So we're saying, you know, what, what capacities needs to be developed? What are our genuine, mature needs? What things really are worth pursuing? And what things really are not that important? And how is it all going to fit together so that by the time the child leaves our educational institution, and we're saying, you know, you were on your own, go out and live your life, we have some conception of what kind of a life we are we're preparing that for. So, you know, if you think about all of the great battles we have in education, sometimes it's a matter of turf war, you know, are we going to put this in the curriculum or not? And oftentimes that means to make room, we have to take something out in order to put something else in, we have to make a value judgment about what really is going to serve the student well in the long term. So, you know, in business courses at the high school level, there's, you know, teaching about bookkeeping and finance and marketing and management and so on. Well, should we add a course in entrepreneurship? And there, what we have to do is really make the case that students need to learn how to be entrepreneurial in their life. And it's a different conception of preparing students for, say, a business career of just, you know, someone will give you a job and you will show up and they will tell you what to do. The entrepreneurial way of thinking is a different philosophical mindset, right? Or, yeah, if we're going to say, should we teach Latin, right, or Greek on the curriculum? Or should we substitute a modern language? Then what we're going to say is, well, you know, there's, in many cases, a philosophical difference there. One side wants to say we are inheritors of this great tradition, and students need to know that great tradition, absorb it and pass it on to the next generation. Another side wants to say, well, we're not so sure that those old traditions are all that great, so to speak, but the more important thing is students live in the real world now. It's a global cosmopolitan world, and for that they need to multiple languages and so on. So again, we're thinking very philosophically differently about what kind of life we're preparing students for. Yeah, the way you've put it there, you can see it ultimately depends on some of the biggest philosophical questions there are. What is a human being? What is the good life for a human being? The relationship between the individual and the state? All these things factor into some of those big educational questions. Exactly right. Yes, that's right. And then some of the people who've been most impactful on education just in the last century or so, John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Paulo Freire and so on, all of them have deep philosophical frameworks that they are working within, and then they're coming along and saying, we need to revolutionize education based explicitly on that new philosophical framework. So you mentioned some key thinkers in education there. Which philosophical battles would you say have had the longest lasting or biggest impact on educational thinking? Yeah, that's a big question because we've been thinking explicitly about education for millennia. So I'm going to cheat just a little bit and say, just say in the last 600 years or so as we get into the modern world, and this is a debate that still is with us in our generation, but I would say it's a twofold debate between some kind of more religious paternalistic model of education and a more naturalistic and independence generating model of education. So if we think of now our standard, but the one that's now being beleaguered, standard model, nonetheless for the last couple of hundred years of liberal education. So the idea is students need to have a broad base of knowledge. They need to be able to operationalize that knowledge in terms of skills. It's not just abstract theory. And all of those things are very complicated. And so students need to be aware of all of the issues and all of the major positions that are rivals in there. And they need to be able themselves to think and enter into the debate as participants. And the idea is that there's still a huge amount that we need to learn and figure out the universe is more open ended. So students need to have a fairly strong mind, many of them to be active discoverers of new knowledge or active creators of new things. So that's kind of an idealized understanding of the liberal arts model. And so we are training free minds. So we're going to free us from ignorance, free us from superstition, and free us from all of the self doubts that we can actually go forth and make our own lives and our society's better places. So then that is to say education is precisely about training students how to do all of that. So we're going to have passionate experts in a lot of different areas. Those experts will engagingly present all of the major theories, invite students to learn about them. But at the end of the day, it's going to be that the student has to internalize it and then find some way to demonstrate his or her best understanding of it. And then the person is coached and so forth along that direction. Now that has been for the most part to your big picture question for centuries. Its main contender has been a model that says liberal is not the right part of education. Instead, education needs to be much more paternalistic and or on that sliding scale even more authoritarian. And so rather than an active minded students, students are expected to be more passive. They are receivers of inherited wisdom. And there are authority figures who have basically figured out or had revealed to them all of the important answers to life's questions. They are known, they are settled, and it's a top down transition. And so you don't challenge who are you to challenge as a young person, the great minds of minds of the past. In some cases overstating this, this is on a sliding scale. But nonetheless, we have a traditional curriculum that's not going to change over time. And it's going to be delivered in a hopefully benevolent paternalistic fashion. But then depending on how pessimistic you are about students aptitude for learning, you might need to use some more authoritarian methods. So that has been the great battle in the modern world. And in historians label, that's sort of modern liberal education versus pre-modern or hardcore traditionalist pre-modern education. And do you think that that is fundamentally the most important battle over education today? Or do you think that it has shifted slightly? Some of what you described there sounded as if we might be seeing a return to a more authoritarian model of education, but a very different perspective. No longer a authority rooted in religious education traditions, but that's very much secular, but has the same fundamental vantage point. So I expect you to come into class and hear some things which ultimately I want you to believe because they are correct and they shouldn't be challenged. Yes, no, absolutely. That's right. On my reading of the big ideas, it's almost always a three-way debate on all of the fundamentals. So yes, to say either we're going to be more supernaturalist and religious in our understanding of the way the world works, or we're going to be more secular and naturalistic, that's two positions. And they are those are huge ones, but there's a third position that is a skeptical position that says the nature of reality. We don't know what that is. It's impossible to know. There is no such thing as an objective God and a supernatural reality or an objective natural reality. Instead, everything is some sort of subjective creation and ultimately I or we make up our own reality. So that's a three-way debate. Just on the cognition issues that become very fundamental to education, one side traditionally has wanted to say there is such a thing as truth. Typically, it's truth with a capital T. It's in a higher dimension. And what we need to do is find some way of accessing that higher dimension. Sometimes it will reveal itself to us through revelation or some special individuals will have a mystical insight and or people who don't get those mystical insights or revelations, they will need to have faith. And so there's been one traditional on the model of knowledge that then gets applied in education circles that says it's a matter of revelation, training people for mystical insight and or expecting them to have faith. And so then you will base your model of education on that. In contrast to that, there's another position that says no, no, objective knowledge is possible, but knowledge is of reality and reality is the natural world, which is cause and effect. So we need to train our senses to observe it very carefully and then to use our reason to categorize things and try out hypotheses and then develop all the formal tools of scientific method. So we can get objective knowledge of reality, but by not by faith and revelation, but rather by doing kind of hard, empirical and rational work. Now, the third position though, comes along and says, well, look, both of you guys are saying that there's a reality out there that can be known and that there are ultimately truths, but we're skeptical. We don't think there is any such thing as knowledge. We think mystical insight, that's just a matter of wishful thinking, right? Faith is just dogmatic, following the leader and not thinking for yourself. But at the same time, we think the senses are illusory. We think logic is just made up word games, right? Math has no connection to actual reality. And so nobody really knows anything. We all just have various sorts of subjective preferences that have been instilled in us. And so we're skeptical, we're relativistic and so on. So again, we have a three-way debate. So to come back to the first part of that, it is that third position. Philosophically, we have been at a very skeptical place for the last century or so. The collapse of positivism, the rise of existentialism, and any number of other movements that have become household names, all of them are very skeptical at their core. And as a result of that, they doubt that there is such a thing as truth, such a thing as knowledge, facts, and that we're in some sense trapped in a kind of subjectivity. Now, that then could go in a couple of directions. One then is to say, well, you know, if nobody really knows anything, then we should all just be very tolerant and let everybody do their own thing and believe whatever, because nobody is in a position to say that I'm better and you're worse on whatever the issue is. But the way it more often comes out is that it's very hard for people to live that way, saying I don't know anything, nobody knows anything, and we're all just going to go off and do our own things, because people want their lives to be meaningful. And typically they want to be committed to something. And typically they have a social value framework and in many cases a political framework that they want everybody to live in terms of. So what they will then typically do is adopt what you're referring to as a new kind of authoritarianism. If it is the case that nobody knows anything, there's no such thing as a true reality out there. It's all just subjective value beliefs and the things that have been conditioned into us. Well, I might as well just plunge into the fray, right? I might as well just say, here's what I happen to believe. This is what seems significant and meaningful to me, and I'm not going to claim that it's true or that it's objective. And I very well recognize that there are lots of other frameworks out there, but really we're just a bunch of people with our own subjective frameworks in competition with each other to see who's going to prevail. And I just want my viewpoint to prevail. And so I'm going to use any techniques, including authoritarian techniques, if it's going to enable my view to prevail. So you can get an authoritarianism out of that kind of skepticism as well. You mentioned Nietzsche as one of the thinkers who was influential for you as a young man just starting formal education and experiencing your passion for philosophy for the first time. And the idea that there are no facts, only interpretations is one which some historians of philosophy trace to Nietzsche. Much of what you're describing there sounds like it's influenced by that idea. And Nietzsche has been called the kind of grandfather of postmodernism. If we're left with just the interpretations and it's just power narratives, is what you're suggesting that people just want to claim power for their own narrative? Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And you're right to cite Nietzsche. I'm not a Nietzschean. I learned a lot from Nietzsche, but I think he is the most influential philosopher for the last century or so. And in some ways the dates are perfect because he died in 1900 and basically the 20th century intellectually was largely a Nietzschean century. So the philosophers whom the current social justice warriors, the wokists, the advocates of political correct authoritarianism and so on. So they are the children or the grandchildren. They will go back and be citing figures like Michel Foucault. They might not have read him at this point, but Foucault cites Nietzsche as a formative influence. Or it might be Heidegger, another giant of 20th century philosophy. Martin Heidegger is largely influenced by Nietzsche as well. So that grandfather, father, grandchild narrative that works as well. So Nietzsche is a very fundamentally subjectivist philosopher with respect to knowledge. He's standing at the end of a long tradition of skeptical philosophy and he comes to believe on all of the major issues about perception, about our forming of abstractions, about our memories, about our ability to do grammar and linguistics and to form scientific theories and narrations and so on. All of that is driven by skeptical arguments that have hollowed out any positive account of those. So we're just left with subjectivism. And then there's a kind of relativism that comes out of that. So then Nietzsche, though, is also first generation thinkers to grapple seriously with evolutionary ideas. And partly this means that you don't see reality as fixed for all time in terms of one stable framework, that reality itself, including humans as organisms are evolving. And so what's, you know, good for this organism at this time is going to be different from what's good for that kind of organism later. And so you have the idea that the rules of the game are evolving over time instead of fixed absolute truths as well. But you also get this idea that, well, look, if there's no such thing as truth, there's no such thing as your rationality is figuring out objectively what the facts of the situation are. If it's all subjective, and this evolving struggle and rivalry, then you do start to start using language like power a different way. So then it is just a power struggle between the strong and the weak. And the strong have their narrative and their subjective preferences and the weak have theirs. And it's not going to be decided by truth and decency and universal rights, because we don't believe in those anymore. It's just going to be a naked power struggle. So there a very adversarial understanding of power comes out of that. And Nietzsche is one of the most clear sighted on that issue. And then the 20th century is largely, largely inheriting that. Now, by contrast to that, and this is going to be closer to my own views. So power is an important word. But so what do we mean by power? And there's a much more optimistic benevolent understanding of power that is that is that is possible. Power is the capacity to get stuff done. You're more powerful to the extent that you have the knowledge and the skills and other kinds of resources to be able to accomplish stuff in the world. And so knowledge comes in a lot of different forms of intellectual power. So here we think about Francis Bacon, knowledge is power. And this then ties us back to education. So here we think about power as a good thing. We want to empower our students to build up their cognitive power and their physical power and their character power so that they can go forth and do good things in the world. And if you cooble that with a more benevolent understanding of human beings, that human beings are competent at acquiring knowledge, they are competent at working out socially and mutually beneficial ways of living together as friends, as romantic partners, starting family, starting businesses, even doing politics. Politics, of course, is about power, but we're going to do it in a democratic and republican way that respects every individual's own power and their own agency, right, and so forth. So here we have the idea that power is very important and we want more and more power. But we think that that power, of course, it can be abused, but human beings can work out ways of using power benevolently. So that understanding of power, though, has philosophical opposition to those who say, no, human beings are much more irrational, much more impotent with respect to cognitive matters, much more subjective and animalistic with respect to the formation of their values. And so power becomes a much darker thing. So that battle over power is also part of what we are engaged in right now. I think that's certainly the case and what people often first think of when they think of power is hierarchy and therefore things no longer being equal. And I think this idea of power and different power centers struggling to get the most power for themselves is interpreted by many people as relating to the Marxist concept of oppression and struggle between different classes. And do you think that the division of the world that Nietzsche puts forward as struggling power centers is deeply related to Marxist concept of struggle, or have the two become intertwined in the way that some thinkers have related the two of them? I think they are variations on a fundamental theme. Both of them do have this idea of power completely dissociated from truth, knowledge, and values. So it's not the idea that we can figure out what the truth is and that we can figure out what's good in the world and then respect that all individuals have the capacity for learning the truth and that all individuals have certain core value statuses that we call that we call rights. So what we then will think is that we want those kinds of people to have power, but it's in the service of discovering more truth and advancing their rights and advancing genuine good in the world. If you reverse that, if you then say, no, really in the first place, it's just power and all of these so-called truths and all these so-called values are just subjective and variable across human beings, then what you're going to find is your truth is in the service of power rather than power in the service of actual truth and so that fundamental reversal is there. Now, to get to Marx and Nietzsche, what both of them do is start off with a very skeptical, subjectivist understanding of the world and an adversarial understanding of human beings. So for them, the difference between strong and weak centers of power, that is the fundamental and on the basis of that, it really just is a question of where your sympathies are. So for Marx, he's going to divide them into bourgeoisie and proletariat or those who own property and those who economically sell their labor to those who have property. So you have these two different classes and then you make them adversarial to each other. And so on the basis of that, it's just a matter of are these guys power going to prevail in this rivalry or are these guys power going to prevail in the rivalry? And in the case of Marx, his sympathies are just with the weaker currently in the power struggle. But Nietzsche is going to give a very similar analysis. He's going to say, not economically but rather biologically and psychobiologically, there are different centers of power. Some of us are more predator-like, some of us are more prey-like, some of us are stronger, some of us are weaker. And we are in adversarial relations to each other. But in the case of Nietzsche, it's just that his sympathies are with the stronger, the more predatory light. So he's going to say, no, these people over here are kind of pathetic. They're not the ones that are going to advance the human species. So I'm going to go for them. So the Marxists are in favor of the weak against the strong. The Nietzscheans are in favor of the strong against the weak. But both of them are agreeing fundamentally that it's an adversarial you versus me power struggle. And there are no such things as universal rights, universal goodness or objective truths. I think there's a lot of depth to that. And one thought that I had about it is that if the Marxist sympathies are with the weak, would it also be true to say that in order to equalize things, they themselves need to be in a position of power? Yes, for sure. It's going to be the more Nietzschean position that says the inequalities are natural, perhaps biologically driven. It's going to be the Marxist position that all inequalities are artificial and driven primarily by social circumstances and so on. But then yes, so the Nietzscheans then are going to say, you know, we have no problem with dramatic inequalities across every single dimension, because it's going to be the high fliers. They're the ones who are going to advance the human species. Whereas the Marxists want to level everything on the ground, it's going to be through some sort of collectivity of equal human beings that we're going to advance the human species. So yes, for both of them, the most fundamental debate is this social power equality dimension. And so that makes them both going much more, I think, in the postmodern direction. By contrast, the position I'm much more sympathetic than neither Marxist nor nor Nietzschean is that equality is an important concept, but it's an equality at a slightly abstract level. We are all equally human beings in the sense that we have our own lives, we have our own cognitive capacities. And the important thing is that each of us is free to develop our own capacities to our fullest extent. And that socially we need to be left free in order to be able to do so. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And you can see the temptation from a Marxist line of thinking, if everything is due to social inequality, and it's socially constructed, then presumably it can all be reconstructed into a much more amenable version of the world. I think that's a possibility, whereas the Nietzschean perspective would be no, some of these things are built in. Yeah, absolutely. So another very fundamental issue, and we've touched briefly on it, but I think it's worth stressing at this point is who is going to be doing this restructuring. So we all say there's problems in the world, and you might be more pessimistic or more optimistic. So there's problems in the world, and we want to fix those problems. Well, then the question is, who is going to do the fixing? And what you do get out of Marxism is the idea that it has to be some sort of powerful group, the vanguard of the proletariat, who takes it and uses basically all of society's resources in order to change it. And the Nietzscheans are also going to argue that whatever improvements they're going to come from certain special individuals, and both of them are contrasted to the position that says it's the individual, all of us, who have agency in our own lives. And if you want to change your circumstance, all fundamentally it is up to you to develop your individual capacities in order to change the world in the way you want to go. And what's very important here is how both the Nietzscheans and the Marxists, the Marxists even more so. And then there are second, third generation inheritors now who deny individual agency fundamentally. They will say, this is the birth of victimhood culture. So the victim is the person who is the ultimate lack of agency. I am who I am because I've been pushed around by all of these social forces beyond my control. I have no agency. And anything that's nasty in my life is somebody else's fault. And anytime we say, well, maybe you could do something about it. Or maybe you are in part to blame for your circumstance right now. That is just swept off the table. You're blaming the victim or you're doing some other kind of sin from that particular lexicon. So this issue really does come down to that old, again, philosophical debate about volition or free will versus some sort of determinism. And another important part of this is that the Marxists and the cultural Marxists and the Neo postmodernists and so on, all of them do advocate very strongly forms of determinism. That says that really the human being is just a lump of plasticine born into a world shaped by social forces and other environmental forces beyond his control. And all you can really do if you have any measure of agency is just decide to accept where you are and then commit yourself in a non-rational way to advancing that set of interests. But of course, everybody else is doing the same thing. It does become a power struggle. Now, that deterministic view of human beings, does that shed any light on why we most often tend to see the the proclivity to cancel debate among postmodernist perspectives. So rather than answering speech with more speech and emphasizing the importance of debate, instead, what we get is no, you're not allowed to hear that perspective or that view is somehow beyond the law. Yes. Why aren't people trusted to listen and make up their own minds? Yes. No, that's a great, great question. And it goes to the heart of what liberal education should be. So the last part of your phrase that we're going to trust individuals to make up their own minds. So make up your own mind. That's an agency point. Yeah. So part of the answer is going to be we don't think individuals have agency or the middle part of it. Individuals, the postmoderns, and they don't believe in individuals. You are a social construct. You are fundamentally a part of a group that has shaped you. So the identity politics, it's actually the identity part that's the most important there. It's not really primarily about politics. It's about what is your identity. And what we find is that they are arguing is that your identity is not as an individual, or most the individual just is the thing of all of the Venn diagram constructions. You're the overlap of a whole bunch of group identities. So you are a collectivized individual. So you're a collective being that is shaped by forces rather than individuals who are going to make up their own minds. But then also if you think about debate as a formal educational device, the assumptions of debate are that here's a controversy, and we're going to acknowledge that this is a controversy, that there are at least two positions and that they're both important positions. And probably most of us don't know what position we should accept yet. So we're going to go through a certain formal process to get there. And we are going to respect advocates of both positions that are going to be there. And that we are interested in the truth, or at least the best approximation of the truth that we can get right now. So we still believe in truth. We believe in respect. We believe that there are genuine controversies. And we think that the way we should proceed is by using a formal reason. You put a position out there, you develop an argument for it. The other person then critiques that argument saying, you know, your factual basis is incorrect here, or you've made an error of logic there. So we're talking about facts and logic and argumentation. And the world is complex and we're going to be rational. And then of course, in a debate, again, we're back to where you ended in your formulation, we're going to leave it up to each member of the audience to make up his or her own mind after hopefully having carefully considered. So that whole apparatus is necessary if you're going to think that debate is a useful and important pedagogical device. But then what we find is that by the time you get to strong skepticism, strong kind of adversarial, cynical power understandings of the world, strong collective collectivity, and lack of agency, everything goes out the window. We're not rational. Logic is a myth. There are no facts. Respect for each other. You got to be kidding me. It's all just an uncivil power struggle. And so what you then do is that whatever institution you are, is you don't listen respectfully and engage the debate. Instead, you act as a member of the adversarial power struggle. You try to shut down the debate by using intimidation tactics or just physical shouting over the person or using threats and so on. So you're fundamentally opposed to everything that goes into making debate possible. And so that's why cancel culture is on the rise. I think that gets right to the heart of the matter. And it's, it's sad to hear it put succinctly like that because fundamentally what's under attack is the commitment to rationality itself. Exactly. That primary component of education. So there's just no value in debate because traditionally the value of free speech and debate has been both parties are somehow interested in working together collaboratively to struggle towards the truth together. And if that is taken away, then there's no point in it. That's right. There's no truth. There's no collaboration, right? We are in a different philosophical universe altogether. There's a really chilling line in Victor Clemperer's book on the language of the Third Reich. I'll just read this so I get it right. He said that words are like tiny doses of arsenic swallowed unnoticed and then after a while the toxic reaction sets in. I'm wondering whether we're starting to experience a toxic reaction to some words that have been in the political educational culture for some time now, but it's only now that the impact is really being felt. Do you have any thoughts on that? No, absolutely right. That weaponization of language is a very useful phrase and accurately descriptive of what's going on. And it's part of a self-conscious strategy. So if we think of concepts like racist and sexist and privilege and the structural part of structural whatever pathology we're interested, those can all be legitimate concepts, but they are all concepts that at least in my language are used as anti-concepts. That's partly a technical term of art, so let me say a little bit about that. But an anti-concept is meant to be a word or a phrase that's used to dismantle language and undercut communication and nonetheless in an adversarial concept or context rather to put your adversary in a defensive position. And so the weaponization part is absolutely right there. So here again we have to get deep. So what's the purpose of language? What is language about? And partly the standard modern view has been that language is a tool of cognition. We have a big brain, we can form abstractions and concepts and then start developing complex propositions and putting them together in narratives and theories and so on. But ultimately we use language as rational animals to figure out and carry around a map or a representation or a set of theories of the world in our heads. So fundamentally language is a tool of cognition. But of course a lot of that we do socially, so we want to connect with each other and so language is also a tool of communication. But if we're going to communicate then we have to make sure that you're using words in the same way that I'm using words and so definition and concept formation and all of that exercise that we go through sometimes frustrating to make sure we're on the same page. That's very important because we are interested in communication as a form of collaboration. Now of course sometimes we are in an adversarial situations and so we're also going to use language as rhetorical weapons in that particular. But that's hopefully a last resort and that's really a sign that something has gone terribly wrong because fundamentally language should be about helping us understand the world and communicate with each other. So the weaponization of language though as a prevailing tactic as your first course, you start off with an insult, you start off with an accusation, you start trying to get inside the person's head to put them on the defensive that is coming out of an ideological strategy that says no we don't cognize the world and life is not about social communication. It is a dog eat dog war and language is just one tool in that war but the kind of tool you need in that war is weapons and so you become very good at using language as a weapon in whatever social where you're going. So racism for example that's a very important concept in the modern world and we all need to think about what it means or what are the psychological and the social underpinnings of it to what extent are the person's intent and their knowledge and their commitments and their values and so forth are organized and the same thing for sexism and so on. So all of these concepts do need careful understanding and careful definition and at the same time we should recognize that particularly now that we are well into the modern world we're believers in rights and human dignity and human freedom and equality under the law that racism is a pathology but we've made great progress on that and so yes there are racists out there but we really should use that word in a very targeted way and before we accuse someone of being a racist we better have done our homework and make sure that we're using this highly important concept accurately but what we of course find right now is that that's not at all what's going on right the word racism is very promiscuously applied and people have not done their homework they're just throwing it out there they've never met you they don't know anything about you in particular but that's what they that's what they lead with and in many cases you know people who are leading seminars in business they will go in and you know just throw out very gross generalities about the racial attitudes of entire groups of people and take it for granted and so on so that is very clearly a weaponization of language but racism then is being used to put people on the defensive right because you know they know very well for example if you accuse someone of being a racist in the early 21st century right the person's reaction is going to be you know immediately defensive what me i'm not a racist and then they start doing some self-examination here but then you immediately put that person on the defensive and disoriented that person and then that puts you in an advantageous position for how the how the argument is going to go or how the proceedings are are going to go so you know each of these has a story but how racism sexism privilege and structural in structural racism are used right now there is a a worked out academic literature over the last now two generations and so these do come to be terms of art and it is part of a strategy about how to use these words to advance certain rhetorical goals and those are in the context of a certain kind of broader ideological goal as well so i don't know if we want to drill down into those more specifically you know maybe structural racism would be a good one to examine or the concept of privilege but i will follow your lead on that well the way you explained how it puts people on the back foot puts them on the defensive hmm i'm wondering whether some of the the key words that many people have noticed in contemporary culture words like diversity for example or inclusion or equity some of those just sound attractive and it seems like they can work like a trojan horse so they're a way of sneaking in almost by stealth some prior or fundamental assumed concepts that not everyone has really thought about deeply and yet those words get them in and that's a new vantage point to attack from do you think that's exactly right exactly right for sure in some cases these are you know technical terms of art and there's a whole package of associated beliefs and assumptions that are that are built into it and the the people who are coining these terms that's what academics do in their areas of expertise they always are choosing words carefully you know because and part of it is if you're trained in rhetoric you know you sometimes can't nakedly state what your position is about you have to come up with an attractive label and at the same time you know that many of the labels that are out there and are popular or have cachet in the culture are coming from a different philosophical tradition and you want to get those ones taken off the table so to speak and one way of doing that is by hollowing them out and one way that typically happens is you know here's here's a word that's now has a current understanding and then you will just add an adjective to that and then that adjective brings with it a certain number of assumptions and it sounds like you're just engaging in the debate but over time the adjectives assumptions comes to dominate and this part gets hollowed out so I think structural racism is a very good example of that or the concept of privilege as it is used now the concept of diversity which has a genuine meaning equity is a another new kid on the block those are all very good examples of exactly that strategy and we find strangely as well that these words end up in practice meaning almost the opposite of the kind of untutored reading of them so diversity ends up being no we don't do diversity of thought it's very much a monoculture that's right that's right so the standard liberal arts ideal embraces diversity because it understands from the get-go that individuals are individuals you know partly it's that we are different in many respects as individuals so we have to be respectful of individual diversity but also the world is very complicated and there's a lot of things we don't know yet so built into the liberal education model is that people are going to come up with diverse interpretations of the world as they are working them out and so we need to respect and in some cases tolerate a lot of diversity of individuality and a lot of diversity of opinion and so that is a beautiful concept and that is the established concept but then if you come along and you have a very different philosophical agenda that is one of the concepts that you need to hollow out and replace with a different understanding of diversity and that's what has been happening over the last two centuries the two generations yeah I'm wondering whether based on what some concerned teachers have been expressing to me privately have we seen a hollowing out of the term education itself some people are starting to feel like there are institutions increasingly which on the face of it aim at education but really are aiming at some form of indoctrination yes no that that's exactly right so we're having a huge philosophical ideological battle over over what education should be and to a large extent it's also a politicized battle not only because government funding of education is a significant part of the story in the modern world so yeah so we do as teachers and as parents and I would say parents are going to become increasingly important in this generation because you know for a century or so we have as parents been able to assume that education is a certain thing and that there are people who are experts in that they are benevolent and we can you know turn our kids over to them and give them hundreds of thousands of pounds to to do something significant with my my children and now parents I think are are properly realizing no I need to do some rethinking about about what's going on here so what what is education and I think the the word you use indoctrination is the right word to contrast it to so indoctrination used to have a bad label because the idea there is there is a doctrine a doctrine and it is set it is known and the people in charge of of education they know what it is and as the word means literally you take the doctrine and you put it in the students and the students are conceived of as being more passive they they absorb it they don't question it and then they regurgitate it in the approved kinds of forms now that model of education of course it's it's ancient but it does seem that it's coming back in a new form in in our in our current generation it's for all of the reasons that that we've we've been talking about you know is there such a thing as a doctrine that I believe and I'm committed to no matter what an important thing for me as a teacher is that this gets into the students heads and I will use any tactics or any techniques to make sure that that one doctrine gets in their heads to the extent that you go down that road and all of us in the privacy of our own minds as as teachers we make this strategic choice but I think to the extent that any individual teacher goes down that road they are profoundly irresponsible they should not go into education and I think to the extent that those of us who are fellow teachers parents in any sort of position of power on school boards and so forth have as part of our moral responsibility not to let indoctrinators become teachers in the first place of course there's a trial period if we're going to give them tenure at some point not give them them tenure it's a total ultimate sabotage of of education I think what you've described there about the threats of growing indoctrination in education rings true for many people working in schools and universities seeing this happening around them but they aren't sure what to do about it what would your advice be for people wanting to resist it it's a very difficult question because people don't want to end up in my position for example sacked over what many people regard as a free speech issue even though there might be many people want to speak out they're not sure what an effective way to do it is Yeah well I would say the first thing is be confident in yourself realize that you are a good person you are a reasonable person and I think anybody who is committed to being a parent anybody in our generation as a young person has decided they want to become a teacher I think the default position in in vast majority of cases is because you are a good person you know what it is to be a racist maybe not you know you don't have all of the history and all of the psychology what sexism is what what unfairness is so trust your own judgment on all of those issues and of course we're lifelong learners all of those cliches and so on but don't let anybody who wants to sabotage your sense of your moral worth and your competence as a rational adult have any space in your in your psyche at all when you recognize that you're dealing with a person like that recognize a need or if something smells wrong here and that the problem is with the other person and then of course be benevolent be civil to the extent that you think you're dealing with this kind of person but don't let them get under your skin I think that's the the most important thing I think the second thing is to recognize and realize that you are more powerful than you think as soon as your peers and your students your peers as teachers your peers in the broader education community yeah we're all very good at sizing each other up are you a decent person are you a smart person are you passionate about your your field are you a fair-minded person and so on your reputation will give you more power than you think even in the case where this this should happen in education that we have disagreements about all kinds of important things political religious social right and so forth that as long as people know that you are a decent smart well meaning person they will cut you a lot of slack and even if they're one of the quieter ones who's not or are not as much interested in speaking up and so forth to the extent that you speak up you are you're putting forth reasonable positions you're listening to the opposition you're responding and so forth you will have more influence than you think you might otherwise you might otherwise have so that's partly a point about self-confidence but it's also of course a point about courage and we all know that we want to particularly if we are decent people we want to get along with people we want to to build the win-win relationships and so it is a little bit unsettling to be attacked and to realize that at some point we do have to stand up on principle and fight for our values so the virtue of courage that the philosophers at least all the good philosophers have returned to generation after generation is an important one important one to attend to that's necessarily mean to go on you know martyr yourself right right off the bat you have to choose your battles carefully but ultimately we all do need to work on our courage as well and to be willing to fight for our important values particularly in our profession's educational values all of our careers it's it's part of the job yeah I think that's absolutely key and sometimes courage or fortitude is more important than prudence and it's the the primary virtue for that reason I think people underestimate what impact one person displaying it can have there's a knock on effect it's a little bit like if you look at the nature documentaries if the whole herd turns on a predator all at once then that's it the the wolf won't chase the bison but if they all flee suddenly the wolf is emboldened so you need people to stand together and sometimes it takes one or two to be able to get a turn of face and I don't think appeasement exactly right compromise it's likely to work in many cases because of the nature of the ideology you're dealing with we're all familiar with the example of a tank man in Tiananmen Square exactly the the arresting image of uh uh I think it was Boris Yeltsin in uh Redscary jumping on top of the the tank you know both involving tanks but that one individual willing to stand up and they I'm drawing a line here that does embolden huge numbers of other people in this and is very inspiring some of what we've been saying so far is broadly pessimistic in that we've been looking at problems do you think that there might be some causes for hope on the horizon some solutions oh yeah absolutely yes we've been uh diagnosing diagnosing some very negative friends uh for for much of this this discussion here but I am ultimately optimistic about this I do think it's going to be ugly and to some extent brutal for the next five years to 10 years I'm not going to do too much crystal ball gazing because we're in the midst of the the battle right now but what I'm optimistic about is uh is several things one is uh 10 years ago or 15 years ago very few people realized that they had a battle on their hands largely the the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these movements but now everybody around the world knows there's a battle they know what the issues are and people are getting up to speed on them on them very quickly and to uh to a large extent you know it's true about sunlight being the best disinfectant to a large extent these pathological movements have been able to do their work in the dark without people realizing but now that we are aware shining the light on them they are a lot of them in defensive mode they have fairly radical ambitions but now they're backpedaling and say oh no no we're saying is this that and the other thing and that's a a sign that's a good sign I do think technologically there's a lot to be optimistic about uh I'm a great believer in the power of the internet of course there's a huge amount of crap out there but young people especially who are much more uh have much more facility right with these devices and to the extent that they recognize they are getting crap in their formal schooling uh there's still young people and they go off and they've got a huge amount of awesome wonderful beautiful stuff at low cost available to them and the more intellectually curious of them are going to go off and do so and then of course uh the all of the new technologies really are bringing the cost of education down enormously that's it's amazing the the reduction in the cost of of educational materials and educational delivery systems and they're also enabling uh all sorts of people who have some entrepreneurial ambitions but are thinking in education to do all sorts of experimenting with alternative uh mod models of education and so on so uh the fact that things have gone downhill so badly and so much of the formal education system is spawning a kind of entrepreneurial revolution early stages but I'm I'm optimistic about that the main thing though I'm optimistic about though is uh uh it's more philosophical you human beings are are human beings and uh particularly young people when I think it is natural for young people to be energetic and ambitious and wants to do something significant and meaningful with their with their lives I think that's built into to human conditions and I think it takes a lot to sabotage that uh uh and and to undercut it and I think a lot of times uh human beings young human beings they've already got good resources psychologically and physically and and hopefully a social support network when they are experiencing the negativity they know how to shut it out they know how to develop their own resources and look elsewhere for for healthy healthy developments and I do you know you're speaking from a British context I'm from a North American context you know here we live in extraordinarily rich societies with so many opportunities out there so many resources available to us but I think the the next generation of younger people come up they will be affected by the negative trends but that's that's sad but at the same time they do need to learn about them and be aware of them but they will become better armed and they will have the energy and the resources available to go off and do awesome stuff so ultimately I'm I'm I'm excited about the future yeah I think lots of people share that excitement and it it might not be going too far to say that the internet could have perhaps an even greater impact on education than the invention of the printing press did I hope we see something coming from that I think your your excitement about the internet's potential is definitely well placed great yeah good good and thanks for giving such detailed answers to the questions I think taken together those will provide many people with some important clarity about these topics that concern so many where can people find out more about you and your work well I do have a personal slash professional website it's just stevenhicks.org and then you know my commentaries on various things short and long and then my publications and so on typically end up there at some point so I would recommend that as as a starting point but let me also say to you thank you for for being an example of integrity your name is now right known around the world for for your your commitment to education and not being willing to back down so I'm glad to know you and thank you for inviting me onto your show it's been a pleasure and you're welcome I've got no regrets because as I said in an interview I felt that the career had vanished before my eyes while I was doing it and for me it's fundamentally about integrity and what kind of institutions we leave to future generations yeah well said thank you very much it's been a
