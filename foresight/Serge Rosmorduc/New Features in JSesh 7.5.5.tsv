0	6340	Hello everybody, this is Serge Rosbondrick and I am going to demonstrate a number of
6340	15720	features of jessesh 7.5.5.
15720	22760	The most powerful new feature is in fact an improvement of an existing feature.
22760	31880	This is an improvement of the search engine in jessesh.
31880	39800	When you use jessesh you can make a search in a folder in which you can define a folder
39800	48080	and you will search in jessesh files which are in this folder so I am going for example
48080	55000	to try a search in the jessesh folder itself.
55000	65160	Ok so I am searching in the jessesh folder and now you can search for instance this was
65160	77200	already possible for a sequence of glyphs say this and it will display all the text
77200	80400	which contains those glyphs.
80400	86080	But something more interesting is that sometimes you want to search for word and you don't
86080	90720	know the exact autography of the word.
90720	101160	So suppose you want text about the visor and so you know there will be the char sign and
101160	108880	normally a t after that but maybe that the t will be separated from the char sign by
108880	113720	another sign so what you can do is add a skip.
113720	122000	A skip represents a number of glyphs an arbitrary number of glyphs between two glyphs so if
122000	130560	I type this and another skip and this a1 then I am going to look at text which contains
130560	139160	the char sign then any number of glyphs then the t sign then any number of glyphs then
139160	142040	the a1 sign.
142040	151200	If I do that I will get way too many results because the signs can be separated by any
151200	159440	number of signs so you can very easily have the char sign at the beginning of a text and
159440	163120	then match later on a t.
163120	171400	So what you can do now and which didn't work very well before is that you can give us set
171400	182000	a value to max skip length which is going to say how many signs this star can represent.
182000	185720	Zero means in fact any number of signs.
185720	194520	If I choose for instance two which is very often a good value then both stars will represent
194520	204560	at most two signs and then I can start my search and you see that I find another number
204560	216360	of texts if I click on them it will open a window and I get a nice v0 here and with
216360	232200	a by the way z1 sign between the t and the a1 and if I click on this one I will get another
232200	243280	spelling from the teaching of tahertep without the z1.
243280	255960	So this is very nice, this is the new stuff in 7.5.5 I am going to say a word or two about
255960	259960	existing features you may not know.
259960	268360	Because you want to look for the particle poo and you know that it might be written
268360	281720	both ways the quail chick or this sign so what you want to do is to do one search for
281720	289120	both of them and of course you could do both search one after the other but you want to
289120	294280	do only one search and what you can use is those brackets.
294280	302240	When you put signs between brackets like this in the search the signs will it will search
302240	311600	for one of those signs so this will search for a p and then one of those two signs.
311600	322960	So if I start the search I've got quite a few answers and if I look at the values then
322960	344760	I've got a poo here and if I look at stillars for instance
344760	367200	if I look at stillars I will get probably something okay okay stillars at stillars if
367200	381280	I look at stillars I will get something with the quail chick here okay that's it there
381280	388520	is a something which might be a powerful system but which will need just as to evolve a lot
388520	397560	about sign description which is the use of viands you can search for viands signs so
397560	405260	if you do this normally you will probably search for both poo with the quail chick and
405260	416880	poo with the rope so for instance here is one example the problem is that it doesn't
416880	424600	always work very well for instance because as a notion of viands I use is very extensive
424600	436080	so for instance if you look at this sign the just sign if you ask for its viands you will
436080	445440	get those viands some of them are actual bona fide viands of the just signs and others are
446000	454240	simply because they look like such a sign they might not be real viands of it and if
454240	459800	you click multiple times on viands you will get viands of viands and for instance this
459800	469120	one is also an oak so you will get the oak sign and if you do this until there are no
469120	478920	more viands you will get for instance basically all get all birds and quite a few signs which
478920	487040	are very removed from the first sign so it's a notion of viands which is not precise enough
487040	495400	for our purpose so this basically is not very useful you can try it but the current results
495400	502480	won't be very good it's supposed to evolve but the data itself in the just sign list
502480	512480	is not currently up to what it should be for having meaningful and useful results there
512480	530040	other new functions of this system the new j sesh system there is a system to add new
530040	541400	lines in a very efficient way so basically you can edit line numbers in j sesh for instance
541400	550880	I'm going to add a line number here and say for instance it's x plus one okay obviously
550880	559480	it should be one but I use x plus one just to demonstrate the new system and once you
559480	569960	have done this and you want to insert a new a new number for a new line you can use insert
569960	577120	next line number and there is a shortcut for it and the advantage is that it will take
577120	585040	the last number in the previous slide you have typed and increase it so here for instance
585040	597680	I can add line numbers as much like my line numbers as I want obviously when you change
597680	606960	your page number for instance you have to type again the whole number but it makes it's
606960	614040	a very very nice system when you want to add line numbers for instance for all your lines
614040	629240	in the j sesh text a new function also which you will like is that at least it's it has
629240	638560	been missing from day one of j sesh so something like 14 years after I've finally taken the
638560	649720	time to add an improper enclosure drawing so I will probably add a related date around
649720	656560	enclosure but now there is square enclosure and I find it might be useful and it covers
656560	668040	the whole manual decodage now so this is it for the for j sesh itself there are a number
668040	682000	of new export functions so suppose you want to use the new unicode system for glyphs in
682000	690240	another software for instance you have a database and you want to use glyphs for j sesh glyphs
690240	698960	unicode glyphs there then you have a copy to unicode copy as simple unicode text and
698960	714000	you paste and there you have unicode glyphs okay you see this is not so j sesh glyphs
714000	725320	it's unicode text you have also normally but it's will probably be more problematic a copy
725320	736520	as unicode 12 which will add between the glyphs a number of formatting characters but it depends
736520	751440	on the font not all fonts will support those characters so ah the last the last new thing
751440	761600	is that you might know there is at last a code in unicode for the egyptological yard
761600	768680	so basically j sesh proposed two systems for the egyptological yard because there were
768680	777200	a number of systems in unicode for this but none of them were was fully usable and now
777280	787840	there is a specific code for egyptological yard so you can check it and if your text font uses
787840	799280	this code you can use it currently the most notable font with the unicode yard is atina
799280	811360	unicode um i hopefully a number of other system will include include this this sign okay that's
811360	820640	all for this demonstration of the new functions features of j sesh thank you for listening and goodbye
