Checking Serge Rosmorduc/New Features in JSesh 7.5.5.txt
 Serge Rosbordick, a user of Jessesh (a software tool for Egyptological studies), demonstrated some of the new features and improvements in Jessesh version 7.5.5. Here's a summary of the key points from his demonstration:

1. **Improved Search Engine**: The search engine in Jessesh has been improved, allowing users to perform more precise searches within a folder. Users can now include "skips" in their search queries, which represent an arbitrary number of glyphs between two specific glyphs. This is particularly useful when searching for words where the exact autography (sequence of glyphs) is unknown.

2. **Max Skip Length**: To control the number of glyphs represented by a skip, users can now set a maximum skip length. A value of zero means any number of glyphs, while a specific number like two limits the skip to at most that many glyphs. This helps narrow down search results to more relevant texts.

3. **Searching for Variants**: Jessesh allows users to search for different variants of a sign or word simultaneously by placing signs between brackets in the search query. This saves time as it eliminates the need to perform multiple searches for each variant.

4. **Viands Functionality**: The concept of "viands," which refers to signs that can replace one another based on context, was discussed. However, Rosbordick noted that the current implementation of viands in Jessesh is not precise and may return irrelevant results. An update to improve this functionality is expected.

5. **Adding Line Numbers Efficiently**: A new feature allows users to add or edit line numbers in a text more efficiently. This is particularly useful when dealing with large texts and when wanting to insert new lines without manually renumbering each line.

6. **Improper Enclosure Drawing**: For the first time, Jessesh now includes an improper enclosure drawing tool for manual decoding.

7. **New Export Functions**: Users can now export text with glyphs to Unicode text, which can be used in other software applications that support Unicode characters. There are two methods: a simple copy-paste function and a more complex option that adds formatting characters (dependent on the font used).

8. **Egyptological Yard**: A new Unicode character has been added specifically for the egyptological yard, which users can now utilize in their texts if their text font supports it. Currently, Atina Unicode is one of the fonts that include this character.

In summary, Jessesh 7.5.5 brings significant improvements to the search functionality, line number management, and export options, enhancing the user experience for Egyptological research. Additionally, the software now includes an improper enclosure drawing tool and supports the newly added Unicode character for the egyptological yard.
