00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Hello everybody, this is Serge Rosbondrick and I am going to demonstrate a number of

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:15,720
features of jessesh 7.5.5.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,760
The most powerful new feature is in fact an improvement of an existing feature.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,880
This is an improvement of the search engine in jessesh.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:39,800
When you use jessesh you can make a search in a folder in which you can define a folder

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:48,080
and you will search in jessesh files which are in this folder so I am going for example

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,000
to try a search in the jessesh folder itself.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,160
Ok so I am searching in the jessesh folder and now you can search for instance this was

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:17,200
already possible for a sequence of glyphs say this and it will display all the text

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
which contains those glyphs.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,080
But something more interesting is that sometimes you want to search for word and you don't

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
know the exact autography of the word.

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:41,160
So suppose you want text about the visor and so you know there will be the char sign and

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,880
normally a t after that but maybe that the t will be separated from the char sign by

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,720
another sign so what you can do is add a skip.

16
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:02,000
A skip represents a number of glyphs an arbitrary number of glyphs between two glyphs so if

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,560
I type this and another skip and this a1 then I am going to look at text which contains

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,160
the char sign then any number of glyphs then the t sign then any number of glyphs then

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,040
the a1 sign.

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:31,200
If I do that I will get way too many results because the signs can be separated by any

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,440
number of signs so you can very easily have the char sign at the beginning of a text and

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
then match later on a t.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,400
So what you can do now and which didn't work very well before is that you can give us set

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:02,000
a value to max skip length which is going to say how many signs this star can represent.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Zero means in fact any number of signs.

26
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:14,520
If I choose for instance two which is very often a good value then both stars will represent

27
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:24,560
at most two signs and then I can start my search and you see that I find another number

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:36,360
of texts if I click on them it will open a window and I get a nice v0 here and with

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:52,200
a by the way z1 sign between the t and the a1 and if I click on this one I will get another

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:03,280
spelling from the teaching of tahertep without the z1.

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:15,960
So this is very nice, this is the new stuff in 7.5.5 I am going to say a word or two about

32
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,960
existing features you may not know.

33
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:28,360
Because you want to look for the particle poo and you know that it might be written

34
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:41,720
both ways the quail chick or this sign so what you want to do is to do one search for

35
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,120
both of them and of course you could do both search one after the other but you want to

36
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,280
do only one search and what you can use is those brackets.

37
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:02,240
When you put signs between brackets like this in the search the signs will it will search

38
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:11,600
for one of those signs so this will search for a p and then one of those two signs.

39
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:22,960
So if I start the search I've got quite a few answers and if I look at the values then

40
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:44,760
I've got a poo here and if I look at stillars for instance

41
00:05:44,760 --> 00:06:07,200
if I look at stillars I will get probably something okay okay stillars at stillars if

42
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:21,280
I look at stillars I will get something with the quail chick here okay that's it there

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,520
is a something which might be a powerful system but which will need just as to evolve a lot

44
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:37,560
about sign description which is the use of viands you can search for viands signs so

45
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,260
if you do this normally you will probably search for both poo with the quail chick and

46
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:56,880
poo with the rope so for instance here is one example the problem is that it doesn't

47
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,600
always work very well for instance because as a notion of viands I use is very extensive

48
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:16,080
so for instance if you look at this sign the just sign if you ask for its viands you will

49
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,440
get those viands some of them are actual bona fide viands of the just signs and others are

50
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,240
simply because they look like such a sign they might not be real viands of it and if

51
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,800
you click multiple times on viands you will get viands of viands and for instance this

52
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:49,120
one is also an oak so you will get the oak sign and if you do this until there are no

53
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:58,920
more viands you will get for instance basically all get all birds and quite a few signs which

54
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:07,040
are very removed from the first sign so it's a notion of viands which is not precise enough

55
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:15,400
for our purpose so this basically is not very useful you can try it but the current results

56
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,480
won't be very good it's supposed to evolve but the data itself in the just sign list

57
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:32,480
is not currently up to what it should be for having meaningful and useful results there

58
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:50,040
other new functions of this system the new j sesh system there is a system to add new

59
00:08:50,040 --> 00:09:01,400
lines in a very efficient way so basically you can edit line numbers in j sesh for instance

60
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm going to add a line number here and say for instance it's x plus one okay obviously

61
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,480
it should be one but I use x plus one just to demonstrate the new system and once you

62
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:29,960
have done this and you want to insert a new a new number for a new line you can use insert

63
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:37,120
next line number and there is a shortcut for it and the advantage is that it will take

64
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,040
the last number in the previous slide you have typed and increase it so here for instance

65
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:57,680
I can add line numbers as much like my line numbers as I want obviously when you change

66
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:06,960
your page number for instance you have to type again the whole number but it makes it's

67
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,040
a very very nice system when you want to add line numbers for instance for all your lines

68
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:29,240
in the j sesh text a new function also which you will like is that at least it's it has

69
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:38,560
been missing from day one of j sesh so something like 14 years after I've finally taken the

70
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:49,720
time to add an improper enclosure drawing so I will probably add a related date around

71
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,560
enclosure but now there is square enclosure and I find it might be useful and it covers

72
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:08,040
the whole manual decodage now so this is it for the for j sesh itself there are a number

73
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:22,000
of new export functions so suppose you want to use the new unicode system for glyphs in

74
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,240
another software for instance you have a database and you want to use glyphs for j sesh glyphs

75
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:38,960
unicode glyphs there then you have a copy to unicode copy as simple unicode text and

76
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:54,000
you paste and there you have unicode glyphs okay you see this is not so j sesh glyphs

77
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,320
it's unicode text you have also normally but it's will probably be more problematic a copy

78
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:16,520
as unicode 12 which will add between the glyphs a number of formatting characters but it depends

79
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:31,440
on the font not all fonts will support those characters so ah the last the last new thing

80
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:41,600
is that you might know there is at last a code in unicode for the egyptological yard

81
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,680
so basically j sesh proposed two systems for the egyptological yard because there were

82
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:57,200
a number of systems in unicode for this but none of them were was fully usable and now

83
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:07,840
there is a specific code for egyptological yard so you can check it and if your text font uses

84
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:19,280
this code you can use it currently the most notable font with the unicode yard is atina

85
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:31,360
unicode um i hopefully a number of other system will include include this this sign okay that's

86
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:40,640
all for this demonstration of the new functions features of j sesh thank you for listening and goodbye
