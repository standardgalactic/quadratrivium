00:00.000 --> 00:06.340
Hello everybody, this is Serge Rosbondrick and I am going to demonstrate a number of

00:06.340 --> 00:15.720
features of jessesh 7.5.5.

00:15.720 --> 00:22.760
The most powerful new feature is in fact an improvement of an existing feature.

00:22.760 --> 00:31.880
This is an improvement of the search engine in jessesh.

00:31.880 --> 00:39.800
When you use jessesh you can make a search in a folder in which you can define a folder

00:39.800 --> 00:48.080
and you will search in jessesh files which are in this folder so I am going for example

00:48.080 --> 00:55.000
to try a search in the jessesh folder itself.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.160
Ok so I am searching in the jessesh folder and now you can search for instance this was

01:05.160 --> 01:17.200
already possible for a sequence of glyphs say this and it will display all the text

01:17.200 --> 01:20.400
which contains those glyphs.

01:20.400 --> 01:26.080
But something more interesting is that sometimes you want to search for word and you don't

01:26.080 --> 01:30.720
know the exact autography of the word.

01:30.720 --> 01:41.160
So suppose you want text about the visor and so you know there will be the char sign and

01:41.160 --> 01:48.880
normally a t after that but maybe that the t will be separated from the char sign by

01:48.880 --> 01:53.720
another sign so what you can do is add a skip.

01:53.720 --> 02:02.000
A skip represents a number of glyphs an arbitrary number of glyphs between two glyphs so if

02:02.000 --> 02:10.560
I type this and another skip and this a1 then I am going to look at text which contains

02:10.560 --> 02:19.160
the char sign then any number of glyphs then the t sign then any number of glyphs then

02:19.160 --> 02:22.040
the a1 sign.

02:22.040 --> 02:31.200
If I do that I will get way too many results because the signs can be separated by any

02:31.200 --> 02:39.440
number of signs so you can very easily have the char sign at the beginning of a text and

02:39.440 --> 02:43.120
then match later on a t.

02:43.120 --> 02:51.400
So what you can do now and which didn't work very well before is that you can give us set

02:51.400 --> 03:02.000
a value to max skip length which is going to say how many signs this star can represent.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.720
Zero means in fact any number of signs.

03:05.720 --> 03:14.520
If I choose for instance two which is very often a good value then both stars will represent

03:14.520 --> 03:24.560
at most two signs and then I can start my search and you see that I find another number

03:24.560 --> 03:36.360
of texts if I click on them it will open a window and I get a nice v0 here and with

03:36.360 --> 03:52.200
a by the way z1 sign between the t and the a1 and if I click on this one I will get another

03:52.200 --> 04:03.280
spelling from the teaching of tahertep without the z1.

04:03.280 --> 04:15.960
So this is very nice, this is the new stuff in 7.5.5 I am going to say a word or two about

04:15.960 --> 04:19.960
existing features you may not know.

04:19.960 --> 04:28.360
Because you want to look for the particle poo and you know that it might be written

04:28.360 --> 04:41.720
both ways the quail chick or this sign so what you want to do is to do one search for

04:41.720 --> 04:49.120
both of them and of course you could do both search one after the other but you want to

04:49.120 --> 04:54.280
do only one search and what you can use is those brackets.

04:54.280 --> 05:02.240
When you put signs between brackets like this in the search the signs will it will search

05:02.240 --> 05:11.600
for one of those signs so this will search for a p and then one of those two signs.

05:11.600 --> 05:22.960
So if I start the search I've got quite a few answers and if I look at the values then

05:22.960 --> 05:44.760
I've got a poo here and if I look at stillars for instance

05:44.760 --> 06:07.200
if I look at stillars I will get probably something okay okay stillars at stillars if

06:07.200 --> 06:21.280
I look at stillars I will get something with the quail chick here okay that's it there

06:21.280 --> 06:28.520
is a something which might be a powerful system but which will need just as to evolve a lot

06:28.520 --> 06:37.560
about sign description which is the use of viands you can search for viands signs so

06:37.560 --> 06:45.260
if you do this normally you will probably search for both poo with the quail chick and

06:45.260 --> 06:56.880
poo with the rope so for instance here is one example the problem is that it doesn't

06:56.880 --> 07:04.600
always work very well for instance because as a notion of viands I use is very extensive

07:04.600 --> 07:16.080
so for instance if you look at this sign the just sign if you ask for its viands you will

07:16.080 --> 07:25.440
get those viands some of them are actual bona fide viands of the just signs and others are

07:26.000 --> 07:34.240
simply because they look like such a sign they might not be real viands of it and if

07:34.240 --> 07:39.800
you click multiple times on viands you will get viands of viands and for instance this

07:39.800 --> 07:49.120
one is also an oak so you will get the oak sign and if you do this until there are no

07:49.120 --> 07:58.920
more viands you will get for instance basically all get all birds and quite a few signs which

07:58.920 --> 08:07.040
are very removed from the first sign so it's a notion of viands which is not precise enough

08:07.040 --> 08:15.400
for our purpose so this basically is not very useful you can try it but the current results

08:15.400 --> 08:22.480
won't be very good it's supposed to evolve but the data itself in the just sign list

08:22.480 --> 08:32.480
is not currently up to what it should be for having meaningful and useful results there

08:32.480 --> 08:50.040
other new functions of this system the new j sesh system there is a system to add new

08:50.040 --> 09:01.400
lines in a very efficient way so basically you can edit line numbers in j sesh for instance

09:01.400 --> 09:10.880
I'm going to add a line number here and say for instance it's x plus one okay obviously

09:10.880 --> 09:19.480
it should be one but I use x plus one just to demonstrate the new system and once you

09:19.480 --> 09:29.960
have done this and you want to insert a new a new number for a new line you can use insert

09:29.960 --> 09:37.120
next line number and there is a shortcut for it and the advantage is that it will take

09:37.120 --> 09:45.040
the last number in the previous slide you have typed and increase it so here for instance

09:45.040 --> 09:57.680
I can add line numbers as much like my line numbers as I want obviously when you change

09:57.680 --> 10:06.960
your page number for instance you have to type again the whole number but it makes it's

10:06.960 --> 10:14.040
a very very nice system when you want to add line numbers for instance for all your lines

10:14.040 --> 10:29.240
in the j sesh text a new function also which you will like is that at least it's it has

10:29.240 --> 10:38.560
been missing from day one of j sesh so something like 14 years after I've finally taken the

10:38.560 --> 10:49.720
time to add an improper enclosure drawing so I will probably add a related date around

10:49.720 --> 10:56.560
enclosure but now there is square enclosure and I find it might be useful and it covers

10:56.560 --> 11:08.040
the whole manual decodage now so this is it for the for j sesh itself there are a number

11:08.040 --> 11:22.000
of new export functions so suppose you want to use the new unicode system for glyphs in

11:22.000 --> 11:30.240
another software for instance you have a database and you want to use glyphs for j sesh glyphs

11:30.240 --> 11:38.960
unicode glyphs there then you have a copy to unicode copy as simple unicode text and

11:38.960 --> 11:54.000
you paste and there you have unicode glyphs okay you see this is not so j sesh glyphs

11:54.000 --> 12:05.320
it's unicode text you have also normally but it's will probably be more problematic a copy

12:05.320 --> 12:16.520
as unicode 12 which will add between the glyphs a number of formatting characters but it depends

12:16.520 --> 12:31.440
on the font not all fonts will support those characters so ah the last the last new thing

12:31.440 --> 12:41.600
is that you might know there is at last a code in unicode for the egyptological yard

12:41.600 --> 12:48.680
so basically j sesh proposed two systems for the egyptological yard because there were

12:48.680 --> 12:57.200
a number of systems in unicode for this but none of them were was fully usable and now

12:57.280 --> 13:07.840
there is a specific code for egyptological yard so you can check it and if your text font uses

13:07.840 --> 13:19.280
this code you can use it currently the most notable font with the unicode yard is atina

13:19.280 --> 13:31.360
unicode um i hopefully a number of other system will include include this this sign okay that's

13:31.360 --> 13:40.640
all for this demonstration of the new functions features of j sesh thank you for listening and goodbye
