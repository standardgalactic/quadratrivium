Checking 80,000 Hours/How quickly could AI transform the world？ ｜ Tom Davidson.txt
 Tom Chou joined Louisa Hall to discuss the concept of emergent behavior in ant colonies and its implications for artificial intelligence (AI) development. In ant societies, individual ants follow simple rules that lead to complex patterns beneficial for the colony without the ants understanding the broader context. This system's efficiency and effectiveness inspired a discussion on AI.

The concern with training highly intelligent individual AIs is the potential risk they might pose if they become too powerful or if their goals diverge from human interests. An alternative approach could be to create a team of AIs, each specialized and operating without a comprehensive understanding of the overall system, making it safer and more manageable. This decentralized AI system could coordinate to achieve complex tasks collectively, similar to how ant colonies operate, thus potentially mitigating the risks associated with a single super intelligent AI.

Louisa and Tom explored how this analogy might inform the development of AI that can work alongside humans safely and effectively. They suggested that listening to past episodes on AI, such as those featuring Richard Newell, Nova Dasama, Chris Olah, Brian Christian, and Paul Cristiano, could provide deeper insights into these issues. The podcast is produced by Kieran Harris, with audio mastering and technical editing by Simon Monsour and Ben Cordell, and full transcripts and additional resources are available on the 80,000 Hours website.
