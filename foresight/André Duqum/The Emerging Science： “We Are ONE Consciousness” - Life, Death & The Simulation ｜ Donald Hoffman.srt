1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
We have assumed in science for hundreds of years that spacetime is fundamental reality.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
In the last 10 years, for the first time, scientists have taken off the spacetime headset.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,720
What are we going to find?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,320
So I should be very, very clear on this point.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,760
Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,120
And when I say that spacetime isn't fundamental, objects and spacetime are fundamental,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,400
that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,320
What I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't see reality as it is.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
This theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
outside of our spacetime headset.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,560
Once you know the software, you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,000
So you believe we're living in a simulation of sorts?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,160
I think that we just have to bite the bullet and say,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
no matter how smart and mathematically precise you are,

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,240
I think as a scientist, it's critical for me to actually spend time in utter silence.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,960
That's where the true new creativity comes from.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,200
What we know is one perspective out of an infinite number of perspectives.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
But that's who you are.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,200
What you are transcends any description.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,760
And that's how the infinite comes to know itself.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,720
Don, so good to have you back.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,480
Thank you, Andre. Thanks for having me back.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,160
I thought we could start with giving maybe a 10-minute overview,

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,640
kind of a high-level view of both your work,

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
our conversation last time, which I absolutely loved and our audience loved.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
And then we can dive deeper into some new terrain here on this conversation today,

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
which I'm very much looking forward to.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,080
So starting with how fitness beats truth and how the chance that evolution has shaped

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,720
sensory systems to see objective reality is precisely zero in the work that you share.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
Could you elaborate on that a little bit in terms of how evolution shapes our

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,120
sensory systems to be able to navigate it effectively for survival purposes,

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,120
but not to see reality as it is objectively?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Right. So Darwin's theory is very clear that evolution shapes sensory systems to guide

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,240
adaptive behavior. And that's true. According to Darwin's theory, that is in fact true.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Most of us think intuitively that to do that, evolution must shape us to see the truth because

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
clearly if you see the truth, that will be much more adaptive than if you don't see the truth.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
So to guide adaptive behavior, evolution must also shape us to see the truth.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
And it turns out that that extra assumption, which isn't in Darwin's theory,

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,520
shouldn't be in Darwin's theory. Now, the mathematics of it is very, very simple.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,960
The payoff functions that guide evolution. Like if you play a game, you have payoffs. If you

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,280
make certain moves on the board game or in a video game, you get a certain number of points.

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
And if you get enough points, you can get to the next level of the game. If you don't get enough

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
points in time, you die and so forth. Same thing like an evolution. There's the evolutionary game

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:03,920
theory. You have payoffs that guide adaptive evolution. And what happens with those payoffs,

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,240
they're basically not telling you whether you go to the next level of the game, but whether

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,800
your genes, your offspring go to the next level of the game. So when you analyze those fitness

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,600
payoffs and ask, do those fitness payoffs contain information about the true structure of objective

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,640
reality? If they're going to shape you, if the payoff functions that guide evolution

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
are going to shape your sensory systems for you to see the truth, then they have to know a little

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,680
bit about the truth themselves or they can't shape you. And what we've proven, and this is,

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,280
again, work with not just me, but Chetan Prakash and Manish Singh, Robert Prentner and Brian

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,520
Marion and Justin Marks, a number of other people, not just me. But what we've shown is in a number

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,840
of ways that the payoff functions basically don't have the information, almost surely don't

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
have the information about the structure of the world. So you can actually prove the probability

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,320
is precisely zero that any payoff function has that information and therefore is precisely

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,120
zero probability that we've been shaped to see reality as it is. Now, I should mention

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,240
just two quick objections that people have about this. One is, I've shot myself on the foot,

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,280
logically. I've used evolutionary game theory, which is supposed to capture Darwin's theory of

60
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,040
evolution. It's the mathematics of Darwin's theory. And I've used it to actually show that certain

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,280
basic concepts in Darwin's theory like real physical animals competing for real physical

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,400
resources in a real space and time. I'm saying that all of that is, you know, space and time

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,280
aren't fundamental. We're not seeing reality as it is. Objects and space, time are just an illusion

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,480
or a headset. So the argument from philosophers, some philosophers have been, well, Hoffman,

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,720
unfortunately, shot himself on the foot, logically. He's used evolutionary game theory

66
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,440
mathematics to show that the very concepts that were gave rise to evolutionary game theory

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,360
aren't true. So either the math faithfully represents Darwin's ideas and captures it

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,320
and is a good representation of those ideas, or it's not. If it's not,

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
Hoffman couldn't use it for what he's using it for. And if it does, if it is a good faithful

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
representation of Darwin's central ideas, then it couldn't possibly contradict them.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,920
So in either way, Hoffman is messed up and his team. And the answer is this,

72
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,720
fundamentally misunderstands the nature of scientific theories. Every theory makes assumptions.

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,840
They're the miracles of the theory. And then it says, if you grant me those assumptions,

74
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll show, I'll then prove all this or explain all this other wonderful stuff.

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
But it never explains its assumptions. And you can get a new theory, a deeper theory,

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
that explains those assumptions, but it'll have its own new assumptions add infinitum.

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,040
So every theory has, if it's good enough, has a scope. But every theory,

78
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,280
no matter how good it is, has its limits. If none else, its assumptions are showing you

79
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,600
what its limits are. So the only question is, when you have a mathematical representation

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,400
of the theory, is the mathematics, if it's a good theory, the mathematics will help you explore

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,320
the scope. That's new. And, but if it's a great theory, the mathematics will actually show you

82
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,560
precisely what the limits are. And in case of Einstein's theory of spacetime, for example,

83
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,720
his mathematics is of course fantastic and GPS and everything else is based on Einstein's math.

84
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,800
So wonderful scope. But his theory also, the same mathematics that captures his theory and shows

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,040
its scope also tells us its limits. And the limits are, in Einstein's case, 10 to the minus 33

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,560
centimeters. Space time ceases to have any operational meaning, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,320
10 to the minus 43 seconds. And so here we have the case where the mathematics that Einstein came

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,640
up with is the very mathematics that comes back and says your fundamental concept of space and time

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,120
fail at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So that's how science,

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,640
good science, really works. The mathematics that's intended to capture the fundamental concepts of

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,040
your theory. If it's great mathematics and a great theory, we'll come back and show you

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,600
exactly what the limits are of those fundamental concepts. So that's not self-refutation.

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,600
In fact, that's why science is so powerful when we just use informal discussion and, you know,

94
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,840
talking about ideas over beer and so forth. That's one thing.

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,640
But you can never find out the limit of your ideas and the limits of your theories

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,040
when you have just an informal theory. And as a result, it's easy to become dogmatic and to

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,520
think that you're getting close to the theory of everything that I know the truth and you don't and

98
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,680
so forth. What science does is it puts a big dose of humility on there. Even a big theory

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,600
like Einstein's theory of space time, it tells you that theory is great and it stops at 10 to the

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,200
minus 33 centimeters game over. So you need a new concept. So that's, so it's an anti-dogmatic kind

101
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,360
of thing. So that's sort of just a little kind of pushback I've gotten on this and you can see why

102
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,080
would be some strong pushback because what I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't see

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,760
reality as it is. Yeah. And we'll circle back to the value of discovering the limits of different

104
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,440
theories because I'm excited to dive into that to continue to, you know, put a bow on the high

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,400
level overview of this work. That understanding that you just shared in conjunction with local

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,360
realism being proof false leads us to explore the headset analogy. And so, you know, the Nobel

107
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Prize for local realism being proved false explains how objects in space time cease to exist when

108
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,960
they're not perceived. Like they get rendered on the fly when they're perceived. Why does that become

109
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,840
an important reflection when we start to dismantle this notion that reality is as it seems?

110
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Well, again, I should say that your local realism is false. The Nobel Prize was a

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,720
granted for it for that experimental verification. There are some who still want to maintain some

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,160
kind of realism through multiverse kinds of explanations and so forth. I think that we just

113
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,360
have to bite the bullet and say space and time aren't fundamental. And the properties of objects

114
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,040
in space and time aren't fundamental. So that's the direction I'm going by. I just want to

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,160
point out that there are very, very bright physicists who would disagree. Now, the theory of

116
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,240
evolution of natural selection and my work on that is in some sense, it suggests that space

117
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,240
time is an interface, right? So it does, it strongly suggests that what evolution gave us was not

118
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,120
a window on the truth, but a headset that lets us play the game of life. And so that's why I think

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,760
it does fit in with the modern results in physics. I think it's a very reasonable interpretation

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,560
of modern quantum theory. And it's actually part of, for example, a big interpretation,

121
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:19,600
the so-called cubism interpretation of quantum theory that Chris Fuchs and others are espousing,

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,720
that the quantum state is just the observer's statement of the degrees of belief of what

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,720
they will experience if they make certain kinds of observations. And it's not, you know, quantum

124
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,880
states are not descriptions of objective reality. They're descriptions of your degrees of subjective

125
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,320
belief. So I think that that fits very, very well with the work I'm saying. So here's a case where

126
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,520
physics, this interpretation of physics, the Cubist interpretation of physics, the non-local realist

127
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,680
interpretation of quantum physics works very, very well with what evolution is suggesting,

128
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,160
that we evolve not to see the truth, but to have a headset. So yeah, I think the two actually

129
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,960
dovetail quite well. The truth to be hidden, but allowing us to control it in a way that we need.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,840
That's exactly right. And I should mention that since the last time we talked,

131
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,280
there's been a big push by the European Research Council, the ERC. They have a 10 million euro

132
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,320
new initiative for finding that there are these new structures outside of spacetime.

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Like the Amplituhedron?

134
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Like the Amplituhedron, right. Yeah, that's right. So they're called positive geometries,

135
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,720
but and so they, it's just started. Is it a cosmological polytope? Is that correct?

136
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,280
That's right. That's right, an associahedron and so forth. So there are these positive

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,680
geometries and they could have billions of dimensions. Spacetime has four, maybe 11 in

138
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,720
string theory or something like that, but they could have billions of dimensions. In other words,

139
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,000
our headset is pretty cheap. It's a really, really low dimensional, we got the cheap model.

140
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:08,720
The high energy theoretical physicists are now looking at structures like the Amplituhedron,

141
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,160
in which one of the parameters is the dimension of your spacetime. So in our case, M equals four.

142
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,800
M is the parameter, and ours is four, but they could have a billion. M could be any number,

143
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,640
M is one of the, four is one of the smaller numbers you could have. So that's already a

144
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,200
parameter in the positive geometries that your headset, your spacetime could be

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,880
as many dimensions as you want. And we have about as cheap of one as you could get away with.

146
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,000
So instead of us having a theory of everything, we have a theory just of a trivial headset.

147
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,360
So just refining again, the understanding that objects cease to exist in the form we think they

148
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,480
do when they're not perceived. This goes for the chair that you're sitting on, the moon, any object

149
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,160
that the quantum theories works at all scales, then this would apply to that at all scales.

150
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,840
Can you just share a little bit more about the headset analogy and how that helps us kind of

151
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,160
wrap our head around things exist in objective reality in a way that is analogous like we

152
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,600
explored to last time, like a computer where there's gates of electricity moving, but the display

153
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
of the screen is set to hide the truth of reality so we can control it in a way that is useful,

154
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
because otherwise if we didn't have the display of a computer screen, like how would we actually

155
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,120
effectively navigate it? So could you elaborate on that a little bit more so we can wrap our

156
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,280
head around that? That's right. So an obvious question is if we don't see the truth, then

157
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,720
what has evolution done? How does it allow us to survive when we're ignorant of what reality is?

158
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,280
But if you think about it, it actually makes a lot of sense. If you have someone,

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,720
say Grand Theft Auto, and it is a virtual reality version of Grand Theft Auto in multiplayer,

160
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,040
and there's some supercomputer somewhere that's running it, but you don't see that

161
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
supercomputer, you don't need them about the software and so forth. All I know is I've got a

162
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,360
steering wheel in front of me, I've got a dashboard, I've got a gas pedal and so forth,

163
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,560
and I can see over to my right, I can see a green Ferrari or something like that that I'm racing

164
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,360
against. Well, of course, if you looked inside the supercomputer, there's no green Ferrari anywhere

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,400
inside the supercomputer, and there's no steering wheel and none of that. The reality that I'm

166
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,040
interacting with and what I'm really doing in this metaphor in that reality is toggling millions of

167
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,040
voltages in a precise order. It has to be, you get one toggle wrong and the thing can crash.

168
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,440
So you have to get this precise toggling of millions of voltages. That's what you're really

169
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,280
doing in the reality. But if you had to do that to play the game, if you actually had to go in

170
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,600
there and know what sequence of voltages to put in at what time, good luck. I'm going to win the

171
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,920
game if I'm just turning my steering wheel and slamming on the brakes and the gas and what,

172
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm going to win the game. So here's the case where it's very, very clear that knowing the

173
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,320
reality and having to interface directly with the reality to play the game is going to make you lose

174
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,000
as opposed to just having a dumb, dumb down user interface that hides the truth but gives you just

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,760
the controls you need. So that's sort of the point of view of evolution. From the evolutionary

176
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,000
point of view, Darwin's idea then is basically that evolution shaped us with sensory systems that

177
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,840
hide all the truth that we don't need and all the gory details. Just give us the levers that we need

178
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,040
to control reality without actually knowing what those levers do. Because if you had all the stuff

179
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,240
that you know, you're going to have to pay for more energy for all the neurons you're going to need

180
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
to store that information to understand that stuff, it's just too expensive. So that's sort of

181
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,680
an intuition where it starts to make it seem not so much crazy, but of course,

182
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
of course you don't want to see the truth. It's just too complicated.

183
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah. So this starts to, I think, be a little destabilizing for some people when you say,

184
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,560
we're living in a matrix simulation. Reality isn't real. And so this understanding that

185
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,640
this headset, our sensory system allows us to navigate the game of life, like the game in

186
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,840
GTA 6 or whatever that comes out. If we have a VR headset like the Apple headset, it will allow us

187
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,280
to navigate and play in there, for example. And that space time is a very limited scope of reality.

188
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,960
And within that limited scope of reality, we are perceiving less than 0.1% of the electromagnetic

189
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,600
spectrum that we can see with visible light. The sensory experience of life is

190
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
extremely limited to the vastness of what existence actually is.

191
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,960
That's right. And even the very notion of the electromagnetic spectrum itself

192
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,480
is an artifact of the headset. It's not a deep insight into the reality. So when we talk about

193
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,360
that, we're using headset language is not the truth. But even in the headset, we have hints

194
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,960
inside the headset, even the part that we see inside the headset is trivial compared to what's

195
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,200
out there. So you believe we're living in a simulation of sorts. Is that right?

196
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah, I would say that this is, that space time is not fundamental objective reality.

197
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,520
Therefore, something else is. And so I should be careful though, and say when most people talk

198
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,960
about simulation theory, like Nick Bostrom and people in that camp, their point of view is very,

199
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,560
very different from mine. And I should be very, very clear about the difference and also the

200
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,640
similarities. So the similarities are that what you see around you is not the truth. It's in some

201
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,120
sense, a simulation or a headset. But what Nick and Bostrom and others think is that

202
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,640
space time and physicalist ideas are still fundamental. And they think that computer

203
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,360
programs properly programmed can actually create consciousness. So the idea is that

204
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,680
there's some computer programmer in a different world that has created this simulation and the

205
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
simulation is sophisticated enough that the algorithms are actually creating creatures

206
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,160
like us with consciousness. But it's consciousness that's emerging from the computational prowess

207
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,560
of the programmer and the power of the computer. Of course, then the possibility is that that

208
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,240
programmer in their computer is in fact just a simulation from a deeper programmer and so forth

209
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,280
many, many levels of that. But at the bottom, the bottom level is presumably again a physicalist

210
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,800
space time programmer in a world that's physical and space time. And so the idea is, so they're

211
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:49,600
making two assumptions that space time, physics is fundamental. And second, that properly programmed

212
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,800
computers can create consciousness. And I'm disagreeing with both points. So the two critical

213
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,120
points of their simulation hypothesis, I think are false. I think there's no evidence

214
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,480
in any theory of how computer programs could create consciousness. I'll put it this way.

215
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,760
There's not a single theory out there right now. And there have been lots of attempts that says

216
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,120
that consciousness is created by some kind of algorithm, some kind of computational process,

217
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,440
some kind of neural network that can, that none of those theories can explain even one specific

218
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
conscious experience. When you look at all the theories that are out there and they've been

219
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,360
at this for decades, and many of these people are my friends and they're brilliant people.

220
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,320
But what I always ask them when I speak at conferences is to say, okay, we can experience

221
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,520
roughly a trillion specific conscious experiences. Taste of garlic, smell of chocolate, the sound of

222
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,080
a trumpet. There's about a trillion things that we experienced should be shooting fish and a barrel

223
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,600
to pick one and give us a theory and say how this computational process must be the taste of mint.

224
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,200
So how many of you guys got? How many have you done? Zero. And that's the way it's been,

225
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,600
and that's the way it's going to be. So, so there's a lot of talk about these computational approaches

226
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,160
and or neuro biological approaches for, for coming with conscious experiences. And there's

227
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,240
not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain. Zero. And I predict that that's

228
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,160
going to continue because it's not possible in principle to do that. So, so I disagree with

229
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,360
the simulation theorists that are saying that your consciousness is due to some program or writing

230
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,320
up a program that created your conscience. Show me the beef. There's nothing there. There's all

231
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,600
sorts of ideas and hand waves, but I have not seen anybody plop down and say, here is, for example,

232
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:49,040
an integrated information theory. Here is the causal matrix and by end matrix and must be 5000.

233
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,720
And these are the 5000 by 5000. These are the exact numbers that must be in the matrix for this to

234
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,640
be the taste of mint. Nothing. Right. And if you think about it, how in the world could a 5000 by

235
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,280
5000 matrix of numbers be the taste of mint? You've got some explaining to do. So, so, so that's where

236
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,640
I disagree on two things, right? The idea that spacetime is fundamental and that computational

237
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
processes or neural processes could create conscious experiences. And I'll just mention

238
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,600
when you, when I give up local realism, and when I say that spacetime isn't fundamental,

239
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,360
objects and spacetime are fundamental, that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.

240
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,680
That means none of my behavior is caused by neural activity. Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist

241
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,400
and I think we need more money for, for neuroscience, not less. So I'm, so let me be very, very clear.

242
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,040
I am not denigrating neuroscience research. I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. I love that

243
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,640
research and we, but it's going to be much harder than we thought. The 86 billion neurons of the

244
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,400
brain and roughly the same number of glial cells are complicated, but they're trivial. They're just

245
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,720
a headset projection of the real thing that's behind them outside of spacetime. And so neuroscience

246
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,280
is going to have to reverse engineer the 86 billion neurons and, and look at the much more

247
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,480
complicated reality behind that. So, so I, that's why I say we need more money for neuroscience,

248
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,320
not less. And we're going to have to up our game because we haven't actually started the hard work

249
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,960
yet in neuroscience. So let's just lay the, the foundation too for, for people that start to explore

250
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,880
the hard problem of consciousness of why any collection of matter from the materials view

251
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,320
would have an experience of itself is very baffling. And so when you look at consciousness in the

252
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,360
many different theories of how it could come to be, there is a materialist view, which is like

253
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,440
you just explained, which is along, you know, analogous the understanding that spacetime is real

254
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,200
and after a certain amount of unconscious complexity and your neuronal structure,

255
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,360
consciousness starts to appear as you turn that dial forward. Now we're exploring a little bit more

256
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
of a originally thought of as panpsychist view, which is the understanding that consciousness is

257
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,520
actually fundamental. Could you explain the difference between consciousness being fundamental

258
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,600
or panpsychism versus idealism? Sure. That's right. So I'm good friends with Philip Goff,

259
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,360
who's one of the principal proponents of the modern panpsychist kind of theory. And

260
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,240
so there, I'll talk about one specific version of it. I think that, that Philip may have thought

261
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,840
about it that way, but I think he's not necessarily committed to this. So what I'm saying right now,

262
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,400
sure. I'm not pinning Philip with this. Okay. But one kind of panpsychism

263
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:49,120
takes spacetime as fundamental. And it says that in addition to these elementary particles,

264
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,080
the leptons, bosons and quarks of the standard model of physics. So we have these fundamental

265
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,280
particles and their physical properties. In addition, let's just posit that these

266
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,480
bosons, leptons and quarks also have in addition a fundamental unit of consciousness. So that they,

267
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,040
and in some sense, the consciousness is what is the reality behind the mathematics.

268
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,600
And that certainly is interesting, but there's a couple problems with it. First is,

269
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,960
why should we assume that the laws of consciousness are tied to the laws of our particular headset?

270
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,520
This is just the M equals 4 version of a projection of something that's much more complicated.

271
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:45,680
It fails to understand how trivial spacetime is. Spacetime is just a trivial headset. And so if

272
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,240
we're going to pin our theory of consciousness such that the equations of that little headset are,

273
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,560
in some sense, dictating how these consciousnesses interact, that's just way too limiting.

274
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,320
We have to think outside of that box. And second, it actually does no work.

275
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,120
As a scientist, I would like, I mean, philosophy is important and so I'm not

276
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,200
denigrating philosophy, but as a scientist, I would like my theory of consciousness to actually

277
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,680
do some work for me. Not just to say, the laws of physics, you can leave them alone,

278
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,320
nothing to see here, but we can tag on consciousness. I'm very, very unhappy with that.

279
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
I would like a theory of consciousness that shows me where the laws of physics come out

280
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,560
as a special case of the more general laws of consciousness. So I would like to show that the

281
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,000
headset is a trivial headset and consciousness is the more fundamental. So you can see it's a very,

282
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,240
very different spirit. Now, having said that, there are many different versions of panpsychism.

283
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,920
So I could easily imagine, and I may have already influenced Philip in this direction,

284
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,520
we'll see. Panpsychism, that's not tied to space time. In that case, as a scientist,

285
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:05,600
I still want, then, fundamental mathematical principles. I want this partly because as a

286
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,080
scientist, here's the attitude that I think hard-nosed physicalists should have toward this.

287
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,680
They can say, look, in our assumption that space and time are fundamental and doing the

288
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,120
mathematics of physics is fundamental, we can explain all this stuff. Your GPS is due to us.

289
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,640
The science and technology that's allowing us to do this podcast is all due to this physical

290
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,600
science. What kind of scientific equipment has come out of your theory of consciousness?

291
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,480
Oh, none? Oh, well, I think that that sort of tells us how important your ideas are vis-a-vis

292
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,480
our physical. And what can I say? They've got me. And they've got anybody who says consciousness

293
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,200
is fundamental, and they say, well, what kind of technology can you give us? None. Well, then

294
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,840
either that whole approach is not strong enough, or you haven't done your work. And I think it

295
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,520
is, we haven't done our work. I think the approach is strong enough. But we now,

296
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,480
those of us who take consciousness as fundamental, need to have fundamentally new mathematical

297
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,720
theories of consciousness, qua consciousness, with rigorous mathematics that shows how precisely

298
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,000
space-time comes out as a projection of this, where we actually get the standard model of

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,040
particle physics and the generalization of it, so that we can actually predict new technologies.

300
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,320
So that's where I'm headed. So the panpsychist approach

301
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,720
has not at all been taken into direction by philosophers that could ever lead to brand

302
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,600
new mathematics that would lead to new technology. So that's one problem I've got with it.

303
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,040
The approach that I'm taking is, I call it conscious realism, but you mentioned idealism.

304
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,960
Strictly speaking, what I'm doing is philosophically idealism. It's probably the closest would be

305
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,640
Bernardo Castro's analytical idealism. So yes, it is. What I'm doing is idealism.

306
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,520
Which just so I can understand, panpsychist view would be that consciousness is fundamental.

307
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,840
So essentially consciousness is a fundamental constituent, and idealism would be perceiving

308
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,880
consciousness as all there is, but projecting down essentially as like reality is a shadow of

309
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,040
innocence. Yeah, the idea that's what we call physical spacetime is just ideas in the mind.

310
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,400
It's just a headset. Ideas in the mind of God. Ideas in the mind of consciousness. Absolutely.

311
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,400
So and the idea would be then that this is what quantum mechanics is telling us. The

312
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,600
fact that local realism is false means that the moon or whatever you observe has a value of position,

313
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,840
momentum, and spend, and so forth. When you observe and when you don't observe, you can't assert

314
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,160
those things, because in fact, they're not true. And this is quite nice. This is

315
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,920
non-contextual realism. And there's some wonderful work on this, the Coak and Specker

316
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,280
theorems and so forth. There are cases where you can actually set up these quantum measurements,

317
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,720
where you can show a sequence of measurements, where you can predict with probability one.

318
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
What the outcome of an experiment will be, what one of the measurements will be.

319
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,520
Probability one. And you can prove that the mathematics of quantum mechanics entails

320
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,680
that there could not possibly have been a value until you made the measurement. So these are like

321
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,320
knock down, drag out kinds of arguments that non-contextual realism is false. So all measurements

322
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,160
are contextual. And to put that in normal language, that means that in some sense,

323
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,720
the consciousness of the observer. Although, I shouldn't put that on Chris Fuchs. So I think

324
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,920
that he's going to be agnostic about consciousness and all this stuff. He's just saying whatever

325
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,240
quantum mechanics is, it's just describing the degrees of belief of the agent that's making

326
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,440
the measurements. So when I talk about consciousness, I'm not putting that on Chris. That's me.

327
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,400
So now as we start to explore a little bit more beyond the headset,

328
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,720
what role do you feel like evolution could be playing as a projection down from consciousness?

329
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,080
That's a great question. And it does raise the issue that I'm going to be talking about

330
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,960
consciousness beyond space. And strictly speaking, that's an independent hypothesis

331
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,600
from the whole business about evolution leading us to have evolved a headset. So we have to be

332
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,200
very careful about how the science goes here. In the first step, I'm just taking Darwin's theory

333
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,320
and the mathematics of it and saying, let me just take that as my game. Darwin's theory and the

334
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,200
mathematics of it. What does it tell us about our perceptions? Oh, it's just a headset is not the

335
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,000
truth. That's what Darwin's theory entails. Now it's a separate step. Okay, now that Darwin has

336
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,080
told us that we need to look outside of space time. But Darwin doesn't tell us what's outside of

337
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,040
space time, right? So it's brilliant. So when I do the next step and say, okay, I'm going to propose

338
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,080
that there's this social network of conscious agents, I'm leaping way, way beyond Darwin. And

339
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,680
there's nothing in Darwin that says that's the leap you have to take. So I should be very, very

340
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,400
clear. Nothing in my work in evolutionary theory is saying you must go to conscious agents. However,

341
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,680
I have to go the other way. If I'm going to propose conscious agents, the social network,

342
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,000
the Twitterverse of conscious agents as the fundamental reality, then it's my responsibility

343
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,360
to show that I can first project it back into something that I would call space time, create a

344
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,560
space time. And that when I do that projection, in that space time, I would see what looks like

345
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,480
nature, red, and tooth and claw as Darwin predicts. So it's not that Darwin predicts

346
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,120
conscious agents, it's rather that Darwin says there's something beyond space time.

347
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,720
And then I go, okay, well, what is it? Darwin can't tell me, I need to make my own leap. So

348
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm going to propose conscious agents, because at least that way I might be able to understand

349
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,600
consciousness. Then okay, then as a scientist, no BS, give me back space time, give me back the

350
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,320
standard model of particle physics, every bit of it with new predictions, and give me back

351
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,160
evolution of a natural selection. Otherwise, my theory of conscious agents, you shouldn't pay

352
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,040
attention to it at all. So unless I can do that, bye bye. So that's the hard nose attitude that we

353
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,080
have to have for these an idealist theory of conscious beyond space time. For as a scientist,

354
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
again, I'm not putting down philosophy. Philosophy is wonderful. And I learned a lot from philosophers.

355
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,840
But I'm talking about science here. Scientists who are idealists have to do this hard work

356
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,880
and give us back a theory of space time that that that gives us new technologies and new insights.

357
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,760
So that's what what what I'm up to right now is working with my my colleagues. It's a mathematically

358
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,440
precise theory of consciousness. It's think of it as again, like a social network like the

359
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,000
Twitterverse. There's an infinite number of these conscious agents. And we have a mathematics

360
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,600
with a Markovian so called a Markovian dynamical system. It's trivial to show that it's

361
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,680
computationally universal. So our network of conscious agents can do anything that a neural

362
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:28,720
network could do. Chat GPT, Gemini, Bard, all these, these all these AI programs that are

363
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,200
based on neural nets, conscious agent networks can do all of that. So our conscious agent nets

364
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,240
only assume that there are agents that have a range of experiences, like the taste of chocolate,

365
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,720
the smell of garlic. So that's one of our miracles. Every scientific theory has a miracle.

366
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,440
Here's my miracles. There are conscious experiences. And second miracle is that there are probabilistic

367
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
relationships among conscious experiences. That first one, though, doesn't necessarily

368
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,840
require an assumption, right? So how could you say it's a miracle? Well, most because our conscious

369
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,040
experience is probably the one thing that I sell evident, right? You? Well, I would agree that

370
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,960
space and time, what we call physics is an extrapolation from our experiences.

371
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,760
My experiences are all I know directly. So I would agree with you on that.

372
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,400
But when I say it's a miracle for my theory, what I'm saying is my theory will not try to explain

373
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:33,360
the origin of conscious experiences. So it's not sense. It's a miracle. So it's going and some

374
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,360
people might say, well, that's why I like physicalism, because I'm just going to start off with

375
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,400
the standard model of particle physics. And I don't need to assume the taste of mint and all

376
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,560
these experiences, just the particle particles of in their properties. And I'm going to show you

377
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,680
where those conscious experiences come from. And then I went and and I would say if they could do

378
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,080
that. But as I said, that would be very, very impressive if they could do that. Right now,

379
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,320
they're batting zero. And I predict that they're going to bat zero. But they would have their

380
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,760
own miracle, which is the laws of the standard model of particle physics and the and then the

381
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,080
quarks and gluons and bosons and and leptons that they that they're. So it's not like they don't

382
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,440
have any miracles. They have their own miracles. It's just not my miracles. So every every theory

383
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,880
is going to have its miracles. Now, one thing about taking consciousness as fundamental is

384
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,960
there's a wide variety of conscious experiences, right? I said there's a trillion specific ones

385
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,880
that we have. So that's in some sense, it's assuming a lot, right? But it's one category

386
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,920
of of assumption that's a category of conscious experiences. And the reason why right now,

387
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,920
I think it's a good step as a scientist to move in that direction is when you look at

388
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,400
my my good friends and colleagues who are doing the physicalist theories,

389
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,600
they're having to assume all of space time physics, the standard model and so forth.

390
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,520
And then when they get to the step of explaining conscious experiences, they can't. And so what

391
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,480
they're effectively having to do is also they have to stipulate the conscious experiences. They

392
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
stipulate the physics and they stipulate the conscious experiences. And that's actually the

393
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,800
word that Stephen Pinker used as he describes, you know, like the global workspace global neuronal

394
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,360
workspace theory is saying it. Yeah, it stipulates all the physics, but then it also has to stipulate

395
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,280
the conscious experiences. And so my attitude is, well, if the physicalist theories are stipulating

396
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,720
the conscious experiences as well as the physics, and I'm only stipulating the conscious experiences,

397
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,720
and I'm going to show where the physics comes out, I'm going to explain the physics, I'm not

398
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,880
going to stipulate the physics, I'm going to explain it and hopefully get a deeper model with

399
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,520
new technologies that you couldn't get with space time. Then you win that that approach will win

400
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,840
because I've stipulated less than the physicalist theories. So that's why I think I want to go

401
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,720
ahead with this, even though it's a big give to take all these conscious experiences as fundamental.

402
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,600
But what I'm not taking is other things like learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence,

403
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,720
the self, there's all these other things that we would expect to have from a theory of consciousness.

404
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,320
And I'm not assuming those that I'm going to explain the only thing I'm assuming are the raw

405
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,080
conscious experiences themselves and probabilistic relationships among them. That's all. That's all

406
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm giving myself. So it's very, very spare starting point, as spare as I could make it. It was

407
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,120
literally the minimal thing that I thought I could get away with. And then there's no notion of self,

408
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,440
learning, memory, intelligence, all that other stuff, we have to build that. But the fact that it's

409
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,800
computationally universal means, it doesn't mean it's easy, but it means, yeah, we can do it.

410
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,960
So we mentioned a little bit earlier the amplitude hydrant, which is this

411
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,200
joule-shaped geometric structure that challenges our notion of space and time.

412
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,440
How would you explain what that is to somebody that is not a physicist or mathematician? Like

413
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,320
in simplistic terms, what does that represent for the possibility in challenging notions of space and

414
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:08,640
time? Yeah, it's an interesting short story. I'll tell this short story. When you try to understand

415
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,240
how particles interact in space-time, you might smash two gluons into each other and four gluons

416
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,120
go spraying out. And you want to look at the probabilities of various kinds of interactions

417
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,680
that particles can have. They're called them scattering amplitudes, but probabilities of

418
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,240
interactions. When you do the mathematics in space-time using quantum field theory,

419
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:40,720
the math is very difficult. That little two in, four gluons out, hundreds of pages of algebra,

420
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,120
hundreds of pages of algebra for one interaction, millions of terms. And that makes it really hard

421
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,800
when you have to look at millions or even billions of these interactions per second

422
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,560
to try to figure out what's the new stuff. So there was some serious pressure to try to make

423
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,400
the mathematics easier. The experimentals were saying, come on, guys, you've got to give us

424
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,600
something a little bit easier to work with here on the mathematics. And so some mathematicians

425
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,720
in the 80s discovered they could get it down to 13 pages instead of several hundred pages that

426
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,480
were like, oh, thank you. Holy smoke down to like 13 or something. And then they guessed a single formula,

427
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,360
like just a few terms. You could write it down by hand. And it was right for that one particular

428
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,200
interact. And it was like, there's something going on here. There's like some magic going on here.

429
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,760
Maybe it's a one-off. But then they found other examples. And then in 2005, 2006, Ed Whitton in

430
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,480
his postdocs discovered something called, it's now called the BCFW recursion relation

431
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,160
that allowed them, for many, many kinds of interactions, technically it's called n equals

432
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:59,680
four super Yang-Mills. But anyway, a particular class, they could compute them with this very,

433
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:06,560
very simple recursive formula that collapsed all this stuff. And some guy named Hodges, then

434
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,680
brilliant physicist in England, said, in one case, a few cases, it looks like this formula is

435
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,960
putting together pieces of a volume of some object. Maybe there's some general thing here.

436
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,000
And then Nima and his team said, oh, that's an interesting idea. So they went after that.

437
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,480
And in 2014, 2013, they published the archive, but 2014, the actual publication came out. So just

438
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,640
10 years ago, the official publication came out of the amplitude hedron, which confirmed what Hodges

439
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,800
had proposed. But there was some geometric object that BCFW recursion relations were gluing pieces

440
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,080
together to make this object. And that object was encoding in its volumes, the scattering

441
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,400
probabilities. And the structure, it turned out, of this object. The structure was encoding the

442
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,600
probabilities. The volumes are encoding the probabilities. But the structure, like the edges,

443
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,880
the all the edges and so forth, were encoding properties of locality and uniterity,

444
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,160
effectively, space-time properties, quantum uniterity and space-time locality,

445
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:23,520
relativistic locality. And so, but this was not an object inside space-time. And it was actually

446
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,320
entirely beyond space-time and also beyond quantum theory. So some people said, well,

447
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:36,000
yeah, space-time isn't fundamental, but we'll use entanglement, for example, of quantum theory,

448
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,280
to boot up space-time. And they're saying, no, no, no, no. Space-time and quantum theory

449
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,880
are emerging together from something far deeper, such as the amplitohedron.

450
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,200
And then more generally, these positive geometries. So the amplitohedron is sort of like the first,

451
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,640
but positive geometries more generally. So the idea is there's,

452
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,680
we have assumed in science for hundreds of years that space-time is fundamental reality.

453
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,720
In the last 10 years, for the first time, scientists have taken off the space-time

454
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,440
headset. And we've said, we can look outside space-time. What are we going to find? We're

455
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,040
looking outside of space-time. The first paper, in some sense, that was going outside of space-time is,

456
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,080
say, in the last 10 years, give or take. So we've been looking outside of space-time for 10 years,

457
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,320
and what do we find? What do you take off the headset? Obelisks.

458
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,440
Geometric structures, not a dynamic, just sitting there. Here I am. Big geometric. Could be millions

459
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,560
of dimensions. It could be hundreds of dimensions, trillions of dimensions, just sitting there.

460
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,160
And so here, it was very much like 2001 Space Odyssey, where the obelisk is there.

461
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,880
And all the apes are pounding and hooting, and they know it's important. It's clearly,

462
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,320
and they have no clue, right? And that's where we are. We've taken off the headset,

463
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,360
there's these obelisks sitting there, smiling at us. It's quiet. They're not moving.

464
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,000
They're telling us something really, really important. But it's so tantalizing that, as I

465
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,360
mentioned, the European Research Council just put out a $10 million initiative. It's called

466
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,880
the Universe Plus initiative. February, they brought together like 100 mathematicians and

467
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,000
high-energy theoretical physicists to launch this whole thing, and we're off to the races.

468
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,480
We've taken off the headset. We found these obelisks. We want to find out who put those

469
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,600
obelisks there and why. What is this telling us? Right. So the race is on, and what I'm proposing

470
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,680
is we need a dynamics. Physics always wants something dynamical. We need a dynamics

471
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,840
that will give rise to these obelisks, the positive geometries. And so that's what I'm working on with

472
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,720
this theory of consciousness. What the paper I'm working on right now, and the paper I published

473
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,680
last year, is we're taking the theory of consciousness in this dynamical system, and we're

474
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,760
showing how to get the new objects that the physicists have found outside of spacetime from

475
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,520
them. So I didn't mention, in addition to the positive geometries, there are combinatorial objects,

476
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,480
in particular something called decorated permutations that classify these structures,

477
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,200
classify the objects. And we've done that. We've actually mapped our consciousness dynamics onto

478
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:43,840
the decorated permutations. That's then giving us, that helped us grok how to then mesh our theory

479
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,200
of conscious agent dynamics, the markup dynamics, with these positive geometries. And the paper we're

480
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,560
working on right now, we're planning to actually take, in a simple case, n equals four super young

481
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,840
males to go all the way from consciousness all the way into spacetime and predict a scattering

482
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:05,520
amplitude. So the idea, that was just the first baby step, but the idea is, we start with the

483
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,600
theory of consciousness mathematically precise outside of spacetime, and show precisely where

484
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,120
are these decorated permutations, and the positive geometries come from, and then show how spacetime

485
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,600
and its properties emerge as a trivial projection of this social dynamics of conscious agents.

486
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
So that's sort of the big picture where we're headed.

487
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,880
Okay, there's like four tangents that just spurred off that I want to explore.

488
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,360
There is this Sufi master, actually, that I believe has a quote roughly saying,

489
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,880
this whole universe was made so that God may know himself, the seed wished to know what it was,

490
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,400
and what is in it, and so it became a tree. And it seems like structures, like these geometric

491
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:56,480
structures that exist out of spacetime that we're discovering point to projecting down into

492
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,560
this reality to create almost analogous to like, we discover certain crystals or rocks that earth,

493
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,160
for whatever reason, the dynamics create these mathematically precise structures that are extremely

494
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,880
beautiful, that we're looking down projecting down into there are these higher dimensional

495
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,600
structures that are projecting down. And so I'm just curious, what implications do you feel like

496
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:25,600
is, comes about as we start discovering these hired, like obelisks that for some reason are there,

497
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,920
we don't know why. But that, yeah, that again, like we mentioned, challenges or notions of spacetime,

498
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,440
but then also begs the question of what are they doing? How are they there?

499
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,760
Right, right. And first, I should clarify one thing, I mean, I probably sound very excited

500
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,080
about these ideas about conscious agents outside of spacetime. And I'm playing it up.

501
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,120
Because that's the current research I'm doing, it's a lot of fun. But frankly, it's just a baby

502
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,680
step, right? It's not the truth. There is no such thing as a theory of everything. And that includes

503
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,040
Hoffman's theory. So I'm not claiming I've got the final word. I'm just saying that here's a very

504
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,560
interesting, for those of us who think something like consciousness is fundamental, here is a first

505
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,640
scientific theory outside of spacetime. But it's not the final theory of everything. And I'll be

506
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,680
very, very happy when someone comes and overthrows my theory and get something deeper. But my guess

507
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,520
is that the deeper thing will be a much deeper understanding of consciousness than one that

508
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:30,400
my theory is proposing. So Humble Pis is required, right? This isn't, I'm not the theory of everything.

509
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,400
It's okay to be excited and be fine, but don't mistake that for me thinking it's the truth.

510
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,720
It's not the truth. It's just an interesting baby step. In terms of

511
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,320
for example, what you were saying about what the Sufi master said.

512
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,720
I think something like that is really right. Again, it's a good pointer. Again, not when I say

513
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,600
right, not the truth, but again, a pointer in an interesting direction. I think that

514
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,080
so I should be very, very clear on this point. This is really critical.

515
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,760
I talked earlier about scientific theories always making assumptions. And therefore,

516
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,240
there could never be a scientific theory of everything.

517
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,680
That means there's an infinite number of scientific theories that we could create

518
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,280
because there's an infinite number of deeper and deeper assumptions we could make.

519
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:37,440
And reality, whatever it is, is transcends even that infinite sequence of scientific theories.

520
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,080
And that's really an important point and it's coming from a very

521
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,600
simple fact about scientific theories. Every scientific theory must make assumptions.

522
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,240
And it doesn't explain its assumptions. Those are miracles for the scientific theory.

523
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,480
There's no way around it. You cannot give me a scientific theory that doesn't have miracles

524
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,920
at the starting point. We call them assumptions. That's a very sobering fact about science and one

525
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,880
that we should really look at closely. It means infinite job security for science,

526
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,880
which is good. But that's also very, very humbling. It means that even if we gave infinite effort,

527
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,360
had a billion Einstein's working for a billion years,

528
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,600
we wouldn't scratch the surface of whatever objective reality is.

529
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,160
So when spiritual traditions, many spiritual traditions have made it very,

530
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,920
very clear, like the Tao De Ching says, the Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao.

531
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:43,040
They're saying something that's truly, truly important. And that is all of our concepts

532
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,400
fail ultimately. They're pointers to the reality, but they're not the reality.

533
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,680
In the following, in a very, very simple sense, the word mint versus the experience of mint.

534
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,920
Of course, the word mint is nothing like the experience of mint.

535
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,120
And the word mint doesn't explain the experience of mint. And it's not a theory of the experience of

536
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,800
mint. If you want to know mint, the experience of mint, you have to taste it yourself. You have

537
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,160
to know it firsthand. And then someone else can say, that is what I mean by the word mint.

538
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,040
So you have to have the experience yourself. And then the words can point to it.

539
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,480
This is not BS. This is the way, and this is all of our concepts, the color red,

540
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,840
the smell of garlic, the sound of a trumpet. You have to have the, if you don't have the

541
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,960
experience yourself, good luck me giving it to you by talking. So my words aren't going to do it.

542
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,080
And so that's, so what the spiritual traditions have been saying is extremely important here.

543
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,880
It's not just schmistical nonsense. I'm saying that scientists have to really understand

544
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,760
that our scientific, I'm a scientist. I love scientific theories. They beat hand waves by a

545
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,200
long shot. So I'm sort of impatient with hand waves. Scientific theories are wonderful because

546
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,640
they're precise and they tell you their limits. And so they tell you when that theory is done.

547
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,200
That's beautiful. But many scientists still have the hope that they're going to get a theory of

548
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,400
everything. No chance. There is no theory of everything. So the spiritual traditions are

549
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,400
telling us the right thing when they say any word is a pointer. The same thing is true of

550
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,800
scientific theories. They're all at best pointers, but our pointers in science tell us their limits.

551
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,200
The space time pointer stops at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. Thank you.

552
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,560
After that, space time is not worthwhile. It doesn't work and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

553
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:50,080
That's the anti dogmatic cure that we get from science. That's really, really powerful. So,

554
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,600
I'm all on board with the spiritual traditions saying in some sense that

555
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,400
whatever reality is, you can only make pointers to it. And even our scientific theories will only

556
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,360
be pointers to it. And they're only pointers to a perspective on it. So the idea that the

557
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,360
infinite one that you were saying from the Sufi master, that the infinite needs to look at itself

558
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,840
from different perspectives, I agree. And maybe what science does is it gives us rigorous, the

559
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,920
most rigorous descriptions we can give pointers from a perspective. And the fact that we can do

560
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,080
technology doesn't mean that we know the truth. It means that we have a good description of this

561
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:42,480
perspective. And so the match of the scientific description to a perspective, not the ultimate

562
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:49,200
truth transcends, but the perspective description getting that right does allow technology. And

563
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,520
so that's where we can see most of our theories are not even right about our perspective, right?

564
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:02,080
We're just so wrong that we don't even get our perspective correct. So that's how humbling

565
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,520
this is. Yeah. And words are frustratingly inadequate for describing these things. And

566
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,600
much like what you were saying, it's so puzzling because our words are meant to communicate our

567
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:21,520
inner experience. And yet our inner experience inherently transcends linguistics. That's right.

568
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,600
And I'm excited to dive also into Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, because this points

569
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,880
that there are truths that can't be proven. And so we'll dive into that in a moment. But

570
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,480
just any further thoughts on how the limits of language is a very real thing. And it's a thing

571
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:47,120
on this podcast that we can talk about many different things forever. And yet you won't have

572
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:53,360
the experience of meant until you taste it. Until you taste it. That's right. And in spiritual,

573
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:59,840
the big one in spirituality is that the ultimate unconditioned consciousness

574
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:09,280
transcends any description. You can only know it by letting go of thought. And actually being

575
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:16,720
face to face, no thought with that unconditional infinite intelligence that you are. Now, for many

576
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:27,280
scientists, that sounds very mystical. It sounds very, very... This is so unscientific. It's so...

577
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,240
We want rigorous terms that we can verify and experiments. And my point earlier was,

578
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:44,800
no, this is not different than what's going on in science at all. All of the basic

579
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:54,160
concepts that we have, how do we know the taste of meant? If you've never tasted it,

580
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,440
I can't... The word is only a pointer. Spacetime. If you've never experienced spacetime,

581
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,120
the mathematics is only a pointer. So this is not something, some deficit of spiritual traditions

582
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,480
that they say, well, we're pointing to this, this mystical thing that's infinite intelligence that

583
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,560
you are. But, you know, no words. And most of my colleagues in science would go,

584
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,880
that's kind of nonsense. We don't need to deal with here in science. And I'm saying, no, no,

585
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,840
that's the kind of nonsense you deal with all the time. Almost every term that you use is only

586
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:34,400
known by what we call ostensive definition. Ostensive definition means someone has to point

587
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,760
and then give you the word. Like when you have a baby, 18 months, and it's time for them to learn

588
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:49,280
some words. And mom and dad, there's a rabbit on the carpet. And at the right age, you can just point

589
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:59,200
and say, rabbit. And, you know, Chris gets it. Maybe Chris gets that. Now, when you think about it,

590
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,680
that's a miracle. There's an infinite number of hypotheses that Chris could entertain. It could

591
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:12,320
be the fur, the texture of the fur, the color. It could be the ear and the left foot. It could be

592
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,600
the tail and the chair behind the rabbit. There's an infinite number. So how is it that all mom and

593
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:26,720
dad have to do at the right age is to point and say to Chris, rabbit. And Chris gets it.

594
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,720
Often in one or just one or two trials. That's ostensive definition. And that means that Chris

595
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,720
already has to have that experience. And mom and dad don't teach them the experience. They assume

596
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,280
the experience and they give a pointer, which is trivial compared to the experience of the rabbit.

597
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,040
Rabbit is nothing. The word rabbit is just a trivial pointer. And this is how we know

598
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,760
basically everything, every visual experience that you have, every smell experience you have,

599
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,920
every tactile experience you have, the fact that you get the name. People just tell you

600
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,760
the experience that you're having that I'm assuming that you're having. We call that, you know, hot.

601
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,520
We call that cold. We call that rough. We call that smooth. We call that satin. Whatever.

602
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,280
You have to have the experience. And that's almost any sensory experience is all by

603
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,880
ostensive definition. We don't teach people anything. If they don't have the experience,

604
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:30,240
you can't teach them. So this kind of thing, it's easy for scientists to dismiss the claim

605
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:39,440
that language fails to capture this deep consciousness that's unconditioned, that's

606
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,160
infinite, and that ultimately is the core of who you are. That sounds so schmistical to them.

607
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,640
And I'm saying, no, no, no, this is ubiquitous. And all the terms that we know basically are

608
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,360
by ostensive definition from things that transcend the words and can't be reduced

609
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:04,880
to the words. And I should just, it's humorous, but when you're pointing to the rabbit and saying

610
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,280
rabbit at the right age with Chris, what you don't do is point and say quadruped.

611
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,760
You'd be messing up your kid. If you said quadruped or, you know, mammal, something like that.

612
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:24,640
It's just the wrong thing to do. So we actually have rules that are wired into us. We know

613
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,280
intuitively, you don't have to go to class. You just know that when you're going to say rabbit,

614
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,760
you're not going to say quadruped or mammal or anything like that.

615
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,240
It's reducing it down to its function or parts instead of what its essence is.

616
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,440
That's right. And the kid is also pre-programmed to know that mom and dad know this intuitively.

617
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,520
So they're going to give me what we call the basic level object category name first,

618
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,360
and then they'll maybe give me some superordinate or subordinate

619
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,680
pointers later on. But right now, I'm going to just get the basic level. And so we're actually wired

620
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:03,440
up with the right way of pointing out. So the pointing that you get in the spiritual traditions,

621
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,840
and these are just pointers. I'm just pointing out that that's how we learn everything.

622
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,280
It's pointing out all the time. This is not just some mystical weird stuff that these people,

623
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,560
it's all over the place, and it's essential in science.

624
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,440
And I think that the pointing out of things doesn't absolve us of the mystery of what it is,

625
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,120
because oftentimes you give a bird a name, or you discover a new species or whatever,

626
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:33,680
and you name it. And it's like, okay, now we know what that is. There is a level of grandiosity,

627
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,560
just labeling something as in that's a rabbit. And okay, yeah, there's just not,

628
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,760
there's not, I just know that rabbits look like that, or a tree is just a tree. And you don't get

629
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,560
to, I guess, be surprised by the mystery of what the essence of that thing is, which is

630
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,000
like the one in the many different ancient wisdom traditions that have talked about this

631
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,320
immaterial realm that pre-exists space, time, and the quantum foam from

632
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:06,240
Kabbalistic origins talking about Ain Sof, which is literally without end, or Buddhism talking

633
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:14,480
about emptiness, or Advaita Vedanta talking about this non-dual reality, that the consciousness

634
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,760
extremely vast and differentiating itself into all of these different experiences,

635
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:26,160
which I find so fascinating. I've heard you talk to how, as humans, we have three channels of color

636
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:32,000
with red, green, and blue. The Mantis Shrimp has 10, 11, or more channels of color. What is that

637
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,960
experience like? Exactly. No, I agree with all the points that you're making here. And it's really

638
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,680
critical, as you were talking about the spiritual traditions, do tell us that the word is just the

639
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:51,360
word, and the reality transcends the word. The word is just a pointer. And so they often will

640
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:58,480
recommend that you spend time letting go of the words. So that's meditation. So if you want to

641
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:07,600
not be trapped in the trivial world of concepts, which is trivial compared to reality, then spend

642
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:15,440
time in meditation where you literally let your mind not dwell on the concepts. You just have no,

643
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,880
you let go of any concept. And when you actually look at the, when you walk around in the world,

644
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:28,720
look at trees, look at the ocean, where you just literally say, I'm, my mind can be quiet for a

645
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:35,120
while. Just no thoughts. I'm just going to be here in thoughtless pure awareness. Then the world

646
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:41,760
comes alive. And you begin to realize most of the time, you've killed the world. It's deadened. You

647
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:48,720
see the dead world of your concepts, and you don't see the living world that's around you. And I can

648
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,360
put this, so that's what spiritual tradition, I'll put this in scientific language, base inference.

649
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,720
We talk about our prior understandings, our prior probabilities as you know, in Bayesian

650
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:08,320
priors. So you have this prior probability of, for example, maybe belief in the standard model

651
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,840
of particle physics and the particular laws in that and those problems. That's my, my, my prior.

652
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,000
Before that, maybe with Newton, we had Newton's theory of physics and so forth. That would be our

653
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,840
prayer. And once you have a prior, once you have the prior probability, any new data that you get

654
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,200
will be interpreted in terms of your prior understanding. And there's this whole Bayesian

655
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,440
inference kind of thing. And you get a posterior distribution, which is so given that you have

656
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,400
this prior belief, and you get this new data coming in, then you compute what your posterior

657
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,560
distribution will be. Walking around without concepts, letting go of thought is saying,

658
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:55,760
I need to let go of my prior. If I don't let go of my prior, I'm condemned to only see my posterior

659
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,760
in, in both funny senses that, right? You can only see your posterior, both in the technical sense

660
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,520
and in, in this more metaphorical sense. If you don't let go of your priors, you will only see

661
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,560
your posterior. And, and so if you don't want to just be seeing your own posterior, you want to be

662
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,360
open up to novelty, then you actually have to spend time. I think as a scientist, it's critical for

663
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:23,920
me to actually spend time in, of course, thought and mathematics and hard notes of no substitute.

664
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,920
Do your hard work. And then let go of it completely. Sit there in utter silence. That's where the

665
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,400
true new creativity comes from. And then go back and try to translate it, if you can,

666
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,280
into the, the math and symbols that, that you have. And that way you're not stuck

667
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,200
with your priors. You, if you want creativity, you actually have to get outside your priors

668
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,440
all together. So I, so I would suggest that again, there's not some kind of schmystical, nasty,

669
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,480
terrible, silly stuff that's going on, you know, in spiritual traditions that, that's

670
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,440
anathema to science. I think there's a way to understand what the spiritual traditions are

671
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,600
telling us that makes sense from a Bayesian inference point of view from the science, from

672
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:12,400
the scientists. If you don't let go of your priors, you're condemned to only see your posterior.

673
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,640
So let go of your priors. What does that mean? Of course, do your homework,

674
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,600
but then at some point step back and let go of all your concepts for a while and see what comes out.

675
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:27,760
Yeah, it really seems like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where blind men come

676
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,680
and, you know, touch the tail of the elephant, think it's a whips and other touches the leg,

677
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:37,040
thinks it's a tree trunk. Another touches the trunk of the elephant and thinks it's, you know,

678
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,560
a snake and another touches the belly, thinks it's a wall. And they're all experiencing parts

679
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:48,800
of something and not understanding the whole of what it is. And I just find it very interesting

680
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:55,600
to explore the overlap and conciliance of what the cutting edge science saying with the ancient

681
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:02,400
wisdom traditions and philosophy and metaphysics. And if we can touch all the different parts of

682
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,560
that metaphorical elephant to see and talk to each other about what our experience is of that thing

683
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,560
that it points us closer to the direction of the experience of what it actually, you know,

684
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:19,600
what it actually is and what reality actually is. Yes, I think that the idea of the elephant being

685
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:25,440
looked at from different various perspectives is apt here. And the science gives us rigorous tools

686
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,560
to do that palpating of different parts of the elephant with more precision than we might otherwise

687
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,760
palpate it. And when I say that there's infinite job security and science, I mean,

688
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,680
that's really, truly humbling. It means that we, with all the palpation we've done,

689
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,680
we have 0% of the elephant underneath us, 0%. And that's, I honestly believe that.

690
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:56,240
I think that we've palpated 0% of it. What we know is one perspective out of an infinite

691
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,720
number of perspectives. Not like there's five perspectives and we got one of them.

692
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,680
No, there's an infinite number of different perspectives and whatever it is, but that's

693
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:14,240
who you are. What you are transcends any description, an infinite number of descriptions.

694
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,160
And so it's truly, truly a remarkable claim that spiritual traditions are making and that

695
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:29,840
you and I are just avatars. Andre and Don are avatars being used by an infinite consciousness

696
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,840
that transcends an infinite number of different descriptions and would transcend an infinite

697
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,480
study by science. And it's talking to itself through two different avatars and looking at

698
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,120
itself right now through a particular humble perspective, only a four-dimensional space

699
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,520
time headset perspective on itself. And it's doing that and who knows how many,

700
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,160
there's an infinite number of these other things going on all the time. But what's interesting

701
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:06,880
about it as well from a social perspective is, once I understand that Andre and Don are just

702
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,800
really the same consciousness talking to itself through two different avatars,

703
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,920
that's the real foundation for social interaction and social justice. Love your neighbor as yourself

704
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:26,480
is true and right because your neighbor is yourself. It's interesting that the infinite

705
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:35,040
consciousness that we are has chosen to forget itself, to plunge itself into a perspective

706
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:41,840
so thoroughly that it's lost in the perspective and it actually views its other avatars as enemies

707
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:48,720
in some cases and slowly wakes up. So somehow it's really important when you look at yourself

708
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,960
from a perspective that you really look at yourself from that perspective, you take it really,

709
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:59,520
really seriously and you get lost in it and then very, very painfully wake up and then you realize,

710
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:07,040
oh, as interesting and complicated and wonderful as that perspective was, I infinitely transcend that

711
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:14,080
and that's how the infinite comes to know itself. It's beautiful and it's why I love talking to

712
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,280
you so much too because you're able to navigate both terrains of the scientific understanding which

713
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:27,520
is rigorous and the philosophical and inner experience side of things. If consciousness

714
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:36,160
really is this unifying field, then us as individuals in parentheses having this individual

715
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:42,240
experience are much like waves of an ocean. We're not actually separate, but we have the

716
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,600
experience in a certain amount of time, in a certain amount of space that Andre and Don exist,

717
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,280
just like a wave exists in an ocean for a certain amount of time and for a certain amount of space

718
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,520
and it has its own experience that is unique and unlike any other wave that has probably ever

719
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:04,960
come before and after that time and space it inhabited is over, then it joins back the ocean,

720
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,840
but the kicker is that it was never separate from the ocean. In the first place. In the first place,

721
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:17,680
but there is value in the ocean having the wave in us as individuals that are connected to source

722
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:24,560
or the one kind of losing ourselves, discovering ourselves, waking up because that somehow provides

723
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,760
a unique nuanced experience and perspective of the one that otherwise wouldn't have been previously

724
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:38,320
available. I completely agree. I think that's right and the one thing that we're trying to do

725
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,920
with mathematics that we're working on right now is to actually take that idea and make it mathematical.

726
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:50,640
Again, the mathematics will always just be a baby step, but still to take those ideas that

727
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,560
what you were saying is I think been part of the wisdom traditions for millennia,

728
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,440
that kind of idea, to turn it into mathematically precise things. So what we're doing right now,

729
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:07,200
for example, we have with the Markovian dynamics of conscious agents and the way the wisdom ideas

730
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:15,440
get cashed out is that the model, again, it's just a model, but here's what the model says.

731
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,080
We can write down dynamics of this infinite conscious agent.

732
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,800
That's so-called stationary dynamics. There is no entropic arrow of time.

733
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,880
So it's a dynamical system, but the entropy is not increasing.

734
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,320
Well, if it is, then also, since your P is increased air is moving in the other direction,

735
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,880
what do you say? For stationary dynamics, that's the technical thing I'd have to ask about.

736
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'll have to look. Sidebar. That's right. But the entropy is constant in the stationary dynamics,

737
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,320
but it's a theorem that if I take this dynamics in which there's no entropic arrow of time and I

738
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,400
look at it from any perspective, by conditional probability, for example, then the dynamics that

739
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,720
I'll see will be a projected dynamics, and that projected dynamics will have an arrow of time.

740
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:17,040
The entropy will be increasing. So here we are with an entropic arrow of time.

741
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,640
The model I'm working on is there's a consciousness has no entropic arrow of time.

742
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,920
It's timeless, and it's also spaceless. But when I look at it from this perspective,

743
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,760
so we're talking about perspectives, but now we can deal with mathematical precision. We can say,

744
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,920
when we take this perspective, then by the mathematics tells us we're going to get an

745
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:44,240
arrow of time. So we will get a big bang. And by the way, it's all one. The consciousness is all

746
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,280
one. But when you get inside of the projection, now all of a sudden there are these artificial

747
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:55,760
boundaries. So you get what we call predictive processing and Markov blankets and active inference

748
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,960
and so forth. All of this stuff, which is sort of modern state-of-the-art neuroscience kinds of

749
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,560
things that we're looking to and other computer science looking at ways of, you know, modeling

750
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,160
thing, all of that breaking into units with Markov blankets, separating things and so forth,

751
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:16,720
active inference mean predictive processing to maintain our boundaries. All of that is not

752
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:21,120
an insight into the deep nature of reality. All of that is an artifact of loss of information

753
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,080
in the projection, as is Darwin's theory of natural selection. Nature, red and tooth and

754
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,960
claw. What is the fundamental limited resource in evolution? Time. If I don't eat in time,

755
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,120
I die. If I don't mate in time, I don't reproduce. If I don't breathe in time, I die. Time is the

756
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:45,200
fundamental limited resource. So I love Darwin's theory. Inside space-time, talking about biology

757
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:49,200
inside of our space-time, there's no better theory than Darwin's. Having said that wonderful

758
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:54,800
thing about Darwin, every aspect of his theory is an artifact of the projection from space-time.

759
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,760
None of it translates to anything about the reality beyond. None of it. So that's a real

760
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,960
warning sign to us to be very, very humble about our theories. Darwin's theory is a beautiful

761
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,800
theory inside space-time. It has no traction outside whatsoever. It's all of it as an artifact.

762
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,040
So we're not moving towards the theory of everything. We should be very, very humble.

763
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:27,760
I'm curious. Do you think that there are levels of fundamental reality that are simply inconceivable

764
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,280
to the human mind and understanding? Like, we wouldn't expect a monkey to understand quantum

765
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:41,360
mechanics or entanglement or have even the baseline ingredients to be able to have any

766
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,800
semblance of anything regarding quantum mechanics. Are there things that you think that are simply

767
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,040
beyond the capacity of the human mind to understand and deeper levels of reality?

768
01:13:51,040 --> 01:14:00,880
That's, I do. I think that the human mind has great capacities and fundamental limitations.

769
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:08,000
And when spiritual traditions tell us to set aside the human mind now and then,

770
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,880
spend time on meditation and put the human mind apart, of course, then when you try to

771
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,880
reconceptualize what you experienced, you can only reconceptualize it inside the human mind.

772
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,000
That's the tool you've got. But in fact, you infinitely transcend the human mind. So you

773
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:32,240
aren't the human mind. When you talk to me through these avatars, we're having to use the human mind

774
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:37,520
and therefore, all of a sudden, the bandwidth goes down to a straw, a little tiny straw of

775
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,520
information that goes back and forth. But you and I are, in fact, the infinite intelligence

776
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,560
looking at itself through this particular little straw. So yeah, the human mind has this incredibly-

777
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,120
Write that down.

778
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,680
But you are not the human mind. You transcend infinitely the human mind. But

779
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,520
as long as you're in this avatar, you can only have a human mind appreciation of that transcendence.

780
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:09,040
I love that. So, I mean, right now, we're exploring the boundaries or limitations of

781
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,240
our possible understanding. And I know that you've talked to the value of discovering the

782
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:20,160
limitations of our mathematical theorems and because they show us what's possible and how we

783
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:27,440
can invent GPS and so much of things that we use and take for granted in our convenient modern society.

784
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:33,760
And it also shows us where it fails, right? And so, what is the value of discovering the

785
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,480
limitations? Do you feel like, and how it redirects us in our energy and their search?

786
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,240
Well, I think it's valuable for a couple of reasons. One reason is simply that it's true

787
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,000
that the mathematics, as powerful as mathematics is, and I love mathematics,

788
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,960
all the theorems that you can prove are a trivial subset of the theorems that are out there.

789
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,520
And all the theorems that are entailed by any set of axioms you write down

790
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:08,480
are trivial subset of all the theorems that are true. So, it's really important to know that.

791
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,040
Once again, I think one way to think about it is that it's the infinite intelligence giving

792
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:22,880
itself a wake-up call, giving its avatars, its projections a wake-up call. It's plunging itself

793
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,880
in all the way with both feet, it's losing itself in there, but it's giving itself a little hint

794
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,400
from the mathematics that says, no matter how smart and mathematically precise you are,

795
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:38,400
it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond. Wake-up call, wake-up call,

796
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:45,200
you aren't your projection, you aren't the avatar. Reality transcends, infinitely transcends anything

797
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,560
that you can do in your science and your mathematics, which is not to say, don't do your

798
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,680
science, do your, I'm a scientist, I'm not a mathematician, I wish, I wish I were, I work

799
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,760
with mathematicians, but I am a scientist. And so, I'm all for the science and the mathematics,

800
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:07,280
but it's wonderful to get a better appreciation of this projection of these avatars.

801
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:13,760
But ultimately, that's a big hint to ourself from Gertl's Incompleteness theorem, for example,

802
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,400
that there's infinite exploration beyond what you could even do with your science and your

803
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:28,640
mathematics. So, that's a very important wake-up call. So, let's explore that Incompleteness

804
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,000
theorem. I've been geeking out, diving deeper into Kierkegaard's Incompleteness theorem, also

805
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,440
his life and who he was as an individual, very, very interesting, regarded as one of the most

806
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:46,960
brilliant logicians to possibly have ever lived. And I recall Einstein referring to him as kind of

807
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,200
like the smart one, like he would like love to come back and go on long walks with him.

808
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,600
And a very interesting individual also had these metaphysical practices of laying down

809
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,240
and intuiting mathematical objects and different things like that, which I want to talk to you

810
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,240
about in a little bit. But for people that don't know what the Incompleteness theorem is,

811
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:11,840
how would you break it down in describing truths that are truths but can't be proven?

812
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:20,880
Well, what Gertl showed was that if I write down a certain set of axioms, like for arithmetic,

813
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:29,920
every number has a successor and things like that. If my axioms are enough rigorous and enough

814
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:36,000
complicated, so substantial enough to actually be able to formulate all of arithmetic,

815
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:45,840
then Gertl showed that he could write down a sentence that was true and could not be proven

816
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:54,240
from your axioms. And that's pretty stunning, right? So that was the brilliance was to actually

817
01:18:54,240 --> 01:19:01,040
use the language of mathematics to write down a sentence that says, I'm true, but can't be proven.

818
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,960
And so he did that. And which you can say, well, okay, well, no problem, I'll just take that and

819
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,880
add that to my axioms. So now I'm good. So this statement wasn't provable, so I won't,

820
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:19,760
I'll just throw it in as an axiom. But then Gertl's thing is recursive. He can then show you another

821
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,640
one. And this goes on ad infinitum. What this means is Gertl showed that basically,

822
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:33,600
you can't just write down a finite set of axioms and then a set of rules and grind out all the

823
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:44,080
truths. Truth transcends proof. There's a bottom in three words. That's what that's Gertl in three

824
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:52,080
words. Truth transcends proof. And that's along the lines of what I was saying earlier that truth

825
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,160
transcends any scientific theory. Because every scientific theory is going to have

826
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:04,240
a mathematical set of assumptions, the axioms, and it will have mathematical derivation rules that

827
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:10,720
are, of course, usually at least is good enough for doing arithmetic. So every scientific theory

828
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:16,000
is subject to Gertl's incompleteness theorem, which means that as many truths as you can crank

829
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,120
out with your scientific theory, I'm sorry, as many proofs about realities, you can crank out

830
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,560
the truth infinitely transcends it. So this is another bit of humble pie. And again,

831
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:34,400
my take home message is not don't do science. Absolutely do science. Because science does

832
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,880
crank out a lot of interesting proofs that seem to be useful. But it also, to its credit, tells you

833
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,320
that it can't give you the whole truth. That's wonderful.

834
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:51,120
So he ascribed binary, I believe, different numbers to certain equations and theorems to be able to

835
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,200
prove this. A random example that's just coming to mind right now. I don't even know if it's accurate,

836
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:02,960
but I'd love to hear is if I say this statement, all men are liars. And I'm a man. If I am lying,

837
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,840
then that kind of eats itself because is that statement true or false? If I'm lying that

838
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,760
all men are liars, but that that entails that I'm telling the truth about all men are liars,

839
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,480
but I am also so it's like it kind of eats itself in a really confusing way.

840
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,680
That's right. The liars paradox is an important point.

841
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,280
I even know it's like a thing. It's a very, very big thing in mathematics.

842
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:35,360
And there's also the barber of Seville, which is a similar, the barber of Seville

843
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,720
shaves all and only those who don't shave themselves.

844
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:49,680
Who shaves the barber of Seville? Right. You get yourself into, so that's where this turns out

845
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:55,840
to be non-trivial in mathematics because you get things that Bertrand Russell discovered this issue

846
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:02,880
of in the set theory. So a lot of mathematics is set on set theory, the set of all integers,

847
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,120
for example, or the set of all prime numbers. We have all the sets are very, very important.

848
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:16,560
But Bertrand Russell pointed out that what about the set of all sets that don't contain themselves?

849
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:23,680
Does that set contain itself or not? And you get this liars paradox kind of thing coming out.

850
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,960
What they have often done is reduce set theory to what they call a class theory to try to avoid

851
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,840
these kinds of paradoxes. But my take is that this is really not really resolved. There is

852
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:48,320
this liar paradox kind of thing that goes on in mathematics. And so yeah, it's pretty deep.

853
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,880
But I would say that the big one though is that truth transcends proof.

854
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,720
And that you kind of in a way have to be, you have to go outside of a system to like fully

855
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:04,800
understand it. And that consciousness is not amorphous, but structured. And that structuredness,

856
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:14,320
I guess, goes to infinity. I would agree up to a point. I would say that when you say

857
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,760
consciousness is structured, I would say as a scientist, I'm limited to describing consciousness

858
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,840
as structured and having that structure go into infinity. That's what I'm doing. So what you're

859
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:29,360
describing is what I'm trying to do. But I actually think that consciousness transcends

860
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:36,640
structure, infinitely transcends structure. But it can be structured. Just like projection.

861
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:43,440
Sure. Like we're structures of consciousness in a way. That's right. But what you are literally

862
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:50,480
does transcend any words or any mathematics period. But there's an infinite number of

863
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:56,000
perspectives that we could take on the true consciousness. And in many of those perspectives,

864
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,280
then you could have infinite mathematical description that I'm working on. The paper I'm

865
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,840
working on right now is one. So I'm working on a paper right now where you want to share a little

866
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:12,880
bit about just to just to touch. I love I love to hear. Yeah. So it's, we have this Markovian

867
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,640
dynamics. So Markov chains describing a big social network of interacting conscious agents,

868
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,560
an infinite number of them in principle.

869
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:29,920
So it's just like, like you were talking about, I mean, infinite structure description of, of the

870
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:36,880
one consciousness. And I'm doing that because that's the best I can do as a scientist. But I,

871
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,680
as I said earlier, I think that consciousness transcends that completely. So, so, so I'm

872
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,280
putting the humble pie right up front on this. But now with the humble pie there,

873
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:52,800
fun part of this, this, this perspective, it turns out that we discovered just in this year a,

874
01:24:53,920 --> 01:25:01,200
a new order on Markov chains that no one had ever discovered before. And it's a way of saying when

875
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:07,600
one Markov chain in some sense is less than another or entails another. For those who know

876
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,960
Markov theory, I'll just say it real briefly. If you can take a Markov kernel, and if you take a

877
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,640
trace of it of that Markov chain on a subset of its states, like the first three states or

878
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,800
something like that, you'll get a new Markovian kernel called the trace chain. So you can take

879
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,440
a big Markovian kernel, trace it on a subset of its states, and you get a new Markovian kernel

880
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:32,160
that's called the trace chain of it. And now I can go into an intuition on that if you want to,

881
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,480
I can say a little bit more intuitively about what that means. But what this logic is, is we

882
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:44,800
discovered that if you say one Markovian kernel entails another or observes another,

883
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,680
if and only if it's a trace of the other. So it's a trace chain of the other.

884
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:55,920
Then you get a complete logic. All consciousnesses are now tied together in this one big logic.

885
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:01,120
You could talk about when they can actually, it tells you how to combine consciousnesses,

886
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,440
when they can combine into new higher consciousnesses, and when they can't. It's a

887
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:16,640
non-bullying logic, and it shows that consciousness can go infinitely far in complexity, in infinitely

888
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:24,000
many directions. There's no one top consciousness in this model. So even this mathematics is already

889
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,040
complex enough to say whatever consciousness is, there's not just a single little guy at the top.

890
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,440
There's an infinite number of directions. You can go infinitely far. And so we'll be publishing

891
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:42,880
it this year, this paper. So there's this whole logic of all the little consciousnesses and bigger

892
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:49,280
and bigger consciousnesses, how they combine to ultimately point to the one consciousness

893
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:56,800
which transcends our logic. But with this logic, this is going to be part of the key for us making

894
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:03,680
the map into space-time and the physics, and giving a theory of observation. Because we now have

895
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:11,040
a theory, what does it mean for one consciousness to observe another? It's if it's a trace of the

896
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:17,360
other. And that's going to be, we're thinking it's going to be a big, big help in physics because

897
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:24,640
in quantum theory, they don't have a theory of observation. They don't have a theory of the

898
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:32,240
observer. So when you don't observe something, there's a unitary linear evolution of the system.

899
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:39,520
But when you observe, whatever processes, whatever system is doing the observation is nonlinear,

900
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:48,480
it's nonunitary. And so for quantum theory has been out for almost 100 years, in 1926 to now,

901
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:57,920
so 98 years. And no theory of observation, because you can't reduce a nonunitary process

902
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:04,240
to a unitary one, you just can't do it. So we're proposing a theory of observation for physics.

903
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:11,360
With what you just described, is it possible that it could be linked to what someone,

904
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:18,160
some would regard as a kind of contentious exploration with James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis

905
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:25,760
that the Earth is itself a living organism? And I'm curious if this, because it sounds like

906
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,400
you're exploring the inter, how consciousness is kind of like linked together. Do you feel

907
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,760
like conscious agents such as Don, Andre, everybody that lives on Earth and the organisms that live

908
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:42,240
here, like conscious agents could kind of stack to create a bigger one? For example, Gaia, do you

909
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:47,920
see that as a possibility? Well, yes, but it's a completely different framework from the Gaia

910
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:53,200
kind of hypothesis. So let me sort of explain the difference in perspective.

911
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,840
From the theory of conscious agents, it's saying that consciousness is fundamental,

912
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:08,720
and spacetime and its objects are just a headset. So to make it really radical, how radical it is,

913
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:15,760
most of us think of ourselves as little 100 to 200 pound tiny objects inside of an infinite

914
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:23,200
spacetime with trillions of galaxies and so forth. So I'm this tiny little 200 pound object

915
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:29,680
in this massive universe that's been there for almost 14 billion years and so forth.

916
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:39,280
And what I'm saying is that's completely wrong. Whatever you are, spacetime is a trivial data

917
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:45,360
structure inside you. So you're not this trivial 200 pound object inside this vast spacetime.

918
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:53,520
That vast spacetime is a trivial data structure inside you. So that's how radical what I'm saying

919
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,480
is much more radical than the Gaia hypothesis. So if you're looking for who is the bigger

920
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:09,120
or not, right? But then the idea is that what we view, we look around us, we see what we think

921
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:16,960
is a distinction between animate and inanimate objects. I mean, I'm not worried about hitting

922
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,480
this, whereas I'd be worried about hitting you. If I hit the microphone, it might mess up the

923
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:28,000
audio a little bit, but I'm not worried about causing any pain on anybody. Whereas if I hit you,

924
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,120
I'd be causing pain. So we have this distinction between animate and inanimate objects. And

925
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:40,320
the Gaia hypothesis is starting to sort of play with that saying, well, maybe the difference between

926
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:46,000
living and non-living isn't as tight as we thought. Well, I think that that's right in the following

927
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,320
sense. The distinction we make between animate and inanimate objects, I claim, is completely

928
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,640
unprincipled. There's no principle distinction between animate and inanimate at all.

929
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:07,520
No. In this point of view, the only reality is consciousness. That is the reality. So I'm always

930
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,160
interacting with my headset, space-time headset. I'm always interacting with consciousness.

931
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:20,400
But my consciousness, my headset is dumbing things down, right? And that's what headsets do. They're

932
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,120
simplifying things. Right now, so I have some insight into your conscious experiences through

933
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:32,400
my headset. But when I look at a mouse, I'll get much less insight, but some. When I look at an amoeba,

934
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:40,320
much less, virus, much less. And then when I look at protons, neutrons, none, rocks, none.

935
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:46,160
But think about it this way. Suppose I'm talking with you on a Zoom screen,

936
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,680
and there's a bunch of pixels on my screen. Some of the pixels are pixels of your face.

937
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,640
And those pixels provide me with a portal into you, into what you're thinking. I mean,

938
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:02,640
like, if you smile, I can, you know, he must be happier or frown, he doesn't like what I just said.

939
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:07,280
So I get some insight from those pixels about your conscious experiences. But the pixels of the

940
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:13,920
wall behind you. No, no insight into consciousness whatsoever. Now, I wouldn't want to say, ah,

941
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,200
so there is a distinction between animate and inanimate pixels. Those are the living pixels,

942
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,480
and those are the none. That's dumb. Pixels are pixels. They're part of an interface,

943
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:31,040
a headset, or a desktop. And some of them, some pixels provide a portal into the

944
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:37,920
consciousness, you know, and others don't. And so this is the way I think about why there's no

945
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,440
distinction between animate and inanimate objects. Space time is just a headset. The headset

946
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,760
sometimes gives me insight into consciousness. Sometimes it doesn't. That's what headsets do.

947
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:53,280
They dumb things down. That's a limit of the headset, not an insight into reality. So when I

948
01:32:53,280 --> 01:33:01,520
look at a rock, I am interacting with consciousness. But my interface is so impoverished that all I get

949
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:12,560
is a rock. Yeah. Now, I hope that the back and forth goes both ways, that just as the

950
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:19,120
consciousness on the other side can't really affect me too much directly, I can't affect the

951
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,120
consciousness too much through the rock. If I smash the rock, as I might have to do if I'm

952
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:28,240
building a house or something like that, I would hate to think that I was causing pain

953
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,880
on the other side. But I don't know. There's no portal into the conscious experience of a rock.

954
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:41,040
That's right. But I mean, we could assume that objects with no central nervous system would not

955
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:47,120
be able to feel pain in that way. But I'm curious. So you think, do you believe that all inanimate

956
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:56,240
objects have a degree of sentience, like having a sliver, a type, a scale somewhere

957
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:01,280
of a conscious experience? I don't. And I don't think the human body has any sentience either.

958
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:09,680
Because body is just an interface description. It has nothing. Your body, the body that I see,

959
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,600
that I call Andre, only exists when I perceive. That body is now gone. It only exists in the

960
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,280
instant. So rocks don't have this liver of consciousness because rocks don't even exist

961
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,600
when they're not perceived. And the human body, the human brain doesn't exist when it's not

962
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,240
perceived. I have no neurons right now. Yeah. So this is when we say local realism is false.

963
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:36,320
We have to be completely thorough. Local realism is absolutely false. And that means the human body

964
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,880
only exists when it's perceived and it doesn't contain consciousness.

965
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,480
However, when I see a human body, I know my interface is telling me, don't do certain things

966
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:50,400
because my interface has given me a way that could affect consciousness.

967
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,600
So I just want to clarify here. Are you saying that when you look away from me,

968
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,040
I cease to be rendered in your experience. So in a way, I cease to exist.

969
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:09,440
But the fundamental constituents of my consciousness, although not rendered in real

970
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:17,200
space time, still do exist, but completely detached from the way our sensory system would

971
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,720
perceive it. That's right. You're not in space time. Yeah. Space time is in you.

972
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,360
Completely. Yeah. So you're entirely outside of space time. And your body

973
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:33,040
is literally just a pixel description. When I take my camera and point it,

974
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,840
the pixels for Andre will light up and I now have Andre pixels. As soon as I

975
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,160
turn the camera, those pixels are gone. There is no, and your body is just as ephemeral as that.

976
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:51,360
Even to myself, right? Right now, I have no brain. There are literally no neurons.

977
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,240
There's no neuron. Now, if you did a scan, you would find neurons, but that's because

978
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,400
you're intervening and looking. So you get a picture. Now you've got your pixels that you've

979
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:05,760
sort of said, now I've got my pixels making neurons. Okay, fine. But neurons only exist

980
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,160
in the act of observation. You don't have neurons when they're not perceived,

981
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:16,480
but you do have what neurons are connected to. Would you say that?

982
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,880
Nothing in space time exists when it's not perceived. Nothing. Space time itself doesn't

983
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,200
exist when it's not perceived. So this goes way beyond the Gale hypothesis, right?

984
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:33,600
I know, I know. But the objects in space time, they are connected to the structure of reality.

985
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,480
Just like the pixels on the desktop are a portal to back and forth that when we're talking to each

986
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:47,600
other. Right. So they're- So yeah, like a folder on your desktop screen doesn't exist when it's

987
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:54,240
not perceived, but the electrical gates and things that are happening within the computer system,

988
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:01,360
those do exist. In that metaphor, they do. But when I let go of, when I then step back and

989
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,320
apply that metaphor to all the space time, then they don't exist anymore.

990
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:11,120
So I use that metaphor just to get people to understand the ideas. So for sake of argument,

991
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,000
let's assume the computer's real. Yeah. The circumstances are real.

992
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:22,800
People will grant me that. Once they understand, okay, oh yeah, no, there's no blue rectangular icon

993
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,360
inside the computer. You won't find that. So my file on the desktop is not, there's nothing on the

994
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:31,040
computer. It looks like once you get that, then you have to kick that ladder away. That includes

995
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,080
kicking away the computer itself. It doesn't exist when it's not perceived.

996
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,360
All right. So yeah, I mean, it's, I feel like no matter how many conversations I have

997
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:44,640
with you, there's still some more head wrapping. I have to, like I need to wrap my head around

998
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,560
this even further. And I feel like our audience does too. It takes many times of talking about

999
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:55,280
this and exposure to it to like. The rabbit hole goes deeper. It does. It keeps going. It just

1000
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,480
seems to keep going. I'm as uncomfortable as you are, by the way. I mean, I have gone through

1001
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:07,840
this kicking and screaming myself. Just grasping onto space time as a rug fully gets pulled

1002
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,840
underneath you. And emotionally, I don't believe it one bit. I can see why I do meditation and so

1003
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:22,400
forth. I realized the amount that this has penetrated into my emotional belief in is 1%.

1004
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:31,040
Yeah. But the logic, I mean, I just can't argue with the logic and who knows when my emotions

1005
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:39,360
will come along for the ride. There seems to be various enlightened beings, masters of meditation

1006
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:45,280
that have emotionally embraced it. What they would say is close to 100%. Yes. Where they have

1007
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:51,280
literally no fear of the body because they clearly have the perception that it is not thumb. Right.

1008
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,800
Where if somebody comes up to you, God forbid on the street and puts a gun to your head.

1009
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,600
I'd be scared. Scared to death. Right. It seems like in the metaphysical practices

1010
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,800
and the contemplative sciences, you can arrive at the place experientially, emotionally,

1011
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:10,080
where you truly perceive the source of that which you are. And therefore,

1012
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:15,680
that which you are not does not have to grip over you. Which is interesting because it requires both

1013
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:21,840
the rigorous science and logic to be able to explore these things and explain it with the

1014
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,160
limited capacity we have for language with language. And then the contemplative practices

1015
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:33,440
that allow us to arrive there experientially to become closer and intimate and become one with

1016
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:40,080
that which we truthfully are. I completely agree. And I think that there are spiritual

1017
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:49,120
masters who are there. Eckhart Tolle, for example, I suspect truly doesn't fear death.

1018
01:39:49,920 --> 01:40:04,000
And so, and I intellectually think that, well, this is interesting to think about this way.

1019
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,600
Think about a video game in which you jump into the video game

1020
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,480
and you could be in the game identified with the avatar. That's me. So if it's a shoot-em-up game

1021
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,960
and you think you are your avatar, you're going to be scared to death and you're going to be

1022
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:30,880
really alert and suppose that, I mean, I'm maybe sealed or something. I'm trying to get you ready.

1023
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,120
So I'm putting you in this game. So I want to somehow drug you so that when you get in the

1024
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,920
simulation, you think it's real because I want you to be scared to death and I want you to learn how

1025
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:44,400
to fight in that thing. So I'm going to make you identified. So here's a drug that makes you identified

1026
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:51,920
with your avatar in this VR game. And boy, you really, you, and then it will slowly

1027
01:40:53,360 --> 01:41:01,040
let you disidentify from that avatar. And that's what I think is going on here is we're in this

1028
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:06,000
emotionally. I'm still identified with the avatar, but part of me is recognized. Oh,

1029
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,400
Don, that's just an avatar. It's not you, but the emotional part of me is still

1030
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,280
plugged into you are an avatar. The meditation process is slowly

1031
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:24,640
waking me up to the truth that an avatar is just an avatar. Relax. Just relax. It's just your avatar.

1032
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:32,000
You are the infinite intelligence of which this whole simulation is a trivial little game that you

1033
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,080
is. It's no effort for you, whatever. It's literally nothing. And all the wealth and all the possessions

1034
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:44,320
you could possibly have, you could be the richest man on earth. It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing.

1035
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,440
It's just a little game in you and you could make a billion other much better games than that.

1036
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,600
So that's, but see, mostly I'm still, it's very, very interesting to know that I am the infinite

1037
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:03,600
intelligence. I've woken up a little bit, but not completely. So I'm still halfway between

1038
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:08,880
identifying with the avatar and halfway of disidentifying with the avatar. And I agree

1039
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,560
that there are spiritual masters who have completely disidentified and I would love to

1040
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:21,360
disidentify because it's no fun to be afraid. Yeah. I find it so interesting how I think largely

1041
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:26,720
like around the time of the Vienna circle and the like 19th, 20th century, there was kind of

1042
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:33,440
this big divorce between the simultaneous contemplative practices and metaphysical practices

1043
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:40,240
alongside the scientific explorations. And like most people don't understand to the degree in

1044
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:47,840
which Newton himself had just as much exploration into alchemy than the sciences. And it makes

1045
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,840
sense that they're kind of, they're one and the same in the source. And then there's the

1046
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,160
experiential side and then there's the logical side. There's the particle. There's the wave.

1047
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:00,560
There's two ways to come at something from the top down, from the bottom up,

1048
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:07,040
you know, and the way that it's processed. I'm curious because I know you meditate for

1049
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:13,600
like roughly like two hours a day, at least you sit in silence. And Kurt Godel was somebody who

1050
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:19,840
very, very viscerally felt that you could lay down and he would say he would lay down for

1051
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:26,320
hours and get rid of all of his senses. So hearing, tasting, touching, smelling,

1052
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:31,840
he would feel that you could intuit directly mathematical objects that since we're connected

1053
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,720
to it, there shouldn't be any reason that by abiding in the place in which we are connected

1054
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:43,760
to it, that you shouldn't be able to have intuitions around it that then come into your

1055
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,520
mind or your thought that you could then channel into his work. And he said that he did that very,

1056
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,440
you know, and he's one of the most brilliant logicians to ever exist. And he was doing that.

1057
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:58,320
So I would just be so curious to see what would happen if the most brilliant minds in today's

1058
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,880
age had those practices to support them on the practices as well. So how do you feel like your

1059
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:08,720
practice has personally benefited you on that journey? Well, I think that it's absolutely

1060
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:15,200
essential. I didn't start meditating for that reason. I started meditating for the very pedestrian

1061
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:19,440
reason that I was having hard time sleeping and I didn't want to take drugs. And so I said,

1062
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:24,160
well, they'll meditate. But then I realized later on, well, there's a lot more to this

1063
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:28,240
meditation just helping me with my sleep. This is pretty profound transformation that's going on

1064
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:32,320
here. So I can't take credit or anything like that. I just was doing it for my own little silly

1065
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:38,000
reasons. But then I stumbled onto this is pretty important. And now I use it explicitly as a tool.

1066
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:46,000
I need new ideas. Go into silence. I mean, when you realize that you are that infinite intelligence,

1067
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,280
that's what you are. But if you don't let go of your Bayesian priors,

1068
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,880
you'll only see your posterior. So I have to, how do you let go of your Bayesian priors? There's

1069
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:00,720
only one way to do it. That's literally to let go. No thoughts. How can you get into the unknown

1070
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:07,120
if you don't leave the known? That's exactly right. So I think this is absolutely essential

1071
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:12,640
for scientists. And I think that the very best creative ones, whether or not they're,

1072
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:17,680
they know it, they go into a moment of silence when the real deep intuitions come. Of course,

1073
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:21,760
you have to do your homework. You've studied your math. You see, there's no, there's no

1074
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:26,880
substitute for doing the hard work. It's just like a powerful, brilliant musician without

1075
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,880
understanding and practicing their skills. Then they can throw it out the window and it's a part

1076
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,440
of their unconscious competence. And then they sit down, listen, and something beautiful, the next

1077
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:39,840
masterpiece comes through. That's right. You had to do your homework. But then, then is when you

1078
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,440
sort of let go of what you know, that the new originality comes through. And Einstein did talk

1079
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:53,680
about that. He said that his big ideas came to him in vague images and so forth. And for me, too,

1080
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:02,560
I'm no Einstein by a long shot. But my ideas, when they do come, come from moments of silence,

1081
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,200
where I've done my homework, I have a problem I'm trying to solve. And then all of a sudden,

1082
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:12,800
follow myself just going deep silence. And then all of a sudden, I see something coming.

1083
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:17,520
So I think for scientists to actually take advantage of it, to realize you are that infinite

1084
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:23,040
intelligence, let go of your, of course, build your priors. That's what science is. Build these

1085
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:29,520
really good prior. But then let go of them. If you need to transcend Newton, you have to let go of

1086
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,560
Newton for a while before you can go to quantum and general relativity and so forth. You have to

1087
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:41,680
let go of Newtonian ideas. And so going into the silence beyond any concept is really critical.

1088
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:46,160
So it's again, an interesting back and forth and we're getting a little picture perhaps of what

1089
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:54,320
the one is doing all the time in is that back and forth between I've got this perspective on myself,

1090
01:46:54,320 --> 01:47:00,080
I got the Newtonian perspective, that was fun. Let me go deeper. Oh, now I got relativity. Oh,

1091
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:04,080
now I've got quantum mechanics. And that's still trivial compared to what I am. But that was an

1092
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,120
interesting new perspective. And so even these perspectives as fun as they are are trivial

1093
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:17,200
compared to what you are. What do you say to people that would comment on this podcast? Like

1094
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:23,280
somebody did the last time saying, what difference does it make if reality is an illusion? The pain

1095
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:30,880
I feel is real to me. The joy I feel is real to me. We are having an experience that is obviously

1096
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:39,680
incredibly valuable. And it feels real to us. So I guess, how would you respond to somebody that

1097
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:45,760
says, why does it matter if reality is an illusion? Which it might seem like a trite kind of after

1098
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:51,440
our whole conversation, it seems silly to ask that question, because it has very real implications.

1099
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:56,560
But how would you respond to that? Well, I'd say a couple of things. I think

1100
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:04,960
all of us are inquisitive. Who am I? Why am I here? What is this all about? I mean, maybe

1101
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:14,480
some people are not. But I think most of us are. And then most of us, when we start hearing

1102
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:20,800
the various stories that people tell, find them, man, it's probably not good enough. That story

1103
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:28,480
is probably not good enough. And so I think it's really important because we are inquisitive. And

1104
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:35,760
that may be what we're here for, in fact, is why does the one plunge itself into avatars is

1105
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:43,840
because it's answering the question, who am I? And it's taking an infinite number of different

1106
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,920
perspectives and looking and saying, oh, from this perspective, I could talk about myself

1107
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:55,840
this way. And so to find out that this is just a perspective is important,

1108
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,840
that this is an illusion, this is just a perspective. So I'm using those two things

1109
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,960
together here. It's a perspective. Therefore, it's not the truth. Therefore, it's in that sense,

1110
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:12,560
illusory, is perhaps as best language can be used to describe it. What we're here for in the first

1111
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,280
place, we're here to learn that this is an illusion, but it was an interesting illusion.

1112
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:23,040
And look how complicated we are from this point of view, and yet we transcend all of that. So that

1113
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:31,120
would be, I mean, one answer. On the other hand, I think if someone persisted in saying that, I

1114
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:36,720
would say, well, that would be another perspective that the one takes on itself from your avatar.

1115
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:42,800
And maybe that's what the one needed to see from that perspective as well, that relax.

1116
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:49,280
And in some sense, yeah, relax. There's nothing that needs to be completed about you. You are

1117
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,760
already the infinite. So maybe this is just really about enjoying all the perspectives,

1118
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,640
including the perspective. Who gives it? Yeah.

1119
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:04,080
Yeah, no, I love that. I'm curious what you think as we've been exploring like alternative

1120
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:10,240
views from the conventional notion of our understanding of reality, what do you think

1121
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:16,240
starts to open into otherwise contentious fields of understanding of out-of-body experiences,

1122
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:22,720
precognition, remote viewing, near-death experiences, with this understanding that we've

1123
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,640
been exploring with consciousness, what implications do you feel like it has in those realms?

1124
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:34,640
Well, if you're a physicalist, these things can't happen. If, like me, you're a conscious realist,

1125
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:43,840
I can't rule them out. Now, as a hard-nosed scientist, I'm not happy just to say I can't

1126
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:49,600
rule them out. Therefore, I'm going to say that these things are all real. Absolutely not.

1127
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,320
I'm going to be hard-nosed still about it. What I'm not going to do is rule them out a priori.

1128
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:06,000
But I'm more than 100% sure that most of these are probably confabulations,

1129
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:13,840
right? Probably most things are confabulations. But there is, for example, the near-death experiences

1130
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:20,640
that there seem to be, there's some systematic experiences of the tunnel, the light, the life

1131
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:26,800
review, maybe a decision to come back. That seems pretty consistent. So, I wouldn't rule that out

1132
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,880
at all. But here's where I get hard-nosed about it.

1133
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:40,480
As a scientist, I'm on a theory, right? So, and I'm working on it. So, we'll see. But if

1134
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:49,120
space-time is just a headset, then what does, in some sense, my experience of me is just an avatar

1135
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:54,160
in that. And now we have these experiences of an avatar going through a tunnel and seeing a white

1136
01:51:54,160 --> 01:52:01,760
light and review. I want my theory of conscious agents to be able to show how we make a headset

1137
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:06,960
and then show me precisely when that headset is coming to an end for a particular avatar.

1138
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:16,400
Why or how I could get this tunnel with a light experience. In other words, until I have a

1139
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:22,880
scientifically precise theory of this and then can make predictions that are testable.

1140
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:36,160
All we have are informal accounts, hints, in other words, a pre-scientific kind of approach.

1141
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,560
And what we've found throughout human history is, of course, you can do great things without science

1142
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,200
and you get geniuses who just have good intuitions and do things. But when you actually get the

1143
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:51,280
systematic science stuff, you find out that most of what you believed was nonsense. Most of

1144
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:55,760
things that people did were just plain nonsense. Not all. Sometimes, you know, indigenous people

1145
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:01,120
have some really deep insights that you can't explain how they got that. But most of the time,

1146
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:10,720
there's just plenty of nonsense. So, my guess is, if I were a physicalist, I'd say all nonsense.

1147
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,360
No, nothing to be saved here. This is all just illusions caused by the brain activity and so

1148
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,680
forth. So, I'm not saying that whatsoever. So, I'm not saying it's all nonsense. I'm saying

1149
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:25,920
at least in principle, it's not all nonsense. I'm saying in practice, probably most of it,

1150
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:34,960
99% of the reports are probably just not accurate. But that doesn't mean that there's something deeper

1151
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:41,040
that isn't true. I think that life does not end with the death of the body. It's just taking off

1152
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:48,560
the avatar. So, I think that maybe Hoffman, as Hoffman doesn't exist anymore, but the consciousness

1153
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:53,040
that was the true thing behind Hoffman will continue to exist because it's the infinite

1154
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:58,640
consciousness. So, I may lose everything that I'm attached to in terms of the Hoffman ego.

1155
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:04,720
All that has to go and spiritual teachers tell us to die before you die. And that's, I think,

1156
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:09,600
that's right. In some sense, if I can die to everything about Hoffman and don't care about

1157
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:18,080
Hoffman, because Hoffman is just an avatar, then when there's time for the avatar to go

1158
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:23,680
goodbye, it'll be just like in the VR game. Once I've not identified with the avatar, when this

1159
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:28,000
game over, I don't care. That was just my avatar that died. It's not me. It's my avatar that died

1160
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:35,520
and then shut down the game. So, I guess I'll summarize what I'm saying.

1161
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,680
I cannot dismiss any of these, the near-death experiences or any of these kinds of things.

1162
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:46,800
I can't dismiss them out of hand. But I think that those who take consciousness as fundamental

1163
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:54,800
owe it to everybody to give absolutely rigorous scientific accounts of these things and to hold

1164
01:54:54,800 --> 01:55:00,240
the highest standards in terms of the data that we try to collect and so forth.

1165
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:07,440
So, this is not, you know, saying consciousness fundamental is not an invitation to just accept

1166
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:14,000
any hypothesis and say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It means I'm open to them, but I'm going to be

1167
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:21,120
hard-nosed about them. And that's what we should do, because if there is something real there,

1168
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:26,160
then we want to understand really what it is. Yeah. I'm curious what, if you had to give your

1169
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:33,120
best guess, if when we die, consciousness still exists, in regards to reincarnation,

1170
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:37,520
which there's been some interesting studies about kids that come in and have actual memories that

1171
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:43,760
you can verify in the real world of people who have lived that they claim as dumb, from where

1172
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:49,040
they lived to people that were, they were in relationship to, to favorite objects that they

1173
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:54,880
had. If it is in the case that somehow this consciousness leaves and then does take another

1174
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:03,680
form, how could it possibly be done where, I guess, memory is stored in consciousness and

1175
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:11,680
could take on another avatar? Right. Well, this is quite interesting because I was approached by

1176
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:19,600
a team of brilliant researchers. One, one of the, the head of the team is a research

1177
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:24,320
scientist at Caltech, and most of them are Indian, so they're, I think, more Hindu and possibly,

1178
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:30,000
and they're very interested in reincarnation. And, and I actually gave a talk in their workshop

1179
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,680
at the Science of Consciousness Conference in Tucson back in April. And they found out about this

1180
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:45,200
trace logic that I've mentioned via trace chains of Markov chain. And they realized that that might

1181
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:51,040
actually give them the tools they need for understanding reincarnation. So, so I've been

1182
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:56,240
collaborating with them, and they're going to actually be implementing that logic and trying

1183
01:56:56,240 --> 01:57:04,080
to start to make predictions from it of reincarnation. Now, I'm, I'm just giving them help to

1184
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:07,600
understand the basic logic. I'm not actually part of their, their, their research team,

1185
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:12,400
but I will, I'll, I'll help them. So I'll, you know, I have no axe to grind on this. I mean,

1186
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:17,440
I know very little about the theory of reincarnation and so forth. But, but they do, I mean, they're,

1187
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,040
they're quite immersed in it. So I'll be very interested to see, but, but this seemed to be,

1188
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:29,840
this trace logic of conscious agents seemed to be the first mathematical framework they'd ever seen

1189
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:35,440
that had the potential to begin to address these, these kinds of questions rigorously,

1190
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:40,400
mathematical rigor. So, so they'll be doing some big simulations, big, big matrices with

1191
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:46,880
millions of entries and so forth to, to, to try to, to get at this. And the kind of question you

1192
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,200
asked is going to be the kind of question we'll try to answer. How could the memories of one life,

1193
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:56,560
one avatar sort of be stored in the network and then downloaded into another headset and so forth?

1194
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,960
Right. Yeah, be very interesting. Yeah. But so finally we have a mathematical framework that's

1195
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:09,760
rigorous enough and, and can be implemented in, in computers to test it, which is fun. I mean,

1196
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,880
at least with science, you can actually test things and go, oh, most of the time you realize your

1197
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:17,760
ideas are just wrong. That's just wrong. Whereas if you don't have the mathematics, you can,

1198
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,800
you can believe for many, many years that you're on the right track when you're deeply wrong.

1199
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:26,640
Yeah. You mentioned how our understanding of spacetime and Newtonian physics has

1200
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:31,760
buried many fruits and technologies that we use in every day, in the everyday world. What do you

1201
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:37,520
think could be some possible practical applications of this new understanding of consciousness and

1202
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,040
how it would change how we live in the practical world tactically?

1203
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:46,880
I think that you can't think big enough on what it's going to do. Quantum mechanics opened up

1204
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:52,560
incredible technologies that are mind blowing. What are some fields perhaps that you think would be

1205
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,240
like revolutionized? Well, transportation for example. So right now,

1206
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,880
there are billions or maybe even trillions, but at least billions of galaxies that would be fun

1207
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:08,960
to explore. The nearest one is more than 2 million light years away. That's the nearest one. Well,

1208
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,520
even if we're traveling through space near the speed of light, that's a long, long time. I mean,

1209
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:20,960
if you put some humans on the spaceship, the great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids

1210
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,160
wouldn't be alive. So you can see that's our nearest galaxy. So going through spacetime

1211
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:33,760
and seeing any of the real estate is just not possible with our current way of thinking. But

1212
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:39,280
what if you realize that spacetime is just a headset and you know the code? So in some sense,

1213
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:44,000
so think about someone who's, again, a real wizard at Grand Theft Auto. They know how to drive their

1214
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,760
car faster than anybody else and they know all the, they know the terrain and they can beat

1215
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:53,280
everybody. That's great. But if you're the software engineer who wrote the code, well, you can do

1216
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:57,440
things that are magic to the wizard. You can give them a flat tire anytime you want to. You can

1217
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,600
take the gas out of this tank. You can change the geometry of the roads. You can take his car and move

1218
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:06,000
it from one side of the game to the other instantly just like that by changing a pointer. Well,

1219
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:12,800
when we're, this theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software outside of

1220
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:18,080
our spacetime headset. We're starting to learn how the game is rigged. How do we play, how,

1221
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,600
what is a software that's playing the spacetime game? Once we understand that, I don't think we'll

1222
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:29,680
have to go through spacetime to the Andromeda Galaxy. We can go around spacetime. We can just

1223
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:35,760
be there. So we're going to, so, and that's just one. I think you just can't think big enough.

1224
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,880
Once you, once you know the software, you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.

1225
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:47,680
It feels like there's not an area of life that it wouldn't revolutionize. Think about like healing

1226
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:54,800
if you understand the deeper dynamics of how the projection of like all of ourselves work together.

1227
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:03,680
What we maybe would have spent decades trying to heal physiologically or travel to

1228
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:12,320
within the limits of the speed of light, all of a sudden like miraculously cease to exist because

1229
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:16,880
you're working with dynamics outside of the headset. That's right. So I think, you know,

1230
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:21,680
in medicine, probably there'll be all sorts of remarkable things. So as I mentioned earlier,

1231
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:27,280
the 86 billion neurons and roughly the same number of glial cells make the brain is really

1232
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:33,200
complicated. But we're going to be going to the more complex software outside of it. We'll actually

1233
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:40,160
be able to understand and maybe rewire the brain outside of space time. And then also understand

1234
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,360
systems in the body at a much deeper level and then rewire them. So yeah, I think that

1235
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,760
the revolution in medicine will be remarkable. What do you think it will take for the brilliant

1236
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:57,040
physicists that are currently out there to pivot their intelligence to exploring realities beyond

1237
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:02,800
space time, beyond the headset? Well, the Universe Plus project that the European

1238
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:09,760
Research Council has funded already has over 100 scientists doing that. So they're funding

1239
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,960
the look for these new positive and understanding these positive geometries

1240
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:19,600
beyond space time. That's very different than saying that they're after consciousness,

1241
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:24,480
but they're not. I mean, maybe individuals are, but that's not what the ERC is up to.

1242
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:33,440
My hope, I'm actually trying to get one of these... Trying to recruit one of them.

1243
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:38,640
Trying to recruit. I've got money for it. So I've got money for a postdoc, for two postdocs. So

1244
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:43,280
if someone's got, what I need is someone with a recent PhD in algebraic geometry,

1245
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:46,880
specific branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which is really critical to these positive

1246
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:52,480
geometries, or a real understanding of high energy theoretical physics and in particular the

1247
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:57,600
amplitude and so forth. Because in the current paper, we're going to make a projection to a

1248
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:02,720
special case of the amplitude, but we would like to have someone who can actually help us do the

1249
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:06,960
real whole deal. So we want to do proof of concept in this paper and show that we can actually start

1250
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:13,040
with conscious agents and predict scattering of gluons in space time so that we now can go all

1251
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:18,960
the way. So we've got the little bridge across. Now we need someone to help us build the whole

1252
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:25,680
thing, right? A big, big road across. So we're looking for relative new PhDs in

1253
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:30,640
high energy theoretical physics or algebraic geometry can help us with this. But ultimately,

1254
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:43,040
once we do that, if we can actually make a prediction, a new prediction inside space time,

1255
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:48,720
from a dynamical system of conscious agents, we can show that these positive geometries

1256
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:52,960
arise from it. We can actually make new predictions that are testable and then come out to be true

1257
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:58,240
inside space time. We won't have any trouble at that point getting people. Now we may have trouble

1258
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,760
having them take it seriously as consciousness. They might say, consciousness, munchiness. Who

1259
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:05,440
cares about that? But you've got a Markovian dynamics outside of space time. I'm good with

1260
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:10,400
that. So let's just, let's go with that. And so it's not going to be a proof of consciousness

1261
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:15,840
being fundamental, but it'll be perhaps an indication that a Markovian dynamical system

1262
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:20,960
outside of space time is an important next step in science. And that would be fine with me. If

1263
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:27,920
they dismiss the conscious stuff, that's perfectly fine. I completely respect that.

1264
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:33,600
But I would be loving to give me, these guys are brilliant, guys in the generic sense. These people

1265
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:40,160
are brilliant and much more smart in this stuff than I am. And so I'll just be able to then kick

1266
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:46,560
back and try to read their papers. That's what I want. Yeah. I'm so curious to see what evolves

1267
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:52,560
in that space and then also globally. I mean, as these new innovations and discoveries come on

1268
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:59,440
board, I'm curious to see what happens with religious fundamentalists, with people's understanding

1269
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:06,560
of perceptions on God too. Would you say that, I don't love the term or using it because it's

1270
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:12,560
so tainted, but the closest thing approximating the term of God would be the collective consciousness

1271
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:20,560
of all that is? Well, I would say that the word God and then the word collective unconsciousness

1272
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:31,040
or collective conscience are pointers and that the thing itself completely transcended. It is

1273
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:35,840
not even a thing, right? Going back to the mint. Yeah. Even to say the thing itself is already

1274
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:43,120
a mistake, right? So all these things are pointers to something that transcends. And again,

1275
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:48,320
I said something. So as soon as I start using language everywhere, as soon as I say something,

1276
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:53,360
I realize, wrong again, wrong again, wrong again. Maybe for the next podcast, you should just sit

1277
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:59,280
here in silence for a few hours. Well, that's right. And bore people to death and enlighten them.

1278
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:07,040
Yeah. So I think the deepest, rigorous thing I've seen so far is this

1279
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:15,200
trace logic on the space of conscious, of Mark Covington. But that's what, having said that,

1280
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:24,800
I then will immediately say it's a baby step and compared to the reality, zero, right? So I think

1281
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:31,040
that we can go infinitely beyond what I've done, what my team has done with this Markov,

1282
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:38,400
trace chain thing. And even if we go infinitely beyond it, and we do that for a trillion years,

1283
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:46,080
we'll be 0% of the way toward understanding what you already are completely.

1284
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,440
Because it's infinite. It's completely infinite. No matter how big the number gets, it's still

1285
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:56,080
nothing in comparison. And that puts the light of dogmatism, right? It's really,

1286
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:02,720
dogmatism is really missing the point. Dogmatism is missing the point that

1287
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:12,240
what you can say about it is never it, never it. There's no right formulation of words.

1288
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:18,800
And killing people, because their formulation of words is different from yours, is really to miss

1289
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:23,840
the point that, I don't know what the word is for meant in Spanish, but

1290
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,560
saying meant in Spanish versus saying in English is nothing to kill over. Hey,

1291
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,520
we're pointing to the same thing. You're just saying it in Spanish, I'm saying it in English.

1292
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:38,880
Let's not kill each other over it. We're pointing to the same thing, which is what you are,

1293
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:45,040
and what everybody else is. They are that, and they are that completely already.

1294
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:53,280
And what is interesting that the one consciousness chooses to put itself into avatars and let itself

1295
02:07:53,280 --> 02:08:02,320
get so wrapped up that it forgets itself and it kills, it has some avatars kill others.

1296
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,680
Ultimately,

1297
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:13,120
when you realize it's just an avatar, in some sense, nothing was really ever lost.

1298
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:20,080
When you, with your friends, and you shoot up your friend's avatar, and then afterwards you

1299
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:24,080
take off your headsets, laugh, have a beer together, and it's just your avatar.

1300
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:29,680
It's just like the, I don't know if you've seen the film Ruddy Player One, but I love it,

1301
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:35,440
and it gives a perfect description of what could be very real in the next 20 to 30 years,

1302
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:44,000
if not less, where you have a setup that you plug into with a headset and biofeedback technology

1303
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,560
that plugs you into another reality that is extremely real. And if the rise of technology

1304
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:56,480
is at all moving forward, given enough time, well, we will come to the place where

1305
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,560
our games are, we can plug into another virtual reality that seems extremely real. And you take

1306
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:11,280
like GTA or Sims just further down the line as AI and technology advances. It's not far off from

1307
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:18,960
the future reality that we could create what is like a simulation and what seems to be conscious

1308
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:24,800
beings having an experience, whether or not they are, is up for debate. But then we get lost in

1309
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:31,440
the sauce, so to speak. We think that we are the character, and yeah, you've given a lot of

1310
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:36,080
important pointers to waking up beyond who we are in this headset.

1311
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:39,360
Yeah, I think that you're right that there's going to be an infinite

1312
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:44,640
number of directions we can explore with different kinds of simulations and so forth and

1313
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:49,200
exploring different physics, right? We can change the laws of physics in these new worlds and see

1314
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:54,240
how we adapt to them. Why not have instead of three dimensions of space, one of four dimensions

1315
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:59,440
of space. Actually, a friend of mine, Mike Desmura, a professor at UCI, probably 20 years ago,

1316
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:04,640
was already doing that with his graduate students. They were making four-dimensional worlds and having

1317
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:09,600
people learn to play in these four-dimensional worlds, and one of the graduate students

1318
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,800
claimed in their thesis that people were learning to actually experience, you know,

1319
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,680
to actually see in four dimensions. And I didn't buy, I let him get his PhD, but I didn't buy that.

1320
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:24,320
But I think if you trained infants, but I don't think you can do this for ethical reasons,

1321
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:31,680
but if you trained infants, possibly, possibly, they might be able to develop a four-dimensional,

1322
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:40,240
a real four-dimensional space-time experience. So, yeah, I think that we can certainly push

1323
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:46,640
the parameters and our imagination is the only limit. I'm very interested to see what happens

1324
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:53,200
as we can, also within the headset, explore the boundaries of what our senses are capable of.

1325
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:57,920
Forgot the scientist or researcher that was Anika Harris, who we just had on was referring to, but

1326
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:04,320
they're actually training, like, for example, the sense of the magnetic field of the Earth,

1327
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:10,720
and you could develop that sense to know where, like, North is based off of wearing this device,

1328
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:14,480
and you can, like, it's a new sense that you could develop and have the capacity for.

1329
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:23,360
There is, I believe it's the Kogi tribe in South America, where within the first seven years,

1330
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:29,920
the Chosen Shaman children largely live in darkness, which you could say is unethical,

1331
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:35,040
we could say many different things, but they are developing a completely unique relationship

1332
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:40,160
to their internal reality than people in the Western world, just like the opposite end of the

1333
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:47,040
spectrum, and what that unlocks for their capacity to navigate those realms, you know,

1334
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:52,560
in their own consciousness. It's very interesting. It really is, and also David Eagleman has been

1335
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:59,120
doing this kind of research, right, where he's been sort of augmenting our senses in various

1336
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:03,040
interesting ways. You could even have people that could sort of have the stock market information

1337
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:07,040
being played onto their body, and they could sort of feel when this time does buy and when

1338
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:11,760
this time does sell, and so forth. They can build these intuitions. So, yeah, there's a lot of

1339
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:19,360
untapped potential that we could use, but I think it's really fascinating. Right now, we're doing

1340
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:25,600
this using just what we know about the neuroscience inside the headset. Once we actually have stepped

1341
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:30,640
outside the headset, and we know the software behind the neuroscience, then those kind of

1342
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:34,560
technologies I think are going to be even more powerful. Yeah. Do you think we will create

1343
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:43,760
conscious AIs? So, that's a good question. Most people, when they answer that question,

1344
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:49,440
or even ask it, what they're thinking about is this framework, that building a conscious

1345
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:54,720
AI means we're starting with these unconscious circuits and software, physical stuff in space

1346
02:12:54,720 --> 02:13:00,480
and time. That's the fundamental reality. But if we get the right kind of complexity in the

1347
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:06,800
circuits and the software, then the unconscious circuits and software will give rise somehow

1348
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,480
to the conscious experience. So, that's the way most people take your question, and you try to

1349
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:16,880
answer them. They'll say, oh, yeah, sure. Of course, we know that physical systems can create

1350
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,520
consciousness. Your brain is a physical system, and it creates consciousness. Neurons, neural

1351
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:25,440
circuits create consciousness. So, yeah. So, most people, that's the kind of answer they're going

1352
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:33,680
to give. My answer is very, very different. I say that neurons don't even exist when they're not

1353
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:40,880
perceived. Circuits and software don't exist, except as ideas in my mind. So, I've got to rethink

1354
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,960
the question entirely. So, here's how I rethink the question.

1355
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:53,280
Inside my headset, there are certain portals to consciousness. One is what I call the Andre

1356
02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:00,320
body. That's a portal into a consciousness. And we have one technology

1357
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:07,200
that we know of that works for creating new portals into consciousness. And that technology is

1358
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:13,760
having kids. So, it's low tech, but it works. So, we actually, we have a technology that opens up

1359
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:19,600
new portals into consciousness. So, from this point of view in which consciousness is fundamental,

1360
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:24,400
if we can actually reverse engineer with maybe the concentration theory as the first baby step,

1361
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:29,040
understand that technology. What are we doing when we have kids?

1362
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:32,800
From the point of view of consciousness, how is a new headset being created?

1363
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:40,720
Once we've reverse engineered that, then we can ask ourselves, can we do it ourselves?

1364
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:45,280
Can we just take that and do it abstractly? Instead of doing it through human mating,

1365
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:51,520
can we actually do it in some sense technologically? And I think ultimately,

1366
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:54,880
the answer is probably yes, we'll be able to open new portals. And when we do it,

1367
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:01,280
it may be that certain of the technologies we use will look in our headset like artificial

1368
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:07,920
intelligences on computers, circuits. But now notice that the answer is completely different.

1369
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:14,480
I'm not saying that the circuits and software are creating the consciousness. I'm saying that

1370
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:19,760
consciousness is fundamental. What looks like technology is an interface representation that

1371
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:25,440
only exists when you happen to see it. So, the software and hardware aren't even there

1372
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:30,960
when you don't look. The only thing is there are the conscious agents. But through your headset,

1373
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:37,120
it looks like a conscious robot that you're interacting with. So, you can see why I had

1374
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:43,440
to give a long answer. If I just said yes, the answer is yes, I think we could do it.

1375
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:47,520
But you can see that that would have given you entirely the wrong perspective on what I'm saying.

1376
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:53,200
Yeah. The first example you gave is if you've seen Ex Machina, the movie, where they

1377
02:15:54,160 --> 02:16:01,040
essentially develop this through the wetware and the hardware, this sentient AI humanoid robots,

1378
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:06,480
that would be creating it, essentially creating consciousness through

1379
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:11,600
figuring it out throughout the Newtonian world, essentially.

1380
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:17,040
If you assume that physical is framework, you're not going to understand really what you're doing.

1381
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:22,400
Now, it may be that ultimately, we'll find with this theory of consciousness fundamental,

1382
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:26,880
we'll figure out what we have to do inside of our headset and maybe it'll look like the Ex Machina

1383
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:31,760
kind of thing. But what we'll realize is that what we're really doing is rearranging this neural,

1384
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:37,760
this network of conscious agents. It looks like neurons or circuits in software inside space time,

1385
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:42,080
but what we're really doing is this new programming of conscious agents or whatever

1386
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:48,560
transcend conscious agents. So it still may work out that way, but the real scientific

1387
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:53,360
theory will be much deeper than space time. And by the way, that's not just a cognitive

1388
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:58,160
scientist saying that this is now the European Research Council putting 10 million euros on the

1389
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:02,880
line saying these positive geometries outside of space time are the real deal. This is the way

1390
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:10,080
forward. Let's do this. Incredible. Man, I love, thank you so much for your time today. I'm just so

1391
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:16,720
it brings me joy. Like I just feel like a giddy kid who discovered a new toy every time I get to

1392
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:22,960
dive deep into this discussion that just like lights me up so much because starting to slowly chip

1393
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:29,360
away at a model of understanding the world, which has so many implications of how we navigate

1394
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:33,760
within it. And diving deeper into the truth as like, you know, that's the goal with here in the

1395
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:40,400
no less self podcast to discover the true nature of ourselves and the world around us. And I just

1396
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:45,280
putting it out there in the field, I have the vision of producing these high quality round table

1397
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:53,280
discussions around specific areas of life, one being music as medicine, another being around

1398
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:58,800
consciousness theories. And so I'm excited to hopefully in the next 12 months, I'm just going to

1399
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:02,960
find the location and find, you know, the way we want to do it because it's a full thing to like

1400
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:10,080
have six state individuals fun to start to create these conversations that can be shared

1401
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:17,360
in in all of its nuance and all of its many different perspectives to start to like refine

1402
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:21,600
each other's perspective in a way that can be perceived for the masses and for people online

1403
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:27,200
to be able to watch and intrigue interest for people that may want to go down this path and

1404
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:32,960
find the way that the one uniquely wants to express itself through them. And so be on the

1405
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:36,800
lookout for that. I'm excited to have something like that in the future as well. I think that's

1406
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:41,680
an excellent idea. I think that actually something new could come out of it when you bring people

1407
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:48,640
together that are thinking roughly the same, but but not exactly the same. And they've done a lot

1408
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:54,400
of work. They're thinking about it really, really deeply. Then you get some new sparks that they

1409
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:58,880
could really light something up. Yeah. Yeah. And I know researchers obviously do that in their own

1410
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:03,520
accord behind closed doors. And we're not, but it's interesting when you put it in the media,

1411
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:07,680
you know, and for people to view. And it's like the parable of the blind man and the elephant,

1412
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:12,160
you know, let's sit down at a round table, put this elephant on the table and talking about it.

1413
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:17,520
Absolutely. Absolutely. Sweet. So amazing. Now, is there is there anything else you want to share

1414
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:22,080
with their audience? Having understood, you know, the context of the conversation we just have that

1415
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:27,440
you would like to wrap up on or share before we close? I would just say one thing. This is the

1416
