0	4480	We have assumed in science for hundreds of years that spacetime is fundamental reality.
4480	9280	In the last 10 years, for the first time, scientists have taken off the spacetime headset.
9280	10720	What are we going to find?
10720	12320	So I should be very, very clear on this point.
12320	13760	Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist.
13760	17120	And when I say that spacetime isn't fundamental, objects and spacetime are fundamental,
17120	20400	that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.
20400	24320	What I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't see reality as it is.
24320	28480	This theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software
28560	30320	outside of our spacetime headset.
30320	34560	Once you know the software, you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.
34560	38000	So you believe we're living in a simulation of sorts?
38000	40160	I think that we just have to bite the bullet and say,
40160	43440	no matter how smart and mathematically precise you are,
43440	45760	it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond.
45760	50240	I think as a scientist, it's critical for me to actually spend time in utter silence.
50240	52960	That's where the true new creativity comes from.
52960	57200	What we know is one perspective out of an infinite number of perspectives.
57200	58160	But that's who you are.
58160	61200	What you are transcends any description.
61200	63760	And that's how the infinite comes to know itself.
70800	72720	Don, so good to have you back.
72720	74480	Thank you, Andre. Thanks for having me back.
74480	78160	I thought we could start with giving maybe a 10-minute overview,
78160	80640	kind of a high-level view of both your work,
80640	84640	our conversation last time, which I absolutely loved and our audience loved.
84640	88320	And then we can dive deeper into some new terrain here on this conversation today,
88320	90240	which I'm very much looking forward to.
90240	98080	So starting with how fitness beats truth and how the chance that evolution has shaped
98080	102720	sensory systems to see objective reality is precisely zero in the work that you share.
103280	107200	Could you elaborate on that a little bit in terms of how evolution shapes our
107200	111120	sensory systems to be able to navigate it effectively for survival purposes,
111120	115120	but not to see reality as it is objectively?
116000	121040	Right. So Darwin's theory is very clear that evolution shapes sensory systems to guide
121040	128240	adaptive behavior. And that's true. According to Darwin's theory, that is in fact true.
129200	135200	Most of us think intuitively that to do that, evolution must shape us to see the truth because
135200	139680	clearly if you see the truth, that will be much more adaptive than if you don't see the truth.
139680	143760	So to guide adaptive behavior, evolution must also shape us to see the truth.
143760	147040	And it turns out that that extra assumption, which isn't in Darwin's theory,
148560	153520	shouldn't be in Darwin's theory. Now, the mathematics of it is very, very simple.
153520	158960	The payoff functions that guide evolution. Like if you play a game, you have payoffs. If you
159600	165280	make certain moves on the board game or in a video game, you get a certain number of points.
165280	168160	And if you get enough points, you can get to the next level of the game. If you don't get enough
168160	173200	points in time, you die and so forth. Same thing like an evolution. There's the evolutionary game
173200	183920	theory. You have payoffs that guide adaptive evolution. And what happens with those payoffs,
183920	188240	they're basically not telling you whether you go to the next level of the game, but whether
188240	192800	your genes, your offspring go to the next level of the game. So when you analyze those fitness
192800	199600	payoffs and ask, do those fitness payoffs contain information about the true structure of objective
199600	204640	reality? If they're going to shape you, if the payoff functions that guide evolution
204640	209040	are going to shape your sensory systems for you to see the truth, then they have to know a little
209040	213680	bit about the truth themselves or they can't shape you. And what we've proven, and this is,
213680	221280	again, work with not just me, but Chetan Prakash and Manish Singh, Robert Prentner and Brian
221280	227520	Marion and Justin Marks, a number of other people, not just me. But what we've shown is in a number
227520	231840	of ways that the payoff functions basically don't have the information, almost surely don't
232640	236560	have the information about the structure of the world. So you can actually prove the probability
236560	242320	is precisely zero that any payoff function has that information and therefore is precisely
242320	247120	zero probability that we've been shaped to see reality as it is. Now, I should mention
247120	254240	just two quick objections that people have about this. One is, I've shot myself on the foot,
254240	261280	logically. I've used evolutionary game theory, which is supposed to capture Darwin's theory of
261280	267040	evolution. It's the mathematics of Darwin's theory. And I've used it to actually show that certain
267040	273280	basic concepts in Darwin's theory like real physical animals competing for real physical
273280	278400	resources in a real space and time. I'm saying that all of that is, you know, space and time
278400	283280	aren't fundamental. We're not seeing reality as it is. Objects and space, time are just an illusion
283280	290480	or a headset. So the argument from philosophers, some philosophers have been, well, Hoffman,
290480	294720	unfortunately, shot himself on the foot, logically. He's used evolutionary game theory
294720	299440	mathematics to show that the very concepts that were gave rise to evolutionary game theory
300240	307360	aren't true. So either the math faithfully represents Darwin's ideas and captures it
307360	312320	and is a good representation of those ideas, or it's not. If it's not,
312320	316800	Hoffman couldn't use it for what he's using it for. And if it does, if it is a good faithful
316800	320320	representation of Darwin's central ideas, then it couldn't possibly contradict them.
320320	325920	So in either way, Hoffman is messed up and his team. And the answer is this,
326320	332720	fundamentally misunderstands the nature of scientific theories. Every theory makes assumptions.
334480	337840	They're the miracles of the theory. And then it says, if you grant me those assumptions,
338720	342800	I'll show, I'll then prove all this or explain all this other wonderful stuff.
342800	346720	But it never explains its assumptions. And you can get a new theory, a deeper theory,
346720	350800	that explains those assumptions, but it'll have its own new assumptions add infinitum.
350880	357040	So every theory has, if it's good enough, has a scope. But every theory,
357840	363280	no matter how good it is, has its limits. If none else, its assumptions are showing you
363280	367600	what its limits are. So the only question is, when you have a mathematical representation
367600	372400	of the theory, is the mathematics, if it's a good theory, the mathematics will help you explore
372400	378320	the scope. That's new. And, but if it's a great theory, the mathematics will actually show you
378320	382560	precisely what the limits are. And in case of Einstein's theory of spacetime, for example,
383360	388720	his mathematics is of course fantastic and GPS and everything else is based on Einstein's math.
388720	394800	So wonderful scope. But his theory also, the same mathematics that captures his theory and shows
394800	401040	its scope also tells us its limits. And the limits are, in Einstein's case, 10 to the minus 33
401040	406560	centimeters. Space time ceases to have any operational meaning, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,
406560	412320	10 to the minus 43 seconds. And so here we have the case where the mathematics that Einstein came
412320	418640	up with is the very mathematics that comes back and says your fundamental concept of space and time
419280	425120	fail at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So that's how science,
425120	432640	good science, really works. The mathematics that's intended to capture the fundamental concepts of
432640	437040	your theory. If it's great mathematics and a great theory, we'll come back and show you
437040	441600	exactly what the limits are of those fundamental concepts. So that's not self-refutation.
442400	449600	In fact, that's why science is so powerful when we just use informal discussion and, you know,
450560	453840	talking about ideas over beer and so forth. That's one thing.
455600	460640	But you can never find out the limit of your ideas and the limits of your theories
460640	465040	when you have just an informal theory. And as a result, it's easy to become dogmatic and to
465040	469520	think that you're getting close to the theory of everything that I know the truth and you don't and
469520	475680	so forth. What science does is it puts a big dose of humility on there. Even a big theory
475680	481600	like Einstein's theory of space time, it tells you that theory is great and it stops at 10 to the
481600	487200	minus 33 centimeters game over. So you need a new concept. So that's, so it's an anti-dogmatic kind
487200	493360	of thing. So that's sort of just a little kind of pushback I've gotten on this and you can see why
493360	500080	would be some strong pushback because what I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't see
500080	505760	reality as it is. Yeah. And we'll circle back to the value of discovering the limits of different
505760	513440	theories because I'm excited to dive into that to continue to, you know, put a bow on the high
513520	518400	level overview of this work. That understanding that you just shared in conjunction with local
518400	525360	realism being proof false leads us to explore the headset analogy. And so, you know, the Nobel
525360	532320	Prize for local realism being proved false explains how objects in space time cease to exist when
532320	536960	they're not perceived. Like they get rendered on the fly when they're perceived. Why does that become
536960	541840	an important reflection when we start to dismantle this notion that reality is as it seems?
542400	549360	Well, again, I should say that your local realism is false. The Nobel Prize was a
549360	554720	granted for it for that experimental verification. There are some who still want to maintain some
554720	560160	kind of realism through multiverse kinds of explanations and so forth. I think that we just
560160	565360	have to bite the bullet and say space and time aren't fundamental. And the properties of objects
565360	571040	in space and time aren't fundamental. So that's the direction I'm going by. I just want to
571040	578160	point out that there are very, very bright physicists who would disagree. Now, the theory of
578160	584240	evolution of natural selection and my work on that is in some sense, it suggests that space
584240	590240	time is an interface, right? So it does, it strongly suggests that what evolution gave us was not
590240	597120	a window on the truth, but a headset that lets us play the game of life. And so that's why I think
597200	603760	it does fit in with the modern results in physics. I think it's a very reasonable interpretation
603760	610560	of modern quantum theory. And it's actually part of, for example, a big interpretation,
610560	619600	the so-called cubism interpretation of quantum theory that Chris Fuchs and others are espousing,
619600	626720	that the quantum state is just the observer's statement of the degrees of belief of what
626720	632720	they will experience if they make certain kinds of observations. And it's not, you know, quantum
632720	638880	states are not descriptions of objective reality. They're descriptions of your degrees of subjective
638880	646320	belief. So I think that that fits very, very well with the work I'm saying. So here's a case where
646320	651520	physics, this interpretation of physics, the Cubist interpretation of physics, the non-local realist
651520	659680	interpretation of quantum physics works very, very well with what evolution is suggesting,
659680	666160	that we evolve not to see the truth, but to have a headset. So yeah, I think the two actually
666160	670960	dovetail quite well. The truth to be hidden, but allowing us to control it in a way that we need.
671760	677840	That's exactly right. And I should mention that since the last time we talked,
677840	683280	there's been a big push by the European Research Council, the ERC. They have a 10 million euro
683280	688320	new initiative for finding that there are these new structures outside of spacetime.
688880	690080	Like the Amplituhedron?
690080	693440	Like the Amplituhedron, right. Yeah, that's right. So they're called positive geometries,
693440	698720	but and so they, it's just started. Is it a cosmological polytope? Is that correct?
698720	703280	That's right. That's right, an associahedron and so forth. So there are these positive
703280	709680	geometries and they could have billions of dimensions. Spacetime has four, maybe 11 in
709680	712720	string theory or something like that, but they could have billions of dimensions. In other words,
713840	720000	our headset is pretty cheap. It's a really, really low dimensional, we got the cheap model.
720960	728720	The high energy theoretical physicists are now looking at structures like the Amplituhedron,
728720	734160	in which one of the parameters is the dimension of your spacetime. So in our case, M equals four.
734160	738800	M is the parameter, and ours is four, but they could have a billion. M could be any number,
739680	744640	M is one of the, four is one of the smaller numbers you could have. So that's already a
744640	749200	parameter in the positive geometries that your headset, your spacetime could be
749200	754880	as many dimensions as you want. And we have about as cheap of one as you could get away with.
754960	760000	So instead of us having a theory of everything, we have a theory just of a trivial headset.
760800	767360	So just refining again, the understanding that objects cease to exist in the form we think they
767360	774480	do when they're not perceived. This goes for the chair that you're sitting on, the moon, any object
774480	780160	that the quantum theories works at all scales, then this would apply to that at all scales.
780160	783840	Can you just share a little bit more about the headset analogy and how that helps us kind of
783840	790160	wrap our head around things exist in objective reality in a way that is analogous like we
790160	797600	explored to last time, like a computer where there's gates of electricity moving, but the display
797600	803200	of the screen is set to hide the truth of reality so we can control it in a way that is useful,
803200	806720	because otherwise if we didn't have the display of a computer screen, like how would we actually
806720	811120	effectively navigate it? So could you elaborate on that a little bit more so we can wrap our
811120	815280	head around that? That's right. So an obvious question is if we don't see the truth, then
815840	822720	what has evolution done? How does it allow us to survive when we're ignorant of what reality is?
822720	827280	But if you think about it, it actually makes a lot of sense. If you have someone,
828000	832720	say Grand Theft Auto, and it is a virtual reality version of Grand Theft Auto in multiplayer,
832720	839040	and there's some supercomputer somewhere that's running it, but you don't see that
839040	842320	supercomputer, you don't need them about the software and so forth. All I know is I've got a
842320	847360	steering wheel in front of me, I've got a dashboard, I've got a gas pedal and so forth,
847360	850560	and I can see over to my right, I can see a green Ferrari or something like that that I'm racing
850560	855360	against. Well, of course, if you looked inside the supercomputer, there's no green Ferrari anywhere
855360	860400	inside the supercomputer, and there's no steering wheel and none of that. The reality that I'm
860400	867040	interacting with and what I'm really doing in this metaphor in that reality is toggling millions of
867040	875040	voltages in a precise order. It has to be, you get one toggle wrong and the thing can crash.
875040	879440	So you have to get this precise toggling of millions of voltages. That's what you're really
879440	885280	doing in the reality. But if you had to do that to play the game, if you actually had to go in
885280	891600	there and know what sequence of voltages to put in at what time, good luck. I'm going to win the
891600	895920	game if I'm just turning my steering wheel and slamming on the brakes and the gas and what,
896160	900000	I'm going to win the game. So here's the case where it's very, very clear that knowing the
900000	906320	reality and having to interface directly with the reality to play the game is going to make you lose
906320	914000	as opposed to just having a dumb, dumb down user interface that hides the truth but gives you just
914000	921760	the controls you need. So that's sort of the point of view of evolution. From the evolutionary
921760	928000	point of view, Darwin's idea then is basically that evolution shaped us with sensory systems that
928640	935840	hide all the truth that we don't need and all the gory details. Just give us the levers that we need
935840	943040	to control reality without actually knowing what those levers do. Because if you had all the stuff
943040	948240	that you know, you're going to have to pay for more energy for all the neurons you're going to need
948320	953680	to store that information to understand that stuff, it's just too expensive. So that's sort of
953680	959680	an intuition where it starts to make it seem not so much crazy, but of course,
959680	962320	of course you don't want to see the truth. It's just too complicated.
962320	967200	Yeah. So this starts to, I think, be a little destabilizing for some people when you say,
967200	972560	we're living in a matrix simulation. Reality isn't real. And so this understanding that
973520	980640	this headset, our sensory system allows us to navigate the game of life, like the game in
980640	985840	GTA 6 or whatever that comes out. If we have a VR headset like the Apple headset, it will allow us
985840	993280	to navigate and play in there, for example. And that space time is a very limited scope of reality.
993280	998960	And within that limited scope of reality, we are perceiving less than 0.1% of the electromagnetic
999040	1003600	spectrum that we can see with visible light. The sensory experience of life is
1003600	1007680	extremely limited to the vastness of what existence actually is.
1007680	1012960	That's right. And even the very notion of the electromagnetic spectrum itself
1012960	1016480	is an artifact of the headset. It's not a deep insight into the reality. So when we talk about
1016480	1023360	that, we're using headset language is not the truth. But even in the headset, we have hints
1023360	1026960	inside the headset, even the part that we see inside the headset is trivial compared to what's
1027040	1031200	out there. So you believe we're living in a simulation of sorts. Is that right?
1032080	1036960	Yeah, I would say that this is, that space time is not fundamental objective reality.
1037600	1043520	Therefore, something else is. And so I should be careful though, and say when most people talk
1043520	1048960	about simulation theory, like Nick Bostrom and people in that camp, their point of view is very,
1048960	1052560	very different from mine. And I should be very, very clear about the difference and also the
1052560	1058640	similarities. So the similarities are that what you see around you is not the truth. It's in some
1058640	1065120	sense, a simulation or a headset. But what Nick and Bostrom and others think is that
1066080	1072640	space time and physicalist ideas are still fundamental. And they think that computer
1072640	1079360	programs properly programmed can actually create consciousness. So the idea is that
1079440	1085680	there's some computer programmer in a different world that has created this simulation and the
1086960	1090640	simulation is sophisticated enough that the algorithms are actually creating creatures
1090640	1096160	like us with consciousness. But it's consciousness that's emerging from the computational prowess
1096160	1100560	of the programmer and the power of the computer. Of course, then the possibility is that that
1100560	1106240	programmer in their computer is in fact just a simulation from a deeper programmer and so forth
1106960	1113280	many, many levels of that. But at the bottom, the bottom level is presumably again a physicalist
1113280	1120800	space time programmer in a world that's physical and space time. And so the idea is, so they're
1120800	1129600	making two assumptions that space time, physics is fundamental. And second, that properly programmed
1129600	1134800	computers can create consciousness. And I'm disagreeing with both points. So the two critical
1134800	1139120	points of their simulation hypothesis, I think are false. I think there's no evidence
1141840	1148480	in any theory of how computer programs could create consciousness. I'll put it this way.
1148480	1153760	There's not a single theory out there right now. And there have been lots of attempts that says
1153760	1159120	that consciousness is created by some kind of algorithm, some kind of computational process,
1159200	1165440	some kind of neural network that can, that none of those theories can explain even one specific
1165440	1168480	conscious experience. When you look at all the theories that are out there and they've been
1168480	1173360	at this for decades, and many of these people are my friends and they're brilliant people.
1173360	1178320	But what I always ask them when I speak at conferences is to say, okay, we can experience
1178320	1185520	roughly a trillion specific conscious experiences. Taste of garlic, smell of chocolate, the sound of
1185520	1190080	a trumpet. There's about a trillion things that we experienced should be shooting fish and a barrel
1190080	1195600	to pick one and give us a theory and say how this computational process must be the taste of mint.
1196160	1201200	So how many of you guys got? How many have you done? Zero. And that's the way it's been,
1201200	1207600	and that's the way it's going to be. So, so there's a lot of talk about these computational approaches
1207600	1212160	and or neuro biological approaches for, for coming with conscious experiences. And there's
1212240	1218240	not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain. Zero. And I predict that that's
1218240	1224160	going to continue because it's not possible in principle to do that. So, so I disagree with
1224160	1229360	the simulation theorists that are saying that your consciousness is due to some program or writing
1229360	1236320	up a program that created your conscience. Show me the beef. There's nothing there. There's all
1236320	1241600	sorts of ideas and hand waves, but I have not seen anybody plop down and say, here is, for example,
1241600	1249040	an integrated information theory. Here is the causal matrix and by end matrix and must be 5000.
1249600	1254720	And these are the 5000 by 5000. These are the exact numbers that must be in the matrix for this to
1254720	1260640	be the taste of mint. Nothing. Right. And if you think about it, how in the world could a 5000 by
1260640	1267280	5000 matrix of numbers be the taste of mint? You've got some explaining to do. So, so, so that's where
1267920	1272640	I disagree on two things, right? The idea that spacetime is fundamental and that computational
1272640	1277600	processes or neural processes could create conscious experiences. And I'll just mention
1278960	1283600	when you, when I give up local realism, and when I say that spacetime isn't fundamental,
1283600	1289360	objects and spacetime are fundamental, that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.
1290320	1295680	That means none of my behavior is caused by neural activity. Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist
1295680	1300400	and I think we need more money for, for neuroscience, not less. So I'm, so let me be very, very clear.
1300400	1305040	I am not denigrating neuroscience research. I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. I love that
1305040	1310640	research and we, but it's going to be much harder than we thought. The 86 billion neurons of the
1310640	1318400	brain and roughly the same number of glial cells are complicated, but they're trivial. They're just
1318400	1324720	a headset projection of the real thing that's behind them outside of spacetime. And so neuroscience
1324720	1329280	is going to have to reverse engineer the 86 billion neurons and, and look at the much more
1329280	1334480	complicated reality behind that. So, so I, that's why I say we need more money for neuroscience,
1334480	1338320	not less. And we're going to have to up our game because we haven't actually started the hard work
1338320	1346960	yet in neuroscience. So let's just lay the, the foundation too for, for people that start to explore
1346960	1352880	the hard problem of consciousness of why any collection of matter from the materials view
1352880	1358320	would have an experience of itself is very baffling. And so when you look at consciousness in the
1358880	1363360	many different theories of how it could come to be, there is a materialist view, which is like
1363360	1369440	you just explained, which is along, you know, analogous the understanding that spacetime is real
1369440	1375200	and after a certain amount of unconscious complexity and your neuronal structure,
1375200	1381360	consciousness starts to appear as you turn that dial forward. Now we're exploring a little bit more
1381360	1385200	of a originally thought of as panpsychist view, which is the understanding that consciousness is
1385200	1389520	actually fundamental. Could you explain the difference between consciousness being fundamental
1389520	1395600	or panpsychism versus idealism? Sure. That's right. So I'm good friends with Philip Goff,
1395600	1401360	who's one of the principal proponents of the modern panpsychist kind of theory. And
1403600	1410240	so there, I'll talk about one specific version of it. I think that, that Philip may have thought
1410320	1413840	about it that way, but I think he's not necessarily committed to this. So what I'm saying right now,
1413840	1420400	sure. I'm not pinning Philip with this. Okay. But one kind of panpsychism
1421600	1429120	takes spacetime as fundamental. And it says that in addition to these elementary particles,
1429760	1436080	the leptons, bosons and quarks of the standard model of physics. So we have these fundamental
1436080	1441280	particles and their physical properties. In addition, let's just posit that these
1441840	1448480	bosons, leptons and quarks also have in addition a fundamental unit of consciousness. So that they,
1449360	1453040	and in some sense, the consciousness is what is the reality behind the mathematics.
1453840	1461600	And that certainly is interesting, but there's a couple problems with it. First is,
1462560	1468960	why should we assume that the laws of consciousness are tied to the laws of our particular headset?
1469760	1477520	This is just the M equals 4 version of a projection of something that's much more complicated.
1478800	1485680	It fails to understand how trivial spacetime is. Spacetime is just a trivial headset. And so if
1485680	1490240	we're going to pin our theory of consciousness such that the equations of that little headset are,
1490400	1498560	in some sense, dictating how these consciousnesses interact, that's just way too limiting.
1499200	1504320	We have to think outside of that box. And second, it actually does no work.
1505440	1511120	As a scientist, I would like, I mean, philosophy is important and so I'm not
1511120	1515200	denigrating philosophy, but as a scientist, I would like my theory of consciousness to actually
1515200	1519680	do some work for me. Not just to say, the laws of physics, you can leave them alone,
1519680	1524320	nothing to see here, but we can tag on consciousness. I'm very, very unhappy with that.
1524320	1527840	I would like a theory of consciousness that shows me where the laws of physics come out
1527840	1532560	as a special case of the more general laws of consciousness. So I would like to show that the
1532560	1538000	headset is a trivial headset and consciousness is the more fundamental. So you can see it's a very,
1538000	1544240	very different spirit. Now, having said that, there are many different versions of panpsychism.
1544240	1549920	So I could easily imagine, and I may have already influenced Philip in this direction,
1549920	1557520	we'll see. Panpsychism, that's not tied to space time. In that case, as a scientist,
1557520	1565600	I still want, then, fundamental mathematical principles. I want this partly because as a
1565600	1572080	scientist, here's the attitude that I think hard-nosed physicalists should have toward this.
1573040	1577680	They can say, look, in our assumption that space and time are fundamental and doing the
1577680	1583120	mathematics of physics is fundamental, we can explain all this stuff. Your GPS is due to us.
1583760	1588640	The science and technology that's allowing us to do this podcast is all due to this physical
1588640	1595600	science. What kind of scientific equipment has come out of your theory of consciousness?
1595600	1602480	Oh, none? Oh, well, I think that that sort of tells us how important your ideas are vis-a-vis
1602480	1608480	our physical. And what can I say? They've got me. And they've got anybody who says consciousness
1608480	1615200	is fundamental, and they say, well, what kind of technology can you give us? None. Well, then
1616080	1621840	either that whole approach is not strong enough, or you haven't done your work. And I think it
1621920	1625520	is, we haven't done our work. I think the approach is strong enough. But we now,
1625520	1630480	those of us who take consciousness as fundamental, need to have fundamentally new mathematical
1630480	1636720	theories of consciousness, qua consciousness, with rigorous mathematics that shows how precisely
1637360	1642000	space-time comes out as a projection of this, where we actually get the standard model of
1642000	1647040	particle physics and the generalization of it, so that we can actually predict new technologies.
1647760	1652320	So that's where I'm headed. So the panpsychist approach
1653680	1658720	has not at all been taken into direction by philosophers that could ever lead to brand
1658720	1663600	new mathematics that would lead to new technology. So that's one problem I've got with it.
1664160	1669040	The approach that I'm taking is, I call it conscious realism, but you mentioned idealism.
1669760	1674960	Strictly speaking, what I'm doing is philosophically idealism. It's probably the closest would be
1674960	1680640	Bernardo Castro's analytical idealism. So yes, it is. What I'm doing is idealism.
1680640	1685520	Which just so I can understand, panpsychist view would be that consciousness is fundamental.
1685520	1691840	So essentially consciousness is a fundamental constituent, and idealism would be perceiving
1691840	1698880	consciousness as all there is, but projecting down essentially as like reality is a shadow of
1698960	1705040	innocence. Yeah, the idea that's what we call physical spacetime is just ideas in the mind.
1705040	1712400	It's just a headset. Ideas in the mind of God. Ideas in the mind of consciousness. Absolutely.
1712400	1718400	So and the idea would be then that this is what quantum mechanics is telling us. The
1720720	1727600	fact that local realism is false means that the moon or whatever you observe has a value of position,
1727600	1731840	momentum, and spend, and so forth. When you observe and when you don't observe, you can't assert
1732480	1738160	those things, because in fact, they're not true. And this is quite nice. This is
1739200	1745920	non-contextual realism. And there's some wonderful work on this, the Coak and Specker
1745920	1751280	theorems and so forth. There are cases where you can actually set up these quantum measurements,
1751280	1756720	where you can show a sequence of measurements, where you can predict with probability one.
1758480	1762480	What the outcome of an experiment will be, what one of the measurements will be.
1763120	1767520	Probability one. And you can prove that the mathematics of quantum mechanics entails
1767520	1773680	that there could not possibly have been a value until you made the measurement. So these are like
1774480	1782320	knock down, drag out kinds of arguments that non-contextual realism is false. So all measurements
1782320	1788160	are contextual. And to put that in normal language, that means that in some sense,
1788160	1794720	the consciousness of the observer. Although, I shouldn't put that on Chris Fuchs. So I think
1794720	1799920	that he's going to be agnostic about consciousness and all this stuff. He's just saying whatever
1799920	1804240	quantum mechanics is, it's just describing the degrees of belief of the agent that's making
1804240	1809440	the measurements. So when I talk about consciousness, I'm not putting that on Chris. That's me.
1809520	1812400	So now as we start to explore a little bit more beyond the headset,
1813840	1818720	what role do you feel like evolution could be playing as a projection down from consciousness?
1819600	1824080	That's a great question. And it does raise the issue that I'm going to be talking about
1824080	1830960	consciousness beyond space. And strictly speaking, that's an independent hypothesis
1830960	1837600	from the whole business about evolution leading us to have evolved a headset. So we have to be
1837600	1843200	very careful about how the science goes here. In the first step, I'm just taking Darwin's theory
1843200	1848320	and the mathematics of it and saying, let me just take that as my game. Darwin's theory and the
1848320	1853200	mathematics of it. What does it tell us about our perceptions? Oh, it's just a headset is not the
1853200	1858000	truth. That's what Darwin's theory entails. Now it's a separate step. Okay, now that Darwin has
1858000	1864080	told us that we need to look outside of space time. But Darwin doesn't tell us what's outside of
1864080	1869040	space time, right? So it's brilliant. So when I do the next step and say, okay, I'm going to propose
1869040	1874080	that there's this social network of conscious agents, I'm leaping way, way beyond Darwin. And
1874080	1877680	there's nothing in Darwin that says that's the leap you have to take. So I should be very, very
1877680	1884400	clear. Nothing in my work in evolutionary theory is saying you must go to conscious agents. However,
1884400	1889680	I have to go the other way. If I'm going to propose conscious agents, the social network,
1889680	1896000	the Twitterverse of conscious agents as the fundamental reality, then it's my responsibility
1896000	1901360	to show that I can first project it back into something that I would call space time, create a
1901360	1906560	space time. And that when I do that projection, in that space time, I would see what looks like
1906560	1912480	nature, red, and tooth and claw as Darwin predicts. So it's not that Darwin predicts
1913680	1917120	conscious agents, it's rather that Darwin says there's something beyond space time.
1917680	1922720	And then I go, okay, well, what is it? Darwin can't tell me, I need to make my own leap. So
1922720	1926240	I'm going to propose conscious agents, because at least that way I might be able to understand
1926240	1933600	consciousness. Then okay, then as a scientist, no BS, give me back space time, give me back the
1933600	1938320	standard model of particle physics, every bit of it with new predictions, and give me back
1938320	1942160	evolution of a natural selection. Otherwise, my theory of conscious agents, you shouldn't pay
1942240	1949040	attention to it at all. So unless I can do that, bye bye. So that's the hard nose attitude that we
1949040	1954080	have to have for these an idealist theory of conscious beyond space time. For as a scientist,
1955200	1959600	again, I'm not putting down philosophy. Philosophy is wonderful. And I learned a lot from philosophers.
1960720	1965840	But I'm talking about science here. Scientists who are idealists have to do this hard work
1965840	1970880	and give us back a theory of space time that that that gives us new technologies and new insights.
1970880	1975760	So that's what what what I'm up to right now is working with my my colleagues. It's a mathematically
1975760	1981440	precise theory of consciousness. It's think of it as again, like a social network like the
1981440	1986000	Twitterverse. There's an infinite number of these conscious agents. And we have a mathematics
1986000	1993600	with a Markovian so called a Markovian dynamical system. It's trivial to show that it's
1993600	1999680	computationally universal. So our network of conscious agents can do anything that a neural
1999680	2008720	network could do. Chat GPT, Gemini, Bard, all these, these all these AI programs that are
2008720	2013200	based on neural nets, conscious agent networks can do all of that. So our conscious agent nets
2014480	2020240	only assume that there are agents that have a range of experiences, like the taste of chocolate,
2020240	2024720	the smell of garlic. So that's one of our miracles. Every scientific theory has a miracle.
2024720	2031440	Here's my miracles. There are conscious experiences. And second miracle is that there are probabilistic
2031440	2035200	relationships among conscious experiences. That first one, though, doesn't necessarily
2035200	2041840	require an assumption, right? So how could you say it's a miracle? Well, most because our conscious
2041840	2047040	experience is probably the one thing that I sell evident, right? You? Well, I would agree that
2047120	2054960	space and time, what we call physics is an extrapolation from our experiences.
2054960	2059760	My experiences are all I know directly. So I would agree with you on that.
2061120	2066400	But when I say it's a miracle for my theory, what I'm saying is my theory will not try to explain
2066400	2073360	the origin of conscious experiences. So it's not sense. It's a miracle. So it's going and some
2073360	2077360	people might say, well, that's why I like physicalism, because I'm just going to start off with
2079520	2084400	the standard model of particle physics. And I don't need to assume the taste of mint and all
2084400	2090560	these experiences, just the particle particles of in their properties. And I'm going to show you
2090560	2097680	where those conscious experiences come from. And then I went and and I would say if they could do
2097680	2102080	that. But as I said, that would be very, very impressive if they could do that. Right now,
2102080	2106320	they're batting zero. And I predict that they're going to bat zero. But they would have their
2106320	2111760	own miracle, which is the laws of the standard model of particle physics and the and then the
2111760	2118080	quarks and gluons and bosons and and leptons that they that they're. So it's not like they don't
2118080	2123440	have any miracles. They have their own miracles. It's just not my miracles. So every every theory
2123440	2128880	is going to have its miracles. Now, one thing about taking consciousness as fundamental is
2128960	2132960	there's a wide variety of conscious experiences, right? I said there's a trillion specific ones
2132960	2138880	that we have. So that's in some sense, it's assuming a lot, right? But it's one category
2138880	2143920	of of assumption that's a category of conscious experiences. And the reason why right now,
2143920	2147920	I think it's a good step as a scientist to move in that direction is when you look at
2148800	2152400	my my good friends and colleagues who are doing the physicalist theories,
2153440	2157600	they're having to assume all of space time physics, the standard model and so forth.
2157600	2161520	And then when they get to the step of explaining conscious experiences, they can't. And so what
2161520	2166480	they're effectively having to do is also they have to stipulate the conscious experiences. They
2166480	2170240	stipulate the physics and they stipulate the conscious experiences. And that's actually the
2170240	2174800	word that Stephen Pinker used as he describes, you know, like the global workspace global neuronal
2174800	2179360	workspace theory is saying it. Yeah, it stipulates all the physics, but then it also has to stipulate
2179360	2185280	the conscious experiences. And so my attitude is, well, if the physicalist theories are stipulating
2185280	2190720	the conscious experiences as well as the physics, and I'm only stipulating the conscious experiences,
2190720	2194720	and I'm going to show where the physics comes out, I'm going to explain the physics, I'm not
2194720	2198880	going to stipulate the physics, I'm going to explain it and hopefully get a deeper model with
2198880	2203520	new technologies that you couldn't get with space time. Then you win that that approach will win
2203520	2209840	because I've stipulated less than the physicalist theories. So that's why I think I want to go
2209840	2216720	ahead with this, even though it's a big give to take all these conscious experiences as fundamental.
2216720	2221600	But what I'm not taking is other things like learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence,
2221600	2226720	the self, there's all these other things that we would expect to have from a theory of consciousness.
2227440	2232320	And I'm not assuming those that I'm going to explain the only thing I'm assuming are the raw
2232320	2238080	conscious experiences themselves and probabilistic relationships among them. That's all. That's all
2238080	2242720	I'm giving myself. So it's very, very spare starting point, as spare as I could make it. It was
2242720	2249120	literally the minimal thing that I thought I could get away with. And then there's no notion of self,
2249760	2253440	learning, memory, intelligence, all that other stuff, we have to build that. But the fact that it's
2253440	2258800	computationally universal means, it doesn't mean it's easy, but it means, yeah, we can do it.
2259920	2264960	So we mentioned a little bit earlier the amplitude hydrant, which is this
2264960	2269200	joule-shaped geometric structure that challenges our notion of space and time.
2269200	2275440	How would you explain what that is to somebody that is not a physicist or mathematician? Like
2275440	2280320	in simplistic terms, what does that represent for the possibility in challenging notions of space and
2280320	2288640	time? Yeah, it's an interesting short story. I'll tell this short story. When you try to understand
2288640	2294240	how particles interact in space-time, you might smash two gluons into each other and four gluons
2294240	2299120	go spraying out. And you want to look at the probabilities of various kinds of interactions
2299120	2303680	that particles can have. They're called them scattering amplitudes, but probabilities of
2303680	2310240	interactions. When you do the mathematics in space-time using quantum field theory,
2311520	2320720	the math is very difficult. That little two in, four gluons out, hundreds of pages of algebra,
2321280	2327120	hundreds of pages of algebra for one interaction, millions of terms. And that makes it really hard
2327120	2330800	when you have to look at millions or even billions of these interactions per second
2330800	2336560	to try to figure out what's the new stuff. So there was some serious pressure to try to make
2336560	2342400	the mathematics easier. The experimentals were saying, come on, guys, you've got to give us
2342400	2347600	something a little bit easier to work with here on the mathematics. And so some mathematicians
2347680	2352720	in the 80s discovered they could get it down to 13 pages instead of several hundred pages that
2353680	2360480	were like, oh, thank you. Holy smoke down to like 13 or something. And then they guessed a single formula,
2362240	2367360	like just a few terms. You could write it down by hand. And it was right for that one particular
2367360	2373200	interact. And it was like, there's something going on here. There's like some magic going on here.
2373200	2379760	Maybe it's a one-off. But then they found other examples. And then in 2005, 2006, Ed Whitton in
2379760	2384480	his postdocs discovered something called, it's now called the BCFW recursion relation
2384480	2390160	that allowed them, for many, many kinds of interactions, technically it's called n equals
2390160	2399680	four super Yang-Mills. But anyway, a particular class, they could compute them with this very,
2399680	2406560	very simple recursive formula that collapsed all this stuff. And some guy named Hodges, then
2407920	2415680	brilliant physicist in England, said, in one case, a few cases, it looks like this formula is
2415680	2420960	putting together pieces of a volume of some object. Maybe there's some general thing here.
2420960	2426000	And then Nima and his team said, oh, that's an interesting idea. So they went after that.
2426000	2432480	And in 2014, 2013, they published the archive, but 2014, the actual publication came out. So just
2432480	2438640	10 years ago, the official publication came out of the amplitude hedron, which confirmed what Hodges
2438640	2444800	had proposed. But there was some geometric object that BCFW recursion relations were gluing pieces
2444800	2452080	together to make this object. And that object was encoding in its volumes, the scattering
2452080	2458400	probabilities. And the structure, it turned out, of this object. The structure was encoding the
2458400	2463600	probabilities. The volumes are encoding the probabilities. But the structure, like the edges,
2463600	2470880	the all the edges and so forth, were encoding properties of locality and uniterity,
2470880	2476160	effectively, space-time properties, quantum uniterity and space-time locality,
2477120	2483520	relativistic locality. And so, but this was not an object inside space-time. And it was actually
2484080	2490320	entirely beyond space-time and also beyond quantum theory. So some people said, well,
2490320	2496000	yeah, space-time isn't fundamental, but we'll use entanglement, for example, of quantum theory,
2496000	2501280	to boot up space-time. And they're saying, no, no, no, no. Space-time and quantum theory
2501840	2506880	are emerging together from something far deeper, such as the amplitohedron.
2508320	2513200	And then more generally, these positive geometries. So the amplitohedron is sort of like the first,
2513200	2518640	but positive geometries more generally. So the idea is there's,
2521040	2525680	we have assumed in science for hundreds of years that space-time is fundamental reality.
2525680	2532720	In the last 10 years, for the first time, scientists have taken off the space-time
2532720	2539440	headset. And we've said, we can look outside space-time. What are we going to find? We're
2539440	2545040	looking outside of space-time. The first paper, in some sense, that was going outside of space-time is,
2545040	2550080	say, in the last 10 years, give or take. So we've been looking outside of space-time for 10 years,
2550080	2554320	and what do we find? What do you take off the headset? Obelisks.
2556480	2563440	Geometric structures, not a dynamic, just sitting there. Here I am. Big geometric. Could be millions
2563440	2568560	of dimensions. It could be hundreds of dimensions, trillions of dimensions, just sitting there.
2569200	2576160	And so here, it was very much like 2001 Space Odyssey, where the obelisk is there.
2576720	2582880	And all the apes are pounding and hooting, and they know it's important. It's clearly,
2582880	2586320	and they have no clue, right? And that's where we are. We've taken off the headset,
2586320	2591360	there's these obelisks sitting there, smiling at us. It's quiet. They're not moving.
2593040	2598000	They're telling us something really, really important. But it's so tantalizing that, as I
2598000	2603360	mentioned, the European Research Council just put out a $10 million initiative. It's called
2603360	2608880	the Universe Plus initiative. February, they brought together like 100 mathematicians and
2608880	2614000	high-energy theoretical physicists to launch this whole thing, and we're off to the races.
2614640	2618480	We've taken off the headset. We found these obelisks. We want to find out who put those
2618480	2625600	obelisks there and why. What is this telling us? Right. So the race is on, and what I'm proposing
2626240	2633680	is we need a dynamics. Physics always wants something dynamical. We need a dynamics
2634560	2639840	that will give rise to these obelisks, the positive geometries. And so that's what I'm working on with
2639840	2644720	this theory of consciousness. What the paper I'm working on right now, and the paper I published
2644720	2651680	last year, is we're taking the theory of consciousness in this dynamical system, and we're
2651680	2657760	showing how to get the new objects that the physicists have found outside of spacetime from
2657760	2663520	them. So I didn't mention, in addition to the positive geometries, there are combinatorial objects,
2663520	2668480	in particular something called decorated permutations that classify these structures,
2668480	2675200	classify the objects. And we've done that. We've actually mapped our consciousness dynamics onto
2675200	2683840	the decorated permutations. That's then giving us, that helped us grok how to then mesh our theory
2683840	2689200	of conscious agent dynamics, the markup dynamics, with these positive geometries. And the paper we're
2689200	2694560	working on right now, we're planning to actually take, in a simple case, n equals four super young
2694560	2697840	males to go all the way from consciousness all the way into spacetime and predict a scattering
2697840	2705520	amplitude. So the idea, that was just the first baby step, but the idea is, we start with the
2705520	2711600	theory of consciousness mathematically precise outside of spacetime, and show precisely where
2711600	2717120	are these decorated permutations, and the positive geometries come from, and then show how spacetime
2717120	2723600	and its properties emerge as a trivial projection of this social dynamics of conscious agents.
2723680	2725440	So that's sort of the big picture where we're headed.
2727040	2730880	Okay, there's like four tangents that just spurred off that I want to explore.
2732720	2737360	There is this Sufi master, actually, that I believe has a quote roughly saying,
2737360	2742880	this whole universe was made so that God may know himself, the seed wished to know what it was,
2742880	2748400	and what is in it, and so it became a tree. And it seems like structures, like these geometric
2748400	2756480	structures that exist out of spacetime that we're discovering point to projecting down into
2756480	2762560	this reality to create almost analogous to like, we discover certain crystals or rocks that earth,
2762560	2768160	for whatever reason, the dynamics create these mathematically precise structures that are extremely
2768160	2772880	beautiful, that we're looking down projecting down into there are these higher dimensional
2772880	2777600	structures that are projecting down. And so I'm just curious, what implications do you feel like
2777600	2785600	is, comes about as we start discovering these hired, like obelisks that for some reason are there,
2785600	2791920	we don't know why. But that, yeah, that again, like we mentioned, challenges or notions of spacetime,
2791920	2795440	but then also begs the question of what are they doing? How are they there?
2796000	2801760	Right, right. And first, I should clarify one thing, I mean, I probably sound very excited
2801760	2806080	about these ideas about conscious agents outside of spacetime. And I'm playing it up.
2806320	2813120	Because that's the current research I'm doing, it's a lot of fun. But frankly, it's just a baby
2813120	2817680	step, right? It's not the truth. There is no such thing as a theory of everything. And that includes
2817680	2823040	Hoffman's theory. So I'm not claiming I've got the final word. I'm just saying that here's a very
2823040	2828560	interesting, for those of us who think something like consciousness is fundamental, here is a first
2828560	2834640	scientific theory outside of spacetime. But it's not the final theory of everything. And I'll be
2834640	2839680	very, very happy when someone comes and overthrows my theory and get something deeper. But my guess
2839680	2843520	is that the deeper thing will be a much deeper understanding of consciousness than one that
2843520	2850400	my theory is proposing. So Humble Pis is required, right? This isn't, I'm not the theory of everything.
2852080	2856400	It's okay to be excited and be fine, but don't mistake that for me thinking it's the truth.
2856400	2860720	It's not the truth. It's just an interesting baby step. In terms of
2865040	2868320	for example, what you were saying about what the Sufi master said.
2871840	2876720	I think something like that is really right. Again, it's a good pointer. Again, not when I say
2876720	2881600	right, not the truth, but again, a pointer in an interesting direction. I think that
2884960	2888080	so I should be very, very clear on this point. This is really critical.
2888400	2893760	I talked earlier about scientific theories always making assumptions. And therefore,
2894320	2896240	there could never be a scientific theory of everything.
2898960	2903680	That means there's an infinite number of scientific theories that we could create
2904640	2907280	because there's an infinite number of deeper and deeper assumptions we could make.
2908800	2917440	And reality, whatever it is, is transcends even that infinite sequence of scientific theories.
2919040	2924080	And that's really an important point and it's coming from a very
2924880	2929600	simple fact about scientific theories. Every scientific theory must make assumptions.
2930240	2934240	And it doesn't explain its assumptions. Those are miracles for the scientific theory.
2934240	2938480	There's no way around it. You cannot give me a scientific theory that doesn't have miracles
2938480	2943920	at the starting point. We call them assumptions. That's a very sobering fact about science and one
2944000	2948880	that we should really look at closely. It means infinite job security for science,
2949600	2954880	which is good. But that's also very, very humbling. It means that even if we gave infinite effort,
2956880	2959360	had a billion Einstein's working for a billion years,
2962080	2965600	we wouldn't scratch the surface of whatever objective reality is.
2966240	2970160	So when spiritual traditions, many spiritual traditions have made it very,
2970160	2973920	very clear, like the Tao De Ching says, the Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao.
2974560	2983040	They're saying something that's truly, truly important. And that is all of our concepts
2986080	2990400	fail ultimately. They're pointers to the reality, but they're not the reality.
2990400	2997680	In the following, in a very, very simple sense, the word mint versus the experience of mint.
3000880	3003920	Of course, the word mint is nothing like the experience of mint.
3004720	3009120	And the word mint doesn't explain the experience of mint. And it's not a theory of the experience of
3009120	3014800	mint. If you want to know mint, the experience of mint, you have to taste it yourself. You have
3014800	3020160	to know it firsthand. And then someone else can say, that is what I mean by the word mint.
3020160	3025040	So you have to have the experience yourself. And then the words can point to it.
3026000	3030480	This is not BS. This is the way, and this is all of our concepts, the color red,
3031120	3035840	the smell of garlic, the sound of a trumpet. You have to have the, if you don't have the
3035840	3042960	experience yourself, good luck me giving it to you by talking. So my words aren't going to do it.
3042960	3048080	And so that's, so what the spiritual traditions have been saying is extremely important here.
3048080	3052880	It's not just schmistical nonsense. I'm saying that scientists have to really understand
3053600	3059760	that our scientific, I'm a scientist. I love scientific theories. They beat hand waves by a
3059760	3065200	long shot. So I'm sort of impatient with hand waves. Scientific theories are wonderful because
3065200	3070640	they're precise and they tell you their limits. And so they tell you when that theory is done.
3071440	3077200	That's beautiful. But many scientists still have the hope that they're going to get a theory of
3077200	3082400	everything. No chance. There is no theory of everything. So the spiritual traditions are
3082400	3086400	telling us the right thing when they say any word is a pointer. The same thing is true of
3086400	3092800	scientific theories. They're all at best pointers, but our pointers in science tell us their limits.
3093760	3097200	The space time pointer stops at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. Thank you.
3097920	3102560	After that, space time is not worthwhile. It doesn't work and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.
3102560	3110080	That's the anti dogmatic cure that we get from science. That's really, really powerful. So,
3110880	3115600	I'm all on board with the spiritual traditions saying in some sense that
3116560	3122400	whatever reality is, you can only make pointers to it. And even our scientific theories will only
3122400	3129360	be pointers to it. And they're only pointers to a perspective on it. So the idea that the
3129360	3135360	infinite one that you were saying from the Sufi master, that the infinite needs to look at itself
3135360	3141840	from different perspectives, I agree. And maybe what science does is it gives us rigorous, the
3141840	3147920	most rigorous descriptions we can give pointers from a perspective. And the fact that we can do
3147920	3154080	technology doesn't mean that we know the truth. It means that we have a good description of this
3154080	3162480	perspective. And so the match of the scientific description to a perspective, not the ultimate
3162560	3169200	truth transcends, but the perspective description getting that right does allow technology. And
3169200	3175520	so that's where we can see most of our theories are not even right about our perspective, right?
3175520	3182080	We're just so wrong that we don't even get our perspective correct. So that's how humbling
3182080	3187520	this is. Yeah. And words are frustratingly inadequate for describing these things. And
3187520	3193600	much like what you were saying, it's so puzzling because our words are meant to communicate our
3193600	3201520	inner experience. And yet our inner experience inherently transcends linguistics. That's right.
3202560	3207600	And I'm excited to dive also into Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, because this points
3207600	3212880	that there are truths that can't be proven. And so we'll dive into that in a moment. But
3213520	3220480	just any further thoughts on how the limits of language is a very real thing. And it's a thing
3220480	3227120	on this podcast that we can talk about many different things forever. And yet you won't have
3227120	3233360	the experience of meant until you taste it. Until you taste it. That's right. And in spiritual,
3233360	3239840	the big one in spirituality is that the ultimate unconditioned consciousness
3240800	3249280	transcends any description. You can only know it by letting go of thought. And actually being
3249280	3256720	face to face, no thought with that unconditional infinite intelligence that you are. Now, for many
3257360	3267280	scientists, that sounds very mystical. It sounds very, very... This is so unscientific. It's so...
3268000	3276240	We want rigorous terms that we can verify and experiments. And my point earlier was,
3277680	3284800	no, this is not different than what's going on in science at all. All of the basic
3285920	3294160	concepts that we have, how do we know the taste of meant? If you've never tasted it,
3294160	3299440	I can't... The word is only a pointer. Spacetime. If you've never experienced spacetime,
3300480	3307120	the mathematics is only a pointer. So this is not something, some deficit of spiritual traditions
3307120	3312480	that they say, well, we're pointing to this, this mystical thing that's infinite intelligence that
3312480	3318560	you are. But, you know, no words. And most of my colleagues in science would go,
3319360	3322880	that's kind of nonsense. We don't need to deal with here in science. And I'm saying, no, no,
3322880	3327840	that's the kind of nonsense you deal with all the time. Almost every term that you use is only
3327840	3334400	known by what we call ostensive definition. Ostensive definition means someone has to point
3335280	3341760	and then give you the word. Like when you have a baby, 18 months, and it's time for them to learn
3341760	3349280	some words. And mom and dad, there's a rabbit on the carpet. And at the right age, you can just point
3349280	3359200	and say, rabbit. And, you know, Chris gets it. Maybe Chris gets that. Now, when you think about it,
3360960	3365680	that's a miracle. There's an infinite number of hypotheses that Chris could entertain. It could
3365680	3372320	be the fur, the texture of the fur, the color. It could be the ear and the left foot. It could be
3372320	3377600	the tail and the chair behind the rabbit. There's an infinite number. So how is it that all mom and
3377600	3386720	dad have to do at the right age is to point and say to Chris, rabbit. And Chris gets it.
3387760	3392720	Often in one or just one or two trials. That's ostensive definition. And that means that Chris
3392720	3398720	already has to have that experience. And mom and dad don't teach them the experience. They assume
3398720	3405280	the experience and they give a pointer, which is trivial compared to the experience of the rabbit.
3405920	3411040	Rabbit is nothing. The word rabbit is just a trivial pointer. And this is how we know
3411040	3417760	basically everything, every visual experience that you have, every smell experience you have,
3417760	3421920	every tactile experience you have, the fact that you get the name. People just tell you
3422800	3427760	the experience that you're having that I'm assuming that you're having. We call that, you know, hot.
3427760	3431520	We call that cold. We call that rough. We call that smooth. We call that satin. Whatever.
3432480	3437280	You have to have the experience. And that's almost any sensory experience is all by
3437280	3440880	ostensive definition. We don't teach people anything. If they don't have the experience,
3441760	3450240	you can't teach them. So this kind of thing, it's easy for scientists to dismiss the claim
3450240	3459440	that language fails to capture this deep consciousness that's unconditioned, that's
3459520	3466160	infinite, and that ultimately is the core of who you are. That sounds so schmistical to them.
3466160	3472640	And I'm saying, no, no, no, this is ubiquitous. And all the terms that we know basically are
3472640	3477360	by ostensive definition from things that transcend the words and can't be reduced
3477360	3484880	to the words. And I should just, it's humorous, but when you're pointing to the rabbit and saying
3484880	3489280	rabbit at the right age with Chris, what you don't do is point and say quadruped.
3491520	3497760	You'd be messing up your kid. If you said quadruped or, you know, mammal, something like that.
3497760	3504640	It's just the wrong thing to do. So we actually have rules that are wired into us. We know
3504640	3509280	intuitively, you don't have to go to class. You just know that when you're going to say rabbit,
3509280	3511760	you're not going to say quadruped or mammal or anything like that.
3512560	3516240	It's reducing it down to its function or parts instead of what its essence is.
3516240	3521440	That's right. And the kid is also pre-programmed to know that mom and dad know this intuitively.
3521440	3525520	So they're going to give me what we call the basic level object category name first,
3526080	3529360	and then they'll maybe give me some superordinate or subordinate
3530160	3535680	pointers later on. But right now, I'm going to just get the basic level. And so we're actually wired
3535680	3543440	up with the right way of pointing out. So the pointing that you get in the spiritual traditions,
3543440	3547840	and these are just pointers. I'm just pointing out that that's how we learn everything.
3547840	3553280	It's pointing out all the time. This is not just some mystical weird stuff that these people,
3553280	3556560	it's all over the place, and it's essential in science.
3556560	3561440	And I think that the pointing out of things doesn't absolve us of the mystery of what it is,
3561440	3567120	because oftentimes you give a bird a name, or you discover a new species or whatever,
3567120	3573680	and you name it. And it's like, okay, now we know what that is. There is a level of grandiosity,
3573680	3578560	just labeling something as in that's a rabbit. And okay, yeah, there's just not,
3578560	3583760	there's not, I just know that rabbits look like that, or a tree is just a tree. And you don't get
3583760	3588560	to, I guess, be surprised by the mystery of what the essence of that thing is, which is
3589280	3594000	like the one in the many different ancient wisdom traditions that have talked about this
3594000	3598320	immaterial realm that pre-exists space, time, and the quantum foam from
3599440	3606240	Kabbalistic origins talking about Ain Sof, which is literally without end, or Buddhism talking
3606240	3614480	about emptiness, or Advaita Vedanta talking about this non-dual reality, that the consciousness
3615440	3619760	extremely vast and differentiating itself into all of these different experiences,
3619760	3626160	which I find so fascinating. I've heard you talk to how, as humans, we have three channels of color
3626160	3632000	with red, green, and blue. The Mantis Shrimp has 10, 11, or more channels of color. What is that
3632000	3638960	experience like? Exactly. No, I agree with all the points that you're making here. And it's really
3638960	3643680	critical, as you were talking about the spiritual traditions, do tell us that the word is just the
3643680	3651360	word, and the reality transcends the word. The word is just a pointer. And so they often will
3651360	3658480	recommend that you spend time letting go of the words. So that's meditation. So if you want to
3658480	3667600	not be trapped in the trivial world of concepts, which is trivial compared to reality, then spend
3667600	3675440	time in meditation where you literally let your mind not dwell on the concepts. You just have no,
3676240	3680880	you let go of any concept. And when you actually look at the, when you walk around in the world,
3680880	3688720	look at trees, look at the ocean, where you just literally say, I'm, my mind can be quiet for a
3688720	3695120	while. Just no thoughts. I'm just going to be here in thoughtless pure awareness. Then the world
3695120	3701760	comes alive. And you begin to realize most of the time, you've killed the world. It's deadened. You
3701760	3708720	see the dead world of your concepts, and you don't see the living world that's around you. And I can
3708720	3715360	put this, so that's what spiritual tradition, I'll put this in scientific language, base inference.
3716480	3720720	We talk about our prior understandings, our prior probabilities as you know, in Bayesian
3720800	3728320	priors. So you have this prior probability of, for example, maybe belief in the standard model
3728320	3733840	of particle physics and the particular laws in that and those problems. That's my, my, my prior.
3734640	3740000	Before that, maybe with Newton, we had Newton's theory of physics and so forth. That would be our
3740000	3745840	prayer. And once you have a prior, once you have the prior probability, any new data that you get
3746720	3751200	will be interpreted in terms of your prior understanding. And there's this whole Bayesian
3751200	3755440	inference kind of thing. And you get a posterior distribution, which is so given that you have
3755440	3760400	this prior belief, and you get this new data coming in, then you compute what your posterior
3760400	3766560	distribution will be. Walking around without concepts, letting go of thought is saying,
3767840	3775760	I need to let go of my prior. If I don't let go of my prior, I'm condemned to only see my posterior
3776480	3781760	in, in both funny senses that, right? You can only see your posterior, both in the technical sense
3781760	3785520	and in, in this more metaphorical sense. If you don't let go of your priors, you will only see
3785520	3790560	your posterior. And, and so if you don't want to just be seeing your own posterior, you want to be
3790560	3795360	open up to novelty, then you actually have to spend time. I think as a scientist, it's critical for
3795360	3803920	me to actually spend time in, of course, thought and mathematics and hard notes of no substitute.
3804000	3811920	Do your hard work. And then let go of it completely. Sit there in utter silence. That's where the
3811920	3816400	true new creativity comes from. And then go back and try to translate it, if you can,
3816400	3821280	into the, the math and symbols that, that you have. And that way you're not stuck
3822560	3827200	with your priors. You, if you want creativity, you actually have to get outside your priors
3827200	3833440	all together. So I, so I would suggest that again, there's not some kind of schmystical, nasty,
3833440	3838480	terrible, silly stuff that's going on, you know, in spiritual traditions that, that's
3838480	3843440	anathema to science. I think there's a way to understand what the spiritual traditions are
3843440	3847600	telling us that makes sense from a Bayesian inference point of view from the science, from
3847600	3852400	the scientists. If you don't let go of your priors, you're condemned to only see your posterior.
3852400	3856640	So let go of your priors. What does that mean? Of course, do your homework,
3857280	3861600	but then at some point step back and let go of all your concepts for a while and see what comes out.
3862560	3867760	Yeah, it really seems like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where blind men come
3867760	3871680	and, you know, touch the tail of the elephant, think it's a whips and other touches the leg,
3871680	3877040	thinks it's a tree trunk. Another touches the trunk of the elephant and thinks it's, you know,
3877040	3882560	a snake and another touches the belly, thinks it's a wall. And they're all experiencing parts
3882560	3888800	of something and not understanding the whole of what it is. And I just find it very interesting
3888800	3895600	to explore the overlap and conciliance of what the cutting edge science saying with the ancient
3895600	3902400	wisdom traditions and philosophy and metaphysics. And if we can touch all the different parts of
3902400	3908560	that metaphorical elephant to see and talk to each other about what our experience is of that thing
3908560	3912560	that it points us closer to the direction of the experience of what it actually, you know,
3912560	3919600	what it actually is and what reality actually is. Yes, I think that the idea of the elephant being
3919600	3925440	looked at from different various perspectives is apt here. And the science gives us rigorous tools
3925440	3930560	to do that palpating of different parts of the elephant with more precision than we might otherwise
3931120	3935760	palpate it. And when I say that there's infinite job security and science, I mean,
3935760	3941680	that's really, truly humbling. It means that we, with all the palpation we've done,
3942640	3947680	we have 0% of the elephant underneath us, 0%. And that's, I honestly believe that.
3947680	3956240	I think that we've palpated 0% of it. What we know is one perspective out of an infinite
3956240	3960720	number of perspectives. Not like there's five perspectives and we got one of them.
3960720	3965680	No, there's an infinite number of different perspectives and whatever it is, but that's
3965680	3974240	who you are. What you are transcends any description, an infinite number of descriptions.
3974240	3980160	And so it's truly, truly a remarkable claim that spiritual traditions are making and that
3980720	3989840	you and I are just avatars. Andre and Don are avatars being used by an infinite consciousness
3989840	3993840	that transcends an infinite number of different descriptions and would transcend an infinite
3996160	4002480	study by science. And it's talking to itself through two different avatars and looking at
4002480	4007120	itself right now through a particular humble perspective, only a four-dimensional space
4007920	4013520	time headset perspective on itself. And it's doing that and who knows how many,
4014320	4018160	there's an infinite number of these other things going on all the time. But what's interesting
4018160	4026880	about it as well from a social perspective is, once I understand that Andre and Don are just
4026880	4030800	really the same consciousness talking to itself through two different avatars,
4030800	4037920	that's the real foundation for social interaction and social justice. Love your neighbor as yourself
4039680	4046480	is true and right because your neighbor is yourself. It's interesting that the infinite
4046480	4055040	consciousness that we are has chosen to forget itself, to plunge itself into a perspective
4055120	4061840	so thoroughly that it's lost in the perspective and it actually views its other avatars as enemies
4061840	4068720	in some cases and slowly wakes up. So somehow it's really important when you look at yourself
4068720	4072960	from a perspective that you really look at yourself from that perspective, you take it really,
4072960	4079520	really seriously and you get lost in it and then very, very painfully wake up and then you realize,
4079520	4087040	oh, as interesting and complicated and wonderful as that perspective was, I infinitely transcend that
4087600	4094080	and that's how the infinite comes to know itself. It's beautiful and it's why I love talking to
4094080	4099280	you so much too because you're able to navigate both terrains of the scientific understanding which
4099280	4107520	is rigorous and the philosophical and inner experience side of things. If consciousness
4107520	4116160	really is this unifying field, then us as individuals in parentheses having this individual
4116160	4122240	experience are much like waves of an ocean. We're not actually separate, but we have the
4122240	4127600	experience in a certain amount of time, in a certain amount of space that Andre and Don exist,
4127600	4133280	just like a wave exists in an ocean for a certain amount of time and for a certain amount of space
4133280	4137520	and it has its own experience that is unique and unlike any other wave that has probably ever
4137520	4144960	come before and after that time and space it inhabited is over, then it joins back the ocean,
4144960	4149840	but the kicker is that it was never separate from the ocean. In the first place. In the first place,
4150720	4157680	but there is value in the ocean having the wave in us as individuals that are connected to source
4157680	4164560	or the one kind of losing ourselves, discovering ourselves, waking up because that somehow provides
4164560	4169760	a unique nuanced experience and perspective of the one that otherwise wouldn't have been previously
4169760	4178320	available. I completely agree. I think that's right and the one thing that we're trying to do
4178320	4181920	with mathematics that we're working on right now is to actually take that idea and make it mathematical.
4182640	4190640	Again, the mathematics will always just be a baby step, but still to take those ideas that
4191280	4196560	what you were saying is I think been part of the wisdom traditions for millennia,
4196560	4201440	that kind of idea, to turn it into mathematically precise things. So what we're doing right now,
4201440	4207200	for example, we have with the Markovian dynamics of conscious agents and the way the wisdom ideas
4207200	4215440	get cashed out is that the model, again, it's just a model, but here's what the model says.
4216320	4220080	We can write down dynamics of this infinite conscious agent.
4222000	4226800	That's so-called stationary dynamics. There is no entropic arrow of time.
4228160	4230880	So it's a dynamical system, but the entropy is not increasing.
4231840	4236320	Well, if it is, then also, since your P is increased air is moving in the other direction,
4236400	4242880	what do you say? For stationary dynamics, that's the technical thing I'd have to ask about.
4244000	4252000	I'll have to look. Sidebar. That's right. But the entropy is constant in the stationary dynamics,
4252000	4258320	but it's a theorem that if I take this dynamics in which there's no entropic arrow of time and I
4258320	4264400	look at it from any perspective, by conditional probability, for example, then the dynamics that
4264400	4270720	I'll see will be a projected dynamics, and that projected dynamics will have an arrow of time.
4270720	4277040	The entropy will be increasing. So here we are with an entropic arrow of time.
4278800	4282640	The model I'm working on is there's a consciousness has no entropic arrow of time.
4282640	4287920	It's timeless, and it's also spaceless. But when I look at it from this perspective,
4287920	4291760	so we're talking about perspectives, but now we can deal with mathematical precision. We can say,
4291760	4295920	when we take this perspective, then by the mathematics tells us we're going to get an
4295920	4304240	arrow of time. So we will get a big bang. And by the way, it's all one. The consciousness is all
4304240	4309280	one. But when you get inside of the projection, now all of a sudden there are these artificial
4309280	4315760	boundaries. So you get what we call predictive processing and Markov blankets and active inference
4315760	4320960	and so forth. All of this stuff, which is sort of modern state-of-the-art neuroscience kinds of
4320960	4326560	things that we're looking to and other computer science looking at ways of, you know, modeling
4326560	4332160	thing, all of that breaking into units with Markov blankets, separating things and so forth,
4332160	4336720	active inference mean predictive processing to maintain our boundaries. All of that is not
4336720	4341120	an insight into the deep nature of reality. All of that is an artifact of loss of information
4341120	4346080	in the projection, as is Darwin's theory of natural selection. Nature, red and tooth and
4346560	4352960	claw. What is the fundamental limited resource in evolution? Time. If I don't eat in time,
4352960	4357120	I die. If I don't mate in time, I don't reproduce. If I don't breathe in time, I die. Time is the
4357120	4365200	fundamental limited resource. So I love Darwin's theory. Inside space-time, talking about biology
4365200	4369200	inside of our space-time, there's no better theory than Darwin's. Having said that wonderful
4369200	4374800	thing about Darwin, every aspect of his theory is an artifact of the projection from space-time.
4374800	4381760	None of it translates to anything about the reality beyond. None of it. So that's a real
4381760	4386960	warning sign to us to be very, very humble about our theories. Darwin's theory is a beautiful
4386960	4392800	theory inside space-time. It has no traction outside whatsoever. It's all of it as an artifact.
4395120	4399040	So we're not moving towards the theory of everything. We should be very, very humble.
4399920	4407760	I'm curious. Do you think that there are levels of fundamental reality that are simply inconceivable
4407760	4413280	to the human mind and understanding? Like, we wouldn't expect a monkey to understand quantum
4413280	4421360	mechanics or entanglement or have even the baseline ingredients to be able to have any
4421360	4426800	semblance of anything regarding quantum mechanics. Are there things that you think that are simply
4426800	4431040	beyond the capacity of the human mind to understand and deeper levels of reality?
4431040	4440880	That's, I do. I think that the human mind has great capacities and fundamental limitations.
4441520	4448000	And when spiritual traditions tell us to set aside the human mind now and then,
4448000	4454880	spend time on meditation and put the human mind apart, of course, then when you try to
4454960	4458880	reconceptualize what you experienced, you can only reconceptualize it inside the human mind.
4458880	4464000	That's the tool you've got. But in fact, you infinitely transcend the human mind. So you
4464000	4472240	aren't the human mind. When you talk to me through these avatars, we're having to use the human mind
4472240	4477520	and therefore, all of a sudden, the bandwidth goes down to a straw, a little tiny straw of
4477520	4481520	information that goes back and forth. But you and I are, in fact, the infinite intelligence
4481520	4486560	looking at itself through this particular little straw. So yeah, the human mind has this incredibly-
4486560	4487120	Write that down.
4488320	4493680	But you are not the human mind. You transcend infinitely the human mind. But
4494800	4499520	as long as you're in this avatar, you can only have a human mind appreciation of that transcendence.
4500480	4509040	I love that. So, I mean, right now, we're exploring the boundaries or limitations of
4509040	4514240	our possible understanding. And I know that you've talked to the value of discovering the
4514240	4520160	limitations of our mathematical theorems and because they show us what's possible and how we
4520160	4527440	can invent GPS and so much of things that we use and take for granted in our convenient modern society.
4528320	4533760	And it also shows us where it fails, right? And so, what is the value of discovering the
4533760	4538480	limitations? Do you feel like, and how it redirects us in our energy and their search?
4540000	4546240	Well, I think it's valuable for a couple of reasons. One reason is simply that it's true
4546240	4550000	that the mathematics, as powerful as mathematics is, and I love mathematics,
4552400	4556960	all the theorems that you can prove are a trivial subset of the theorems that are out there.
4556960	4559520	And all the theorems that are entailed by any set of axioms you write down
4561280	4568480	are trivial subset of all the theorems that are true. So, it's really important to know that.
4569120	4575040	Once again, I think one way to think about it is that it's the infinite intelligence giving
4575040	4582880	itself a wake-up call, giving its avatars, its projections a wake-up call. It's plunging itself
4582880	4586880	in all the way with both feet, it's losing itself in there, but it's giving itself a little hint
4586880	4592400	from the mathematics that says, no matter how smart and mathematically precise you are,
4593360	4598400	it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond. Wake-up call, wake-up call,
4598400	4605200	you aren't your projection, you aren't the avatar. Reality transcends, infinitely transcends anything
4605200	4608560	that you can do in your science and your mathematics, which is not to say, don't do your
4608560	4613680	science, do your, I'm a scientist, I'm not a mathematician, I wish, I wish I were, I work
4613680	4619760	with mathematicians, but I am a scientist. And so, I'm all for the science and the mathematics,
4619760	4627280	but it's wonderful to get a better appreciation of this projection of these avatars.
4627920	4633760	But ultimately, that's a big hint to ourself from Gertl's Incompleteness theorem, for example,
4633760	4640400	that there's infinite exploration beyond what you could even do with your science and your
4640400	4648640	mathematics. So, that's a very important wake-up call. So, let's explore that Incompleteness
4648640	4654000	theorem. I've been geeking out, diving deeper into Kierkegaard's Incompleteness theorem, also
4654000	4659440	his life and who he was as an individual, very, very interesting, regarded as one of the most
4659440	4666960	brilliant logicians to possibly have ever lived. And I recall Einstein referring to him as kind of
4666960	4671200	like the smart one, like he would like love to come back and go on long walks with him.
4671920	4677600	And a very interesting individual also had these metaphysical practices of laying down
4677600	4682240	and intuiting mathematical objects and different things like that, which I want to talk to you
4682240	4686240	about in a little bit. But for people that don't know what the Incompleteness theorem is,
4686240	4691840	how would you break it down in describing truths that are truths but can't be proven?
4693120	4700880	Well, what Gertl showed was that if I write down a certain set of axioms, like for arithmetic,
4701840	4709920	every number has a successor and things like that. If my axioms are enough rigorous and enough
4709920	4716000	complicated, so substantial enough to actually be able to formulate all of arithmetic,
4718160	4725840	then Gertl showed that he could write down a sentence that was true and could not be proven
4725920	4734240	from your axioms. And that's pretty stunning, right? So that was the brilliance was to actually
4734240	4741040	use the language of mathematics to write down a sentence that says, I'm true, but can't be proven.
4741040	4746960	And so he did that. And which you can say, well, okay, well, no problem, I'll just take that and
4746960	4752880	add that to my axioms. So now I'm good. So this statement wasn't provable, so I won't,
4753600	4759760	I'll just throw it in as an axiom. But then Gertl's thing is recursive. He can then show you another
4759760	4764640	one. And this goes on ad infinitum. What this means is Gertl showed that basically,
4766480	4773600	you can't just write down a finite set of axioms and then a set of rules and grind out all the
4773600	4784080	truths. Truth transcends proof. There's a bottom in three words. That's what that's Gertl in three
4784080	4792080	words. Truth transcends proof. And that's along the lines of what I was saying earlier that truth
4792800	4798160	transcends any scientific theory. Because every scientific theory is going to have
4798160	4804240	a mathematical set of assumptions, the axioms, and it will have mathematical derivation rules that
4804240	4810720	are, of course, usually at least is good enough for doing arithmetic. So every scientific theory
4810720	4816000	is subject to Gertl's incompleteness theorem, which means that as many truths as you can crank
4816000	4821120	out with your scientific theory, I'm sorry, as many proofs about realities, you can crank out
4821120	4826560	the truth infinitely transcends it. So this is another bit of humble pie. And again,
4826800	4834400	my take home message is not don't do science. Absolutely do science. Because science does
4834400	4840880	crank out a lot of interesting proofs that seem to be useful. But it also, to its credit, tells you
4841520	4844320	that it can't give you the whole truth. That's wonderful.
4844320	4851120	So he ascribed binary, I believe, different numbers to certain equations and theorems to be able to
4851120	4855200	prove this. A random example that's just coming to mind right now. I don't even know if it's accurate,
4855200	4862960	but I'd love to hear is if I say this statement, all men are liars. And I'm a man. If I am lying,
4863920	4869840	then that kind of eats itself because is that statement true or false? If I'm lying that
4869840	4875760	all men are liars, but that that entails that I'm telling the truth about all men are liars,
4875760	4880480	but I am also so it's like it kind of eats itself in a really confusing way.
4880480	4883680	That's right. The liars paradox is an important point.
4884640	4889280	I even know it's like a thing. It's a very, very big thing in mathematics.
4889280	4895360	And there's also the barber of Seville, which is a similar, the barber of Seville
4897440	4900720	shaves all and only those who don't shave themselves.
4902880	4909680	Who shaves the barber of Seville? Right. You get yourself into, so that's where this turns out
4909680	4915840	to be non-trivial in mathematics because you get things that Bertrand Russell discovered this issue
4915840	4922880	of in the set theory. So a lot of mathematics is set on set theory, the set of all integers,
4922880	4929120	for example, or the set of all prime numbers. We have all the sets are very, very important.
4929120	4936560	But Bertrand Russell pointed out that what about the set of all sets that don't contain themselves?
4936640	4943680	Does that set contain itself or not? And you get this liars paradox kind of thing coming out.
4949680	4954960	What they have often done is reduce set theory to what they call a class theory to try to avoid
4954960	4959840	these kinds of paradoxes. But my take is that this is really not really resolved. There is
4959840	4968320	this liar paradox kind of thing that goes on in mathematics. And so yeah, it's pretty deep.
4968320	4972880	But I would say that the big one though is that truth transcends proof.
4974000	4978720	And that you kind of in a way have to be, you have to go outside of a system to like fully
4978720	4984800	understand it. And that consciousness is not amorphous, but structured. And that structuredness,
4984800	4994320	I guess, goes to infinity. I would agree up to a point. I would say that when you say
4994320	4999760	consciousness is structured, I would say as a scientist, I'm limited to describing consciousness
4999760	5003840	as structured and having that structure go into infinity. That's what I'm doing. So what you're
5003840	5009360	describing is what I'm trying to do. But I actually think that consciousness transcends
5009360	5016640	structure, infinitely transcends structure. But it can be structured. Just like projection.
5016640	5023440	Sure. Like we're structures of consciousness in a way. That's right. But what you are literally
5023440	5030480	does transcend any words or any mathematics period. But there's an infinite number of
5030480	5036000	perspectives that we could take on the true consciousness. And in many of those perspectives,
5036000	5041280	then you could have infinite mathematical description that I'm working on. The paper I'm
5041280	5045840	working on right now is one. So I'm working on a paper right now where you want to share a little
5045840	5052880	bit about just to just to touch. I love I love to hear. Yeah. So it's, we have this Markovian
5052880	5058640	dynamics. So Markov chains describing a big social network of interacting conscious agents,
5058640	5060560	an infinite number of them in principle.
5061520	5069920	So it's just like, like you were talking about, I mean, infinite structure description of, of the
5069920	5076880	one consciousness. And I'm doing that because that's the best I can do as a scientist. But I,
5076880	5081680	as I said earlier, I think that consciousness transcends that completely. So, so, so I'm
5081680	5085280	putting the humble pie right up front on this. But now with the humble pie there,
5085280	5092800	fun part of this, this, this perspective, it turns out that we discovered just in this year a,
5093920	5101200	a new order on Markov chains that no one had ever discovered before. And it's a way of saying when
5101200	5107600	one Markov chain in some sense is less than another or entails another. For those who know
5107600	5112960	Markov theory, I'll just say it real briefly. If you can take a Markov kernel, and if you take a
5112960	5118640	trace of it of that Markov chain on a subset of its states, like the first three states or
5118640	5122800	something like that, you'll get a new Markovian kernel called the trace chain. So you can take
5122800	5127440	a big Markovian kernel, trace it on a subset of its states, and you get a new Markovian kernel
5127440	5132160	that's called the trace chain of it. And now I can go into an intuition on that if you want to,
5132160	5136480	I can say a little bit more intuitively about what that means. But what this logic is, is we
5136480	5144800	discovered that if you say one Markovian kernel entails another or observes another,
5146160	5149680	if and only if it's a trace of the other. So it's a trace chain of the other.
5150560	5155920	Then you get a complete logic. All consciousnesses are now tied together in this one big logic.
5156640	5161120	You could talk about when they can actually, it tells you how to combine consciousnesses,
5161120	5165440	when they can combine into new higher consciousnesses, and when they can't. It's a
5165440	5176640	non-bullying logic, and it shows that consciousness can go infinitely far in complexity, in infinitely
5176640	5184000	many directions. There's no one top consciousness in this model. So even this mathematics is already
5184000	5189040	complex enough to say whatever consciousness is, there's not just a single little guy at the top.
5189600	5195440	There's an infinite number of directions. You can go infinitely far. And so we'll be publishing
5195440	5202880	it this year, this paper. So there's this whole logic of all the little consciousnesses and bigger
5202880	5209280	and bigger consciousnesses, how they combine to ultimately point to the one consciousness
5209280	5216800	which transcends our logic. But with this logic, this is going to be part of the key for us making
5216800	5223680	the map into space-time and the physics, and giving a theory of observation. Because we now have
5225120	5231040	a theory, what does it mean for one consciousness to observe another? It's if it's a trace of the
5231040	5237360	other. And that's going to be, we're thinking it's going to be a big, big help in physics because
5238240	5244640	in quantum theory, they don't have a theory of observation. They don't have a theory of the
5244640	5252240	observer. So when you don't observe something, there's a unitary linear evolution of the system.
5252240	5259520	But when you observe, whatever processes, whatever system is doing the observation is nonlinear,
5259520	5268480	it's nonunitary. And so for quantum theory has been out for almost 100 years, in 1926 to now,
5268480	5277920	so 98 years. And no theory of observation, because you can't reduce a nonunitary process
5277920	5284240	to a unitary one, you just can't do it. So we're proposing a theory of observation for physics.
5284960	5291360	With what you just described, is it possible that it could be linked to what someone,
5291360	5298160	some would regard as a kind of contentious exploration with James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis
5298160	5305760	that the Earth is itself a living organism? And I'm curious if this, because it sounds like
5305760	5310400	you're exploring the inter, how consciousness is kind of like linked together. Do you feel
5310400	5315760	like conscious agents such as Don, Andre, everybody that lives on Earth and the organisms that live
5315760	5322240	here, like conscious agents could kind of stack to create a bigger one? For example, Gaia, do you
5322240	5327920	see that as a possibility? Well, yes, but it's a completely different framework from the Gaia
5327920	5333200	kind of hypothesis. So let me sort of explain the difference in perspective.
5335120	5339840	From the theory of conscious agents, it's saying that consciousness is fundamental,
5340880	5348720	and spacetime and its objects are just a headset. So to make it really radical, how radical it is,
5350320	5355760	most of us think of ourselves as little 100 to 200 pound tiny objects inside of an infinite
5356720	5363200	spacetime with trillions of galaxies and so forth. So I'm this tiny little 200 pound object
5363200	5369680	in this massive universe that's been there for almost 14 billion years and so forth.
5370880	5379280	And what I'm saying is that's completely wrong. Whatever you are, spacetime is a trivial data
5379280	5385360	structure inside you. So you're not this trivial 200 pound object inside this vast spacetime.
5385360	5393520	That vast spacetime is a trivial data structure inside you. So that's how radical what I'm saying
5393520	5398480	is much more radical than the Gaia hypothesis. So if you're looking for who is the bigger
5398480	5409120	or not, right? But then the idea is that what we view, we look around us, we see what we think
5409200	5416960	is a distinction between animate and inanimate objects. I mean, I'm not worried about hitting
5416960	5422480	this, whereas I'd be worried about hitting you. If I hit the microphone, it might mess up the
5422480	5428000	audio a little bit, but I'm not worried about causing any pain on anybody. Whereas if I hit you,
5428000	5435120	I'd be causing pain. So we have this distinction between animate and inanimate objects. And
5435200	5440320	the Gaia hypothesis is starting to sort of play with that saying, well, maybe the difference between
5440320	5446000	living and non-living isn't as tight as we thought. Well, I think that that's right in the following
5446000	5452320	sense. The distinction we make between animate and inanimate objects, I claim, is completely
5452320	5456640	unprincipled. There's no principle distinction between animate and inanimate at all.
5457200	5467520	No. In this point of view, the only reality is consciousness. That is the reality. So I'm always
5467520	5472160	interacting with my headset, space-time headset. I'm always interacting with consciousness.
5472720	5480400	But my consciousness, my headset is dumbing things down, right? And that's what headsets do. They're
5480400	5485120	simplifying things. Right now, so I have some insight into your conscious experiences through
5485120	5492400	my headset. But when I look at a mouse, I'll get much less insight, but some. When I look at an amoeba,
5493360	5500320	much less, virus, much less. And then when I look at protons, neutrons, none, rocks, none.
5501120	5506160	But think about it this way. Suppose I'm talking with you on a Zoom screen,
5507360	5511680	and there's a bunch of pixels on my screen. Some of the pixels are pixels of your face.
5511680	5516640	And those pixels provide me with a portal into you, into what you're thinking. I mean,
5516640	5522640	like, if you smile, I can, you know, he must be happier or frown, he doesn't like what I just said.
5522640	5527280	So I get some insight from those pixels about your conscious experiences. But the pixels of the
5527280	5533920	wall behind you. No, no insight into consciousness whatsoever. Now, I wouldn't want to say, ah,
5533920	5539200	so there is a distinction between animate and inanimate pixels. Those are the living pixels,
5539200	5544480	and those are the none. That's dumb. Pixels are pixels. They're part of an interface,
5544480	5551040	a headset, or a desktop. And some of them, some pixels provide a portal into the
5551760	5557920	consciousness, you know, and others don't. And so this is the way I think about why there's no
5557920	5563440	distinction between animate and inanimate objects. Space time is just a headset. The headset
5564080	5567760	sometimes gives me insight into consciousness. Sometimes it doesn't. That's what headsets do.
5567760	5573280	They dumb things down. That's a limit of the headset, not an insight into reality. So when I
5573280	5581520	look at a rock, I am interacting with consciousness. But my interface is so impoverished that all I get
5581520	5592560	is a rock. Yeah. Now, I hope that the back and forth goes both ways, that just as the
5592640	5599120	consciousness on the other side can't really affect me too much directly, I can't affect the
5599120	5603120	consciousness too much through the rock. If I smash the rock, as I might have to do if I'm
5603120	5608240	building a house or something like that, I would hate to think that I was causing pain
5609120	5614880	on the other side. But I don't know. There's no portal into the conscious experience of a rock.
5614880	5621040	That's right. But I mean, we could assume that objects with no central nervous system would not
5621040	5627120	be able to feel pain in that way. But I'm curious. So you think, do you believe that all inanimate
5627120	5636240	objects have a degree of sentience, like having a sliver, a type, a scale somewhere
5636240	5641280	of a conscious experience? I don't. And I don't think the human body has any sentience either.
5641920	5649680	Because body is just an interface description. It has nothing. Your body, the body that I see,
5649760	5655600	that I call Andre, only exists when I perceive. That body is now gone. It only exists in the
5655600	5659280	instant. So rocks don't have this liver of consciousness because rocks don't even exist
5659280	5663600	when they're not perceived. And the human body, the human brain doesn't exist when it's not
5663600	5670240	perceived. I have no neurons right now. Yeah. So this is when we say local realism is false.
5670240	5676320	We have to be completely thorough. Local realism is absolutely false. And that means the human body
5676880	5680880	only exists when it's perceived and it doesn't contain consciousness.
5680880	5686480	However, when I see a human body, I know my interface is telling me, don't do certain things
5686480	5690400	because my interface has given me a way that could affect consciousness.
5690400	5695600	So I just want to clarify here. Are you saying that when you look away from me,
5696880	5701040	I cease to be rendered in your experience. So in a way, I cease to exist.
5702000	5709440	But the fundamental constituents of my consciousness, although not rendered in real
5709440	5717200	space time, still do exist, but completely detached from the way our sensory system would
5717200	5720720	perceive it. That's right. You're not in space time. Yeah. Space time is in you.
5721760	5725360	Completely. Yeah. So you're entirely outside of space time. And your body
5725440	5733040	is literally just a pixel description. When I take my camera and point it,
5733760	5737840	the pixels for Andre will light up and I now have Andre pixels. As soon as I
5738400	5744160	turn the camera, those pixels are gone. There is no, and your body is just as ephemeral as that.
5745360	5751360	Even to myself, right? Right now, I have no brain. There are literally no neurons.
5751360	5754240	There's no neuron. Now, if you did a scan, you would find neurons, but that's because
5754800	5760400	you're intervening and looking. So you get a picture. Now you've got your pixels that you've
5760400	5765760	sort of said, now I've got my pixels making neurons. Okay, fine. But neurons only exist
5767360	5772160	in the act of observation. You don't have neurons when they're not perceived,
5772160	5776480	but you do have what neurons are connected to. Would you say that?
5777520	5782880	Nothing in space time exists when it's not perceived. Nothing. Space time itself doesn't
5782880	5787200	exist when it's not perceived. So this goes way beyond the Gale hypothesis, right?
5787200	5793600	I know, I know. But the objects in space time, they are connected to the structure of reality.
5794560	5800480	Just like the pixels on the desktop are a portal to back and forth that when we're talking to each
5800480	5807600	other. Right. So they're- So yeah, like a folder on your desktop screen doesn't exist when it's
5807600	5814240	not perceived, but the electrical gates and things that are happening within the computer system,
5814800	5821360	those do exist. In that metaphor, they do. But when I let go of, when I then step back and
5821360	5824320	apply that metaphor to all the space time, then they don't exist anymore.
5824880	5831120	So I use that metaphor just to get people to understand the ideas. So for sake of argument,
5831120	5834000	let's assume the computer's real. Yeah. The circumstances are real.
5836080	5842800	People will grant me that. Once they understand, okay, oh yeah, no, there's no blue rectangular icon
5842800	5847360	inside the computer. You won't find that. So my file on the desktop is not, there's nothing on the
5847360	5851040	computer. It looks like once you get that, then you have to kick that ladder away. That includes
5851040	5854080	kicking away the computer itself. It doesn't exist when it's not perceived.
5854640	5859360	All right. So yeah, I mean, it's, I feel like no matter how many conversations I have
5860160	5864640	with you, there's still some more head wrapping. I have to, like I need to wrap my head around
5864640	5868560	this even further. And I feel like our audience does too. It takes many times of talking about
5868560	5875280	this and exposure to it to like. The rabbit hole goes deeper. It does. It keeps going. It just
5875280	5880480	seems to keep going. I'm as uncomfortable as you are, by the way. I mean, I have gone through
5880480	5887840	this kicking and screaming myself. Just grasping onto space time as a rug fully gets pulled
5887840	5893840	underneath you. And emotionally, I don't believe it one bit. I can see why I do meditation and so
5893840	5902400	forth. I realized the amount that this has penetrated into my emotional belief in is 1%.
5903520	5911040	Yeah. But the logic, I mean, I just can't argue with the logic and who knows when my emotions
5911040	5919360	will come along for the ride. There seems to be various enlightened beings, masters of meditation
5919360	5925280	that have emotionally embraced it. What they would say is close to 100%. Yes. Where they have
5925280	5931280	literally no fear of the body because they clearly have the perception that it is not thumb. Right.
5931280	5934800	Where if somebody comes up to you, God forbid on the street and puts a gun to your head.
5934800	5939600	I'd be scared. Scared to death. Right. It seems like in the metaphysical practices
5939600	5944800	and the contemplative sciences, you can arrive at the place experientially, emotionally,
5945360	5950080	where you truly perceive the source of that which you are. And therefore,
5950080	5955680	that which you are not does not have to grip over you. Which is interesting because it requires both
5955680	5961840	the rigorous science and logic to be able to explore these things and explain it with the
5961840	5966160	limited capacity we have for language with language. And then the contemplative practices
5966160	5973440	that allow us to arrive there experientially to become closer and intimate and become one with
5973440	5980080	that which we truthfully are. I completely agree. And I think that there are spiritual
5980720	5989120	masters who are there. Eckhart Tolle, for example, I suspect truly doesn't fear death.
5989920	6004000	And so, and I intellectually think that, well, this is interesting to think about this way.
6006320	6009600	Think about a video game in which you jump into the video game
6011520	6016480	and you could be in the game identified with the avatar. That's me. So if it's a shoot-em-up game
6017440	6020960	and you think you are your avatar, you're going to be scared to death and you're going to be
6021520	6030880	really alert and suppose that, I mean, I'm maybe sealed or something. I'm trying to get you ready.
6030880	6035120	So I'm putting you in this game. So I want to somehow drug you so that when you get in the
6035120	6039920	simulation, you think it's real because I want you to be scared to death and I want you to learn how
6039920	6044400	to fight in that thing. So I'm going to make you identified. So here's a drug that makes you identified
6044400	6051920	with your avatar in this VR game. And boy, you really, you, and then it will slowly
6053360	6061040	let you disidentify from that avatar. And that's what I think is going on here is we're in this
6062080	6066000	emotionally. I'm still identified with the avatar, but part of me is recognized. Oh,
6066720	6070400	Don, that's just an avatar. It's not you, but the emotional part of me is still
6071280	6075280	plugged into you are an avatar. The meditation process is slowly
6076560	6084640	waking me up to the truth that an avatar is just an avatar. Relax. Just relax. It's just your avatar.
6084640	6092000	You are the infinite intelligence of which this whole simulation is a trivial little game that you
6092000	6098080	is. It's no effort for you, whatever. It's literally nothing. And all the wealth and all the possessions
6098080	6104320	you could possibly have, you could be the richest man on earth. It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing.
6105440	6109440	It's just a little game in you and you could make a billion other much better games than that.
6110320	6115600	So that's, but see, mostly I'm still, it's very, very interesting to know that I am the infinite
6115600	6123600	intelligence. I've woken up a little bit, but not completely. So I'm still halfway between
6123600	6128880	identifying with the avatar and halfway of disidentifying with the avatar. And I agree
6128880	6132560	that there are spiritual masters who have completely disidentified and I would love to
6132560	6141360	disidentify because it's no fun to be afraid. Yeah. I find it so interesting how I think largely
6141360	6146720	like around the time of the Vienna circle and the like 19th, 20th century, there was kind of
6146720	6153440	this big divorce between the simultaneous contemplative practices and metaphysical practices
6153520	6160240	alongside the scientific explorations. And like most people don't understand to the degree in
6160240	6167840	which Newton himself had just as much exploration into alchemy than the sciences. And it makes
6167840	6171840	sense that they're kind of, they're one and the same in the source. And then there's the
6171840	6176160	experiential side and then there's the logical side. There's the particle. There's the wave.
6176160	6180560	There's two ways to come at something from the top down, from the bottom up,
6180880	6187040	you know, and the way that it's processed. I'm curious because I know you meditate for
6187040	6193600	like roughly like two hours a day, at least you sit in silence. And Kurt Godel was somebody who
6195200	6199840	very, very viscerally felt that you could lay down and he would say he would lay down for
6200480	6206320	hours and get rid of all of his senses. So hearing, tasting, touching, smelling,
6206320	6211840	he would feel that you could intuit directly mathematical objects that since we're connected
6211840	6216720	to it, there shouldn't be any reason that by abiding in the place in which we are connected
6216720	6223760	to it, that you shouldn't be able to have intuitions around it that then come into your
6223760	6227520	mind or your thought that you could then channel into his work. And he said that he did that very,
6227520	6231440	you know, and he's one of the most brilliant logicians to ever exist. And he was doing that.
6231440	6238320	So I would just be so curious to see what would happen if the most brilliant minds in today's
6238320	6242880	age had those practices to support them on the practices as well. So how do you feel like your
6242880	6248720	practice has personally benefited you on that journey? Well, I think that it's absolutely
6248720	6255200	essential. I didn't start meditating for that reason. I started meditating for the very pedestrian
6255200	6259440	reason that I was having hard time sleeping and I didn't want to take drugs. And so I said,
6259440	6264160	well, they'll meditate. But then I realized later on, well, there's a lot more to this
6264160	6268240	meditation just helping me with my sleep. This is pretty profound transformation that's going on
6268240	6272320	here. So I can't take credit or anything like that. I just was doing it for my own little silly
6272320	6278000	reasons. But then I stumbled onto this is pretty important. And now I use it explicitly as a tool.
6278800	6286000	I need new ideas. Go into silence. I mean, when you realize that you are that infinite intelligence,
6286000	6291280	that's what you are. But if you don't let go of your Bayesian priors,
6291280	6294880	you'll only see your posterior. So I have to, how do you let go of your Bayesian priors? There's
6294880	6300720	only one way to do it. That's literally to let go. No thoughts. How can you get into the unknown
6300720	6307120	if you don't leave the known? That's exactly right. So I think this is absolutely essential
6307120	6312640	for scientists. And I think that the very best creative ones, whether or not they're,
6312640	6317680	they know it, they go into a moment of silence when the real deep intuitions come. Of course,
6317680	6321760	you have to do your homework. You've studied your math. You see, there's no, there's no
6321760	6326880	substitute for doing the hard work. It's just like a powerful, brilliant musician without
6326880	6330880	understanding and practicing their skills. Then they can throw it out the window and it's a part
6330880	6335440	of their unconscious competence. And then they sit down, listen, and something beautiful, the next
6335440	6339840	masterpiece comes through. That's right. You had to do your homework. But then, then is when you
6339840	6345440	sort of let go of what you know, that the new originality comes through. And Einstein did talk
6345440	6353680	about that. He said that his big ideas came to him in vague images and so forth. And for me, too,
6354720	6362560	I'm no Einstein by a long shot. But my ideas, when they do come, come from moments of silence,
6362560	6367200	where I've done my homework, I have a problem I'm trying to solve. And then all of a sudden,
6367680	6372800	follow myself just going deep silence. And then all of a sudden, I see something coming.
6372800	6377520	So I think for scientists to actually take advantage of it, to realize you are that infinite
6377520	6383040	intelligence, let go of your, of course, build your priors. That's what science is. Build these
6383040	6389520	really good prior. But then let go of them. If you need to transcend Newton, you have to let go of
6389520	6394560	Newton for a while before you can go to quantum and general relativity and so forth. You have to
6394560	6401680	let go of Newtonian ideas. And so going into the silence beyond any concept is really critical.
6401680	6406160	So it's again, an interesting back and forth and we're getting a little picture perhaps of what
6406160	6414320	the one is doing all the time in is that back and forth between I've got this perspective on myself,
6414320	6420080	I got the Newtonian perspective, that was fun. Let me go deeper. Oh, now I got relativity. Oh,
6420080	6424080	now I've got quantum mechanics. And that's still trivial compared to what I am. But that was an
6424080	6429120	interesting new perspective. And so even these perspectives as fun as they are are trivial
6429120	6437200	compared to what you are. What do you say to people that would comment on this podcast? Like
6437200	6443280	somebody did the last time saying, what difference does it make if reality is an illusion? The pain
6443280	6450880	I feel is real to me. The joy I feel is real to me. We are having an experience that is obviously
6450880	6459680	incredibly valuable. And it feels real to us. So I guess, how would you respond to somebody that
6459680	6465760	says, why does it matter if reality is an illusion? Which it might seem like a trite kind of after
6465760	6471440	our whole conversation, it seems silly to ask that question, because it has very real implications.
6471440	6476560	But how would you respond to that? Well, I'd say a couple of things. I think
6477440	6484960	all of us are inquisitive. Who am I? Why am I here? What is this all about? I mean, maybe
6484960	6494480	some people are not. But I think most of us are. And then most of us, when we start hearing
6495680	6500800	the various stories that people tell, find them, man, it's probably not good enough. That story
6500800	6508480	is probably not good enough. And so I think it's really important because we are inquisitive. And
6508480	6515760	that may be what we're here for, in fact, is why does the one plunge itself into avatars is
6517360	6523840	because it's answering the question, who am I? And it's taking an infinite number of different
6523840	6527920	perspectives and looking and saying, oh, from this perspective, I could talk about myself
6528720	6535840	this way. And so to find out that this is just a perspective is important,
6536560	6539840	that this is an illusion, this is just a perspective. So I'm using those two things
6539840	6544960	together here. It's a perspective. Therefore, it's not the truth. Therefore, it's in that sense,
6544960	6552560	illusory, is perhaps as best language can be used to describe it. What we're here for in the first
6552560	6557280	place, we're here to learn that this is an illusion, but it was an interesting illusion.
6557360	6563040	And look how complicated we are from this point of view, and yet we transcend all of that. So that
6563040	6571120	would be, I mean, one answer. On the other hand, I think if someone persisted in saying that, I
6571120	6576720	would say, well, that would be another perspective that the one takes on itself from your avatar.
6576720	6582800	And maybe that's what the one needed to see from that perspective as well, that relax.
6583760	6589280	And in some sense, yeah, relax. There's nothing that needs to be completed about you. You are
6589280	6593760	already the infinite. So maybe this is just really about enjoying all the perspectives,
6593760	6596640	including the perspective. Who gives it? Yeah.
6598560	6604080	Yeah, no, I love that. I'm curious what you think as we've been exploring like alternative
6605040	6610240	views from the conventional notion of our understanding of reality, what do you think
6610320	6616240	starts to open into otherwise contentious fields of understanding of out-of-body experiences,
6616240	6622720	precognition, remote viewing, near-death experiences, with this understanding that we've
6622720	6626640	been exploring with consciousness, what implications do you feel like it has in those realms?
6627200	6634640	Well, if you're a physicalist, these things can't happen. If, like me, you're a conscious realist,
6635520	6643840	I can't rule them out. Now, as a hard-nosed scientist, I'm not happy just to say I can't
6643840	6649600	rule them out. Therefore, I'm going to say that these things are all real. Absolutely not.
6650480	6654320	I'm going to be hard-nosed still about it. What I'm not going to do is rule them out a priori.
6654880	6666000	But I'm more than 100% sure that most of these are probably confabulations,
6666720	6673840	right? Probably most things are confabulations. But there is, for example, the near-death experiences
6673840	6680640	that there seem to be, there's some systematic experiences of the tunnel, the light, the life
6680640	6686800	review, maybe a decision to come back. That seems pretty consistent. So, I wouldn't rule that out
6687920	6690880	at all. But here's where I get hard-nosed about it.
6693520	6700480	As a scientist, I'm on a theory, right? So, and I'm working on it. So, we'll see. But if
6700480	6709120	space-time is just a headset, then what does, in some sense, my experience of me is just an avatar
6709120	6714160	in that. And now we have these experiences of an avatar going through a tunnel and seeing a white
6714160	6721760	light and review. I want my theory of conscious agents to be able to show how we make a headset
6721760	6726960	and then show me precisely when that headset is coming to an end for a particular avatar.
6729360	6736400	Why or how I could get this tunnel with a light experience. In other words, until I have a
6736400	6742880	scientifically precise theory of this and then can make predictions that are testable.
6745360	6756160	All we have are informal accounts, hints, in other words, a pre-scientific kind of approach.
6756160	6760560	And what we've found throughout human history is, of course, you can do great things without science
6760560	6765200	and you get geniuses who just have good intuitions and do things. But when you actually get the
6765200	6771280	systematic science stuff, you find out that most of what you believed was nonsense. Most of
6771280	6775760	things that people did were just plain nonsense. Not all. Sometimes, you know, indigenous people
6775760	6781120	have some really deep insights that you can't explain how they got that. But most of the time,
6783280	6790720	there's just plenty of nonsense. So, my guess is, if I were a physicalist, I'd say all nonsense.
6791040	6795360	No, nothing to be saved here. This is all just illusions caused by the brain activity and so
6795360	6799680	forth. So, I'm not saying that whatsoever. So, I'm not saying it's all nonsense. I'm saying
6801120	6805920	at least in principle, it's not all nonsense. I'm saying in practice, probably most of it,
6806480	6814960	99% of the reports are probably just not accurate. But that doesn't mean that there's something deeper
6814960	6821040	that isn't true. I think that life does not end with the death of the body. It's just taking off
6821040	6828560	the avatar. So, I think that maybe Hoffman, as Hoffman doesn't exist anymore, but the consciousness
6828560	6833040	that was the true thing behind Hoffman will continue to exist because it's the infinite
6833040	6838640	consciousness. So, I may lose everything that I'm attached to in terms of the Hoffman ego.
6838640	6844720	All that has to go and spiritual teachers tell us to die before you die. And that's, I think,
6844720	6849600	that's right. In some sense, if I can die to everything about Hoffman and don't care about
6850560	6858080	Hoffman, because Hoffman is just an avatar, then when there's time for the avatar to go
6858080	6863680	goodbye, it'll be just like in the VR game. Once I've not identified with the avatar, when this
6863680	6868000	game over, I don't care. That was just my avatar that died. It's not me. It's my avatar that died
6868560	6875520	and then shut down the game. So, I guess I'll summarize what I'm saying.
6876800	6881680	I cannot dismiss any of these, the near-death experiences or any of these kinds of things.
6881680	6886800	I can't dismiss them out of hand. But I think that those who take consciousness as fundamental
6887440	6894800	owe it to everybody to give absolutely rigorous scientific accounts of these things and to hold
6894800	6900240	the highest standards in terms of the data that we try to collect and so forth.
6901680	6907440	So, this is not, you know, saying consciousness fundamental is not an invitation to just accept
6907440	6914000	any hypothesis and say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It means I'm open to them, but I'm going to be
6914000	6921120	hard-nosed about them. And that's what we should do, because if there is something real there,
6921120	6926160	then we want to understand really what it is. Yeah. I'm curious what, if you had to give your
6926160	6933120	best guess, if when we die, consciousness still exists, in regards to reincarnation,
6933120	6937520	which there's been some interesting studies about kids that come in and have actual memories that
6937520	6943760	you can verify in the real world of people who have lived that they claim as dumb, from where
6943760	6949040	they lived to people that were, they were in relationship to, to favorite objects that they
6949040	6954880	had. If it is in the case that somehow this consciousness leaves and then does take another
6954880	6963680	form, how could it possibly be done where, I guess, memory is stored in consciousness and
6963680	6971680	could take on another avatar? Right. Well, this is quite interesting because I was approached by
6972640	6979600	a team of brilliant researchers. One, one of the, the head of the team is a research
6979600	6984320	scientist at Caltech, and most of them are Indian, so they're, I think, more Hindu and possibly,
6984320	6990000	and they're very interested in reincarnation. And, and I actually gave a talk in their workshop
6990000	6997680	at the Science of Consciousness Conference in Tucson back in April. And they found out about this
6998640	7005200	trace logic that I've mentioned via trace chains of Markov chain. And they realized that that might
7005200	7011040	actually give them the tools they need for understanding reincarnation. So, so I've been
7011040	7016240	collaborating with them, and they're going to actually be implementing that logic and trying
7016240	7024080	to start to make predictions from it of reincarnation. Now, I'm, I'm just giving them help to
7024160	7027600	understand the basic logic. I'm not actually part of their, their, their research team,
7027600	7032400	but I will, I'll, I'll help them. So I'll, you know, I have no axe to grind on this. I mean,
7032400	7037440	I know very little about the theory of reincarnation and so forth. But, but they do, I mean, they're,
7037440	7043040	they're quite immersed in it. So I'll be very interested to see, but, but this seemed to be,
7043040	7049840	this trace logic of conscious agents seemed to be the first mathematical framework they'd ever seen
7049840	7055440	that had the potential to begin to address these, these kinds of questions rigorously,
7055440	7060400	mathematical rigor. So, so they'll be doing some big simulations, big, big matrices with
7060400	7066880	millions of entries and so forth to, to, to try to, to get at this. And the kind of question you
7066880	7071200	asked is going to be the kind of question we'll try to answer. How could the memories of one life,
7071200	7076560	one avatar sort of be stored in the network and then downloaded into another headset and so forth?
7076560	7080960	Right. Yeah, be very interesting. Yeah. But so finally we have a mathematical framework that's
7080960	7089760	rigorous enough and, and can be implemented in, in computers to test it, which is fun. I mean,
7089760	7092880	at least with science, you can actually test things and go, oh, most of the time you realize your
7092880	7097760	ideas are just wrong. That's just wrong. Whereas if you don't have the mathematics, you can,
7097760	7100800	you can believe for many, many years that you're on the right track when you're deeply wrong.
7101280	7106640	Yeah. You mentioned how our understanding of spacetime and Newtonian physics has
7106640	7111760	buried many fruits and technologies that we use in every day, in the everyday world. What do you
7111760	7117520	think could be some possible practical applications of this new understanding of consciousness and
7117520	7121040	how it would change how we live in the practical world tactically?
7121600	7126880	I think that you can't think big enough on what it's going to do. Quantum mechanics opened up
7126960	7132560	incredible technologies that are mind blowing. What are some fields perhaps that you think would be
7132560	7136240	like revolutionized? Well, transportation for example. So right now,
7138000	7142880	there are billions or maybe even trillions, but at least billions of galaxies that would be fun
7142880	7148960	to explore. The nearest one is more than 2 million light years away. That's the nearest one. Well,
7150000	7155520	even if we're traveling through space near the speed of light, that's a long, long time. I mean,
7155520	7160960	if you put some humans on the spaceship, the great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids
7160960	7166160	wouldn't be alive. So you can see that's our nearest galaxy. So going through spacetime
7167600	7173760	and seeing any of the real estate is just not possible with our current way of thinking. But
7173760	7179280	what if you realize that spacetime is just a headset and you know the code? So in some sense,
7179280	7184000	so think about someone who's, again, a real wizard at Grand Theft Auto. They know how to drive their
7184000	7187760	car faster than anybody else and they know all the, they know the terrain and they can beat
7187760	7193280	everybody. That's great. But if you're the software engineer who wrote the code, well, you can do
7193280	7197440	things that are magic to the wizard. You can give them a flat tire anytime you want to. You can
7197440	7201600	take the gas out of this tank. You can change the geometry of the roads. You can take his car and move
7201600	7206000	it from one side of the game to the other instantly just like that by changing a pointer. Well,
7206720	7212800	when we're, this theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software outside of
7212800	7218080	our spacetime headset. We're starting to learn how the game is rigged. How do we play, how,
7218080	7223600	what is a software that's playing the spacetime game? Once we understand that, I don't think we'll
7223600	7229680	have to go through spacetime to the Andromeda Galaxy. We can go around spacetime. We can just
7229680	7235760	be there. So we're going to, so, and that's just one. I think you just can't think big enough.
7235760	7240880	Once you, once you know the software, you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.
7241840	7247680	It feels like there's not an area of life that it wouldn't revolutionize. Think about like healing
7247680	7254800	if you understand the deeper dynamics of how the projection of like all of ourselves work together.
7256880	7263680	What we maybe would have spent decades trying to heal physiologically or travel to
7264640	7272320	within the limits of the speed of light, all of a sudden like miraculously cease to exist because
7272320	7276880	you're working with dynamics outside of the headset. That's right. So I think, you know,
7276880	7281680	in medicine, probably there'll be all sorts of remarkable things. So as I mentioned earlier,
7282160	7287280	the 86 billion neurons and roughly the same number of glial cells make the brain is really
7287280	7293200	complicated. But we're going to be going to the more complex software outside of it. We'll actually
7293280	7300160	be able to understand and maybe rewire the brain outside of space time. And then also understand
7301760	7305360	systems in the body at a much deeper level and then rewire them. So yeah, I think that
7305920	7311760	the revolution in medicine will be remarkable. What do you think it will take for the brilliant
7311760	7317040	physicists that are currently out there to pivot their intelligence to exploring realities beyond
7317120	7322800	space time, beyond the headset? Well, the Universe Plus project that the European
7322800	7329760	Research Council has funded already has over 100 scientists doing that. So they're funding
7331200	7334960	the look for these new positive and understanding these positive geometries
7334960	7339600	beyond space time. That's very different than saying that they're after consciousness,
7339600	7344480	but they're not. I mean, maybe individuals are, but that's not what the ERC is up to.
7345440	7353440	My hope, I'm actually trying to get one of these... Trying to recruit one of them.
7353440	7358640	Trying to recruit. I've got money for it. So I've got money for a postdoc, for two postdocs. So
7358640	7363280	if someone's got, what I need is someone with a recent PhD in algebraic geometry,
7363280	7366880	specific branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which is really critical to these positive
7366880	7372480	geometries, or a real understanding of high energy theoretical physics and in particular the
7372480	7377600	amplitude and so forth. Because in the current paper, we're going to make a projection to a
7377600	7382720	special case of the amplitude, but we would like to have someone who can actually help us do the
7382720	7386960	real whole deal. So we want to do proof of concept in this paper and show that we can actually start
7386960	7393040	with conscious agents and predict scattering of gluons in space time so that we now can go all
7393040	7398960	the way. So we've got the little bridge across. Now we need someone to help us build the whole
7398960	7405680	thing, right? A big, big road across. So we're looking for relative new PhDs in
7405680	7410640	high energy theoretical physics or algebraic geometry can help us with this. But ultimately,
7413680	7423040	once we do that, if we can actually make a prediction, a new prediction inside space time,
7423040	7428720	from a dynamical system of conscious agents, we can show that these positive geometries
7428800	7432960	arise from it. We can actually make new predictions that are testable and then come out to be true
7432960	7438240	inside space time. We won't have any trouble at that point getting people. Now we may have trouble
7438240	7441760	having them take it seriously as consciousness. They might say, consciousness, munchiness. Who
7441760	7445440	cares about that? But you've got a Markovian dynamics outside of space time. I'm good with
7445440	7450400	that. So let's just, let's go with that. And so it's not going to be a proof of consciousness
7450400	7455840	being fundamental, but it'll be perhaps an indication that a Markovian dynamical system
7455840	7460960	outside of space time is an important next step in science. And that would be fine with me. If
7460960	7467920	they dismiss the conscious stuff, that's perfectly fine. I completely respect that.
7467920	7473600	But I would be loving to give me, these guys are brilliant, guys in the generic sense. These people
7473600	7480160	are brilliant and much more smart in this stuff than I am. And so I'll just be able to then kick
7480160	7486560	back and try to read their papers. That's what I want. Yeah. I'm so curious to see what evolves
7486560	7492560	in that space and then also globally. I mean, as these new innovations and discoveries come on
7492560	7499440	board, I'm curious to see what happens with religious fundamentalists, with people's understanding
7499440	7506560	of perceptions on God too. Would you say that, I don't love the term or using it because it's
7506560	7512560	so tainted, but the closest thing approximating the term of God would be the collective consciousness
7512560	7520560	of all that is? Well, I would say that the word God and then the word collective unconsciousness
7522240	7531040	or collective conscience are pointers and that the thing itself completely transcended. It is
7531040	7535840	not even a thing, right? Going back to the mint. Yeah. Even to say the thing itself is already
7535920	7543120	a mistake, right? So all these things are pointers to something that transcends. And again,
7543120	7548320	I said something. So as soon as I start using language everywhere, as soon as I say something,
7548320	7553360	I realize, wrong again, wrong again, wrong again. Maybe for the next podcast, you should just sit
7553360	7559280	here in silence for a few hours. Well, that's right. And bore people to death and enlighten them.
7559440	7567040	Yeah. So I think the deepest, rigorous thing I've seen so far is this
7568240	7575200	trace logic on the space of conscious, of Mark Covington. But that's what, having said that,
7575200	7584800	I then will immediately say it's a baby step and compared to the reality, zero, right? So I think
7584800	7591040	that we can go infinitely beyond what I've done, what my team has done with this Markov,
7591040	7598400	trace chain thing. And even if we go infinitely beyond it, and we do that for a trillion years,
7599200	7606080	we'll be 0% of the way toward understanding what you already are completely.
7606800	7611440	Because it's infinite. It's completely infinite. No matter how big the number gets, it's still
7611520	7616080	nothing in comparison. And that puts the light of dogmatism, right? It's really,
7617440	7622720	dogmatism is really missing the point. Dogmatism is missing the point that
7625280	7632240	what you can say about it is never it, never it. There's no right formulation of words.
7633120	7638800	And killing people, because their formulation of words is different from yours, is really to miss
7639600	7643840	the point that, I don't know what the word is for meant in Spanish, but
7644960	7648560	saying meant in Spanish versus saying in English is nothing to kill over. Hey,
7648560	7651520	we're pointing to the same thing. You're just saying it in Spanish, I'm saying it in English.
7653040	7658880	Let's not kill each other over it. We're pointing to the same thing, which is what you are,
7658880	7665040	and what everybody else is. They are that, and they are that completely already.
7666000	7673280	And what is interesting that the one consciousness chooses to put itself into avatars and let itself
7673280	7682320	get so wrapped up that it forgets itself and it kills, it has some avatars kill others.
7685120	7685680	Ultimately,
7689280	7693120	when you realize it's just an avatar, in some sense, nothing was really ever lost.
7695280	7700080	When you, with your friends, and you shoot up your friend's avatar, and then afterwards you
7700080	7704080	take off your headsets, laugh, have a beer together, and it's just your avatar.
7705200	7709680	It's just like the, I don't know if you've seen the film Ruddy Player One, but I love it,
7709680	7715440	and it gives a perfect description of what could be very real in the next 20 to 30 years,
7715440	7724000	if not less, where you have a setup that you plug into with a headset and biofeedback technology
7724000	7730560	that plugs you into another reality that is extremely real. And if the rise of technology
7731440	7736480	is at all moving forward, given enough time, well, we will come to the place where
7737520	7742560	our games are, we can plug into another virtual reality that seems extremely real. And you take
7742560	7751280	like GTA or Sims just further down the line as AI and technology advances. It's not far off from
7751280	7758960	the future reality that we could create what is like a simulation and what seems to be conscious
7759680	7764800	beings having an experience, whether or not they are, is up for debate. But then we get lost in
7765440	7771440	the sauce, so to speak. We think that we are the character, and yeah, you've given a lot of
7771440	7776080	important pointers to waking up beyond who we are in this headset.
7776640	7779360	Yeah, I think that you're right that there's going to be an infinite
7780320	7784640	number of directions we can explore with different kinds of simulations and so forth and
7784640	7789200	exploring different physics, right? We can change the laws of physics in these new worlds and see
7789200	7794240	how we adapt to them. Why not have instead of three dimensions of space, one of four dimensions
7794240	7799440	of space. Actually, a friend of mine, Mike Desmura, a professor at UCI, probably 20 years ago,
7800640	7804640	was already doing that with his graduate students. They were making four-dimensional worlds and having
7804640	7809600	people learn to play in these four-dimensional worlds, and one of the graduate students
7809600	7812800	claimed in their thesis that people were learning to actually experience, you know,
7812800	7817680	to actually see in four dimensions. And I didn't buy, I let him get his PhD, but I didn't buy that.
7818720	7824320	But I think if you trained infants, but I don't think you can do this for ethical reasons,
7824320	7831680	but if you trained infants, possibly, possibly, they might be able to develop a four-dimensional,
7831680	7840240	a real four-dimensional space-time experience. So, yeah, I think that we can certainly push
7840240	7846640	the parameters and our imagination is the only limit. I'm very interested to see what happens
7846640	7853200	as we can, also within the headset, explore the boundaries of what our senses are capable of.
7853200	7857920	Forgot the scientist or researcher that was Anika Harris, who we just had on was referring to, but
7858240	7864320	they're actually training, like, for example, the sense of the magnetic field of the Earth,
7865120	7870720	and you could develop that sense to know where, like, North is based off of wearing this device,
7870720	7874480	and you can, like, it's a new sense that you could develop and have the capacity for.
7875040	7883360	There is, I believe it's the Kogi tribe in South America, where within the first seven years,
7883360	7889920	the Chosen Shaman children largely live in darkness, which you could say is unethical,
7889920	7895040	we could say many different things, but they are developing a completely unique relationship
7895040	7900160	to their internal reality than people in the Western world, just like the opposite end of the
7900160	7907040	spectrum, and what that unlocks for their capacity to navigate those realms, you know,
7907040	7912560	in their own consciousness. It's very interesting. It really is, and also David Eagleman has been
7912560	7919120	doing this kind of research, right, where he's been sort of augmenting our senses in various
7919120	7923040	interesting ways. You could even have people that could sort of have the stock market information
7923040	7927040	being played onto their body, and they could sort of feel when this time does buy and when
7927040	7931760	this time does sell, and so forth. They can build these intuitions. So, yeah, there's a lot of
7931760	7939360	untapped potential that we could use, but I think it's really fascinating. Right now, we're doing
7939360	7945600	this using just what we know about the neuroscience inside the headset. Once we actually have stepped
7945600	7950640	outside the headset, and we know the software behind the neuroscience, then those kind of
7950640	7954560	technologies I think are going to be even more powerful. Yeah. Do you think we will create
7954560	7963760	conscious AIs? So, that's a good question. Most people, when they answer that question,
7963840	7969440	or even ask it, what they're thinking about is this framework, that building a conscious
7969440	7974720	AI means we're starting with these unconscious circuits and software, physical stuff in space
7974720	7980480	and time. That's the fundamental reality. But if we get the right kind of complexity in the
7980480	7986800	circuits and the software, then the unconscious circuits and software will give rise somehow
7986800	7990480	to the conscious experience. So, that's the way most people take your question, and you try to
7990480	7996880	answer them. They'll say, oh, yeah, sure. Of course, we know that physical systems can create
7996880	8001520	consciousness. Your brain is a physical system, and it creates consciousness. Neurons, neural
8001520	8005440	circuits create consciousness. So, yeah. So, most people, that's the kind of answer they're going
8006080	8013680	to give. My answer is very, very different. I say that neurons don't even exist when they're not
8013680	8020880	perceived. Circuits and software don't exist, except as ideas in my mind. So, I've got to rethink
8020880	8024960	the question entirely. So, here's how I rethink the question.
8028480	8033280	Inside my headset, there are certain portals to consciousness. One is what I call the Andre
8033840	8040320	body. That's a portal into a consciousness. And we have one technology
8041200	8047200	that we know of that works for creating new portals into consciousness. And that technology is
8047200	8053760	having kids. So, it's low tech, but it works. So, we actually, we have a technology that opens up
8053760	8059600	new portals into consciousness. So, from this point of view in which consciousness is fundamental,
8059600	8064400	if we can actually reverse engineer with maybe the concentration theory as the first baby step,
8065360	8069040	understand that technology. What are we doing when we have kids?
8069600	8072800	From the point of view of consciousness, how is a new headset being created?
8073600	8080720	Once we've reverse engineered that, then we can ask ourselves, can we do it ourselves?
8080720	8085280	Can we just take that and do it abstractly? Instead of doing it through human mating,
8085280	8091520	can we actually do it in some sense technologically? And I think ultimately,
8091520	8094880	the answer is probably yes, we'll be able to open new portals. And when we do it,
8095760	8101280	it may be that certain of the technologies we use will look in our headset like artificial
8101280	8107920	intelligences on computers, circuits. But now notice that the answer is completely different.
8107920	8114480	I'm not saying that the circuits and software are creating the consciousness. I'm saying that
8115040	8119760	consciousness is fundamental. What looks like technology is an interface representation that
8119760	8125440	only exists when you happen to see it. So, the software and hardware aren't even there
8126080	8130960	when you don't look. The only thing is there are the conscious agents. But through your headset,
8130960	8137120	it looks like a conscious robot that you're interacting with. So, you can see why I had
8137120	8143440	to give a long answer. If I just said yes, the answer is yes, I think we could do it.
8143440	8147520	But you can see that that would have given you entirely the wrong perspective on what I'm saying.
8147600	8153200	Yeah. The first example you gave is if you've seen Ex Machina, the movie, where they
8154160	8161040	essentially develop this through the wetware and the hardware, this sentient AI humanoid robots,
8163120	8166480	that would be creating it, essentially creating consciousness through
8168640	8171600	figuring it out throughout the Newtonian world, essentially.
8172640	8177040	If you assume that physical is framework, you're not going to understand really what you're doing.
8177760	8182400	Now, it may be that ultimately, we'll find with this theory of consciousness fundamental,
8182400	8186880	we'll figure out what we have to do inside of our headset and maybe it'll look like the Ex Machina
8186880	8191760	kind of thing. But what we'll realize is that what we're really doing is rearranging this neural,
8191760	8197760	this network of conscious agents. It looks like neurons or circuits in software inside space time,
8197760	8202080	but what we're really doing is this new programming of conscious agents or whatever
8202080	8208560	transcend conscious agents. So it still may work out that way, but the real scientific
8208560	8213360	theory will be much deeper than space time. And by the way, that's not just a cognitive
8213360	8218160	scientist saying that this is now the European Research Council putting 10 million euros on the
8218160	8222880	line saying these positive geometries outside of space time are the real deal. This is the way
8222880	8230080	forward. Let's do this. Incredible. Man, I love, thank you so much for your time today. I'm just so
8232080	8236720	it brings me joy. Like I just feel like a giddy kid who discovered a new toy every time I get to
8236720	8242960	dive deep into this discussion that just like lights me up so much because starting to slowly chip
8242960	8249360	away at a model of understanding the world, which has so many implications of how we navigate
8249360	8253760	within it. And diving deeper into the truth as like, you know, that's the goal with here in the
8253760	8260400	no less self podcast to discover the true nature of ourselves and the world around us. And I just
8260400	8265280	putting it out there in the field, I have the vision of producing these high quality round table
8265280	8273280	discussions around specific areas of life, one being music as medicine, another being around
8273280	8278800	consciousness theories. And so I'm excited to hopefully in the next 12 months, I'm just going to
8278800	8282960	find the location and find, you know, the way we want to do it because it's a full thing to like
8282960	8290080	have six state individuals fun to start to create these conversations that can be shared
8291680	8297360	in in all of its nuance and all of its many different perspectives to start to like refine
8297360	8301600	each other's perspective in a way that can be perceived for the masses and for people online
8301600	8307200	to be able to watch and intrigue interest for people that may want to go down this path and
8307200	8312960	find the way that the one uniquely wants to express itself through them. And so be on the
8312960	8316800	lookout for that. I'm excited to have something like that in the future as well. I think that's
8316800	8321680	an excellent idea. I think that actually something new could come out of it when you bring people
8321680	8328640	together that are thinking roughly the same, but but not exactly the same. And they've done a lot
8328640	8334400	of work. They're thinking about it really, really deeply. Then you get some new sparks that they
8334400	8338880	could really light something up. Yeah. Yeah. And I know researchers obviously do that in their own
8338880	8343520	accord behind closed doors. And we're not, but it's interesting when you put it in the media,
8343520	8347680	you know, and for people to view. And it's like the parable of the blind man and the elephant,
8347680	8352160	you know, let's sit down at a round table, put this elephant on the table and talking about it.
8353200	8357520	Absolutely. Absolutely. Sweet. So amazing. Now, is there is there anything else you want to share
8357520	8362080	with their audience? Having understood, you know, the context of the conversation we just have that
8362080	8367440	you would like to wrap up on or share before we close? I would just say one thing. This is the
8367440	8372480	Know Thyself podcast. It's about Know Thyself. And I would just say that what I've learned is that
8373120	8375920	whatever you are transcends any description.
8378480	8384880	I've said, amazing. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody that's been tuning into this episode,
8384880	8390640	if you made it through nearly two and a half hours, you're my kind of people.
8391360	8396480	I just love to share this, this joy and this conversation and dialogue. So thanks for coming
8396480	8400080	on this journey. As always, let us know in which ways this has uniquely impacted you.
8400800	8406560	And until next time, be well. Thank you, Don.
