800	7840	There's this kind of unfortunate hole that a lot of people fall into if they're talking about free and open-source software or
8360	15240	Digital privacy digital security all this kind of stuff a lot of people will get that they will bite that
15520	17520	They'll go down that rabbit hole
17640	22200	Okay, and they'll be interested in oh, how can I do things right online?
22200	25200	How can I be secure? How can I reduce spyware all that kind of stuff?
25680	31000	one issue that I find is that many of those people obsess with the technology oh
31440	35400	My goodness open-source software is so cool all encrypted all Monero
35480	38600	It's so cool all this all this technology is fantastic
39040	44480	Ignoring the context in which it's used and what I mean by that it here. Here's my actual viewpoint
45320	48840	the absolute most secure way to do something is
49440	50680	always
50680	54960	Not using the internet always a hundred percent of the time
54960	62680	You want to have a secure end-to-end encrypted chat? Well talk to someone in real life without cell phones around. Okay, do you want to?
63840	70760	Buy something anonymously well buy in cash all of that exists in real life, and it functions perfectly
70760	76400	Actually, I was talking about this over the weekend. I did an interview with Kevin Wad who's one of those Monero guys
76400	82040	Maybe you guys know about him and initially he disagreed with this point because I he said something like oh my goodness
82040	87080	It's gonna be so great. We're gonna have Monero this private cryptocurrency if it takes over the world
87080	90160	We can all you know transact privately and stuff like that
90160	93400	And you know we won't have cash anymore and all that kind of stuff and I was like no
93400	98320	I don't want that I absolutely don't want that because what that means even if you have a solid technology
99240	101240	That actually really does
101320	103840	You know protect people's privacy. I
104400	111400	Want the option of being able to use something physical some physical currency some paper cash to transact with people now
111400	115480	It can be a cash based on gold or silver or even it could be based off a digital currency
115480	121120	but I always wanted that ability to be able to transact without a cell phone app without
122000	129280	Connection to the internet that is something that we inherently need and most people if they they're really worried about personal privacy
129280	130680	They wouldn't be more
130680	133840	Technological and they wouldn't use more and more fancy equipment
133840	138600	They would be less technological and not use the internet and not use digital technology
138640	140640	What so ever?
140880	146440	Over Christmas. I actually saw this pretty good video. There's this guy on YouTube Eli the computer guy
146440	150480	I've known that he existed for a while, but I watch is what I watched one of this video
150480	154440	These videos he did on tour or maybe it was I2P or something like that
154440	157480	and he made this really good comparison and that is
158040	164080	Tor if you're using tour to be anonymous. Hey, that's great if it works, you know, there are there are problems for there
164080	169120	Potential vulnerabilities and things with it. But hey, if you're trying to be anonymous online, that's great
169520	175840	But what he said is trying to be private online is kind of like trying to encrypt
176200	182440	Yodeling right because when you're making connections on the internet, you are I mean that stuff is all over the place
182440	187480	The the amount of metadata leakage even if you're doing everything perfect is enormous
187480	195560	Okay, so trying to use that digital technology in a privacy-respecting way is like trying to encrypt Yodeling
195560	198320	I absolutely agree with that. That's a perfect analogy of his
198800	200520	and so
200520	203300	Most of the time if you need to talk to someone, right?
204160	205880	Should your first
205880	210720	Option be let me get this encrypted chat application and I'll use that. No your first
211440	214600	Reflect should be let's see. Can I talk to this person in real life?
214600	219240	Right, can I can I wait until I see this person in real life when I talk to him, right?
219400	225320	That should be reaction number one and I absolutely don't want what I don't want and what I'm worried about
226160	230800	Especially when I see free and open-source technology becoming this enforced standard
231120	235200	Even if it's an open standard actually if it's free and open source as as an enforced
235800	237800	enforced standard that's
237880	244560	Arguably even worse because you know more people can build stuff on top of it easier than you know proprietary programs
244560	249920	And I'm very worried about living in a digital police state that's built on free and open-source software, right?
250440	253000	technology can easily be designed to
253400	259320	Cause people problems even if you know it could be worse worse if it's proprietary or something else like that, right?
259320	261320	I mean we saw a bunch of governments
261560	268440	Try to develop contact tracing apps and there are even a lot of free and open-source people even I think the Linux Foundation and
269240	276840	Those groups of people would fund projects for contact tracing apps that were open source. I don't give a crap if the
277800	281120	dystopia we're gonna live in is proprietary or open source
281120	284720	It doesn't make a lick of difference for me because I don't want to live in one of those dystopias
284720	290480	I do not want to have to be relying on that kind of technology and yes when you're using digital technology
291280	293280	100% of the time use
293720	300640	Free and open-source software use cryptocurrency in crypto encrypted, you know private cryptocurrency like Monero
301280	305360	Use always use the best technology if you have to use technology
305360	310000	But 90% of the time I'm gonna go ahead and guess you don't really need to use technology, right?
310040	316200	You're just you're doing things as a replacement for real life that you shouldn't really be doing anyway
316200	320240	I mean this is this is half self-help half privacy advice
320320	324080	But a lot of people just use the internet for things for social things
324080	331080	they shouldn't be using them for anyway and it is a privacy liability and the solution is not necessarily not even
331160	336880	Necessarily to move to some super private social media site that is free and open source
336880	339560	I mean that in some use cases you could you know make a
339960	343200	You know use that to an end and that might be helpful
343200	347200	But I think in most cases people just shouldn't be using digital technology for most of this stuff
347200	352960	You are trying to encrypt yodeling. That's it. That's a great analogy and that's what you're doing. So
353600	356000	That's just a reminder if you need to touch grass
356800	358120	relax
358120	362960	Just try not to use computers that that's I don't know that that's basically what all of my videos are about, right?
