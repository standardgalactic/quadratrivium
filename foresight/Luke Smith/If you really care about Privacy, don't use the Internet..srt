1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,840
There's this kind of unfortunate hole that a lot of people fall into if they're talking about free and open-source software or

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,240
Digital privacy digital security all this kind of stuff a lot of people will get that they will bite that

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
They'll go down that rabbit hole

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,200
Okay, and they'll be interested in oh, how can I do things right online?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,200
How can I be secure? How can I reduce spyware all that kind of stuff?

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,000
one issue that I find is that many of those people obsess with the technology oh

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,400
My goodness open-source software is so cool all encrypted all Monero

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,600
It's so cool all this all this technology is fantastic

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,480
Ignoring the context in which it's used and what I mean by that it here. Here's my actual viewpoint

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,840
the absolute most secure way to do something is

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,680
always

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,960
Not using the internet always a hundred percent of the time

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,680
You want to have a secure end-to-end encrypted chat? Well talk to someone in real life without cell phones around. Okay, do you want to?

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,760
Buy something anonymously well buy in cash all of that exists in real life, and it functions perfectly

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,400
Actually, I was talking about this over the weekend. I did an interview with Kevin Wad who's one of those Monero guys

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,040
Maybe you guys know about him and initially he disagreed with this point because I he said something like oh my goodness

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,080
It's gonna be so great. We're gonna have Monero this private cryptocurrency if it takes over the world

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,160
We can all you know transact privately and stuff like that

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
And you know we won't have cash anymore and all that kind of stuff and I was like no

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,320
I don't want that I absolutely don't want that because what that means even if you have a solid technology

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
That actually really does

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,840
You know protect people's privacy. I

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Want the option of being able to use something physical some physical currency some paper cash to transact with people now

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,480
It can be a cash based on gold or silver or even it could be based off a digital currency

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,120
but I always wanted that ability to be able to transact without a cell phone app without

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Connection to the internet that is something that we inherently need and most people if they they're really worried about personal privacy

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
They wouldn't be more

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,840
Technological and they wouldn't use more and more fancy equipment

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,600
They would be less technological and not use the internet and not use digital technology

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
What so ever?

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,440
Over Christmas. I actually saw this pretty good video. There's this guy on YouTube Eli the computer guy

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,480
I've known that he existed for a while, but I watch is what I watched one of this video

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,440
These videos he did on tour or maybe it was I2P or something like that

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,480
and he made this really good comparison and that is

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Tor if you're using tour to be anonymous. Hey, that's great if it works, you know, there are there are problems for there

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
Potential vulnerabilities and things with it. But hey, if you're trying to be anonymous online, that's great

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,840
But what he said is trying to be private online is kind of like trying to encrypt

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,440
Yodeling right because when you're making connections on the internet, you are I mean that stuff is all over the place

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,480
The the amount of metadata leakage even if you're doing everything perfect is enormous

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:15,560
Okay, so trying to use that digital technology in a privacy-respecting way is like trying to encrypt Yodeling

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,320
I absolutely agree with that. That's a perfect analogy of his

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,520
and so

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,300
Most of the time if you need to talk to someone, right?

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,880
Should your first

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,720
Option be let me get this encrypted chat application and I'll use that. No your first

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,600
Reflect should be let's see. Can I talk to this person in real life?

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,240
Right, can I can I wait until I see this person in real life when I talk to him, right?

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,320
That should be reaction number one and I absolutely don't want what I don't want and what I'm worried about

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Especially when I see free and open-source technology becoming this enforced standard

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
Even if it's an open standard actually if it's free and open source as as an enforced

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
enforced standard that's

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Arguably even worse because you know more people can build stuff on top of it easier than you know proprietary programs

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
And I'm very worried about living in a digital police state that's built on free and open-source software, right?

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,000
technology can easily be designed to

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,320
Cause people problems even if you know it could be worse worse if it's proprietary or something else like that, right?

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
I mean we saw a bunch of governments

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,440
Try to develop contact tracing apps and there are even a lot of free and open-source people even I think the Linux Foundation and

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,840
Those groups of people would fund projects for contact tracing apps that were open source. I don't give a crap if the

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,120
dystopia we're gonna live in is proprietary or open source

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
It doesn't make a lick of difference for me because I don't want to live in one of those dystopias

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,480
I do not want to have to be relying on that kind of technology and yes when you're using digital technology

62
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
100% of the time use

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Free and open-source software use cryptocurrency in crypto encrypted, you know private cryptocurrency like Monero

64
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Use always use the best technology if you have to use technology

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
But 90% of the time I'm gonna go ahead and guess you don't really need to use technology, right?

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,200
You're just you're doing things as a replacement for real life that you shouldn't really be doing anyway

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,240
I mean this is this is half self-help half privacy advice

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,080
But a lot of people just use the internet for things for social things

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,080
they shouldn't be using them for anyway and it is a privacy liability and the solution is not necessarily not even

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Necessarily to move to some super private social media site that is free and open source

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,560
I mean that in some use cases you could you know make a

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,200
You know use that to an end and that might be helpful

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
But I think in most cases people just shouldn't be using digital technology for most of this stuff

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,960
You are trying to encrypt yodeling. That's it. That's a great analogy and that's what you're doing. So

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just a reminder if you need to touch grass

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,120
relax

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Just try not to use computers that that's I don't know that that's basically what all of my videos are about, right?
