00:00.800 --> 00:07.840
There's this kind of unfortunate hole that a lot of people fall into if they're talking about free and open-source software or

00:08.360 --> 00:15.240
Digital privacy digital security all this kind of stuff a lot of people will get that they will bite that

00:15.520 --> 00:17.520
They'll go down that rabbit hole

00:17.640 --> 00:22.200
Okay, and they'll be interested in oh, how can I do things right online?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.200
How can I be secure? How can I reduce spyware all that kind of stuff?

00:25.680 --> 00:31.000
one issue that I find is that many of those people obsess with the technology oh

00:31.440 --> 00:35.400
My goodness open-source software is so cool all encrypted all Monero

00:35.480 --> 00:38.600
It's so cool all this all this technology is fantastic

00:39.040 --> 00:44.480
Ignoring the context in which it's used and what I mean by that it here. Here's my actual viewpoint

00:45.320 --> 00:48.840
the absolute most secure way to do something is

00:49.440 --> 00:50.680
always

00:50.680 --> 00:54.960
Not using the internet always a hundred percent of the time

00:54.960 --> 01:02.680
You want to have a secure end-to-end encrypted chat? Well talk to someone in real life without cell phones around. Okay, do you want to?

01:03.840 --> 01:10.760
Buy something anonymously well buy in cash all of that exists in real life, and it functions perfectly

01:10.760 --> 01:16.400
Actually, I was talking about this over the weekend. I did an interview with Kevin Wad who's one of those Monero guys

01:16.400 --> 01:22.040
Maybe you guys know about him and initially he disagreed with this point because I he said something like oh my goodness

01:22.040 --> 01:27.080
It's gonna be so great. We're gonna have Monero this private cryptocurrency if it takes over the world

01:27.080 --> 01:30.160
We can all you know transact privately and stuff like that

01:30.160 --> 01:33.400
And you know we won't have cash anymore and all that kind of stuff and I was like no

01:33.400 --> 01:38.320
I don't want that I absolutely don't want that because what that means even if you have a solid technology

01:39.240 --> 01:41.240
That actually really does

01:41.320 --> 01:43.840
You know protect people's privacy. I

01:44.400 --> 01:51.400
Want the option of being able to use something physical some physical currency some paper cash to transact with people now

01:51.400 --> 01:55.480
It can be a cash based on gold or silver or even it could be based off a digital currency

01:55.480 --> 02:01.120
but I always wanted that ability to be able to transact without a cell phone app without

02:02.000 --> 02:09.280
Connection to the internet that is something that we inherently need and most people if they they're really worried about personal privacy

02:09.280 --> 02:10.680
They wouldn't be more

02:10.680 --> 02:13.840
Technological and they wouldn't use more and more fancy equipment

02:13.840 --> 02:18.600
They would be less technological and not use the internet and not use digital technology

02:18.640 --> 02:20.640
What so ever?

02:20.880 --> 02:26.440
Over Christmas. I actually saw this pretty good video. There's this guy on YouTube Eli the computer guy

02:26.440 --> 02:30.480
I've known that he existed for a while, but I watch is what I watched one of this video

02:30.480 --> 02:34.440
These videos he did on tour or maybe it was I2P or something like that

02:34.440 --> 02:37.480
and he made this really good comparison and that is

02:38.040 --> 02:44.080
Tor if you're using tour to be anonymous. Hey, that's great if it works, you know, there are there are problems for there

02:44.080 --> 02:49.120
Potential vulnerabilities and things with it. But hey, if you're trying to be anonymous online, that's great

02:49.520 --> 02:55.840
But what he said is trying to be private online is kind of like trying to encrypt

02:56.200 --> 03:02.440
Yodeling right because when you're making connections on the internet, you are I mean that stuff is all over the place

03:02.440 --> 03:07.480
The the amount of metadata leakage even if you're doing everything perfect is enormous

03:07.480 --> 03:15.560
Okay, so trying to use that digital technology in a privacy-respecting way is like trying to encrypt Yodeling

03:15.560 --> 03:18.320
I absolutely agree with that. That's a perfect analogy of his

03:18.800 --> 03:20.520
and so

03:20.520 --> 03:23.300
Most of the time if you need to talk to someone, right?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.880
Should your first

03:25.880 --> 03:30.720
Option be let me get this encrypted chat application and I'll use that. No your first

03:31.440 --> 03:34.600
Reflect should be let's see. Can I talk to this person in real life?

03:34.600 --> 03:39.240
Right, can I can I wait until I see this person in real life when I talk to him, right?

03:39.400 --> 03:45.320
That should be reaction number one and I absolutely don't want what I don't want and what I'm worried about

03:46.160 --> 03:50.800
Especially when I see free and open-source technology becoming this enforced standard

03:51.120 --> 03:55.200
Even if it's an open standard actually if it's free and open source as as an enforced

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
enforced standard that's

03:57.880 --> 04:04.560
Arguably even worse because you know more people can build stuff on top of it easier than you know proprietary programs

04:04.560 --> 04:09.920
And I'm very worried about living in a digital police state that's built on free and open-source software, right?

04:10.440 --> 04:13.000
technology can easily be designed to

04:13.400 --> 04:19.320
Cause people problems even if you know it could be worse worse if it's proprietary or something else like that, right?

04:19.320 --> 04:21.320
I mean we saw a bunch of governments

04:21.560 --> 04:28.440
Try to develop contact tracing apps and there are even a lot of free and open-source people even I think the Linux Foundation and

04:29.240 --> 04:36.840
Those groups of people would fund projects for contact tracing apps that were open source. I don't give a crap if the

04:37.800 --> 04:41.120
dystopia we're gonna live in is proprietary or open source

04:41.120 --> 04:44.720
It doesn't make a lick of difference for me because I don't want to live in one of those dystopias

04:44.720 --> 04:50.480
I do not want to have to be relying on that kind of technology and yes when you're using digital technology

04:51.280 --> 04:53.280
100% of the time use

04:53.720 --> 05:00.640
Free and open-source software use cryptocurrency in crypto encrypted, you know private cryptocurrency like Monero

05:01.280 --> 05:05.360
Use always use the best technology if you have to use technology

05:05.360 --> 05:10.000
But 90% of the time I'm gonna go ahead and guess you don't really need to use technology, right?

05:10.040 --> 05:16.200
You're just you're doing things as a replacement for real life that you shouldn't really be doing anyway

05:16.200 --> 05:20.240
I mean this is this is half self-help half privacy advice

05:20.320 --> 05:24.080
But a lot of people just use the internet for things for social things

05:24.080 --> 05:31.080
they shouldn't be using them for anyway and it is a privacy liability and the solution is not necessarily not even

05:31.160 --> 05:36.880
Necessarily to move to some super private social media site that is free and open source

05:36.880 --> 05:39.560
I mean that in some use cases you could you know make a

05:39.960 --> 05:43.200
You know use that to an end and that might be helpful

05:43.200 --> 05:47.200
But I think in most cases people just shouldn't be using digital technology for most of this stuff

05:47.200 --> 05:52.960
You are trying to encrypt yodeling. That's it. That's a great analogy and that's what you're doing. So

05:53.600 --> 05:56.000
That's just a reminder if you need to touch grass

05:56.800 --> 05:58.120
relax

05:58.120 --> 06:02.960
Just try not to use computers that that's I don't know that that's basically what all of my videos are about, right?
