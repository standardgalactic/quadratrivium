So, so you think you can tell?
Heaven from Hell Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field?
On a cold steel rail
A smile from a van
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to train
Your heroes for ghosts
Heart-ashes for trees
Hot air for a cold breeze
Cold comfort to change
Did you exchange
The walk on part in the walk
For a Leo in a cage
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to train
Your heroes for ghosts
Heart-ashes for trees
Hot air for a cold breeze
Cold comfort to change
Did you exchange
The walk on part in the walk
For a Leo in a cage
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to train
Your heroes for ghosts
Heart-ashes for trees
Hot air for a cold breeze
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to train
Your heroes for ghosts
Heart-ashes for trees
Heart-ashes for trees
Heart-ashes for trees
