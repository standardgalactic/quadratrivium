Checking Jim Hu/Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here.txt
 The lyrics you've provided seem to reflect on the nature of perception and reality, questioning the ability to distinguish between authentic experiences and those that are constructed or influenced by societal or cultural expectations. The song suggests that what we perceive as real—such as heaven versus hell, blue skies versus pain, or a green field versus cold steel—may often be a result of training or conditioning. It challenges the idea that our heroes are real or that our environment is natural, suggesting instead that they might be "ghosts" and our surroundings might be illusions ("heart-ashes for trees"). The song also touches on the idea of exchange, where perhaps the genuine experience is traded for something less authentic ("a Leo in a cage"), and whether we can discern the difference between what's presented to us and what's truly there. It's a meditation on the nature of truth and the extent to which our perceptions are shaped by external forces.
