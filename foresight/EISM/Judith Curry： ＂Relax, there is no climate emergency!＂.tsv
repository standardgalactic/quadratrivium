15320	28840	or visit eism.eu forward slash support. Thank you.
28840	33400	Hello and welcome to a theory of everything. I'm Luis Rosso, the director of ASIM and host
33400	39120	of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry, an American climatologist and
39120	45280	former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
45280	50880	You'll have to forgive me for the clickbaity title, but there's actually a good reason for it.
50880	57120	On the surface, today's discussion is about climate change, and one of the fruits is the
57120	64360	challenge issued by Dr. Curry, a so-called climate denier, to climate alarmists in general,
64600	69960	and to Lawrence Krauss specifically. For those who don't know, Krauss is a prominent
69960	76040	theoretical physicist and a public intellectual. He's also a previous guest on the channel who
76040	83960	wrote a recent book on climate science. I think you'll be struck, as I was, by the combination
83960	91160	of Dr. Curry's impressive academic credentials and the confidence with which she issues her
91160	98200	challenge. In my view, her claims merit a response, and I hope we can eventually get a taker,
98200	104440	whether Lawrence Krauss or somebody else. However, the most important takeaway here is not on
104440	113800	disagreement, but rather on the agreement. Curry is abundantly clear, as is Krauss, that ultimately
113800	119480	what we're dealing with here is a political question. How are humans going to resolve our
119480	126680	different takes on science without eventually destroying ourselves? That ultimately is the
126680	133800	heart of the issue, and it's one on which the long-term survival of humanity depends. It's one
133800	140040	thing to have an opinion, and it's an entirely different thing to propose a better way to resolve
140040	147000	our differences of opinion. These two things, having an opinion and proposing a better way to
147000	152600	resolve differences of opinion, belong on completely different levels of abstraction,
153320	160600	and the second question is much, much more important. It's the difference between a group of people
160600	166200	not being able to decide what to have for lunch and the same group debating on whether to vote
166760	175320	or draw straws or play rock, paper, scissors to settle the differences. This second question
175400	180760	of how to make collective decisions is studied formally in a branch of economics
180760	187320	known as social choice theory. You'd be surprised how many otherwise very intelligent people don't
187320	193480	pay even the slightest attention to this critical science. I hope you'll reflect on this because
193480	200680	ultimately this is why this channel exists, and this is why we have these discussions. We're not
200680	207320	just another YouTube channel, and we're not here to entertain. Today's lesson is an important one,
207960	214200	but it's not primarily about climate change. Don't get it wrong. The most important lesson
214200	221800	here involves science plus social and political will, or science and management, and that's
221800	228840	where ASEM is a global pioneer. We've started with fundamental physics, and we're working our way
228840	234360	through all of the branches of knowledge. Our mission is to change the way the world
234360	240600	makes decisions before it's too late. So I hope you enjoy my exchange with Dr. Curry,
241240	247640	but I also hope you don't lose focus. As always, you'll find a timestamp and relevant
247640	253480	links in the video description. Thanks for sharing your thoughts in the comments, and thanks for your
253480	259720	continued interest and support. Hello, and welcome to A Theory of Everything. I'm Luis
259720	265960	Rosso, the director of ASEM and host of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry,
265960	273720	an American climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia
273720	279560	Institute of Technology. Dr. Curry, thank you so much for taking the time to talk today.
280440	282920	Well, my pleasure. I look forward to our conversation.
284600	288760	Well, Dr, if it's okay, I'd like to start by telling listeners about your professional background.
290040	296280	So Dr. Curry graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science
296280	304200	degree in Geography. She then earned a PhD in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.
305080	310200	Her research interests include hurricanes, remote sensing, atmospheric modeling,
310760	318360	polar climates, air-sea interactions, climate models, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles
318360	324280	for atmospheric research. She was a member of the National Research Council's Climate Research
324280	330920	Committee and has published over 100 scientific papers and co-edited several major works in
330920	338200	climate science. Dr. Curry served on the NASA Advisory Council Earth Science Subcommittee,
338200	343560	whose mission was to provide advice and recommendations to NASA on issues of
343560	350120	program priorities and policy. She was also a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
350120	357320	Administration Climate Working Group from 2004 to 2009. A member of the National Academies
357320	363480	of Space Studies Board from 2004 to 2007 and a member of the National Academies
363480	372440	Climate Research Group from 2003 to 2006. As you can see from this description that Dr. Curry is
372440	381000	obviously a very accomplished climate scientist. She retired from her university position in 2007
381720	386680	partly because of what she described as anti-skeptic bias, which she attributed
386680	391720	at the time to the political nature of climate science. And that's part of what we're going
391720	397480	to talk about today, the very tricky relationship between science and politics.
398840	404680	In fact, Dr. Curry, the primary focus of this channel, or one of the primary focuses of this
404680	410760	channel, is on the science of effective management, which is tricky. In your case,
410760	417560	you often talk about something that the vast majority of people will agree with and I'd like
417560	422600	to place that at the center of our discussion. And that's the idea of human flourishing.
424120	431480	Most people at any point on any political or ideological spectrum seem to agree that human
431480	436440	flourishing is the ultimate goal. And you've stated, if I've understood correctly, that human
436440	441560	flourishing is ultimately what drives your work. Can you say a little bit more about that and maybe
442360	447080	about why you think that something that everybody agrees on can become so complicated?
448920	456520	Well, I'm not sure everybody agrees on that. Some people want, you know, think that the answer is
456520	464680	fewer people and more poverty. So we use less resources and don't impact the environment. So
464680	471560	that that's sort of an environment first kind of approach. Can I take the people first approach?
472200	480520	You know, I want to see prosperity and human development for all the world's countries and
480520	485080	all the world's peoples. Now, there are a lot of things that get in the way of that.
486360	493480	You know, the environment is just one relatively small factor. And the wealthier a country is,
494520	499960	the smaller the factor of the environment is because you have enough money to figure out
499960	505160	how to cope with it. But in less developed countries, they're very vulnerable to the
505160	515640	environment. Their development is often hampered by poor governance and corrupt leaders. So it's
515640	521960	difficult to make headway. But when we're talking about the climate change problem,
521960	531800	to me, there is no way that a solution of not allowing Africa to develop its fossil fuel
531800	539080	resources can be regarded as ethical or just. I mean, that that's just something that makes no
539080	547320	sense. And you know, it's just two fundamentally different outlooks. So I'm not sure everybody
547320	554280	agrees that human thriving is really the goal. There are a lot of people that say, well, there
554280	559960	should be fewer people. And if people didn't use so many resources and whatever the world would be
560040	568200	a better place. So it's the, you know, just two different views of humans relations with their
568200	576200	environments. You know, one is that we that we rely on the higher environment for our sustenance,
576200	581240	and we have to take care of our environment. And the other one is that, you know,
583320	589160	we can survive, you know, that we can engineer our environment to make it work for us. You know,
589160	595800	we don't want to trash it. But the, you know, the earth is a vast place with many resources.
595800	600440	Let's figure out how to how we can best use this for human thriving.
602920	608440	Okay, well, to be honest, that's kind of news to me that there are a lot of people I suppose
608440	617080	we have to quantify a lot of people who think that less or that the environment is more important
617320	623320	than humans. My guess is that there's not the majority of people do not have this concern. Or
623320	630920	do you have different information than I've been able to? Well, there's very strong academic
630920	638840	heritage in philosophy and environmental science, you know, along those lines. The UN,
638840	648200	the UN policies from the environmental program. And even the Paris Agreement,
648200	654920	they do not put human development first. They're putting reducing carbon dioxide emissions first.
655560	660680	Okay, a lot of the programs that were UN, you know, World Bank and whatever to help
662840	667640	low income countries develop and reduce their vulnerability to climate change,
667640	674440	those resources are being redirected to help mitigate CO2 emissions. So I mean,
675080	681880	there are some big international worldwide policies that do not seem to be focused on
682920	692360	human thriving, at least in the near term. Okay, but if I understand these policy initiatives
692360	699720	correctly, the ultimate goal or the concern about CO2 levels is not the CO2 levels themselves,
699720	706840	but rather their impact on human flourishing. Have I gotten it wrong? Well, yeah, I mean,
706840	712840	this is the weakest part of the argument. Okay, is more CO2 in the atmosphere dangerous?
713400	721480	They haven't really made that case very well. It's tied to extreme weather events.
722360	729240	Which have always happened will always continue to happen. It's very difficult to disentangle
729880	736360	the role of natural weather and climate variability, land use, and the slow creep of
737240	741800	global warming to try to attribute any of the problems that we're having
743320	751560	to increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The slope warming does produce a slow creep
751560	759480	of sea level rise, but it's slow. It's been, the sea level has been rising most recently
759480	768120	since the mid 19th century at relatively slow rates. Certain people predict that this could
768120	776040	rapidly accelerate, but it hasn't been happening. Anything catastrophic with sea level rise,
776040	781880	such as the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is more likely to be associated with
781880	788840	under ice volcanoes than it is to CO2 in the atmosphere. So this whole issue of danger
789480	795400	is the weakest part of the argument. And they try to get around that by blaming everything,
795400	802920	Pakistan floods, hurricane, and everything on climate change. Well, these severe weather events
802920	810920	would have happened independent of climate change. And if you look back to the early part
810920	816840	of the 20th century, you are always going to find worse extreme events than what we've seen in the
816840	823720	last 10 years. And if you go back even farther using paleo climate records, you see some really
823800	834840	awful extreme events. In the US, the worst weather by any standard, heat waves, fires, floods,
834840	843160	hurricanes, everything occurred in the 1930s. Nothing comparable to what happened in the 1930s
843160	849400	have we seen in the 21st century. Did the US weather in the 1930s, did that relate to
850200	861400	fossil fuel emissions? No. So that there's a very weak argument in trying to present all this is
861400	871000	dangerous. Okay, well, we recently talked to Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Columbia University,
871000	876280	and a widely respected global authority on sustainable development, who's twice named
876280	883480	by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 most influential global leaders. So if I'm to understand,
883480	893240	if I'm to appreciate your argument today, his work and the work of his team and the people behind him
893240	900440	are ill-advised, or they're incorrect, or they're wrong, or something else that's driving them
900440	907080	and their work. Is that what you're asking us to accept? I'm not familiar in any way. I know who
907080	913320	Jeffrey Sachs is. I'm not familiar with what he's doing or his recent research. The point is, I'm
913320	920920	very familiar with the UN reports and the Paris Agreement and the conference of the parties
920920	929880	and the UN sustainability goals. Okay, the UN climate stuff is at odds with its own sustainability
929880	937000	goals. In 2015, the world's governments and all the leaders got together and they agreed on 17
937800	944760	global sustainability goals. The first one is to eliminate global poverty. The second one is to
944760	953000	eliminate global food, global hunger. And then somewhere number seven is clean, abundant energy
953000	961960	for all. And number 13 is climate action. Okay, somehow climate action has been elevated as the
961960	970280	most important thing in the world. Forget eliminating poverty, forget food security. The most important
970280	977720	thing is climate action. Farmers can't get enough fertilizer to grow their crops because
978680	985800	it produces CO2 emissions. Does this make sense? No. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the name
985800	994360	of sustainability and climate change policy that has nothing to do with sustainability or human
994360	1003560	well-being or economic development. It's in fact acting counter to reduction of poverty and food
1003800	1012840	security. Interesting argument. What are the forces that are driving this phenomenon from your
1012840	1019560	perspective? Well, you have to go back to the 1980s to understand this. And again, the UN
1019560	1026120	environmental program, they long have had a goal and an interest in world government,
1026680	1039640	anti-capitalism, disdain and dislike for fossil fuels. Okay. And once the global warming argument
1041160	1050280	was put forward, the CO2 emissions, they latched onto this as the vehicle for pushing those policy
1050280	1058760	goals forward. Okay. And this was like in the 80s when they latched onto this. And in 1992,
1058760	1067160	the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had their big treaty. We must prevent dangerous
1067160	1074760	anthropogenic climate change. And this was before there was even any hint of warming. There had
1074760	1081720	been decades of cooling. Okay. So there wasn't even any warming yet. It was just all theoretical
1081720	1089560	and driven by a political agenda. So the policy cart was way out in front of the scientific course
1089560	1097080	on this. Okay. Then the IPCC came along and the first IPCC assessment said, well, we don't see
1097080	1105480	anything beyond natural climate variability. Okay. Well, the UN Framework Convention did not
1105480	1112840	like that. And the existence of the IPCC itself was on the line. So for the second assessment report,
1113560	1118600	the report looked just like the first one. Okay. We're not really seeing anything yet.
1118600	1126280	And tremendous pressure was put on the scientists in the summary for policymakers meeting where the
1126280	1134840	scientists meet with the policymakers. And that was when the scientists came up with,
1134840	1143800	we have seen a discernible impact of emissions on warming of the climate. So this discernible.
1144600	1150520	And then they, this was after the report had all been written. And then they went back and changed
1150520	1156840	the report to be consistent with this. And this was an enormous scandal in scientific circles.
1156840	1164920	But politically, it served a purpose. And the IPCC was able to remain its relevance and its
1164920	1170840	viability. So in these very early days, you can see how politics influenced the science.
1171480	1177480	The whole scientific problem was framed very narrow. Let's look only
1178440	1184360	at CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions, forget natural climate variability,
1184360	1191400	and let's focus only on what might be dangerous. We don't need to concern ourselves with any
1191400	1198840	benefits of a warmer climate. So all of climate science began to be framed in this very narrow way.
1199400	1204200	That's where the funding was for research from natural governments to support the efforts of
1204280	1212520	the IPCC. And the IPCC, third and fourth assessments, they were both the absolute
1212520	1226040	worst. It was just pure political advocacy. Then after that climate gate struck, and the IPCC was
1226040	1233240	put under a lot of scrutiny, and they cleaned up their act to some extent for the fifth and
1233240	1239480	sixth assessment report. The fifth assessment report, the working group two on impacts and
1239480	1246040	working group three on mitigation, they were relatively good. The IPCC six assessment report,
1246040	1252280	the working group one on the science and the physical basis was quite good. Working group two
1252280	1258920	and working group three were not. So it's a very mixed bag. It depends on who gets selected
1259800	1263880	to be authors and lead authors. And these authors are selected with
1265640	1278120	a political agenda in mind. It's not necessary. Someone like me, I was actually a reviewer for
1278120	1284280	the third, a minor contributor and a viewer for the third assessment report. So I did my thing.
1285000	1289640	But when I read the report, I was just disgusted. And so at that point, I didn't have anything
1289640	1298040	more to do with the IPCC. But the whole thing is very politicized. But that said, the IPCC reports
1298040	1307160	are a relative voice of reason compared to what the activists are saying, extinction and code read
1307160	1313480	and all this kind of emergency. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not on. The climate crisis
1313480	1322120	isn't what it used to be even two years ago. The large emissions scenario. Apologies for the
1322120	1329000	lingo RCP 8.5 if that's familiar to any of you. That one is now off the table. The conference of
1329000	1337160	the parties 26 and 27 are no longer considering that extreme emissions scenario. Two or three years
1337160	1344920	ago, a warming of three or four degrees since the pre industrial period would have been regarded as
1344920	1351000	policy success. Because everybody was worried about this really extreme emissions scenario and all
1351000	1356360	the extreme weather that might be associated with. Well, now everybody's back down to the reference
1356360	1364440	which is RCP 4.5, which is a much more modest increase and has much more modest impacts.
1365400	1371880	Okay, we're in reach of two degrees. I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within
1371880	1379080	two degrees centigrade by the end of the 21st century. No, we've already warmed by 1.1 degrees.
1380200	1384840	I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within another nine tenths of a degree
1384840	1391640	centigrade. Now that it's in sight, they've moved the goalpost down to 1.5 degrees to amp up the
1391720	1398120	urgency to do this to do that. So these targets have nothing to do about with science. They have
1398120	1406040	to do with politics and efforts to achieve the maximum action to get rid of fossil fuels.
1407080	1412200	And it's not just about getting rid of fossil fuels. It's all about renewable energy. They
1412200	1421160	don't want nuclear either. So it's a it's a very specific worldview that is being put forward here
1421880	1428600	that has very little basis in actual science and sensible energy policy.
1430360	1436360	Very interesting. There's a lot to unpack there. I suppose I'd like to ask about the alternatives
1436360	1444600	because what you're saying here is a political issue. It's a political argument. So what are
1444600	1449240	the some of the alternatives? What do you think can be done about this? And I should say that to a
1449880	1456840	non-expert outside observer, I suppose you are aware that a person who is
1457880	1466680	in the minority in this argument is also difficult to sort through the complexity here.
1466680	1473080	And there's only a few people, right? Because the overwhelming majority of climate experts
1473080	1483560	do not agree with this take. Is that correct? Not at all. There's a lot of very vocal people out
1483560	1494120	there. Some of them even have press agents, publicity agents, scientists. To me, that's
1494120	1499720	completely antithetical to being a science. So there's a lot of people with big voices and big
1499720	1512040	mouths out there. But if you look at the rank and file, scientists, people realize most people who
1512040	1520040	really understand the processes of how the climate works. Geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers
1520040	1527720	do not disagree with what I'm saying. They understand that we've oversimplified
1527720	1533320	the climate problem. And people in the policy world,
1535960	1541880	many of them agree that we've oversimplified the solution. You can't unring this bell,
1541880	1551400	even if we were to somehow get rid of CO2 emissions. There's a lot of inertia in the climate. It would
1551400	1558760	be 100 years, 50 years before we saw any change in the weather. Sea levels would continue to rise.
1558760	1564200	The ice sheets would be doing what they're doing. There's very long time scales. So this urgency
1564760	1571720	to cut emissions isn't really going to help the weather at all. Now, once you take the urgency
1572440	1578520	out of the equation for reducing emissions, then you're in a very different place in terms of
1578520	1592600	thinking about policy. I am a strong component of a new vision, better vision for 21st century
1592600	1600280	energy infrastructure with new ideas, new technologies, whatever, cleaner, cheaper,
1600280	1606840	more secure, more reliable, etc. I am absolutely all in favor of that. There are many reasons
1606840	1614280	not to continue relying on fossil fuels. By the end of the 21st century, it's going to be very
1614280	1624600	expensive to extract anyways. But there's all sorts of geopolitical instability associated
1624600	1631080	with fossil fuels, as we're seeing play out with the Russian, Ukraine, and Western Europe situation.
1631080	1638280	So there's lots of reasons not to like fossil fuels. But there is no way on earth that wind
1638280	1646280	and solar is the answer. Wind and solar is very low power density. It requires a lot of land,
1646840	1653080	not just for the power plants themselves, but also for the transmission lines that are required.
1653960	1661400	It's very materials intensive, enormous amount of copper, cement, steel, and on and on it goes.
1662520	1669400	Renewable energy is very vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and climate variability.
1669400	1676840	If we're worried about CO2 impacts on the weather, okay, why on earth would we pick
1676840	1684360	an energy system that is exceptionally vulnerable to weather variability, wind droughts, floods,
1684360	1690440	hail, lightning, the whole works? I mean, why would we subject our energy supply to that?
1691320	1699000	Okay, so what should we be doing? Well, the U.S. is making tremendous advances in small nuclear
1699720	1707240	reactors, small modular nuclear reactors with all sorts of advanced technologies. These are just
1707240	1712600	starting to come online. There's a learning curve, but within 10 years, these are going to be
1713480	1720680	really a wonderful solution. Advanced geothermal is also a very promising solution. It doesn't work
1720680	1727640	everywhere, but in locations where they have the right resources, it can be a very good source.
1729960	1740760	To me, those are the two solutions that I would hang my hat on for the 21st century infrastructure.
1741480	1746840	Yeah, we will probably need fossil fuels for a while, but the thing about the energy transition
1746840	1754120	is we need to understand that we're going to need a lot more energy in the 21st century,
1754120	1761320	not just to bring countries like in Africa up to snuff in terms of having access to grid electricity,
1761960	1767240	but we're trying to electrify everything with heat pumps and electric vehicles and all this
1767240	1775240	kind of thing. But more fundamentally, electricity provides a source of all our societal innovations,
1775240	1783240	robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new materials, etc. So we're just
1783240	1790360	going to need a lot more electricity. And there is no way, even if you could work out the technology,
1791640	1797080	relevant technologies for wind and solar to keep it reliable and whatever, there's no way we have
1797080	1805880	the land use that would support an awful lot of wind and solar power. So that's the fact of it.
1806440	1811880	I mean, so much of this is driven by the desire for a particular political solution.
1812840	1818680	Necap, the fossil fuel companies, you know, just kill the fossil fuels, that's a top priority.
1819240	1826600	Okay. And then bring in wind and solar. I mean, that's a solution. That's not going to help anybody.
1826600	1832600	It's going to give us less reliable electricity, which is going to reduce
1835240	1839480	our economic development, which means we have less money to actually
1840440	1849080	protect ourselves from extreme weather events. If we have a lot of electricity, we can run
1849080	1856360	desalination plants, indoor vertical agriculture, we can build all the infrastructure to protect
1857000	1862520	our cities or whatever, we can manage floodplains, we can smart grids to
1862760	1873720	increase the reliability of electricity. So, I mean, electricity is so central. And here we are
1873720	1884520	destroying the infrastructure that has built the prosperity of the 20th century and the first two
1884520	1890520	decades of the 21st century. And we're destroying it without having a viable replacement. This makes
1890520	1896680	absolutely no sense. This is not the way to support human thriving and flourishing.
1898440	1906120	Can I ask you, how receptive have your critics been to engaging in dialogue with you?
1906760	1912280	Oh, they won't debate me because I'll clobber them. They won't debate me. No one will debate me.
1913800	1916360	Well, we've had on the channel, we've had on the channel in the past,
1916680	1921160	he's not a climate scientist, but he's written a book about climate science,
1921720	1925480	and that's Lawrence Krause, a theoretical physicist. Yeah, I know who he is. Yeah.
1926040	1929720	Would you be interested in talking to him, discussing these issues?
1930600	1932920	I'm game to debate and discuss with anybody.
1933480	1937880	Oh, fantastic. That's good news. That's good news. Absolutely. No, this is one of the...
1938200	1948920	Yeah, I'm done. Well, that's good news. Okay, but you have to tell him who he would be talking to
1948920	1956520	because I've had debates scheduled and then people, my opponent who might have been invited first,
1957160	1960920	they then canceled when they saw that they were going to be going up against me.
1961880	1967400	So if you don't invite anybody to debate me, get a signed agreement. I'm serious.
1968280	1975160	That's very good. Well, I love the confidence. That's fantastic. Okay, for this final part,
1975160	1982520	can we transition to some of your professional activity now that you are no longer in academia
1982520	1986600	and where people can learn more about what you're doing these days?
1986840	1992680	Okay, I founded a company, Climate Forecast Applications Network,
1993480	2003240	cfanclimate.com, and this is basically about helping our clients understand and manage their
2003240	2011800	weather and climate related risks. We make weather type forecasts, temperature, wind power related
2011800	2019000	to the wetter energy sector. Hurricane forecast, a lot of our income comes from extended range
2019000	2025080	hurricane forecast, particularly insurance companies and also electricity utility
2025880	2032200	companies that live in coastal... that serve coastal regions. Also do a lot of
2033320	2040760	more climate related consulting. We make projections out to 2050, give them a range of
2040760	2048120	scenarios of what could happen out to 2050 in terms of extreme weather events. And this is a much
2048120	2053960	broader range of scenarios than you would get from the IPCC. We also include natural climate
2053960	2064040	variability. I've recently completed a book titled Climate Uncertainty and Risk. It's in press.
2064920	2072360	The publisher is Anthem Press. It's probably another seven or eight months before it will be
2072360	2082840	published. And this is a holistic look at the whole problem, you know, the pernicious issue of
2082840	2089960	how this has become politicized, how and why. Philosophy of science comes in and then the
2089960	2095960	middle section is really about just looking at what could happen in the 21st century and what we
2095960	2105320	don't know about what could happen. And then the third part is related to risk science decision
2105320	2114200	making under deep uncertainty, adaptation, and energy, you know, a vision for the 21st century
2114200	2123800	energy system. So a lot of territory covered in the book. I'm pretty excited about it. It would be
2123800	2129960	interesting when it comes out, but you know, a lot of what I'm talking about here kind of things
2129960	2137080	are covered in, but it's an academic book. It's not like a rant. Like some climate books are that
2137080	2143640	this has like several thousand academic references. You know, it's a scholarly book
2144280	2151160	and it's published by an academic press. So it's not a political rant like so many climate books
2152280	2158920	to me. That sounds very interesting. I look forward to the possibility of having you back
2158920	2163960	if you're interested when the book comes out. We'll take a deep dive. We'll take a deep dive into that.
2164600	2171400	And I'd like to also continue on two fronts. One is get somebody who's willing to talk to you,
2171400	2177000	who's a critic of these points of view. Hopefully it'll be Lawrence Krause. I think it would be
2177000	2182280	very interesting. And the next front, which we ran out of time today, I think it's probably more
2182280	2190600	important, is how we resolve these differences of interpretation and differences in scientific
2190600	2195240	outlooks, how we resolve these issues politically, which is a separate issue. But I think it's
2195240	2201800	equally or more important than the actual science because ultimately we have to decide how to proceed
2201800	2206760	and how the plan is going to evolve. And it's just so critical, these questions.
2206760	2215880	I agree absolutely. At this point, the science is almost irrelevant at this point. It's really
2215960	2220600	more about the decisions we need to make. And this is what this last third of my book is about,
2220600	2225240	decision making under deep uncertainty. What do you do when you've got different perspectives?
2225880	2233400	Well, you search for no regret solutions. You do lots of experimenting and bring in a lot of
2233400	2239800	stakeholders and decision makers and try to come to some sort of an agreement. It's a wicked problem.
2239800	2247080	And the ways with dealing with a wicked problem are not top down UN mandated kind of solutions.
2247080	2251880	So there are better ways to approach binding solutions to this.
2253640	2258440	Very, very super interesting, super interesting. I think we can probably go on for at least a
2258440	2264360	couple more hours just on that topic. However, we'll put it on hold for the moment.
2265000	2270360	I've really enjoyed this talk. To be honest, I'm actually surprised at how much I've enjoyed the
2270360	2277480	talk and the potential for some really valuable exchanges down the line. So I look forward to
2277480	2281240	that, Dr. Thank you once so much for taking the time. Okay, well, thank you. I look forward to a
2281240	2289960	continuing dialogue. To support our discussions with the world's leading thinkers, please see
