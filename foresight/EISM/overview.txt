1. **Climate Forecast Applications Network**: Dr. Robinson founded this company to help clients understand and manage weather and climate-related risks. They provide extended-range hurricane forecasts, temperature predictions, and climate projections out to 2050, catering to insurance companies, utility providers, and others in the energy sector.

2. **Book "Climate Uncertainty and Risk"**: Dr. Robinson has completed a book that is set to be published by Anthem Press. The book offers a comprehensive view of climate uncertainty and risk, including discussions on the politicization of climate science, the philosophy of science, and the challenges of decision-making under deep uncertainty. It includes around 3,000 academic references and covers topics like adaptation, energy systems, and risk management in the 21st century.

3. **Academic vs. Political Discourse**: Dr. Robinson emphasizes that his book is an academic work, not a political rant, and aims to provide a balanced view on climate issues. He highlights the importance of resolving differences in scientific interpretation and addressing these differences politically.

4. **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**: The final part of Dr. Robinson's book addresses how to make decisions when faced with deep uncertainty, advocating for no regret solutions, stakeholder involvement, experimentation, and collaborative approaches rather than top-down mandates.

5. **Future Dialogues**: Dr. Robinson expressed interest in future discussions, including a potential conversation with Lawrence Krauss to present contrasting viewpoints. He also emphasized the importance of finding consensus and effective strategies for addressing climate challenges politically.

6. **Supporting Discussions**: To continue these valuable dialogues, support can be provided through visiting eism.eu forward slash support or through resources in the video description.

In summary, Dr. Robinson's work focuses on both the scientific and practical aspects of climate forecasting and risk management, as well as the broader implications for decision-making in a world with deep uncertainties about the future climate. His upcoming book aims to contribute to this critical conversation by providing a scholarly perspective that combines scientific analysis with philosophical insights and practical guidance for the 21st century.
