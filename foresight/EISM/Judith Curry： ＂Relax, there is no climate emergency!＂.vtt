00:28.840 --> 00:33.400
Hello and welcome to a theory of everything. I'm Luis Rosso, the director of ASIM and host

00:33.400 --> 00:39.120
of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry, an American climatologist and

00:39.120 --> 00:45.280
former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

00:45.280 --> 00:50.880
You'll have to forgive me for the clickbaity title, but there's actually a good reason for it.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.120
On the surface, today's discussion is about climate change, and one of the fruits is the

00:57.120 --> 01:04.360
challenge issued by Dr. Curry, a so-called climate denier, to climate alarmists in general,

01:04.600 --> 01:09.960
and to Lawrence Krauss specifically. For those who don't know, Krauss is a prominent

01:09.960 --> 01:16.040
theoretical physicist and a public intellectual. He's also a previous guest on the channel who

01:16.040 --> 01:23.960
wrote a recent book on climate science. I think you'll be struck, as I was, by the combination

01:23.960 --> 01:31.160
of Dr. Curry's impressive academic credentials and the confidence with which she issues her

01:31.160 --> 01:38.200
challenge. In my view, her claims merit a response, and I hope we can eventually get a taker,

01:38.200 --> 01:44.440
whether Lawrence Krauss or somebody else. However, the most important takeaway here is not on

01:44.440 --> 01:53.800
disagreement, but rather on the agreement. Curry is abundantly clear, as is Krauss, that ultimately

01:53.800 --> 01:59.480
what we're dealing with here is a political question. How are humans going to resolve our

01:59.480 --> 02:06.680
different takes on science without eventually destroying ourselves? That ultimately is the

02:06.680 --> 02:13.800
heart of the issue, and it's one on which the long-term survival of humanity depends. It's one

02:13.800 --> 02:20.040
thing to have an opinion, and it's an entirely different thing to propose a better way to resolve

02:20.040 --> 02:27.000
our differences of opinion. These two things, having an opinion and proposing a better way to

02:27.000 --> 02:32.600
resolve differences of opinion, belong on completely different levels of abstraction,

02:33.320 --> 02:40.600
and the second question is much, much more important. It's the difference between a group of people

02:40.600 --> 02:46.200
not being able to decide what to have for lunch and the same group debating on whether to vote

02:46.760 --> 02:55.320
or draw straws or play rock, paper, scissors to settle the differences. This second question

02:55.400 --> 03:00.760
of how to make collective decisions is studied formally in a branch of economics

03:00.760 --> 03:07.320
known as social choice theory. You'd be surprised how many otherwise very intelligent people don't

03:07.320 --> 03:13.480
pay even the slightest attention to this critical science. I hope you'll reflect on this because

03:13.480 --> 03:20.680
ultimately this is why this channel exists, and this is why we have these discussions. We're not

03:20.680 --> 03:27.320
just another YouTube channel, and we're not here to entertain. Today's lesson is an important one,

03:27.960 --> 03:34.200
but it's not primarily about climate change. Don't get it wrong. The most important lesson

03:34.200 --> 03:41.800
here involves science plus social and political will, or science and management, and that's

03:41.800 --> 03:48.840
where ASEM is a global pioneer. We've started with fundamental physics, and we're working our way

03:48.840 --> 03:54.360
through all of the branches of knowledge. Our mission is to change the way the world

03:54.360 --> 04:00.600
makes decisions before it's too late. So I hope you enjoy my exchange with Dr. Curry,

04:01.240 --> 04:07.640
but I also hope you don't lose focus. As always, you'll find a timestamp and relevant

04:07.640 --> 04:13.480
links in the video description. Thanks for sharing your thoughts in the comments, and thanks for your

04:13.480 --> 04:19.720
continued interest and support. Hello, and welcome to A Theory of Everything. I'm Luis

04:19.720 --> 04:25.960
Rosso, the director of ASEM and host of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry,

04:25.960 --> 04:33.720
an American climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia

04:33.720 --> 04:39.560
Institute of Technology. Dr. Curry, thank you so much for taking the time to talk today.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.920
Well, my pleasure. I look forward to our conversation.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.760
Well, Dr, if it's okay, I'd like to start by telling listeners about your professional background.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.280
So Dr. Curry graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science

04:56.280 --> 05:04.200
degree in Geography. She then earned a PhD in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.200
Her research interests include hurricanes, remote sensing, atmospheric modeling,

05:10.760 --> 05:18.360
polar climates, air-sea interactions, climate models, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles

05:18.360 --> 05:24.280
for atmospheric research. She was a member of the National Research Council's Climate Research

05:24.280 --> 05:30.920
Committee and has published over 100 scientific papers and co-edited several major works in

05:30.920 --> 05:38.200
climate science. Dr. Curry served on the NASA Advisory Council Earth Science Subcommittee,

05:38.200 --> 05:43.560
whose mission was to provide advice and recommendations to NASA on issues of

05:43.560 --> 05:50.120
program priorities and policy. She was also a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

05:50.120 --> 05:57.320
Administration Climate Working Group from 2004 to 2009. A member of the National Academies

05:57.320 --> 06:03.480
of Space Studies Board from 2004 to 2007 and a member of the National Academies

06:03.480 --> 06:12.440
Climate Research Group from 2003 to 2006. As you can see from this description that Dr. Curry is

06:12.440 --> 06:21.000
obviously a very accomplished climate scientist. She retired from her university position in 2007

06:21.720 --> 06:26.680
partly because of what she described as anti-skeptic bias, which she attributed

06:26.680 --> 06:31.720
at the time to the political nature of climate science. And that's part of what we're going

06:31.720 --> 06:37.480
to talk about today, the very tricky relationship between science and politics.

06:38.840 --> 06:44.680
In fact, Dr. Curry, the primary focus of this channel, or one of the primary focuses of this

06:44.680 --> 06:50.760
channel, is on the science of effective management, which is tricky. In your case,

06:50.760 --> 06:57.560
you often talk about something that the vast majority of people will agree with and I'd like

06:57.560 --> 07:02.600
to place that at the center of our discussion. And that's the idea of human flourishing.

07:04.120 --> 07:11.480
Most people at any point on any political or ideological spectrum seem to agree that human

07:11.480 --> 07:16.440
flourishing is the ultimate goal. And you've stated, if I've understood correctly, that human

07:16.440 --> 07:21.560
flourishing is ultimately what drives your work. Can you say a little bit more about that and maybe

07:22.360 --> 07:27.080
about why you think that something that everybody agrees on can become so complicated?

07:28.920 --> 07:36.520
Well, I'm not sure everybody agrees on that. Some people want, you know, think that the answer is

07:36.520 --> 07:44.680
fewer people and more poverty. So we use less resources and don't impact the environment. So

07:44.680 --> 07:51.560
that that's sort of an environment first kind of approach. Can I take the people first approach?

07:52.200 --> 08:00.520
You know, I want to see prosperity and human development for all the world's countries and

08:00.520 --> 08:05.080
all the world's peoples. Now, there are a lot of things that get in the way of that.

08:06.360 --> 08:13.480
You know, the environment is just one relatively small factor. And the wealthier a country is,

08:14.520 --> 08:19.960
the smaller the factor of the environment is because you have enough money to figure out

08:19.960 --> 08:25.160
how to cope with it. But in less developed countries, they're very vulnerable to the

08:25.160 --> 08:35.640
environment. Their development is often hampered by poor governance and corrupt leaders. So it's

08:35.640 --> 08:41.960
difficult to make headway. But when we're talking about the climate change problem,

08:41.960 --> 08:51.800
to me, there is no way that a solution of not allowing Africa to develop its fossil fuel

08:51.800 --> 08:59.080
resources can be regarded as ethical or just. I mean, that that's just something that makes no

08:59.080 --> 09:07.320
sense. And you know, it's just two fundamentally different outlooks. So I'm not sure everybody

09:07.320 --> 09:14.280
agrees that human thriving is really the goal. There are a lot of people that say, well, there

09:14.280 --> 09:19.960
should be fewer people. And if people didn't use so many resources and whatever the world would be

09:20.040 --> 09:28.200
a better place. So it's the, you know, just two different views of humans relations with their

09:28.200 --> 09:36.200
environments. You know, one is that we that we rely on the higher environment for our sustenance,

09:36.200 --> 09:41.240
and we have to take care of our environment. And the other one is that, you know,

09:43.320 --> 09:49.160
we can survive, you know, that we can engineer our environment to make it work for us. You know,

09:49.160 --> 09:55.800
we don't want to trash it. But the, you know, the earth is a vast place with many resources.

09:55.800 --> 10:00.440
Let's figure out how to how we can best use this for human thriving.

10:02.920 --> 10:08.440
Okay, well, to be honest, that's kind of news to me that there are a lot of people I suppose

10:08.440 --> 10:17.080
we have to quantify a lot of people who think that less or that the environment is more important

10:17.320 --> 10:23.320
than humans. My guess is that there's not the majority of people do not have this concern. Or

10:23.320 --> 10:30.920
do you have different information than I've been able to? Well, there's very strong academic

10:30.920 --> 10:38.840
heritage in philosophy and environmental science, you know, along those lines. The UN,

10:38.840 --> 10:48.200
the UN policies from the environmental program. And even the Paris Agreement,

10:48.200 --> 10:54.920
they do not put human development first. They're putting reducing carbon dioxide emissions first.

10:55.560 --> 11:00.680
Okay, a lot of the programs that were UN, you know, World Bank and whatever to help

11:02.840 --> 11:07.640
low income countries develop and reduce their vulnerability to climate change,

11:07.640 --> 11:14.440
those resources are being redirected to help mitigate CO2 emissions. So I mean,

11:15.080 --> 11:21.880
there are some big international worldwide policies that do not seem to be focused on

11:22.920 --> 11:32.360
human thriving, at least in the near term. Okay, but if I understand these policy initiatives

11:32.360 --> 11:39.720
correctly, the ultimate goal or the concern about CO2 levels is not the CO2 levels themselves,

11:39.720 --> 11:46.840
but rather their impact on human flourishing. Have I gotten it wrong? Well, yeah, I mean,

11:46.840 --> 11:52.840
this is the weakest part of the argument. Okay, is more CO2 in the atmosphere dangerous?

11:53.400 --> 12:01.480
They haven't really made that case very well. It's tied to extreme weather events.

12:02.360 --> 12:09.240
Which have always happened will always continue to happen. It's very difficult to disentangle

12:09.880 --> 12:16.360
the role of natural weather and climate variability, land use, and the slow creep of

12:17.240 --> 12:21.800
global warming to try to attribute any of the problems that we're having

12:23.320 --> 12:31.560
to increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The slope warming does produce a slow creep

12:31.560 --> 12:39.480
of sea level rise, but it's slow. It's been, the sea level has been rising most recently

12:39.480 --> 12:48.120
since the mid 19th century at relatively slow rates. Certain people predict that this could

12:48.120 --> 12:56.040
rapidly accelerate, but it hasn't been happening. Anything catastrophic with sea level rise,

12:56.040 --> 13:01.880
such as the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is more likely to be associated with

13:01.880 --> 13:08.840
under ice volcanoes than it is to CO2 in the atmosphere. So this whole issue of danger

13:09.480 --> 13:15.400
is the weakest part of the argument. And they try to get around that by blaming everything,

13:15.400 --> 13:22.920
Pakistan floods, hurricane, and everything on climate change. Well, these severe weather events

13:22.920 --> 13:30.920
would have happened independent of climate change. And if you look back to the early part

13:30.920 --> 13:36.840
of the 20th century, you are always going to find worse extreme events than what we've seen in the

13:36.840 --> 13:43.720
last 10 years. And if you go back even farther using paleo climate records, you see some really

13:43.800 --> 13:54.840
awful extreme events. In the US, the worst weather by any standard, heat waves, fires, floods,

13:54.840 --> 14:03.160
hurricanes, everything occurred in the 1930s. Nothing comparable to what happened in the 1930s

14:03.160 --> 14:09.400
have we seen in the 21st century. Did the US weather in the 1930s, did that relate to

14:10.200 --> 14:21.400
fossil fuel emissions? No. So that there's a very weak argument in trying to present all this is

14:21.400 --> 14:31.000
dangerous. Okay, well, we recently talked to Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Columbia University,

14:31.000 --> 14:36.280
and a widely respected global authority on sustainable development, who's twice named

14:36.280 --> 14:43.480
by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 most influential global leaders. So if I'm to understand,

14:43.480 --> 14:53.240
if I'm to appreciate your argument today, his work and the work of his team and the people behind him

14:53.240 --> 15:00.440
are ill-advised, or they're incorrect, or they're wrong, or something else that's driving them

15:00.440 --> 15:07.080
and their work. Is that what you're asking us to accept? I'm not familiar in any way. I know who

15:07.080 --> 15:13.320
Jeffrey Sachs is. I'm not familiar with what he's doing or his recent research. The point is, I'm

15:13.320 --> 15:20.920
very familiar with the UN reports and the Paris Agreement and the conference of the parties

15:20.920 --> 15:29.880
and the UN sustainability goals. Okay, the UN climate stuff is at odds with its own sustainability

15:29.880 --> 15:37.000
goals. In 2015, the world's governments and all the leaders got together and they agreed on 17

15:37.800 --> 15:44.760
global sustainability goals. The first one is to eliminate global poverty. The second one is to

15:44.760 --> 15:53.000
eliminate global food, global hunger. And then somewhere number seven is clean, abundant energy

15:53.000 --> 16:01.960
for all. And number 13 is climate action. Okay, somehow climate action has been elevated as the

16:01.960 --> 16:10.280
most important thing in the world. Forget eliminating poverty, forget food security. The most important

16:10.280 --> 16:17.720
thing is climate action. Farmers can't get enough fertilizer to grow their crops because

16:18.680 --> 16:25.800
it produces CO2 emissions. Does this make sense? No. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the name

16:25.800 --> 16:34.360
of sustainability and climate change policy that has nothing to do with sustainability or human

16:34.360 --> 16:43.560
well-being or economic development. It's in fact acting counter to reduction of poverty and food

16:43.800 --> 16:52.840
security. Interesting argument. What are the forces that are driving this phenomenon from your

16:52.840 --> 16:59.560
perspective? Well, you have to go back to the 1980s to understand this. And again, the UN

16:59.560 --> 17:06.120
environmental program, they long have had a goal and an interest in world government,

17:06.680 --> 17:19.640
anti-capitalism, disdain and dislike for fossil fuels. Okay. And once the global warming argument

17:21.160 --> 17:30.280
was put forward, the CO2 emissions, they latched onto this as the vehicle for pushing those policy

17:30.280 --> 17:38.760
goals forward. Okay. And this was like in the 80s when they latched onto this. And in 1992,

17:38.760 --> 17:47.160
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had their big treaty. We must prevent dangerous

17:47.160 --> 17:54.760
anthropogenic climate change. And this was before there was even any hint of warming. There had

17:54.760 --> 18:01.720
been decades of cooling. Okay. So there wasn't even any warming yet. It was just all theoretical

18:01.720 --> 18:09.560
and driven by a political agenda. So the policy cart was way out in front of the scientific course

18:09.560 --> 18:17.080
on this. Okay. Then the IPCC came along and the first IPCC assessment said, well, we don't see

18:17.080 --> 18:25.480
anything beyond natural climate variability. Okay. Well, the UN Framework Convention did not

18:25.480 --> 18:32.840
like that. And the existence of the IPCC itself was on the line. So for the second assessment report,

18:33.560 --> 18:38.600
the report looked just like the first one. Okay. We're not really seeing anything yet.

18:38.600 --> 18:46.280
And tremendous pressure was put on the scientists in the summary for policymakers meeting where the

18:46.280 --> 18:54.840
scientists meet with the policymakers. And that was when the scientists came up with,

18:54.840 --> 19:03.800
we have seen a discernible impact of emissions on warming of the climate. So this discernible.

19:04.600 --> 19:10.520
And then they, this was after the report had all been written. And then they went back and changed

19:10.520 --> 19:16.840
the report to be consistent with this. And this was an enormous scandal in scientific circles.

19:16.840 --> 19:24.920
But politically, it served a purpose. And the IPCC was able to remain its relevance and its

19:24.920 --> 19:30.840
viability. So in these very early days, you can see how politics influenced the science.

19:31.480 --> 19:37.480
The whole scientific problem was framed very narrow. Let's look only

19:38.440 --> 19:44.360
at CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions, forget natural climate variability,

19:44.360 --> 19:51.400
and let's focus only on what might be dangerous. We don't need to concern ourselves with any

19:51.400 --> 19:58.840
benefits of a warmer climate. So all of climate science began to be framed in this very narrow way.

19:59.400 --> 20:04.200
That's where the funding was for research from natural governments to support the efforts of

20:04.280 --> 20:12.520
the IPCC. And the IPCC, third and fourth assessments, they were both the absolute

20:12.520 --> 20:26.040
worst. It was just pure political advocacy. Then after that climate gate struck, and the IPCC was

20:26.040 --> 20:33.240
put under a lot of scrutiny, and they cleaned up their act to some extent for the fifth and

20:33.240 --> 20:39.480
sixth assessment report. The fifth assessment report, the working group two on impacts and

20:39.480 --> 20:46.040
working group three on mitigation, they were relatively good. The IPCC six assessment report,

20:46.040 --> 20:52.280
the working group one on the science and the physical basis was quite good. Working group two

20:52.280 --> 20:58.920
and working group three were not. So it's a very mixed bag. It depends on who gets selected

20:59.800 --> 21:03.880
to be authors and lead authors. And these authors are selected with

21:05.640 --> 21:18.120
a political agenda in mind. It's not necessary. Someone like me, I was actually a reviewer for

21:18.120 --> 21:24.280
the third, a minor contributor and a viewer for the third assessment report. So I did my thing.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.640
But when I read the report, I was just disgusted. And so at that point, I didn't have anything

21:29.640 --> 21:38.040
more to do with the IPCC. But the whole thing is very politicized. But that said, the IPCC reports

21:38.040 --> 21:47.160
are a relative voice of reason compared to what the activists are saying, extinction and code read

21:47.160 --> 21:53.480
and all this kind of emergency. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not on. The climate crisis

21:53.480 --> 22:02.120
isn't what it used to be even two years ago. The large emissions scenario. Apologies for the

22:02.120 --> 22:09.000
lingo RCP 8.5 if that's familiar to any of you. That one is now off the table. The conference of

22:09.000 --> 22:17.160
the parties 26 and 27 are no longer considering that extreme emissions scenario. Two or three years

22:17.160 --> 22:24.920
ago, a warming of three or four degrees since the pre industrial period would have been regarded as

22:24.920 --> 22:31.000
policy success. Because everybody was worried about this really extreme emissions scenario and all

22:31.000 --> 22:36.360
the extreme weather that might be associated with. Well, now everybody's back down to the reference

22:36.360 --> 22:44.440
which is RCP 4.5, which is a much more modest increase and has much more modest impacts.

22:45.400 --> 22:51.880
Okay, we're in reach of two degrees. I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within

22:51.880 --> 22:59.080
two degrees centigrade by the end of the 21st century. No, we've already warmed by 1.1 degrees.

23:00.200 --> 23:04.840
I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within another nine tenths of a degree

23:04.840 --> 23:11.640
centigrade. Now that it's in sight, they've moved the goalpost down to 1.5 degrees to amp up the

23:11.720 --> 23:18.120
urgency to do this to do that. So these targets have nothing to do about with science. They have

23:18.120 --> 23:26.040
to do with politics and efforts to achieve the maximum action to get rid of fossil fuels.

23:27.080 --> 23:32.200
And it's not just about getting rid of fossil fuels. It's all about renewable energy. They

23:32.200 --> 23:41.160
don't want nuclear either. So it's a it's a very specific worldview that is being put forward here

23:41.880 --> 23:48.600
that has very little basis in actual science and sensible energy policy.

23:50.360 --> 23:56.360
Very interesting. There's a lot to unpack there. I suppose I'd like to ask about the alternatives

23:56.360 --> 24:04.600
because what you're saying here is a political issue. It's a political argument. So what are

24:04.600 --> 24:09.240
the some of the alternatives? What do you think can be done about this? And I should say that to a

24:09.880 --> 24:16.840
non-expert outside observer, I suppose you are aware that a person who is

24:17.880 --> 24:26.680
in the minority in this argument is also difficult to sort through the complexity here.

24:26.680 --> 24:33.080
And there's only a few people, right? Because the overwhelming majority of climate experts

24:33.080 --> 24:43.560
do not agree with this take. Is that correct? Not at all. There's a lot of very vocal people out

24:43.560 --> 24:54.120
there. Some of them even have press agents, publicity agents, scientists. To me, that's

24:54.120 --> 24:59.720
completely antithetical to being a science. So there's a lot of people with big voices and big

24:59.720 --> 25:12.040
mouths out there. But if you look at the rank and file, scientists, people realize most people who

25:12.040 --> 25:20.040
really understand the processes of how the climate works. Geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers

25:20.040 --> 25:27.720
do not disagree with what I'm saying. They understand that we've oversimplified

25:27.720 --> 25:33.320
the climate problem. And people in the policy world,

25:35.960 --> 25:41.880
many of them agree that we've oversimplified the solution. You can't unring this bell,

25:41.880 --> 25:51.400
even if we were to somehow get rid of CO2 emissions. There's a lot of inertia in the climate. It would

25:51.400 --> 25:58.760
be 100 years, 50 years before we saw any change in the weather. Sea levels would continue to rise.

25:58.760 --> 26:04.200
The ice sheets would be doing what they're doing. There's very long time scales. So this urgency

26:04.760 --> 26:11.720
to cut emissions isn't really going to help the weather at all. Now, once you take the urgency

26:12.440 --> 26:18.520
out of the equation for reducing emissions, then you're in a very different place in terms of

26:18.520 --> 26:32.600
thinking about policy. I am a strong component of a new vision, better vision for 21st century

26:32.600 --> 26:40.280
energy infrastructure with new ideas, new technologies, whatever, cleaner, cheaper,

26:40.280 --> 26:46.840
more secure, more reliable, etc. I am absolutely all in favor of that. There are many reasons

26:46.840 --> 26:54.280
not to continue relying on fossil fuels. By the end of the 21st century, it's going to be very

26:54.280 --> 27:04.600
expensive to extract anyways. But there's all sorts of geopolitical instability associated

27:04.600 --> 27:11.080
with fossil fuels, as we're seeing play out with the Russian, Ukraine, and Western Europe situation.

27:11.080 --> 27:18.280
So there's lots of reasons not to like fossil fuels. But there is no way on earth that wind

27:18.280 --> 27:26.280
and solar is the answer. Wind and solar is very low power density. It requires a lot of land,

27:26.840 --> 27:33.080
not just for the power plants themselves, but also for the transmission lines that are required.

27:33.960 --> 27:41.400
It's very materials intensive, enormous amount of copper, cement, steel, and on and on it goes.

27:42.520 --> 27:49.400
Renewable energy is very vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and climate variability.

27:49.400 --> 27:56.840
If we're worried about CO2 impacts on the weather, okay, why on earth would we pick

27:56.840 --> 28:04.360
an energy system that is exceptionally vulnerable to weather variability, wind droughts, floods,

28:04.360 --> 28:10.440
hail, lightning, the whole works? I mean, why would we subject our energy supply to that?

28:11.320 --> 28:19.000
Okay, so what should we be doing? Well, the U.S. is making tremendous advances in small nuclear

28:19.720 --> 28:27.240
reactors, small modular nuclear reactors with all sorts of advanced technologies. These are just

28:27.240 --> 28:32.600
starting to come online. There's a learning curve, but within 10 years, these are going to be

28:33.480 --> 28:40.680
really a wonderful solution. Advanced geothermal is also a very promising solution. It doesn't work

28:40.680 --> 28:47.640
everywhere, but in locations where they have the right resources, it can be a very good source.

28:49.960 --> 29:00.760
To me, those are the two solutions that I would hang my hat on for the 21st century infrastructure.

29:01.480 --> 29:06.840
Yeah, we will probably need fossil fuels for a while, but the thing about the energy transition

29:06.840 --> 29:14.120
is we need to understand that we're going to need a lot more energy in the 21st century,

29:14.120 --> 29:21.320
not just to bring countries like in Africa up to snuff in terms of having access to grid electricity,

29:21.960 --> 29:27.240
but we're trying to electrify everything with heat pumps and electric vehicles and all this

29:27.240 --> 29:35.240
kind of thing. But more fundamentally, electricity provides a source of all our societal innovations,

29:35.240 --> 29:43.240
robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new materials, etc. So we're just

29:43.240 --> 29:50.360
going to need a lot more electricity. And there is no way, even if you could work out the technology,

29:51.640 --> 29:57.080
relevant technologies for wind and solar to keep it reliable and whatever, there's no way we have

29:57.080 --> 30:05.880
the land use that would support an awful lot of wind and solar power. So that's the fact of it.

30:06.440 --> 30:11.880
I mean, so much of this is driven by the desire for a particular political solution.

30:12.840 --> 30:18.680
Necap, the fossil fuel companies, you know, just kill the fossil fuels, that's a top priority.

30:19.240 --> 30:26.600
Okay. And then bring in wind and solar. I mean, that's a solution. That's not going to help anybody.

30:26.600 --> 30:32.600
It's going to give us less reliable electricity, which is going to reduce

30:35.240 --> 30:39.480
our economic development, which means we have less money to actually

30:40.440 --> 30:49.080
protect ourselves from extreme weather events. If we have a lot of electricity, we can run

30:49.080 --> 30:56.360
desalination plants, indoor vertical agriculture, we can build all the infrastructure to protect

30:57.000 --> 31:02.520
our cities or whatever, we can manage floodplains, we can smart grids to

31:02.760 --> 31:13.720
increase the reliability of electricity. So, I mean, electricity is so central. And here we are

31:13.720 --> 31:24.520
destroying the infrastructure that has built the prosperity of the 20th century and the first two

31:24.520 --> 31:30.520
decades of the 21st century. And we're destroying it without having a viable replacement. This makes

31:30.520 --> 31:36.680
absolutely no sense. This is not the way to support human thriving and flourishing.

31:38.440 --> 31:46.120
Can I ask you, how receptive have your critics been to engaging in dialogue with you?

31:46.760 --> 31:52.280
Oh, they won't debate me because I'll clobber them. They won't debate me. No one will debate me.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.360
Well, we've had on the channel, we've had on the channel in the past,

31:56.680 --> 32:01.160
he's not a climate scientist, but he's written a book about climate science,

32:01.720 --> 32:05.480
and that's Lawrence Krause, a theoretical physicist. Yeah, I know who he is. Yeah.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.720
Would you be interested in talking to him, discussing these issues?

32:10.600 --> 32:12.920
I'm game to debate and discuss with anybody.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.880
Oh, fantastic. That's good news. That's good news. Absolutely. No, this is one of the...

32:18.200 --> 32:28.920
Yeah, I'm done. Well, that's good news. Okay, but you have to tell him who he would be talking to

32:28.920 --> 32:36.520
because I've had debates scheduled and then people, my opponent who might have been invited first,

32:37.160 --> 32:40.920
they then canceled when they saw that they were going to be going up against me.

32:41.880 --> 32:47.400
So if you don't invite anybody to debate me, get a signed agreement. I'm serious.

32:48.280 --> 32:55.160
That's very good. Well, I love the confidence. That's fantastic. Okay, for this final part,

32:55.160 --> 33:02.520
can we transition to some of your professional activity now that you are no longer in academia

33:02.520 --> 33:06.600
and where people can learn more about what you're doing these days?

33:06.840 --> 33:12.680
Okay, I founded a company, Climate Forecast Applications Network,

33:13.480 --> 33:23.240
cfanclimate.com, and this is basically about helping our clients understand and manage their

33:23.240 --> 33:31.800
weather and climate related risks. We make weather type forecasts, temperature, wind power related

33:31.800 --> 33:39.000
to the wetter energy sector. Hurricane forecast, a lot of our income comes from extended range

33:39.000 --> 33:45.080
hurricane forecast, particularly insurance companies and also electricity utility

33:45.880 --> 33:52.200
companies that live in coastal... that serve coastal regions. Also do a lot of

33:53.320 --> 34:00.760
more climate related consulting. We make projections out to 2050, give them a range of

34:00.760 --> 34:08.120
scenarios of what could happen out to 2050 in terms of extreme weather events. And this is a much

34:08.120 --> 34:13.960
broader range of scenarios than you would get from the IPCC. We also include natural climate

34:13.960 --> 34:24.040
variability. I've recently completed a book titled Climate Uncertainty and Risk. It's in press.

34:24.920 --> 34:32.360
The publisher is Anthem Press. It's probably another seven or eight months before it will be

34:32.360 --> 34:42.840
published. And this is a holistic look at the whole problem, you know, the pernicious issue of

34:42.840 --> 34:49.960
how this has become politicized, how and why. Philosophy of science comes in and then the

34:49.960 --> 34:55.960
middle section is really about just looking at what could happen in the 21st century and what we

34:55.960 --> 35:05.320
don't know about what could happen. And then the third part is related to risk science decision

35:05.320 --> 35:14.200
making under deep uncertainty, adaptation, and energy, you know, a vision for the 21st century

35:14.200 --> 35:23.800
energy system. So a lot of territory covered in the book. I'm pretty excited about it. It would be

35:23.800 --> 35:29.960
interesting when it comes out, but you know, a lot of what I'm talking about here kind of things

35:29.960 --> 35:37.080
are covered in, but it's an academic book. It's not like a rant. Like some climate books are that

35:37.080 --> 35:43.640
this has like several thousand academic references. You know, it's a scholarly book

35:44.280 --> 35:51.160
and it's published by an academic press. So it's not a political rant like so many climate books

35:52.280 --> 35:58.920
to me. That sounds very interesting. I look forward to the possibility of having you back

35:58.920 --> 36:03.960
if you're interested when the book comes out. We'll take a deep dive. We'll take a deep dive into that.

36:04.600 --> 36:11.400
And I'd like to also continue on two fronts. One is get somebody who's willing to talk to you,

36:11.400 --> 36:17.000
who's a critic of these points of view. Hopefully it'll be Lawrence Krause. I think it would be

36:17.000 --> 36:22.280
very interesting. And the next front, which we ran out of time today, I think it's probably more

36:22.280 --> 36:30.600
important, is how we resolve these differences of interpretation and differences in scientific

36:30.600 --> 36:35.240
outlooks, how we resolve these issues politically, which is a separate issue. But I think it's

36:35.240 --> 36:41.800
equally or more important than the actual science because ultimately we have to decide how to proceed

36:41.800 --> 36:46.760
and how the plan is going to evolve. And it's just so critical, these questions.

36:46.760 --> 36:55.880
I agree absolutely. At this point, the science is almost irrelevant at this point. It's really

36:55.960 --> 37:00.600
more about the decisions we need to make. And this is what this last third of my book is about,

37:00.600 --> 37:05.240
decision making under deep uncertainty. What do you do when you've got different perspectives?

37:05.880 --> 37:13.400
Well, you search for no regret solutions. You do lots of experimenting and bring in a lot of

37:13.400 --> 37:19.800
stakeholders and decision makers and try to come to some sort of an agreement. It's a wicked problem.

37:19.800 --> 37:27.080
And the ways with dealing with a wicked problem are not top down UN mandated kind of solutions.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.880
So there are better ways to approach binding solutions to this.

37:33.640 --> 37:38.440
Very, very super interesting, super interesting. I think we can probably go on for at least a

37:38.440 --> 37:44.360
couple more hours just on that topic. However, we'll put it on hold for the moment.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.360
I've really enjoyed this talk. To be honest, I'm actually surprised at how much I've enjoyed the

37:50.360 --> 37:57.480
talk and the potential for some really valuable exchanges down the line. So I look forward to

37:57.480 --> 38:01.240
that, Dr. Thank you once so much for taking the time. Okay, well, thank you. I look forward to a

38:01.240 --> 38:09.960
continuing dialogue. To support our discussions with the world's leading thinkers, please see
