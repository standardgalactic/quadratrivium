00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello and welcome to a theory of everything. I'm Luis Rosso, the director of ASIM and host

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,120
of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry, an American climatologist and

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,280
former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,880
You'll have to forgive me for the clickbaity title, but there's actually a good reason for it.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,120
On the surface, today's discussion is about climate change, and one of the fruits is the

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,360
challenge issued by Dr. Curry, a so-called climate denier, to climate alarmists in general,

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,960
and to Lawrence Krauss specifically. For those who don't know, Krauss is a prominent

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,040
theoretical physicist and a public intellectual. He's also a previous guest on the channel who

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,960
wrote a recent book on climate science. I think you'll be struck, as I was, by the combination

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:31,160
of Dr. Curry's impressive academic credentials and the confidence with which she issues her

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,200
challenge. In my view, her claims merit a response, and I hope we can eventually get a taker,

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,440
whether Lawrence Krauss or somebody else. However, the most important takeaway here is not on

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:53,800
disagreement, but rather on the agreement. Curry is abundantly clear, as is Krauss, that ultimately

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,480
what we're dealing with here is a political question. How are humans going to resolve our

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,680
different takes on science without eventually destroying ourselves? That ultimately is the

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,800
heart of the issue, and it's one on which the long-term survival of humanity depends. It's one

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,040
thing to have an opinion, and it's an entirely different thing to propose a better way to resolve

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,000
our differences of opinion. These two things, having an opinion and proposing a better way to

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,600
resolve differences of opinion, belong on completely different levels of abstraction,

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,600
and the second question is much, much more important. It's the difference between a group of people

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,200
not being able to decide what to have for lunch and the same group debating on whether to vote

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:55,320
or draw straws or play rock, paper, scissors to settle the differences. This second question

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,760
of how to make collective decisions is studied formally in a branch of economics

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,320
known as social choice theory. You'd be surprised how many otherwise very intelligent people don't

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,480
pay even the slightest attention to this critical science. I hope you'll reflect on this because

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,680
ultimately this is why this channel exists, and this is why we have these discussions. We're not

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,320
just another YouTube channel, and we're not here to entertain. Today's lesson is an important one,

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,200
but it's not primarily about climate change. Don't get it wrong. The most important lesson

31
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,800
here involves science plus social and political will, or science and management, and that's

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,840
where ASEM is a global pioneer. We've started with fundamental physics, and we're working our way

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,360
through all of the branches of knowledge. Our mission is to change the way the world

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,600
makes decisions before it's too late. So I hope you enjoy my exchange with Dr. Curry,

35
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,640
but I also hope you don't lose focus. As always, you'll find a timestamp and relevant

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,480
links in the video description. Thanks for sharing your thoughts in the comments, and thanks for your

37
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,720
continued interest and support. Hello, and welcome to A Theory of Everything. I'm Luis

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,960
Rosso, the director of ASEM and host of this channel. Today we're talking to Dr. Judith Curry,

39
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,720
an American climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia

40
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,560
Institute of Technology. Dr. Curry, thank you so much for taking the time to talk today.

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,920
Well, my pleasure. I look forward to our conversation.

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,760
Well, Dr, if it's okay, I'd like to start by telling listeners about your professional background.

43
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,280
So Dr. Curry graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science

44
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,200
degree in Geography. She then earned a PhD in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.

45
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,200
Her research interests include hurricanes, remote sensing, atmospheric modeling,

46
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:18,360
polar climates, air-sea interactions, climate models, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles

47
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,280
for atmospheric research. She was a member of the National Research Council's Climate Research

48
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,920
Committee and has published over 100 scientific papers and co-edited several major works in

49
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:38,200
climate science. Dr. Curry served on the NASA Advisory Council Earth Science Subcommittee,

50
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,560
whose mission was to provide advice and recommendations to NASA on issues of

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,120
program priorities and policy. She was also a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

52
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,320
Administration Climate Working Group from 2004 to 2009. A member of the National Academies

53
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,480
of Space Studies Board from 2004 to 2007 and a member of the National Academies

54
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:12,440
Climate Research Group from 2003 to 2006. As you can see from this description that Dr. Curry is

55
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:21,000
obviously a very accomplished climate scientist. She retired from her university position in 2007

56
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,680
partly because of what she described as anti-skeptic bias, which she attributed

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,720
at the time to the political nature of climate science. And that's part of what we're going

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,480
to talk about today, the very tricky relationship between science and politics.

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,680
In fact, Dr. Curry, the primary focus of this channel, or one of the primary focuses of this

60
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,760
channel, is on the science of effective management, which is tricky. In your case,

61
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,560
you often talk about something that the vast majority of people will agree with and I'd like

62
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,600
to place that at the center of our discussion. And that's the idea of human flourishing.

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,480
Most people at any point on any political or ideological spectrum seem to agree that human

64
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,440
flourishing is the ultimate goal. And you've stated, if I've understood correctly, that human

65
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,560
flourishing is ultimately what drives your work. Can you say a little bit more about that and maybe

66
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,080
about why you think that something that everybody agrees on can become so complicated?

67
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Well, I'm not sure everybody agrees on that. Some people want, you know, think that the answer is

68
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:44,680
fewer people and more poverty. So we use less resources and don't impact the environment. So

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,560
that that's sort of an environment first kind of approach. Can I take the people first approach?

70
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:00,520
You know, I want to see prosperity and human development for all the world's countries and

71
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,080
all the world's peoples. Now, there are a lot of things that get in the way of that.

72
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,480
You know, the environment is just one relatively small factor. And the wealthier a country is,

73
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,960
the smaller the factor of the environment is because you have enough money to figure out

74
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,160
how to cope with it. But in less developed countries, they're very vulnerable to the

75
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:35,640
environment. Their development is often hampered by poor governance and corrupt leaders. So it's

76
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,960
difficult to make headway. But when we're talking about the climate change problem,

77
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:51,800
to me, there is no way that a solution of not allowing Africa to develop its fossil fuel

78
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,080
resources can be regarded as ethical or just. I mean, that that's just something that makes no

79
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,320
sense. And you know, it's just two fundamentally different outlooks. So I'm not sure everybody

80
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,280
agrees that human thriving is really the goal. There are a lot of people that say, well, there

81
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,960
should be fewer people. And if people didn't use so many resources and whatever the world would be

82
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,200
a better place. So it's the, you know, just two different views of humans relations with their

83
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:36,200
environments. You know, one is that we that we rely on the higher environment for our sustenance,

84
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,240
and we have to take care of our environment. And the other one is that, you know,

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,160
we can survive, you know, that we can engineer our environment to make it work for us. You know,

86
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,800
we don't want to trash it. But the, you know, the earth is a vast place with many resources.

87
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,440
Let's figure out how to how we can best use this for human thriving.

88
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay, well, to be honest, that's kind of news to me that there are a lot of people I suppose

89
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:17,080
we have to quantify a lot of people who think that less or that the environment is more important

90
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,320
than humans. My guess is that there's not the majority of people do not have this concern. Or

91
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,920
do you have different information than I've been able to? Well, there's very strong academic

92
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,840
heritage in philosophy and environmental science, you know, along those lines. The UN,

93
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:48,200
the UN policies from the environmental program. And even the Paris Agreement,

94
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,920
they do not put human development first. They're putting reducing carbon dioxide emissions first.

95
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,680
Okay, a lot of the programs that were UN, you know, World Bank and whatever to help

96
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,640
low income countries develop and reduce their vulnerability to climate change,

97
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,440
those resources are being redirected to help mitigate CO2 emissions. So I mean,

98
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,880
there are some big international worldwide policies that do not seem to be focused on

99
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:32,360
human thriving, at least in the near term. Okay, but if I understand these policy initiatives

100
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:39,720
correctly, the ultimate goal or the concern about CO2 levels is not the CO2 levels themselves,

101
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,840
but rather their impact on human flourishing. Have I gotten it wrong? Well, yeah, I mean,

102
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,840
this is the weakest part of the argument. Okay, is more CO2 in the atmosphere dangerous?

103
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:01,480
They haven't really made that case very well. It's tied to extreme weather events.

104
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Which have always happened will always continue to happen. It's very difficult to disentangle

105
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,360
the role of natural weather and climate variability, land use, and the slow creep of

106
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,800
global warming to try to attribute any of the problems that we're having

107
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:31,560
to increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The slope warming does produce a slow creep

108
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:39,480
of sea level rise, but it's slow. It's been, the sea level has been rising most recently

109
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:48,120
since the mid 19th century at relatively slow rates. Certain people predict that this could

110
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:56,040
rapidly accelerate, but it hasn't been happening. Anything catastrophic with sea level rise,

111
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,880
such as the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is more likely to be associated with

112
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,840
under ice volcanoes than it is to CO2 in the atmosphere. So this whole issue of danger

113
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,400
is the weakest part of the argument. And they try to get around that by blaming everything,

114
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,920
Pakistan floods, hurricane, and everything on climate change. Well, these severe weather events

115
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,920
would have happened independent of climate change. And if you look back to the early part

116
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,840
of the 20th century, you are always going to find worse extreme events than what we've seen in the

117
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,720
last 10 years. And if you go back even farther using paleo climate records, you see some really

118
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:54,840
awful extreme events. In the US, the worst weather by any standard, heat waves, fires, floods,

119
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:03,160
hurricanes, everything occurred in the 1930s. Nothing comparable to what happened in the 1930s

120
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,400
have we seen in the 21st century. Did the US weather in the 1930s, did that relate to

121
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:21,400
fossil fuel emissions? No. So that there's a very weak argument in trying to present all this is

122
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:31,000
dangerous. Okay, well, we recently talked to Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Columbia University,

123
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,280
and a widely respected global authority on sustainable development, who's twice named

124
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:43,480
by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 most influential global leaders. So if I'm to understand,

125
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:53,240
if I'm to appreciate your argument today, his work and the work of his team and the people behind him

126
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,440
are ill-advised, or they're incorrect, or they're wrong, or something else that's driving them

127
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,080
and their work. Is that what you're asking us to accept? I'm not familiar in any way. I know who

128
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Jeffrey Sachs is. I'm not familiar with what he's doing or his recent research. The point is, I'm

129
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,920
very familiar with the UN reports and the Paris Agreement and the conference of the parties

130
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:29,880
and the UN sustainability goals. Okay, the UN climate stuff is at odds with its own sustainability

131
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:37,000
goals. In 2015, the world's governments and all the leaders got together and they agreed on 17

132
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,760
global sustainability goals. The first one is to eliminate global poverty. The second one is to

133
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:53,000
eliminate global food, global hunger. And then somewhere number seven is clean, abundant energy

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,960
for all. And number 13 is climate action. Okay, somehow climate action has been elevated as the

135
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:10,280
most important thing in the world. Forget eliminating poverty, forget food security. The most important

136
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:17,720
thing is climate action. Farmers can't get enough fertilizer to grow their crops because

137
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:25,800
it produces CO2 emissions. Does this make sense? No. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the name

138
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:34,360
of sustainability and climate change policy that has nothing to do with sustainability or human

139
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:43,560
well-being or economic development. It's in fact acting counter to reduction of poverty and food

140
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:52,840
security. Interesting argument. What are the forces that are driving this phenomenon from your

141
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,560
perspective? Well, you have to go back to the 1980s to understand this. And again, the UN

142
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,120
environmental program, they long have had a goal and an interest in world government,

143
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:19,640
anti-capitalism, disdain and dislike for fossil fuels. Okay. And once the global warming argument

144
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:30,280
was put forward, the CO2 emissions, they latched onto this as the vehicle for pushing those policy

145
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:38,760
goals forward. Okay. And this was like in the 80s when they latched onto this. And in 1992,

146
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:47,160
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had their big treaty. We must prevent dangerous

147
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,760
anthropogenic climate change. And this was before there was even any hint of warming. There had

148
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,720
been decades of cooling. Okay. So there wasn't even any warming yet. It was just all theoretical

149
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,560
and driven by a political agenda. So the policy cart was way out in front of the scientific course

150
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:17,080
on this. Okay. Then the IPCC came along and the first IPCC assessment said, well, we don't see

151
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:25,480
anything beyond natural climate variability. Okay. Well, the UN Framework Convention did not

152
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,840
like that. And the existence of the IPCC itself was on the line. So for the second assessment report,

153
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,600
the report looked just like the first one. Okay. We're not really seeing anything yet.

154
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:46,280
And tremendous pressure was put on the scientists in the summary for policymakers meeting where the

155
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:54,840
scientists meet with the policymakers. And that was when the scientists came up with,

156
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:03,800
we have seen a discernible impact of emissions on warming of the climate. So this discernible.

157
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,520
And then they, this was after the report had all been written. And then they went back and changed

158
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,840
the report to be consistent with this. And this was an enormous scandal in scientific circles.

159
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,920
But politically, it served a purpose. And the IPCC was able to remain its relevance and its

160
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,840
viability. So in these very early days, you can see how politics influenced the science.

161
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,480
The whole scientific problem was framed very narrow. Let's look only

162
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,360
at CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions, forget natural climate variability,

163
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,400
and let's focus only on what might be dangerous. We don't need to concern ourselves with any

164
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,840
benefits of a warmer climate. So all of climate science began to be framed in this very narrow way.

165
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
That's where the funding was for research from natural governments to support the efforts of

166
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:12,520
the IPCC. And the IPCC, third and fourth assessments, they were both the absolute

167
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:26,040
worst. It was just pure political advocacy. Then after that climate gate struck, and the IPCC was

168
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,240
put under a lot of scrutiny, and they cleaned up their act to some extent for the fifth and

169
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,480
sixth assessment report. The fifth assessment report, the working group two on impacts and

170
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,040
working group three on mitigation, they were relatively good. The IPCC six assessment report,

171
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:52,280
the working group one on the science and the physical basis was quite good. Working group two

172
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,920
and working group three were not. So it's a very mixed bag. It depends on who gets selected

173
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,880
to be authors and lead authors. And these authors are selected with

174
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:18,120
a political agenda in mind. It's not necessary. Someone like me, I was actually a reviewer for

175
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,280
the third, a minor contributor and a viewer for the third assessment report. So I did my thing.

176
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,640
But when I read the report, I was just disgusted. And so at that point, I didn't have anything

177
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:38,040
more to do with the IPCC. But the whole thing is very politicized. But that said, the IPCC reports

178
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:47,160
are a relative voice of reason compared to what the activists are saying, extinction and code read

179
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,480
and all this kind of emergency. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not on. The climate crisis

180
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:02,120
isn't what it used to be even two years ago. The large emissions scenario. Apologies for the

181
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:09,000
lingo RCP 8.5 if that's familiar to any of you. That one is now off the table. The conference of

182
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,160
the parties 26 and 27 are no longer considering that extreme emissions scenario. Two or three years

183
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,920
ago, a warming of three or four degrees since the pre industrial period would have been regarded as

184
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,000
policy success. Because everybody was worried about this really extreme emissions scenario and all

185
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,360
the extreme weather that might be associated with. Well, now everybody's back down to the reference

186
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:44,440
which is RCP 4.5, which is a much more modest increase and has much more modest impacts.

187
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,880
Okay, we're in reach of two degrees. I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within

188
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,080
two degrees centigrade by the end of the 21st century. No, we've already warmed by 1.1 degrees.

189
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,840
I don't think we're going to have a problem staying within another nine tenths of a degree

190
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,640
centigrade. Now that it's in sight, they've moved the goalpost down to 1.5 degrees to amp up the

191
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,120
urgency to do this to do that. So these targets have nothing to do about with science. They have

192
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:26,040
to do with politics and efforts to achieve the maximum action to get rid of fossil fuels.

193
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,200
And it's not just about getting rid of fossil fuels. It's all about renewable energy. They

194
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:41,160
don't want nuclear either. So it's a it's a very specific worldview that is being put forward here

195
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,600
that has very little basis in actual science and sensible energy policy.

196
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Very interesting. There's a lot to unpack there. I suppose I'd like to ask about the alternatives

197
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:04,600
because what you're saying here is a political issue. It's a political argument. So what are

198
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,240
the some of the alternatives? What do you think can be done about this? And I should say that to a

199
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,840
non-expert outside observer, I suppose you are aware that a person who is

200
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:26,680
in the minority in this argument is also difficult to sort through the complexity here.

201
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,080
And there's only a few people, right? Because the overwhelming majority of climate experts

202
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:43,560
do not agree with this take. Is that correct? Not at all. There's a lot of very vocal people out

203
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:54,120
there. Some of them even have press agents, publicity agents, scientists. To me, that's

204
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,720
completely antithetical to being a science. So there's a lot of people with big voices and big

205
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:12,040
mouths out there. But if you look at the rank and file, scientists, people realize most people who

206
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:20,040
really understand the processes of how the climate works. Geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers

207
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:27,720
do not disagree with what I'm saying. They understand that we've oversimplified

208
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,320
the climate problem. And people in the policy world,

209
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,880
many of them agree that we've oversimplified the solution. You can't unring this bell,

210
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:51,400
even if we were to somehow get rid of CO2 emissions. There's a lot of inertia in the climate. It would

211
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:58,760
be 100 years, 50 years before we saw any change in the weather. Sea levels would continue to rise.

212
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,200
The ice sheets would be doing what they're doing. There's very long time scales. So this urgency

213
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,720
to cut emissions isn't really going to help the weather at all. Now, once you take the urgency

214
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,520
out of the equation for reducing emissions, then you're in a very different place in terms of

215
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:32,600
thinking about policy. I am a strong component of a new vision, better vision for 21st century

216
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:40,280
energy infrastructure with new ideas, new technologies, whatever, cleaner, cheaper,

217
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,840
more secure, more reliable, etc. I am absolutely all in favor of that. There are many reasons

218
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:54,280
not to continue relying on fossil fuels. By the end of the 21st century, it's going to be very

219
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:04,600
expensive to extract anyways. But there's all sorts of geopolitical instability associated

220
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,080
with fossil fuels, as we're seeing play out with the Russian, Ukraine, and Western Europe situation.

221
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,280
So there's lots of reasons not to like fossil fuels. But there is no way on earth that wind

222
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:26,280
and solar is the answer. Wind and solar is very low power density. It requires a lot of land,

223
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,080
not just for the power plants themselves, but also for the transmission lines that are required.

224
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,400
It's very materials intensive, enormous amount of copper, cement, steel, and on and on it goes.

225
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:49,400
Renewable energy is very vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and climate variability.

226
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,840
If we're worried about CO2 impacts on the weather, okay, why on earth would we pick

227
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,360
an energy system that is exceptionally vulnerable to weather variability, wind droughts, floods,

228
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,440
hail, lightning, the whole works? I mean, why would we subject our energy supply to that?

229
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay, so what should we be doing? Well, the U.S. is making tremendous advances in small nuclear

230
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,240
reactors, small modular nuclear reactors with all sorts of advanced technologies. These are just

231
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,600
starting to come online. There's a learning curve, but within 10 years, these are going to be

232
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,680
really a wonderful solution. Advanced geothermal is also a very promising solution. It doesn't work

233
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:47,640
everywhere, but in locations where they have the right resources, it can be a very good source.

234
00:28:49,960 --> 00:29:00,760
To me, those are the two solutions that I would hang my hat on for the 21st century infrastructure.

235
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,840
Yeah, we will probably need fossil fuels for a while, but the thing about the energy transition

236
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,120
is we need to understand that we're going to need a lot more energy in the 21st century,

237
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,320
not just to bring countries like in Africa up to snuff in terms of having access to grid electricity,

238
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,240
but we're trying to electrify everything with heat pumps and electric vehicles and all this

239
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:35,240
kind of thing. But more fundamentally, electricity provides a source of all our societal innovations,

240
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:43,240
robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new materials, etc. So we're just

241
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:50,360
going to need a lot more electricity. And there is no way, even if you could work out the technology,

242
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,080
relevant technologies for wind and solar to keep it reliable and whatever, there's no way we have

243
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:05,880
the land use that would support an awful lot of wind and solar power. So that's the fact of it.

244
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,880
I mean, so much of this is driven by the desire for a particular political solution.

245
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,680
Necap, the fossil fuel companies, you know, just kill the fossil fuels, that's a top priority.

246
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,600
Okay. And then bring in wind and solar. I mean, that's a solution. That's not going to help anybody.

247
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
It's going to give us less reliable electricity, which is going to reduce

248
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,480
our economic development, which means we have less money to actually

249
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:49,080
protect ourselves from extreme weather events. If we have a lot of electricity, we can run

250
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:56,360
desalination plants, indoor vertical agriculture, we can build all the infrastructure to protect

251
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,520
our cities or whatever, we can manage floodplains, we can smart grids to

252
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:13,720
increase the reliability of electricity. So, I mean, electricity is so central. And here we are

253
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:24,520
destroying the infrastructure that has built the prosperity of the 20th century and the first two

254
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,520
decades of the 21st century. And we're destroying it without having a viable replacement. This makes

255
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,680
absolutely no sense. This is not the way to support human thriving and flourishing.

256
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:46,120
Can I ask you, how receptive have your critics been to engaging in dialogue with you?

257
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,280
Oh, they won't debate me because I'll clobber them. They won't debate me. No one will debate me.

258
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,360
Well, we've had on the channel, we've had on the channel in the past,

259
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,160
he's not a climate scientist, but he's written a book about climate science,

260
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,480
and that's Lawrence Krause, a theoretical physicist. Yeah, I know who he is. Yeah.

261
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,720
Would you be interested in talking to him, discussing these issues?

262
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,920
I'm game to debate and discuss with anybody.

263
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,880
Oh, fantastic. That's good news. That's good news. Absolutely. No, this is one of the...

264
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:28,920
Yeah, I'm done. Well, that's good news. Okay, but you have to tell him who he would be talking to

265
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:36,520
because I've had debates scheduled and then people, my opponent who might have been invited first,

266
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,920
they then canceled when they saw that they were going to be going up against me.

267
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,400
So if you don't invite anybody to debate me, get a signed agreement. I'm serious.

268
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:55,160
That's very good. Well, I love the confidence. That's fantastic. Okay, for this final part,

269
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:02,520
can we transition to some of your professional activity now that you are no longer in academia

270
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,600
and where people can learn more about what you're doing these days?

271
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,680
Okay, I founded a company, Climate Forecast Applications Network,

272
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:23,240
cfanclimate.com, and this is basically about helping our clients understand and manage their

273
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:31,800
weather and climate related risks. We make weather type forecasts, temperature, wind power related

274
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:39,000
to the wetter energy sector. Hurricane forecast, a lot of our income comes from extended range

275
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,080
hurricane forecast, particularly insurance companies and also electricity utility

276
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:52,200
companies that live in coastal... that serve coastal regions. Also do a lot of

277
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:00,760
more climate related consulting. We make projections out to 2050, give them a range of

278
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:08,120
scenarios of what could happen out to 2050 in terms of extreme weather events. And this is a much

279
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,960
broader range of scenarios than you would get from the IPCC. We also include natural climate

280
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:24,040
variability. I've recently completed a book titled Climate Uncertainty and Risk. It's in press.

281
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:32,360
The publisher is Anthem Press. It's probably another seven or eight months before it will be

282
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:42,840
published. And this is a holistic look at the whole problem, you know, the pernicious issue of

283
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:49,960
how this has become politicized, how and why. Philosophy of science comes in and then the

284
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,960
middle section is really about just looking at what could happen in the 21st century and what we

285
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,320
don't know about what could happen. And then the third part is related to risk science decision

286
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:14,200
making under deep uncertainty, adaptation, and energy, you know, a vision for the 21st century

287
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:23,800
energy system. So a lot of territory covered in the book. I'm pretty excited about it. It would be

288
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,960
interesting when it comes out, but you know, a lot of what I'm talking about here kind of things

289
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:37,080
are covered in, but it's an academic book. It's not like a rant. Like some climate books are that

290
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:43,640
this has like several thousand academic references. You know, it's a scholarly book

291
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:51,160
and it's published by an academic press. So it's not a political rant like so many climate books

292
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,920
to me. That sounds very interesting. I look forward to the possibility of having you back

293
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,960
if you're interested when the book comes out. We'll take a deep dive. We'll take a deep dive into that.

294
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:11,400
And I'd like to also continue on two fronts. One is get somebody who's willing to talk to you,

295
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,000
who's a critic of these points of view. Hopefully it'll be Lawrence Krause. I think it would be

296
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,280
very interesting. And the next front, which we ran out of time today, I think it's probably more

297
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:30,600
important, is how we resolve these differences of interpretation and differences in scientific

298
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,240
outlooks, how we resolve these issues politically, which is a separate issue. But I think it's

299
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,800
equally or more important than the actual science because ultimately we have to decide how to proceed

300
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,760
and how the plan is going to evolve. And it's just so critical, these questions.

301
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:55,880
I agree absolutely. At this point, the science is almost irrelevant at this point. It's really

302
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,600
more about the decisions we need to make. And this is what this last third of my book is about,

303
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,240
decision making under deep uncertainty. What do you do when you've got different perspectives?

304
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,400
Well, you search for no regret solutions. You do lots of experimenting and bring in a lot of

305
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,800
stakeholders and decision makers and try to come to some sort of an agreement. It's a wicked problem.

306
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,080
And the ways with dealing with a wicked problem are not top down UN mandated kind of solutions.

307
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,880
So there are better ways to approach binding solutions to this.

308
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,440
Very, very super interesting, super interesting. I think we can probably go on for at least a

309
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,360
couple more hours just on that topic. However, we'll put it on hold for the moment.

310
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,360
I've really enjoyed this talk. To be honest, I'm actually surprised at how much I've enjoyed the

311
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:57,480
talk and the potential for some really valuable exchanges down the line. So I look forward to

312
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,240
that, Dr. Thank you once so much for taking the time. Okay, well, thank you. I look forward to a

313
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:09,960
continuing dialogue. To support our discussions with the world's leading thinkers, please see
