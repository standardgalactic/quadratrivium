0	4520	Hello, and welcome to a new coding adventure. Today I'm going to be simulating a simple
4520	9520	ecosystem, an idea which was inspired by this really cool video from the channel Prima.
9520	13120	I started by generating a little map with water tiles so that creatures would have something
13120	17920	to drink, and land tiles for them to move around on. I also added some trees as decorations
17920	21840	and obstacles, and then some little plants as a food source.
21840	25680	Next I needed a creature, so I made a crude little bunny out of some cubes and placed
25680	30240	him into the world. He seemed happy enough just hopping around, but of course I wasn't
30240	34560	going to let him have such an easy life. I gave him hunger and thirst, so he'll need
34560	39120	to find some water soon or else die. Fortunately for him there's some nearby, so he's hopping
39120	43800	over to that, and having a drink. There's also a plant over there, so he's going to
43800	49720	head over to that, and gobble it up. Now he's thirsty again, so back to the water. This
49720	54160	by the way is his sensory radius, outside of which he's blind, so currently he's just
54160	57720	hopping around randomly trying to find some food, but now that he's spotted that plant
57720	61160	up there, he's going to head directly over to it.
61160	65840	The next thing I added was an urge to reproduce. Currently that urge is stronger than the bunny's
65840	70160	hunger or thirst, so he'll go searching for a mate. He's not likely to have much luck
70160	75360	though on account of being the only rabbit in existence, so I'll add in a female bunny,
75360	79640	and let's see if they get together. They're both searching, and it looks like they've
79640	86520	spotted one another. You may want to have virtual eyes for this. Alright, it's safe
86520	91160	to look again. The bunny is now pregnant, so in just a few moments we should be able
91160	96240	to welcome some new little creatures to the world. These little fellas will take some
96240	100600	time to grow up, during which their speed and sense of sight will develop, so right
100600	104800	now they're of course particularly vulnerable. In the simulation, female bunnies actually
104800	109240	have a gene which controls how long they're pregnant for. If that duration is short, they
109240	113440	can obviously have offspring more frequently, but the offspring will be more underdeveloped
113440	117720	and have less of a chance of surviving to adulthood. There are a few more genes, one
117720	121880	for sensory distance, and one for reproductive urge, which I've described already. Then
121880	125520	there's one for speed, allowing the rabbit to move faster, at the cost of getting hungry
125520	131520	and thirsty more quickly. Finally, for males only, there's desirability, which here is
131520	137520	expressed by having redder fur. So looking at the code for a second, when a male rabbit
137520	141960	spots a female who's also looking for a mate, he'll send a signal to her, and the
141960	147200	more desirable he is, the higher the chance that she'll accept his advances. If she rejects
147200	151040	him, he'll add her to his mental list of unimpressed females, and won't approach
151040	155560	her again until he's forgotten about it a little while later.
155560	160000	Now when two rabbits mate, the offspring will inherit these genes from their parents. In
160000	163360	the code you can see that each gene will be randomly selected to come from either the
163360	168200	mother or the father. On top of that, there's a small chance for each gene to mutate, which
168200	171440	will increase or decrease its value by a little bit.
171440	176160	Alright, I'm going to start the simulation out with 300 rabbits, and let's see what
176160	181960	happens. So the population first shoots up with the first wave of babies, but the majority
181960	187120	of them aren't very good at surviving, so their numbers quickly decline. At this stage
187120	191560	with just around 100 rabbits in existence, they're at a high risk of extinction. Several
191600	196800	times when I ran the simulation, they got unlucky at this point, and just died out. But
196800	200840	this time they seem to be hanging on tenaciously, and with each new generation becoming more
200840	207320	adept at surviving. After about 20 minutes of simulation, the population was over 1400.
207320	213440	About 2,600 rabbits died from hunger along the way, and over 4,000 from thirst. Let's
213440	217880	have a look at what happened to the genes over this time. The average gestation duration
217880	222240	rose quite steadily, indicating that in this environment it was better to have fewer, but
222240	228040	stronger offspring. The sensory distance rose rapidly, as those too short-sighted to reliably
228040	234800	find food and water were weeded out. The reproductive urge initially dropped, but I guess as the
234800	238960	senses of the rabbits improved, it became less risky to spend more time searching for
238960	245480	a mate. Next, there's speed, but apparently moving faster wasn't really worth the cost.
245480	249880	And finally, designability, which fluctuated a bit for some reason, before finally heading
249880	255480	upwards. I then thought it would be interesting to introduce a predator, so I made something
255480	259600	that hopefully looks at least a little bit like a fox, and told it to move towards rabbits
259600	272920	and eat them. These rabbits are basically just sitting ducks though, so I made the fox
272920	295560	have to work a little harder for his meal by making them flee from him. So, going back
295560	300200	to where we were in this simulation, I added in an initial population of 10 foxes and let
300200	307280	it continue running. At first things seemed to be going okay, but the number of foxes grew
307280	310840	rapidly since they were at the top of the food chain, and they hunted the rabbits to
310840	317200	extinction. Then they realised they'd made a terrible mistake, and starved to death.
317200	321360	With the introduction of the foxes, speed of course became much more valuable to a rabbit
321360	327360	survival. The other traits though remained roughly the same. I tried running the simulation
327360	332440	again, this time with the foxes being there from the outset. As the foxes became more
332440	335960	numerous, the rabbits were nearly hunted to extinction, but they managed to make a
335960	341440	huge comeback. Unfortunately, this led to an explosion in the fox population as well.
341440	346080	The rabbits went extinct, and the foxes followed shortly thereafter.
346080	349600	What I found interesting about this run is that in the presence of the foxes, the rabbits
349600	353920	evolved to have an extremely high reproductive urge. I guess if they didn't find a mate
354000	358560	quickly, they might be killed by a fox, and not have the chance to pass their genes on.
358560	363200	The gestation duration stayed low this time, a favouring quantity of offspring over quality.
363200	367360	Here's how the other traits turned out in case you're interested.
367360	371560	I'm rather sad that I couldn't get the rabbits and foxes to coexist for very long. The only
371560	375320	time the foxes didn't hunt the rabbits to extinction was once when they weren't able
375320	380120	to find the last remaining group of bunnies, and starved to death. Those bunnies then lived
380200	383400	happily ever after though, so I guess it's a happy ending.
383400	387240	In any case, I hope you've enjoyed this coding adventure, make sure to have a look at the
387240	391120	others in the series if you did, and until next time, cheers.
