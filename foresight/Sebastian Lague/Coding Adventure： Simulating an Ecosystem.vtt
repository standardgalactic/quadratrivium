00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Hello, and welcome to a new coding adventure. Today I'm going to be simulating a simple

00:04.520 --> 00:09.520
ecosystem, an idea which was inspired by this really cool video from the channel Prima.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.120
I started by generating a little map with water tiles so that creatures would have something

00:13.120 --> 00:17.920
to drink, and land tiles for them to move around on. I also added some trees as decorations

00:17.920 --> 00:21.840
and obstacles, and then some little plants as a food source.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.680
Next I needed a creature, so I made a crude little bunny out of some cubes and placed

00:25.680 --> 00:30.240
him into the world. He seemed happy enough just hopping around, but of course I wasn't

00:30.240 --> 00:34.560
going to let him have such an easy life. I gave him hunger and thirst, so he'll need

00:34.560 --> 00:39.120
to find some water soon or else die. Fortunately for him there's some nearby, so he's hopping

00:39.120 --> 00:43.800
over to that, and having a drink. There's also a plant over there, so he's going to

00:43.800 --> 00:49.720
head over to that, and gobble it up. Now he's thirsty again, so back to the water. This

00:49.720 --> 00:54.160
by the way is his sensory radius, outside of which he's blind, so currently he's just

00:54.160 --> 00:57.720
hopping around randomly trying to find some food, but now that he's spotted that plant

00:57.720 --> 01:01.160
up there, he's going to head directly over to it.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.840
The next thing I added was an urge to reproduce. Currently that urge is stronger than the bunny's

01:05.840 --> 01:10.160
hunger or thirst, so he'll go searching for a mate. He's not likely to have much luck

01:10.160 --> 01:15.360
though on account of being the only rabbit in existence, so I'll add in a female bunny,

01:15.360 --> 01:19.640
and let's see if they get together. They're both searching, and it looks like they've

01:19.640 --> 01:26.520
spotted one another. You may want to have virtual eyes for this. Alright, it's safe

01:26.520 --> 01:31.160
to look again. The bunny is now pregnant, so in just a few moments we should be able

01:31.160 --> 01:36.240
to welcome some new little creatures to the world. These little fellas will take some

01:36.240 --> 01:40.600
time to grow up, during which their speed and sense of sight will develop, so right

01:40.600 --> 01:44.800
now they're of course particularly vulnerable. In the simulation, female bunnies actually

01:44.800 --> 01:49.240
have a gene which controls how long they're pregnant for. If that duration is short, they

01:49.240 --> 01:53.440
can obviously have offspring more frequently, but the offspring will be more underdeveloped

01:53.440 --> 01:57.720
and have less of a chance of surviving to adulthood. There are a few more genes, one

01:57.720 --> 02:01.880
for sensory distance, and one for reproductive urge, which I've described already. Then

02:01.880 --> 02:05.520
there's one for speed, allowing the rabbit to move faster, at the cost of getting hungry

02:05.520 --> 02:11.520
and thirsty more quickly. Finally, for males only, there's desirability, which here is

02:11.520 --> 02:17.520
expressed by having redder fur. So looking at the code for a second, when a male rabbit

02:17.520 --> 02:21.960
spots a female who's also looking for a mate, he'll send a signal to her, and the

02:21.960 --> 02:27.200
more desirable he is, the higher the chance that she'll accept his advances. If she rejects

02:27.200 --> 02:31.040
him, he'll add her to his mental list of unimpressed females, and won't approach

02:31.040 --> 02:35.560
her again until he's forgotten about it a little while later.

02:35.560 --> 02:40.000
Now when two rabbits mate, the offspring will inherit these genes from their parents. In

02:40.000 --> 02:43.360
the code you can see that each gene will be randomly selected to come from either the

02:43.360 --> 02:48.200
mother or the father. On top of that, there's a small chance for each gene to mutate, which

02:48.200 --> 02:51.440
will increase or decrease its value by a little bit.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.160
Alright, I'm going to start the simulation out with 300 rabbits, and let's see what

02:56.160 --> 03:01.960
happens. So the population first shoots up with the first wave of babies, but the majority

03:01.960 --> 03:07.120
of them aren't very good at surviving, so their numbers quickly decline. At this stage

03:07.120 --> 03:11.560
with just around 100 rabbits in existence, they're at a high risk of extinction. Several

03:11.600 --> 03:16.800
times when I ran the simulation, they got unlucky at this point, and just died out. But

03:16.800 --> 03:20.840
this time they seem to be hanging on tenaciously, and with each new generation becoming more

03:20.840 --> 03:27.320
adept at surviving. After about 20 minutes of simulation, the population was over 1400.

03:27.320 --> 03:33.440
About 2,600 rabbits died from hunger along the way, and over 4,000 from thirst. Let's

03:33.440 --> 03:37.880
have a look at what happened to the genes over this time. The average gestation duration

03:37.880 --> 03:42.240
rose quite steadily, indicating that in this environment it was better to have fewer, but

03:42.240 --> 03:48.040
stronger offspring. The sensory distance rose rapidly, as those too short-sighted to reliably

03:48.040 --> 03:54.800
find food and water were weeded out. The reproductive urge initially dropped, but I guess as the

03:54.800 --> 03:58.960
senses of the rabbits improved, it became less risky to spend more time searching for

03:58.960 --> 04:05.480
a mate. Next, there's speed, but apparently moving faster wasn't really worth the cost.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.880
And finally, designability, which fluctuated a bit for some reason, before finally heading

04:09.880 --> 04:15.480
upwards. I then thought it would be interesting to introduce a predator, so I made something

04:15.480 --> 04:19.600
that hopefully looks at least a little bit like a fox, and told it to move towards rabbits

04:19.600 --> 04:32.920
and eat them. These rabbits are basically just sitting ducks though, so I made the fox

04:32.920 --> 04:55.560
have to work a little harder for his meal by making them flee from him. So, going back

04:55.560 --> 05:00.200
to where we were in this simulation, I added in an initial population of 10 foxes and let

05:00.200 --> 05:07.280
it continue running. At first things seemed to be going okay, but the number of foxes grew

05:07.280 --> 05:10.840
rapidly since they were at the top of the food chain, and they hunted the rabbits to

05:10.840 --> 05:17.200
extinction. Then they realised they'd made a terrible mistake, and starved to death.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.360
With the introduction of the foxes, speed of course became much more valuable to a rabbit

05:21.360 --> 05:27.360
survival. The other traits though remained roughly the same. I tried running the simulation

05:27.360 --> 05:32.440
again, this time with the foxes being there from the outset. As the foxes became more

05:32.440 --> 05:35.960
numerous, the rabbits were nearly hunted to extinction, but they managed to make a

05:35.960 --> 05:41.440
huge comeback. Unfortunately, this led to an explosion in the fox population as well.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.080
The rabbits went extinct, and the foxes followed shortly thereafter.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.600
What I found interesting about this run is that in the presence of the foxes, the rabbits

05:49.600 --> 05:53.920
evolved to have an extremely high reproductive urge. I guess if they didn't find a mate

05:54.000 --> 05:58.560
quickly, they might be killed by a fox, and not have the chance to pass their genes on.

05:58.560 --> 06:03.200
The gestation duration stayed low this time, a favouring quantity of offspring over quality.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.360
Here's how the other traits turned out in case you're interested.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.560
I'm rather sad that I couldn't get the rabbits and foxes to coexist for very long. The only

06:11.560 --> 06:15.320
time the foxes didn't hunt the rabbits to extinction was once when they weren't able

06:15.320 --> 06:20.120
to find the last remaining group of bunnies, and starved to death. Those bunnies then lived

06:20.200 --> 06:23.400
happily ever after though, so I guess it's a happy ending.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.240
In any case, I hope you've enjoyed this coding adventure, make sure to have a look at the

06:27.240 --> 06:31.120
others in the series if you did, and until next time, cheers.
