00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,080
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the most important philosophers in the tradition of Western thought.

3
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,080
He's one of the most artistic and ruthless and fascinating individuals in the intellectual history of the West.

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,080
He viewed himself as being the end of the Western intellectual tradition.

5
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,080
He saw himself as the destroyer of metaphysics.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,080
He saw himself as the destroyer of Christianity.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,080
He saw himself as a combination philosopher-artist in the tradition of Plato.

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,080
And he offered a comprehensive critique of the Western intellectual tradition,

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,080
not conceived merely or narrowly as a philosophical tradition, but as a cultural tradition.

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Nietzsche, more than anyone else, was a philosopher of culture.

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,080
He offered criticism of every element in Western culture,

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,080
and his criticism is noteworthy for its refusal to compromise,

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
for his insistence that we get to the psychological heart of things.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,080
What I'd like to talk about in this lecture is Nietzsche's treatment of Christianity and morality,

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,080
two of the central questions for most philosophers in the Western tradition,

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,080
and particularly important for Nietzsche because although he is something of a megalomaniac,

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,080
there's a certain amount of truth to the argument that he is, in fact, the Antichrist.

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:00,080
He, in fact, called himself the Antichrist more than once, and he wrote a book called The Antichrist.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
And what he hoped to do was to get beyond Christianity.

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,080
He quite literally thought that he was going to supplant Jesus in the Western tradition,

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
which is quite a tall order.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Not many people have that sort of ambition, but Nietzsche was never a shrinking violet,

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,080
and in fact, he wanted to offer a new set of values.

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,080
He wished to offer a new cultural orientation to the West,

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
or perhaps to revive an old cultural orientation in the West.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,080
And he wished to make us confront the half-truths, the lies, the evasions,

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,080
that are characteristic of almost everyone's life and thought.

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Now, he wrote several books that criticized morality.

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,080
In some respects, the tradition of Western ethics is his main target.

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,080
And perhaps the most intriguing of these books, or one of the most intriguing of these books,

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
is called Beyond Good and Evil.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Now, getting beyond good and evil is a rather unusual activity for a philosopher,

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
particularly one concerned with morals,

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
but Nietzsche wants to take an extremely skeptical,

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,080
an extremely naturalistic approach to moral theory and moral valuation,

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,080
and he wishes to offer a criticism of Christianity and the values that it represents,

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,080
and in addition to supplant that with a new code of morals.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Nietzsche asks an important question,

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,080
that everyone living in this modern age, this one-world, anti-metaphysical age,

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,080
has to confront, which is, where does Christianity and its moral values come from?

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,080
How is it that human beings conceived of as animals, as featherless bipeds?

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,080
How is it that they come to have a thing called a conscience?

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
How is it that they make judgments of good and evil,

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,080
which is not characteristic of fish or birds or reptiles?

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,080
What is it about human beings, which causes them to construct moral systems,

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
which are in some respects the antithesis of nature?

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Why is it that we feel the desire to conflict with nature and make judgments that nature never does?

48
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Nietzsche thinks that he finds the answer in the psyche of the human individual,

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
and he thinks that we are very peculiar animals,

50
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:35,080
animals with strange attributes, which are natural and which are part of the human condition.

51
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,080
But in fact, Nietzsche says that most of our elevation of ourselves beyond nature,

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:51,080
beyond simple facticity, is a kind of spurious raising of ourselves outside of and above nature.

53
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
The German term for this is Zonderstellung.

54
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,080
What that means is other position, a position somehow outside of nature.

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Nietzsche wants us to confront the fact that we are animals, that we are part of nature,

56
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,080
and that our moral judgments are in fact part of that natural process.

57
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,080
In looking at Christianity, Nietzsche goes back to the actual history of Christianity

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
and asks, what is it that Christian morals represent?

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Whose interests do they serve?

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
And why are these interests disguised?

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,080
What is it about the moral judgment's characteristic of Christianity that needs to be disguised?

62
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,080
What is it, in other words, that's a lie in Christian morals?

63
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Remarkable question.

64
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Nietzsche's answer is that there are two kinds of morality,

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,080
and Christianity only represents one particular perspective on judgments of good and evil.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
And this perspective is the perspective of the herd.

67
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Nietzsche contrasts two kinds of morals,

68
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,080
herd morals, morals that are characteristic of the weak, the feeble, the inferior, the enslaved,

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
which is to say Christianity,

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,080
and master morals, morals of warriors, the predatory human beings,

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,080
who make judgments on the basis of their strength rather than their weakness.

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Nietzsche wishes to supplant the herd morals characteristic of Christianity,

73
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,080
characteristic of Western culture for the previous 2,000 years, with a new morals,

74
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
morals that hearkens back to the age of the Homeric hero,

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
which hearkens back to the aristocratic warrior elite,

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
which is found all over the world,

77
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,080
which creates values out of nothing,

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,080
and which glories in the fact that their judgments can be enforced in this world,

79
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
independent of any metaphysical construct.

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Now, Nietzsche asks, who was it that created Christianity?

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Well, it's an outgrowth of Judaism, and Judaism is a priestly religion.

82
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Christianity is an extension of that.

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,080
And Christianity in its earliest historical phases appeals to the slave class in Rome.

84
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,080
In fact, Christianity is the revolt of the oppressed masses in Rome.

85
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,080
And Nietzsche argues that Christianity and its myths was organized

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:17,080
so as to articulate the perspective of the slaves, of the inferior, of the feeble.

87
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,080
And it was a way of having revenge upon masters,

88
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
having revenge upon warriors,

89
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
having revenge upon those who could oppress them,

90
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,080
and turning the tables by offering a scale of values that was different from

91
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,080
and independent of that of the master class.

92
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Nietzsche says that the slaves have their revenge,

93
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,080
and the triumph of Christianity in the West amounts to the triumph of the slave,

94
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
of the inferior, of the weak and impoverished.

95
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Think about the ideas or the myths that underlie Christianity.

96
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,080
The idea that even in this world, if there's no justice,

97
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:06,080
there's another world, heaven and hell, where God's eternal justice gives everyone what they deserve.

98
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Nietzsche says that what this, in fact, is, is the frustration, the impotence,

99
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
the anger of slaves transformed into a myth,

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,080
which allows them to get their revenge on those that oppress them,

101
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
if not in this world, at least in an unreal world,

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,080
which offers them some solace in a world of pain and misery.

103
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Nietzsche contrasts the morality of Christianity with the morality of the Romans.

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
The Romans were fierce, independent, warlike men

105
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,080
who made their own scale of values based upon power,

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
based upon the desire to dominate,

107
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,080
and they showed no reluctance to inflict pain on those they viewed as inferior.

108
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,080
And here inferior means not morally inferior in the Christian sense,

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,080
but physically inferior in terms of practical strength.

110
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Nietzsche's new alternative to Christianity will be a resuscitation of the warlike values of the ancient world,

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and what he hopes will come out of this will be an evaluation of Christianity,

112
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
which allows us to get beyond Christianity,

113
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:25,080
and the one who is going to succeed Christ as the central figure in western moral theory will be Nietzsche himself.

114
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,080
He frequently signed himself as the Antichrist, or as Dionysus,

115
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,080
another incarnation of the Nietzschean judgment of good and evil.

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:44,080
And in doing this, he raises very disturbing questions about the kind of moral judgments that we make

117
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
that are still characteristic of this culture,

118
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,080
and the difficulty of maintaining the traditional judgments of good and evil, characteristic of the West,

119
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,080
in an age in which religion and theology are taken less and less seriously.

120
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Now let's think about the idea of getting beyond good and evil.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Nietzsche contrasts the slave and the master moralities,

122
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,080
and he says what's characteristic of Christianity is the distinction between good and evil.

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Good, in the Christian sense, means kindness, lovingness, pity, essentially.

124
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Nietzsche thinks that Christian morality is a morality of pity,

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:30,080
which raises to a spurious level of distinction, feeling for the weak, the inferior, and the impoverished.

126
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,080
We might contrast this with the master morality, which doesn't distinguish between good and evil,

127
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,080
in fact it distinguishes between good and bad,

128
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,080
in the sense of capable or incapable, potent or impotent.

129
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:50,080
That's a totally different judgment of value from that characteristic of Christianity.

130
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,080
And in fact, this is the scale of values, this master morality,

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,080
is the one which Nietzsche expects will produce the highest type of human being.

132
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Nietzsche holds the view, which at least in part is borrowed from Darwin,

133
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
that human beings have no intrinsic value.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,080
If you remember that one of the great breakthroughs, or one of the great contributions of Christianity to the West,

135
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,080
is the idea that all souls are equal in the sight of God,

136
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,080
and that all people are equally value on some level, regardless of what their particular skills or capacities are,

137
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
well, Nietzsche says that's a mistake.

138
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,080
What that is is the revenge of those that can't do anything.

139
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,080
And Nietzsche says, if we are ever going to produce anything great in this culture,

140
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,080
if we are ever going to produce anything significant in this culture,

141
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
we must get away from the idea that other people really matter.

142
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
The only elements in the human species, which are important,

143
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
are the half dozen great geniuses in any culture.

144
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And he says that Christianity inhibits the development of genius.

145
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,080
It inhibits the development of creativity because it is envious.

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,080
It is a way of mythologizing the envy of those that are incapable,

147
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,080
of those that don't have much in the way of capacity.

148
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,080
And Nietzsche says, if we are to get beyond that, then we must get beyond this morality of pity.

149
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,080
We must get beyond good and evil back or forward, if you want,

150
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,080
to the idea that good and bad are the main standards of our moral judgment.

151
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:25,080
So there will be none of the conscientiousness characteristic of Christianity,

152
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
none of the worry about heaven and hell, about God's judgment.

153
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
This good and bad morality, this master morality,

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
will be strictly oriented towards this world.

155
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,080
It will not be caught up with the problem of conscience.

156
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,080
It will not primarily be concerned with the state of one's soul

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
so much as it will be concerned with the state of one's achievements.

158
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Nietzsche's judgment of good and bad, this master morality,

159
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,080
is oriented towards doing things, the masters of those that achieve.

160
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
And this is not necessarily to be taken into political sense,

161
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
although it can be taken into political sense.

162
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Master moralities can also be the moralities of the artist.

163
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Master moralities can also be the morality of the thinker.

164
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,080
But it has to be the kind of thinker or the kind of artist who despises mere mediocrity,

165
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,080
who wants to go beyond and formulate something in this world

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,080
that creates a justification for his entire society.

167
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,080
As Nietzsche says, in the use and abuse of history,

168
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,080
mankind can only be judged by its highest examples.

169
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,080
The average human being has no value, whatever.

170
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Now, Nietzsche also inquires into the differences

171
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,080
between the warrior aristocrat who generates the master morality

172
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,080
and the priest, and the psychology of the priest is of great concern to Nietzsche.

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Nietzsche believes that the priestly type and the warrior aristocrat

174
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
are both, in fact, superior kinds of men.

175
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,080
One type is the individual, the Nietzschean hero,

176
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
who's going to adopt the master morality.

177
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,080
The most dangerous opponent to the Nietzschean hero,

178
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,080
the man who adopts this master morality, is the priest.

179
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,080
The priest is the opposite of the warrior type.

180
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,080
And Nietzsche believes that the origin of this distinction lies in the human psyche,

181
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,080
that psychological differences are what distinguish these two.

182
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:39,080
Now, both the warrior and the priest have different kinds of the will to power.

183
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
They just express this will to power differently.

184
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Nietzsche thinks, in fact, that all human beings can be characterized by their desire

185
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,080
to dominate themselves, to dominate their environment, and to dominate other people.

186
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,080
This puts Nietzsche squarely in the tradition of the Sophists,

187
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,080
do you think of Calakles and Gorgias in the Platonic dialogues?

188
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,080
He's also in the line of Machiavelli, Saad,

189
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
all of those people who adopt an atheistic perspective

190
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,080
and who believe that human life is caught up with the desire to dominate others

191
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,080
and to satisfy one's desires to the maximum extent, Nietzsche supports that idea.

192
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Now, the warrior does it in a very straightforward way.

193
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,080
The warrior takes what he wants without any qualms of conscience.

194
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Conscience is an afterthought invented at a much later date.

195
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,080
The warrior just comes in and does what he does because that is his nature.

196
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
The strong and the weak is the natural distinction.

197
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Good and evil is an anti-natural distinction.

198
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
And if you think about it, there may be a certain grain of truth in this.

199
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Think of it this way.

200
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Think of the distinction between hawks and sparrows.

201
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Sparrows eat grains or seeds or whatever and they're inoffensive birds

202
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
and there are quite many of them.

203
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
But in fact, there's nothing better about eating what sparrows eat

204
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
as compared to what hawks eat.

205
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
We don't make moral judgments about hawks and say that they ought not to eat sparrows.

206
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,080
We just recognize that in nature, different things feed in different ways

207
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,080
and predatory behavior is no worse and no better than any other behavior.

208
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Nature just is what it is.

209
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Nietzsche wants to force us back into nature.

210
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,080
He wants us to reevaluate our disapproval of the human hawks.

211
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:28,080
In fact, Nietzsche thinks that we have no more right to judge a warrior or an aristocrat evil

212
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
than we have a right to judge a hawk evil.

213
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,080
And he in fact thinks it doesn't make any more sense.

214
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,080
The world of nature, red and fang and claw, just is what it is.

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
And as Nietzsche puts it in a beautiful passage, he says,

216
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
There are no moral phenomena.

217
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
There are only moral interpretations of phenomena.

218
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
A very profound idea.

219
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Well, whose values are built into Christianity?

220
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,080
The values of the herd, the values of the weak.

221
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,080
And that's why it caught on among the underclass in Rome.

222
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,080
And the entire history of Western ethics has been extrapolations from this herd morality

223
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
which has inhibited the development of our culture.

224
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,080
If we were to go beyond that, we would have to allow for the fact that cruelty may not be an evil.

225
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,080
That pity may be a vice.

226
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,080
That the desire to dominate other people may be the highest expression of human being,

227
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,080
rather than its worst example.

228
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,080
And in that respect, Nietzsche is not only connected to Machiavelli and to Saad and to this office,

229
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,080
but if any of you are familiar with the work of Dostoevsky,

230
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
particularly something like crime and punishment, the idea of the singular man,

231
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,080
the man that's going to stand outside of good and evil,

232
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
and Raskolnikov commits that murder,

233
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,080
much the same issues are being discussed in that novel.

234
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
The question of whether, in fact, moral judgment is universal,

235
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
or whether it's an arbitrary series of conventions designed by the weak

236
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
to oppress the strong, strangely enough.

237
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Now, in a book called The Genealogy of Morals, he tries to figure out

238
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
how it is we got into this predicament,

239
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,080
how it is we came to the point where the inferior and the weak

240
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
could start to make our moral judgments.

241
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,080
And he says, first of all, that the initial moral judgments that human beings made

242
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,080
came from the warrior aristocrats who imposed their will on the world.

243
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
This is not only his model of the warrior aristocrats,

244
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,080
also in some respects his model of the artist.

245
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Think about, and his arguments are very interesting.

246
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Nietzsche was a philologist and a professor of classical languages,

247
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,080
and he derives most of his arguments from an inquiry into Latin and German words

248
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
and what their origins might have been.

249
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Now, since I can't presuppose that you know Latin and German,

250
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,080
let's try English just to see if, in fact, there's some evidence for this,

251
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
and I think there is.

252
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Think about what a noble action is.

253
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
What makes an action noble?

254
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Well, we know that a noble action is a good one.

255
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,080
If you look it up in the dictionary, you'll find that it's a term of approval.

256
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Is it coincidental that nobility is also a section of the social structure

257
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
in ancient societies?

258
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Consider the distinction between a noble action and a base action.

259
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Who do you think the base are?

260
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,080
The base are, in fact, the inferior, the weak, those that take orders rather than give them.

261
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,080
The distinction between noble and base suggests that maybe our judgments of value

262
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,080
at the time when these words were coined are, in fact, simply the judgments of important warriors

263
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
contrasted with the judgments of people that have to suffer and put up with them.

264
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Consider the distinction between being mean and being noble.

265
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Well, being mean is a very bad thing nowadays to be mean,

266
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,080
but there was a time when to be mean meant that you were essentially a villain.

267
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Villain means peasant in its origins.

268
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Give that some thought.

269
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Nietzsche has a very profound argument here.

270
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Think about something like coming from a good family and coming from a bad family.

271
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Yes, indeed.

272
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Again, the judgments of power, characteristic of predatory warrior aristocrats,

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:18,080
were the actual source, according to Nietzsche, of our judgments of good and evil.

274
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,080
To be mean, to be base, to be a villain meant that you were bad.

275
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,080
To be noble, to be high-minded as opposed to low-minded, to have high moral standards

276
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,080
as opposed to low moral standards, ask yourself where they came from.

277
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Nietzsche was the first man to force himself to consider the possibility

278
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,080
that what we take to be universal moral distinctions applicable to everyone

279
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,080
are, in fact, a disguised form of the will to power,

280
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,080
a way for the weak and the impotent to get back at the superior

281
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,080
by changing these aristocratic valuations, by moving from good and bad to good and evil.

282
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:05,080
In other words, the invention of evil was a way for the oppressed to strike back at the superior.

283
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Nietzsche wants to erase that.

284
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,080
He says that's a mistake in Western culture.

285
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:18,080
That's a hole or a gap or an inferior part of the Western tradition.

286
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,080
And if we want to produce superior human beings, then we have to free them from the shackles of slave morality.

287
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:32,080
We have to prevent them from being undermined in their achievements or undermined in their aspirations

288
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,080
by creating in them the conscience, a conscience which prevents them from achieving what they could.

289
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Now, here's another very interesting question, and it's very hard to answer.

290
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Nietzsche offers us a very provocative conception.

291
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Where does conscience come from and what is it?

292
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Think about that for a moment.

293
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,080
If, in fact, human beings are animals, and I think that Darwin has conclusively shown that to be the case,

294
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,080
why are we the only animal with a conscience and where does it come from and what is it?

295
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Very difficult question.

296
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Nietzsche's argument is something like this.

297
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Human beings have a natural desire to achieve power.

298
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,080
The will to power, that is characteristic of what makes people go.

299
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,080
And the usual route that the will to power takes is the desire to dominate other people.

300
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:31,080
There is a natural ruthlessness in people, a desire to take advantage of others, and it pleases people to cause pain.

301
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Hard thing for us to swallow perhaps in these days, but with the degree of pain in the world

302
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,080
and the degree of evil that we see, to use a word that I might italicize, there may well be something to it.

303
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,080
If, in fact, people do like to create pain in others, of course, usually not themselves,

304
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
what happens when you frustrate this desire?

305
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,080
What happens when you say you can't enslave other people?

306
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
You can't kill other people and take their possessions?

307
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
You can't oppress other people because we will stop you?

308
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Well, Nietzsche says, and this is a fascinating possibility, although I'm not certain if it's true,

309
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,080
he says that when people are frustrated in their desire to cause pain to others,

310
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
the consequence of that is that they decide to start imposing pain on themselves.

311
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:24,080
And this pain that they pose on themselves is called conscience, a horrifying possibility.

312
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,080
In German, the term for the pang of conscience is called Gewissenbisse, which means the bite of conscience.

313
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
And Nietzsche says essentially that people are predatory animals,

314
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
and if they can't bite other people, they bite themselves.

315
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:46,080
And when they begin to torture themselves, they find the last possible outlet for this desire to impose pain on the world.

316
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
If they can't do it to other people, they'll do it to themselves.

317
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Now, this bite of conscience gets progressively worse when priests come on the scene,

318
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
when the priestly type comes on the scene.

319
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,080
It goes from inferior to even more inferior,

320
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,080
because the priests harness slave morality, they harness this morality of the herd,

321
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
and they use it for their own purposes.

322
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,080
The priests are the highest example of the herd animal, of the herd type.

323
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,080
They have a special set of morals that they keep for themselves,

324
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,080
and then they rule the herd using various kinds of myths and various kinds of verbal techniques

325
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,080
so that they can have their revenge, and so that they can oppose the warrior type.

326
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Nietzsche sees among the highest types of human beings an intrinsic conflict between the priest and the warrior.

327
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Nietzsche thinks that the warrior is the kind of person that knows how to forget things.

328
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Again, this is an interesting psychological profile,

329
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,080
and there are many, incidentally, if you read the genealogy of morals and beyond good and evil,

330
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,080
you'll find that there are many anticipations of Freud,

331
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,080
especially the question of conscience and the question of resentment.

332
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Nietzsche thinks that resentment, the hatred of being oppressed, is the source of slave moralities,

333
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,080
and that the priest takes that resentment, formulates it in a mythological way,

334
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,080
and uses that to orchestrate and control the herd so that they can be opposed to any superiority

335
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
among those that would break moral rules, among the would-be warriors.

336
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,080
What makes the priestly type so dangerous is the fact that they can dominate culture

337
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,080
and that they have chosen the wrong path, they have chosen the slave moralities,

338
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
and they have absolutized that.

339
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:43,080
The consequence of absolutizing that is that it seems that there is no possibility of reintroducing master morality

340
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,080
without a complete and thoroughgoing critique of the culture, and that is what Nietzsche thinks he is.

341
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,080
That's what it means for Nietzsche to be the Antichrist.

342
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,080
He's not just the Antichrist in some mythological sense, he literally takes that as a mark of distinction.

343
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
It shows just what a free thinker he is.

344
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Nietzsche is willing to say, not only is he the Antichrist,

345
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,080
but that he thinks that that's the best development in culture since the time of Jesus.

346
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,080
It's about time that we got back to our morality which would allow for the development of superior people.

347
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Now, Nietzsche's argument here is very disturbing.

348
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
It's disturbing in its consequences.

349
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
It's disturbing because it kind of rocks the moral boat for us.

350
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,080
But Nietzsche's critique goes even further than this.

351
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,080
He wants to investigate not just the question of pain and people's desire to impose pain on others,

352
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
and if not on others than on themselves,

353
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,080
he wants to look at the arguments about suffering made by the priests.

354
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Christianity, if you remember, holds the view that God is providential,

355
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,080
that he supervises the entire world, and that I believe the phrase is not a sparrow falls but God knows about it.

356
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Well, Nietzsche thinks that this myth was invented so that suffering could be justified and could be explained.

357
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,080
And in some respects, there's a certain amount of truth in that,

358
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,080
that part of what Christianity does is explain, or at least explain away, the fact of human suffering

359
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,080
by saying that God doubtless has some plan, although we don't know what that plan is,

360
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,080
it surely is there because the kind of God we've decided to construct, the kind of God we believe in,

361
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,080
is the kind of God, he's a good God, a loving God, the kind of God that would never do anything evil.

362
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Since he would never do anything evil, the suffering that you get must have a meaning.

363
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,080
And Nietzsche thinks the worst thing that the priestly element ever did to human culture

364
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
was to sell people on the idea that suffering has meaning.

365
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Nietzsche says that the entire world is completely meaningless, that the world is moral chaos,

366
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,080
that suffering has no meaning, and the idea that suffering has meaning just makes suffering infinitely worse.

367
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,080
It's not hard to see why.

368
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,080
It was bad when weak, feeble people had to put up with the strong,

369
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,080
had to put up with having things stolen from them, with being murdered and raped and tortured.

370
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,080
That was bad because of simple physical pain for the reason that any natural calamity is bad.

371
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,080
But the priestly idea of attaching a meaning to this suffering makes it all that much worse,

372
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,080
because if there is a God in heaven who is in fact supervising this entire procedure,

373
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,080
the reason why suffering must follow us, why evil must befall us, lies in ourselves.

374
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
We are somehow responsible for it. We brought it upon ourselves.

375
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,080
What does this mean? This infinitely increases our suffering,

376
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,080
because not only are the weak and the feeble still being tortured and killed and raped and maimed,

377
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,080
but in addition to that, it's their fault.

378
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,080
What a horrible turnaround.

379
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
What a dreadful addition to the suffering they already have.

380
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,080
After you recover from a terrible encounter with warrior aristocrats, with those who are beyond good and evil,

381
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,080
then you must live with the fact that you brought it on yourself and guilt enters the world.

382
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,080
After the superior, after the strong, after the ruthless have finished with you,

383
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,080
after they've caused their modicum of pain, you have to add to it.

384
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,080
The bite of conscience means you're going to impose pain on yourself.

385
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:25,080
This development is one of the worst turning points in the history of Western culture, according to Nietzsche.

386
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:34,080
And in that respect, Nietzsche believes that he is liberating us from the shackles of a self-imposed misery.

387
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,080
And for all his madness, there is a certain degree of coherence in this argument.

388
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,080
And it is hard to know where he's correct, how much of this we should accept,

389
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,080
and how much of it is just speculation that we could never really have much of an idea about.

390
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,080
So let's stop and think about it for a second.

391
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,080
My suspicion is that Nietzsche is probably wrong in his argument that good and bad come,

392
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,080
or that our judgments of good and bad and good and evil come from the distinction exclusively of masters and slaves.

393
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Probably the distinction between good and bad is much older than aristocratic social structures,

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,080
which are relatively late in human development, maybe two or three thousand BC for the most part.

395
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
What it most likely is attached to is feelings of pleasure and pain.

396
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,080
My guess is, again, just speculating Allah and Nietzsche, which should be very much in the Nietzschean tradition,

397
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,080
that probably a full stomach was a good feeling, and going hungry was a bad feeling.

398
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Probably breaking your leg was a bad feeling, and being healthy was a good feeling.

399
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,080
And these may well go before judgments of good and bad based upon aristocratic social structures.

400
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:56,080
But the fact remains that after these initial judgments of pleasure and pain got turned into our judgments of moral value,

401
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,080
there is a superimposed layer of aristocratic moral judgments in our culture and in our language.

402
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,080
I think that the distinction between noble and base, between noble and mean,

403
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,080
between high moral values and low moral values establishes that with a good degree of plausibility.

404
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Now, what are we to make of this judgment?

405
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,080
What happens when we go beyond good and evil?

406
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,080
And this is a delicate and difficult question.

407
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Nietzsche, in a book called The Antichrist, which he modestly named after himself, one would think,

408
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,080
he describes his procedure as philosophizing with a hammer.

409
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,080
And that's a very intriguing idea, because it shows the destructiveness of his philosophy, the skepticism of it,

410
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,080
and the gleeful malice that's in it.

411
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:53,080
And I think it's worth considering the fact that philosophizing with a hammer very easily shades over into intellectual vandalism.

412
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,080
And it may be that not everything that can be broken ought to be broken,

413
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:07,080
and it is not entirely clear that The Antichrist offers us more as a moral alternative than the Christian ethics.

414
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:14,080
But his willingness to ask questions about it, I think, is what makes Nietzsche of enduring significance to our culture.

415
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,080
For all the madness, for all the evil that's built into it, it's probably the most significant moral development since,

416
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
oh, I don't know, the Enlightenment anyway.

417
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,080
And in terms of its artistic qualities, I think that Nietzsche is probably in the same league as Plato.

418
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,080
And as a great poet-philosopher, Nietzsche and Plato are the two greatest figures who combine art and philosophy.

419
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Those of you who have read Nietzsche will know that his critical capacity is awesome and his artistic capacity is quite great.

420
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
You would not find that primarily in his poems or in the songs that he writes.

421
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Most of the art that he creates directly is quite inferior,

422
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,080
but his prose poetry is the greatest in the German language and probably the greatest in the Western tradition.

423
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Now, when we finish up with the priest and we find the liabilities of the priest,

424
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,080
when we find that perhaps the priestly type has in fact been selling us a dangerous set of myths,

425
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,080
we wonder if we can go back to the warrior, probably not, except in a sublimated sense.

426
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:25,080
If we were to take the will to power, turn it into something perhaps not as catastrophic as, I don't know,

427
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Aryan war-makers or superior brutish types, it may be that the type of the philosopher,

428
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:46,080
that the type of the artist is in fact the warrior type, the individual who needs no moral code to create his own conception of good and bad,

429
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,080
that this type is what can come out of a revaluation of all values and that, I believe, is what is advantageous in Nietzsche.

430
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,080
The difficulty is how we will know when we really are beyond good and evil rather than being beneath good and evil.

431
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Many of Nietzsche's friends and his philosophical admirers have tried to shield Nietzsche from the criticism that he's a proto-Nazi

432
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,080
and in fact I don't think it works, I think in fact Nietzsche is a proto-Nazi.

433
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:23,080
There's a strong tinge of racism in his work, there is a strong tinge of refined cruelty in his work

434
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:32,080
and insofar as this was misused in the 20th century by the Nazis and by other racially oriented hate groups,

435
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,080
I think Nietzsche is at least in part to blame.

436
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Those who like Nietzsche's work, who want to shield it from this criticism, will point out with considerable justification

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,080
that he would have nothing but contempt for the misuse of his work in the century,

438
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,080
but it won't entirely absolve him of the results of his statements because after all,

439
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Nietzsche would have had contempt for everybody whether they adopt his position or not.

440
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,080
So I would say that the warrior type very easily shades over into the barbarian

441
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,080
and Nietzsche as he puts it beautifully says, I write in order to be misinterpreted

442
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,080
and if we only have a series of misinterpretations of Nietzsche

443
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,080
because he thinks that there is no one canonical interpretation

444
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,080
well then it seems to me that he should bear the brunt of responsibility for everything

445
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080
both good and bad that comes out of his work

446
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:31,080
and if we live in a Nietzschean age, it seems to me that we have to find some way of tempering it

447
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
whatever it is that is good from the western intellectual tradition

448
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,080
and if we can't agree as to what we want to call undesirable

449
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,080
whether it's good, whether it's bad or evil, whether it's the master conception of what's undesirable

450
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
or the slave conception, we may perhaps be able to create a sense of the good

451
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
which goes beyond the dichotomy between the two

452
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,080
which allows us to create some sort of overlap between them

453
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,080
perhaps it would be possible, as Nietzsche says, to create an artistic socrates

454
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,080
a moral socrates who is able to both combine the strength of the artist

455
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,080
with the mythological capacities of the priest

456
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:16,080
who is willing to connect his individual judgment with the concern for what is good for the species

457
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,080
and I think Nietzsche himself would not have entirely disagreed with that

458
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,080
if one is going to create a beautiful artistic philosophy the way Nietzsche does

459
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,080
we have to allow him a certain poetic license

460
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,080
if we are willing to allow Plato's poetry and Plato's myths

461
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:40,080
a certain degree of consideration and a certain degree of leeway for interpretation

462
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,080
perhaps if we did that with Nietzsche we would come up with a more fertile reading

463
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:50,080
when you get a chance to read Nietzsche and of all the philosophers I have taught this in this series of lectures

464
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080
I strongly and most strongly recommend that you do get a look at Nietzsche

465
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,080
when you do keep this in mind Nietzsche has one particular trope which is characteristic of him

466
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,080
which runs through all his work and it's analogous to the one trope which is central to Socrates

467
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,080
if Socrates is the man of inimitable irony

468
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,080
the man who constantly says ironic statements that can be interpreted as the opposite of what he says

469
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Nietzsche's typical trope is the oxymoron

470
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,080
an oxymoron is something like cold fire or hot ice

471
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,080
it's to use words in the opposite way that they are to be interpreted literally

472
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,080
Nietzschean oxymoron is what makes his poetry so moving

473
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:39,080
and perhaps the idea that he writes in order to be misinterpreted is that kind of oxymoron

474
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:50,080
perhaps the idea that the distinction between good and evil and good and bad is an unbridgeable distinction

475
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,080
can also be seen as an oxymoronic construction

476
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Nietzsche's treatment of the warrior, Nietzsche's treatment of the priest

477
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,080
if it's not persuasive historically and I think as a historian I think ultimately he's wrong

478
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,080
it is persuasive poetically

479
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,080
and I would ask you to consider the fact that poetic persuasiveness may itself be an oxymoron

480
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Nietzsche believes that having undermined the western intellectual tradition

481
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,080
by having abolished metaphysics, by having abolished the plausibility of Christianity

482
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,080
what he's done is created a new blank slate for us

483
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,080
and if the slate isn't entirely blank

484
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,080
well let's not hold Nietzsche entirely responsible for that

485
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:39,080
let's allow for the fact that poetry and Nietzsche's strong point is the fact that he is a great prose poet

486
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,080
that poetry offers us a multitude of possible interpretations

487
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,080
and that by offering us a liberation from dogma, a liberation from metaphysics

488
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,080
by offering us a kind of poetry which can create new value

489
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,080
which can create new human superiority

490
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:03,080
which can create a new and finer culture that Nietzsche has in fact done our culture a great service

491
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:09,080
however much madness or evil or megalomania is built into the Nietzschean conception of the world

492
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,080
he is surely the greatest philosopher of the last hundred years

493
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,080
and the remainder of the 20th century philosophical tradition would be inconceivable without him

494
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Nietzsche is one of the great forerunners of existentialism

495
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Nietzsche is certainly the first person to articulate the nihilism that threatened our culture

496
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:36,080
as Christianity had to recede after the attack made by modern natural science in the late 19th century

497
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Nietzsche is not in that respect the cause of the breakup of western religion

498
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,080
he's not the cause of the breakup of western metaphysics

499
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Nietzsche just articulates it

500
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
you may think of Nietzsche to take a poetic figure as a kind of seismograph

501
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,080
he's the first and most sensitive writer who sees that the continents of our thought are shifting

502
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
and rather than causing it he tells us about it

503
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:06,080
and in telling us about it he forces us to confront something that sooner or later we would have to confront

504
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,080
and insofar as he does a lot of the intellectual dirty work for us

505
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,080
insofar as he's willing to be the antichrist

506
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:22,080
as he's willing to take upon himself the responsibility for questioning the very foundational elements of our culture

507
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
he's one of the greatest thinkers that ever lived

508
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,080
so whatever is liabilities and I think there are many

509
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,080
because he's an anti-Semite, he's a racist, he's a misogynist

510
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
there are many evils in Nietzsche's work

511
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,080
but like it or not he forces us to think in ways that we would not think otherwise

512
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:47,080
he forces us to consider closely ourselves and to ask ourselves how honest are we when we are alone

513
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
much less when we are with other people

514
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,080
he asks us not only to have the courage of our convictions

515
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Nietzsche asks, no he demands, that we have the courage to question our convictions

516
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,080
which is a much rarer human quality

517
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,080
insofar as our convictions will stand up to this kind of critical scrutiny

518
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Nietzsche can be thought of as one of the high points in Western culture

519
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,080
the idea of ruthless self-criticism is quintessentially Greek

520
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Nietzsche wants to bring us back to the earlier, higher, finer conception of human beings

521
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,080
characteristic of the non-Socratic Greeks

522
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,080
if you could think of one particular figure that Nietzsche wishes to supplant

523
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,080
in philosophy as opposed to religion, that would be Socrates

524
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Nietzsche is the new Socrates

525
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,080
the Socrates of art, the Socrates of the individual, the Socrates of subjectivity

526
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:50,080
what he has in common with Socrates is the willingness to ask uncomfortable questions

527
00:41:50,080 --> 00:42:01,080
what he has in common with Socrates is a willingness to ask questions about issues that no one feels very comfortable with

528
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,080
what's more important about Nietzsche is that his answers are intrinsically provisional

529
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,080
just like Socrates, Nietzsche says everything is always open to question and always will be

530
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Nietzsche calls us not to any dogma but to a higher and finer kind of life

531
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,080
and insofar as we are heeding that Socratic call, Nietzsche who would be the anti-Socrates

532
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,080
is in fact part of the Socratic tradition as well

533
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:33,080
and he is both Socrates and an anti-Socrates is a perfectly Nietzschean oxymoron
