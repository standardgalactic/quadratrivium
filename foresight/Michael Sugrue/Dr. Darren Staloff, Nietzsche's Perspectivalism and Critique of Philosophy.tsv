0	28680	The
28680	34680	text that I'm going to be discussing today, Nietzsche's Gay Science, was by his own admission
34680	44680	his most personal book, a text that more fully than any other revealed his self-created persona.
44680	54400	And I say self-created persona advisedly. Nietzsche was in personality, nothing like the
54400	59720	character you would have gotten from the previous lecture, which quite aptly describes
59720	63840	genealogy of morals beyond good and evil. And from that you get a sense of a sort of
63840	74840	philosophic Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actual Nietzsche was an incredible nerd, an extremely
74840	82720	sickly frail philology professor, prodigious in his youthful scholarship, but his self-created
82720	87840	persona that most accurately described the way he liked to think of himself was actually
87840	93160	less like Arnold Schwarzenegger than Oscar Wilde. He was very much a dandy, a very dapper
93160	100200	dresser, playful, had a very good sense of humor, at least in his writings. And I want
100200	105720	to try whenever possible to give you a sense of that side of him, because that's what
105720	110840	he tries to communicate in Gay Science. For example, it's a work that's comprised of
110840	118200	a series of aphorisms, poems, riddles, jokes, songs, none of which are more than a few
118200	124040	paragraphs long. The form of the work is Nietzsche's attempt to overcome what he considered
124040	130480	the dreary, systematic nature of traditional philosophy, which he felt was hampered with
130480	136320	a sort of ponderous, heavy-handed seriousness as if we were getting deep and getting to
136320	145120	the bottom of things. Rather than be systematic, Nietzsche endeavors to be edifying, playful,
145120	154920	to offer wisdom rather than a lie called truth. And as we'll see, Nietzsche argued that given
154920	161040	the philosophical conception of truth, there could be no such thing. The text is, I would
161040	167840	urge, a wonderfully beautiful piece of prose. In fact, it's one of the very few pleasurable
167840	172560	reads in all of German philosophy. Not to say that German philosophy is not rewarding,
172560	177880	I mean reading Kant, reading Hegel is intensely rewarding, but it is also very much like having
177880	184560	your teeth drilled without anesthetics. And Nietzsche was critically aware of this and
184560	190640	was in fact revolted by it. So my presentation, well as I've mentioned, whenever possible,
190640	198560	I attempt to capture this quality of playfulness, good-hearted mischievousness, and what I would
198560	206880	call a certain happy-go-lucky skepticism. Now, I must confess, in spite of his best efforts,
206880	213240	Nietzsche was, unfortunately, a systematic thinker. Therefore, I'm afraid, before I
213240	216840	can actually delve into the text, and what I plan to do is actually read you passages
216840	221880	and explicate them, I have to present one of his central doctrines that I believe informs
221880	228200	and underlies everything he writes. And this is a doctrine that's known as perspectivalism,
228200	235520	alternately called perspectivism. In brief, the doctrine holds that all of our concepts,
235520	242520	our language, our culture represent perspectives which we impose on experience. We put a mask
242560	250840	as it were over the realm of experience to create a, quote, world. And since Nietzsche
250840	256840	is systematic in all of his theories and theorems and to relate, I can draw on the last lecture
256840	264040	to give you an example of this. Take morality. Is morality an absolute reflection of the
264040	270920	truth? Or is morality, as Nietzsche says, perspectival? In other words, consider the
270920	277520	master morality that Professor Sugru has so aptly described. It is a morality of not
277520	283320	of what one does, but what one is. From a certain perspective, it has an intuitive sense. The
283320	288800	good man is a man who's good for something, and one can easily picture the situation.
288800	293800	You're going off into battle with spears and swords against people with spears and swords,
293800	299640	and you have a choice. You can have on your side either, well, Lawrence Taylor, or you
299680	305640	can have on your side Mahatma Gandhi. He says, well, this was the master sense of morality.
305640	309720	One of them is good. Lawrence Taylor. Why? Because he's good for something. When you're
309720	314200	in the middle of a battle, you'd rather have Lawrence Taylor by your side. Mahatma Gandhi
314200	318560	is bad because he's useless. He can't do anything for us. In the middle of a battle,
318560	322520	he's going to sit down and start, you know, eating rice or something like that. Perfectly
322520	328560	useless. So that's one perspective. And then there's the slave perspective, right, that
328600	334640	Lawrence Taylor is in fact a bad man because he's violent. He's contemptuous of those
334640	340320	beneath him, and Mahatma Gandhi was a good man because he had universal love. And Nietzsche
340320	345280	says, well, which of these are really true? Neither. There isn't a real truth to this.
345280	349760	There's just those perspectives, and you choose the perspective which works best for you.
349760	356760	Now, this is not a complete innovation. That such perspectives are imposed rather than quote
356760	362000	red off of nature. Kant pointed out, right, with his discussion of the Copernican Revolution
362000	367960	and conceptual schemes. A lot of what we quote, call the world actually arises from our own
367960	374960	a priori categories. Now, Hegel had historicized that. He said, you know, it really doesn't
374960	379040	come from our a priori categories of mind because we find different conceptual schemes
379040	386040	in different parts of the world, and we find conceptual schemes evolve over time. Nonetheless,
386480	392680	philosophers after Hegel, and certainly before, held that what makes a perspective true is
392680	399680	that it in some sense corresponds to the way the world is, right? And we might accept Hegel
400680	406640	by saying, well, each of our following perspectives comes closer and closer to an accurate correspondence
406640	411440	of the world. And this is a doctrine called realism, the notion that the world is just
411480	416420	like the picture represented of it by the beliefs we hold or by our language or common
416420	423420	sense. Nature felt this was a piece of pre-Darwinian nonsense, literally a philosophic antique
425040	432040	piece. Nature says, what if we take Darwin seriously? What possibly can make a perspective
433280	439840	believable except the fact, not that it corresponds to reality, but rather that it empowers us
439840	445720	and allows us to cope with reality more effectively. So the key to evaluating belief as good or
445720	450120	bad is not whether it corresponds to reality, which is a vacuous notion because we never
450120	457120	quite get in touch with reality, but rather whether it fulfills our will to power, right?
457120	462080	Whether it allows us to control nature, to control ourselves, to control our environment,
462080	469080	including other humans. So in short, realism for Nietzsche is dogmatic and unjustifiable.
470320	475640	For the world in itself is nothing like the way we describe it. Now I want to urge that
475640	482640	perspectivalism runs in two disparate directions, one external and one internal. Externally
484640	490920	it takes the form of scientific realism, which is the belief that science accurately
490920	496160	depicts the way the world is. But Nietzsche disagrees, he says science is just another
496160	501200	perspective. It's certainly the perspective he believes in, hence gay science, but not
501200	505840	because it corresponds to the world, but because it's an extremely useful thing to believe.
505840	512840	Right? It actually helps us control nature. Reality itself is actually just chaos and
514880	521040	flux. Nietzsche does occasionally, I must confess, fall into metaphysics. His metaphysics
521040	527000	are thoroughly Heracletian, which is to say they are the metaphysics we found in Heraclitus,
527000	534000	the Presocratic philosopher. Persons for Nietzsche are nothing other than a series of
534000	540240	drives and instincts. And this is a really Darwinian conception, right? What describes
540240	545400	a human is the particular conjury of drives and instincts, and Nietzsche sums that up
545440	551880	with the phrase will to power. So all of nature, not just humans, are various wills to power.
551880	556000	All the animals are wills to power, trying to dominate their environment, replicate their
556000	561800	genetic code as much as they possibly can, and eat other things lower in the food chain.
561800	567880	That's the notion of will to power. So science in common sense are just masks that we throw
567880	574880	on reality so that we can cope with it, so that we can manipulate it. Now Nietzsche accepts
575640	579360	the correspondence theory of truth as the only tenable theory of truth, and it is for
579360	586280	that reason he says there is no truth, right? Because there is no fixed, final, parsed reality
586280	590840	for it to correspond to. So don't be upset when we find out that everything is a lie,
590840	594680	that there is no truth. It doesn't mean that there's nothing to believe in. It simply means
594680	599520	that there is nothing to correspond to our beliefs, that our beliefs simply interact
599520	606520	with the world causally, rather than correspondentially, that they give us a handle on the world.
609720	614840	And as I've suggested, therefore grounds for belief have nothing to do with truth, but
614840	621340	rather are all about power over nature and ourselves. Now, perspectivalism also cuts
621340	628340	internally. It undermines something which we might call the internal realism of the self.
629260	634780	Now we're all aware at some point in our lives, we wear masks, right? We present a persona.
634780	640500	When you meet your boss, and he looks like an old bald, who knows what, you don't say
640500	645100	hi, old bald, who know what, rather you smile and say, oh you look so good, I love that
645100	649300	tie, that's really charming. And we wear these masks when we deal with our children and they
649300	653060	do something silly which is dangerous, we don't laugh and say that's silly, we take
653060	658860	a stern face and say, why not not do that? And we put these masks on, we all do this
658860	664980	all the time. Nonetheless, we have this belief that if we could ever take those masks off,
664980	671980	we would find our real self, the real Professor Staloff as it were. Nietzsche finds this view
673260	680140	embarrassingly dogmatic and stupid. There is no real self, any more than a real world.
680140	685820	That's an incredibly dogmatic myth. We create ourselves. We create ourselves by putting
685820	691340	on masks, masks that we build, perhaps on the basis of models of others, but perhaps on
691340	696700	our own. And in fact, that's the distinction he draws about mask wearing. Some people are
696700	703700	more than satisfied to wear the masks that their culture presupposes. For Nietzsche,
704380	711140	that's dangerous, at least for him. He says that sort of a person has no terror of being
711140	718140	a copy, a replica, one just like any other cut out of a cookie cutter mold. The interesting
719100	726100	person is like an artist who self-consciously and artistically creates his own masks. He
728220	733300	may not even do it in his personal life. He may do it through his works. And that is
733300	737980	exactly what Nietzsche's works represent for him, his own self-created persona, his
737980	744100	own self-projected mask. Now, I want to very briefly to say that there are some would-be
744100	748580	friends of Nietzsche who've claimed that he was not a perspectivalist because that would
748580	754020	be a stupid view. I mean, if it's all just perspective, then one perspective is as good
754020	761020	as another. Well, Nietzsche has a great line. He says, I wish such disciples on my enemies.
762020	769020	He says, that's a cloven-minded thought, the inference limps. And the reason it limps
769500	775700	is because such friends assume that the only thing which could count as truth, as grounds
775700	780300	for belief, is correspondence. When Nietzsche says, not at all. There's plenty of reasons
780300	784380	to decide that physics is more true, say, than the belief that I have wings and can
784380	789140	fly off this podium. In fact, the best example of that would be that if I tried it, I'd break
789140	795660	my leg. He says, so that's the grounds for belief. Perspectivalism isn't undermined
795660	801340	by the critique of relativism. Simply because none of the beliefs are absolutely true doesn't
801340	808340	mean we can't choose between them, which fulfill our purposes better.
811900	818500	Perspectivalism does mean, however, that our views of things are interpretations, not
818540	825540	correspondence readings. And nowhere is this more true than in reading texts. Every reading
826420	832860	of a text is an interpretation of it. And in no text is this more obvious than in Nietzsche's,
832860	838420	which are disparate, often contradictory, confusing. So what I'm going to offer is an
838420	844060	interpretation of the gay science, which will take the form of looking at particular passages
844100	851100	which I find edifying and explicating them. I'll try, of course, because I'm not quite
852220	858020	Nietzsche, to cover all the important topics. But whether I do or not is in no way significant.
858020	863420	Whether I cover two or two hundred aphorisms is important. What is important is that I
863420	869420	try and give you a sense of the style, of the flavor of this text.
870420	875740	Alright, so that brings us to the beginning of the text. What is gay science, after all?
875740	882740	The illusion, I believe, was to the gay sebert of the Provence troubadours, which were chivalric
884140	889780	knights who created the first love songs and love poems and were destroyed during the middle
889780	892940	of a papal crusade, because obviously they weren't very good Christians, they believed
892940	897620	in adultery. And the point for Nietzsche, and other thinkers since him, I mean Joseph
897660	903780	Campbell has thought the same view, is that these were the first people who created individuals,
903780	909180	who said, I will stand against authority, and if the church tells me what I'm doing
909180	915180	is a sin, well, so much for the church. I will fulfill my own path. And I think that's
915180	920380	a fair sense of part of what gay science is about, the creating of individuals, the cherishing
920380	927380	of individuality as opposed to commonality, universality. Nietzsche, however, in his preface
929060	936060	to the work, refers to his gay science as the result of a convalescence. He says, gay
937180	943540	science, that signifies the Saturnalia of a spirit who has patiently resisted a terrible
943540	950540	long pressure, patiently, severely, coldly without submitting, but also without hope.
951460	957900	And it was now all at once attacked by hope, the hope for health, and the intoxication
957900	963140	of convalescence. Is it any wonder that in the process much that is unreasonable and foolish
963140	969780	comes to light, much playful tenderness that is lavished even on problems that have a prickly
969780	975820	hide and are not made to be caressed and enticed? This whole book is nothing but a bit of merry
975820	982660	making after long privation and powerlessness, the rejoicing of strength that is returning
982660	988180	of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Well, what is this sickness
988180	993740	or as he calls it, nausea that he's getting better from? The nausea, he says, is the result
993740	999420	of having an over-large dose of a very unhealthy European diet called Romanticism, which fills
999460	1006220	us with great aspirations. Problem with such a conviction is, it only lasts as long as
1006220	1011700	you're scientifically illiterate. If you read Darwin, you realize that there's no purpose
1011700	1018700	behind our existence. We are, in fact, simply the agents of the big actor behind history,
1019020	1025020	Mr. DNA, right, who's a sort of viral infection that's infected the planet and where it's
1025020	1030220	laid a strategy for dominating that infection. But in a sense, don't worry, it'll die off
1030220	1037220	eventually. So Nietzsche says that's the sort of thing which can induce Veltschmer's
1038180	1043500	world weariness, a sense of anxiety and dread over it all. And Nietzsche went through this
1043500	1049260	intense depression, life is meaningless, there's no purpose, there's no goal, and then he
1049260	1056260	got better. And as he gets better, he takes on a new perspective. He's no longer serious
1058400	1065400	and somber, what he would call, oh, too, German. Now, he's pricklish, he's gay. Let me be
1065540	1071160	clear, gay at the time did not have the connotation of homosexuality that it does today. But Walter
1071160	1076080	Kaufman has quite persuasively, I think, argued that it's no coincidence that homosexuals
1076080	1080720	would have reached for the same term that Nietzsche used to describe his science, because
1080720	1086760	it suggests a sort of studied superficiality, a sense of the beauty of mere appearance,
1086760	1092080	a refusal to take serious things seriously, rather take them trivially, and take trivial
1092080	1099080	things seriously, which some of you may recognize as the dictum of Oscar Wilde. So this text
1100080	1106440	is, in a sense, then, at least for Nietzsche, a study of his psychological experience of
1106440	1111360	world weariness and its philosophical results. And Nietzsche makes an important point. He
1111360	1117200	says, this is not just me, I'm aware of it. I'm a philosophical psychologist. But every
1117200	1122320	philosopher, if he really is an interpretation of the body, in a sense, every philosopher
1122320	1127960	feels some sort of psychological tension or pull and need for meaning or purpose. And in
1128000	1133760	fact, he says, most of them are misinterpretations of the body. They're a tendency to read one's
1133760	1140760	psychic organic needs into nature. Given that, Nietzsche says, I will not do that. I will
1144800	1150920	not treat my own projections as a serious, profound, deep thing that underlies the world.
1151200	1158200	Rather than being profound and deep, we should be, as he says, like the Greeks. Oh, those
1159920	1166920	Greeks, they knew how to live. What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface,
1167080	1172680	the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, and the whole
1172680	1179680	Olympus of appearance. Those Greeks were superficial, out of profundity. And this is, and is not
1180320	1185600	this precisely what we are again coming back to. We dare devils of the spirit who have
1185600	1189840	climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought and looked down from up
1189840	1196840	there. We have looked down from there. Are we not precisely in this respect Greeks, adores
1197480	1204480	of forms, of tones of words, and therefore, artists? And I think that celebration is the
1204600	1209600	realization that, you know, there are some serious questions that might be raised, which
1209600	1214600	it's just indecent for any gentleman to raise. And he tells a story of, you know, there's
1214600	1220600	this anecdote about this woman who, this young girl who once asked her mother, is God everywhere?
1220600	1224600	She said, of course, God is everywhere. And the child said, well, that's, I think that's
1224600	1230600	thoroughly indecent. God follows me into the bathroom. I mean, is God aware, is God there
1231600	1237600	when I'm picking my nose? Oh, that's, that's horrible. And Nietzsche says, well, there
1237600	1242040	may be something to that. A wise man knows what are the fair questions and what sort
1242040	1249040	of questions not to ask. Okay, now we turn to the body of the text itself. Nietzsche
1249040	1255360	added a sort of introduction, which he called joke, cunning, and revenge, which will turn
1255360	1261560	out to be the strategies of gay science. And the book introduces all of the major themes
1261560	1268560	that will be discussed in the text. The very first of these little poems is called invitation,
1269120	1274640	and it is exactly that. It's an invitation to the text. Take a chance and try my affair.
1274640	1280120	It will grow on you, I swear. Soon it will taste good to you if by then you should want
1280120	1287120	more. All the things I've done before will inspire things quite new. And the point Nietzsche
1288440	1294120	is making is if you follow this book and begin to think dangerous thoughts, you won't follow
1294120	1300360	me. You will create your own. And I think he wonderfully expresses this in his ninth
1300360	1307360	little poem called My Roses. Yes, my joy wants to amuse. Every joy wants to amuse. Would
1307960	1313560	you like to pick my roses? You must stoop and stick your noses between thorns and rocky
1313560	1320460	views and not be afraid of bruises. For my joy enjoys good teases. For my joy enjoys
1320460	1326960	good roses. Would you like to pick my roses? All of the aphorisms in this book are Nietzsche's
1326960	1332760	roses. He's beckoning us and saying, look, you're going to find some thorny issues here,
1332760	1338760	some pricklish issues here. But that is the nature of his joy, of his happiness, of his
1338760	1345760	happy-go-lucky mischievousness. In his fifth little poem, he introduces his, what I would
1347280	1352240	call, meta-ethical critique, which is not his ethical doctrine, but his doctrine about
1352240	1358000	the way we should feel towards ethics. What troubled Nietzsche was how particular parts
1358000	1362560	of our culture, particularly of our philosophical culture, are claimed to trump the others.
1362560	1367360	Our moral duties come first. And Nietzsche said, well, morality is fine, of course. But
1367360	1372840	is it all of life? Must we learn how to morally eat our food? Must we learn what are the morally
1372840	1379840	correct ways to fold our napkins? Why should our virtues be grave? We like ours nimble-footed.
1379960	1386960	Even like Homer's verse, they have to come and go. Sometimes virtue and morality should
1388880	1393680	leave us in peace for a while so we can do something else, like be creative, do art,
1393680	1400680	do science. Morality is not the measure of all things. And I think perhaps his most wonderful
1400760	1406240	expression of this is in the text itself, I'm jumping out of place, I know, called dealing
1406240	1413240	with virtues. In dealing with a virtue, too, one can lack dignity and fawn. And clearly
1414360	1421360	I think the figure he's responding to here is Kant. Oh yes, we must do our duties. Don't
1421360	1424880	you think that's rather bad form, Kant? Don't you think it's rather bad form to constantly
1424880	1429800	fawn before your duties, like they were a sort of surrogate god? It shows a real lack of
1429800	1436800	taste. Well, he also introduces himself as a problem in the text. He says, in a wonderful
1438080	1445080	passage called Request, the minds of others I know well, but who I am, I cannot tell.
1445520	1451760	My eye is much too close to me, I am not what I saw and see. It would be quite a benefit.
1451760	1457720	If only I could sometimes sit farther away, but my foes are too distant, close friends
1457720	1464720	still too far, between my friends and me the middle would do my wish, you guess my riddle.
1464760	1470760	I need you to make a deep point. If there is no real self in there, but only masks, perspectives,
1470760	1476200	I'm a little too close to my own mask to see who I really am. That's your job, the reader
1476200	1480200	and my job, the reader, the expositor, to try and figure out Nietzsche and come back to
1480200	1487200	him and tell him who he is. But, of course, this has a sort of selfish side to it too,
1488920	1493480	which Nietzsche is quite aware of, as in for your consideration. Double pain is easier
1493480	1500480	to bear than single pain. Do you accept my dare? Try and think my, quote, dangerous thoughts.
1501480	1508480	Okay, and then finally one last theme in this introduction, and we can turn to the rest
1510760	1517760	of the body of the text, and that is his, what I would call, tasteful critique of Christianity.
1518820	1525820	He says, in a wonderful little poem called, Chusy Taste, if it depended on my choice,
1525980	1532980	I think it might be great to have a place in paradise, better yet, outside the gate.
1534100	1537100	And Nietzsche is making a very deep point here. He's saying, look, stop being pious
1537100	1541100	for a minute and be honest with me. What do you think goes on in heaven? Everyone sits
1541100	1546940	in beatific vision, genuflecting towards the deity. What a particularly boring person he
1546940	1551780	must be. Would you really want to spend time there? All the interesting people are in hell.
1552460	1555900	Well, they may well be suffering, of course. We don't want to be in hell. We might want
1555900	1561060	to look at paradise to see that wonderful splendor, but it's beneath the dignity of a
1561060	1567420	gentleman to waste his time in heaven, and that's Chusy Taste. He doesn't want to be
1567420	1574420	part of that, shall we call it, herd? Nietzsche always does. One more passage about his Chusy
1574780	1581780	Taste, and then we can leave it behind, and that is his statement against Christianity,
1583460	1589960	which again is not only sharp and invective, but actually extremely accurate. Against Christianity,
1589960	1595060	what is now decisive against Christianity is our taste, no longer our reason. That may
1595060	1600300	seem absurd at first, but go to a college campus and listen to, especially an elite one, and
1600340	1604540	listen to the young rail against the stupidities of religion, and you'll notice something.
1604540	1609740	They haven't a good argument among them. Any sophisticated theologian will persistently
1609740	1614980	best them in argument, and Nietzsche's point is, but the young won't be convinced. It's
1614980	1620980	not reasons that turn them against Christianity anymore. It's taste. How thoroughly musty
1620980	1627980	and brown to believe in that sort of heavy-handed, baroque sort of belief. The youth have developed
1628780	1635780	a higher form of taste, which clearly shows that it's too stolid, too, as it were, beef-headed.
1638460	1644060	As he says, mystical explanations are thought to be profound. The truth is, they're not
1644060	1651060	even superficial. Nietzsche is saying, look, stop looking at religion from the scales of
1651300	1658300	piety, and look at it literally, and it's thoroughly absurd. Okay. We now turn to Book
1659100	1666100	One, which I would argue constitutes a species of shock therapy. Nietzsche is, in a certain
1669940	1675620	way, trying to preach what I would call tough love. We've all been brought up in a culture
1675660	1681740	which has brainwashed us into thinking like, it wants us to think, thinking like members
1681740	1686780	of a herd. And the only way to break us free from that and liberate us is to shock us,
1686780	1693300	is to scare us, is to show us the absurdity of these views in a most harsh fashion. So
1693300	1699620	he begins with his very first aphorism, the teachers of the purpose of existence. He says,
1699620	1704260	whether I contemplate men with benevolence or with an evil eye, I always find them concerned
1704260	1708380	with a single task, all of them and every one of them in particular, to do what is good
1708380	1715220	for the preservation of the species. Not from any feeling of love, but merely because nothing
1715220	1721300	in them is older, stronger, more inexorable, and unconquerable than this instinct, because
1721300	1727820	this instinct constitutes the essence of our species, our herd. And this is extremely
1727820	1732980	Darwinian point he's making, that if you're kind to other people, and if you try to help
1732980	1737060	the species, it's not because you've thought about it, if you have sentences that describe
1737060	1742020	why you do it, you added those lies later. You do it because you're genetically programmed
1742020	1749020	to do that. That's how Mr. DNA uses us to replicate ourselves. He goes on to say, if
1749860	1756860	you think about it, hatred, mischievousness, evil, are all indispensable for the life of
1758220	1763300	the species? They bring out characteristics, noble characteristics in us, perhaps virtuous
1763300	1767260	and kind characteristics, which would otherwise go rotten if they weren't occasionally evil
1767260	1773760	people and bad things. In fact, if we look at it scientifically, we can prove that it
1773760	1780760	has, in fact, preserved the species so far. But Nietzsche's fear is that we may have reached
1780920	1787080	the point where we can no longer even think bad thoughts, even think our way outside of
1787080	1794080	the herd. For if one could, one could then respond not with a sort of vitriolic anger,
1794960	1800000	but with laughter, as he says, to laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in order
1800000	1807000	to laugh out of the whole truth, to do that, even the best so far lacks sufficient genius.
1807600	1814240	Even laughter may yet have a future. I mean, when the proposition, the species is everything,
1814240	1819600	one is always none, has become part of humanity, and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility
1819600	1823940	has become accessible to all at all times, perhaps laughter will then have formed an
1823940	1830260	alliance with wisdom. Perhaps only gay science will then be left. And Nietzsche's referring
1830260	1834340	to what he thinks is an extremely dangerous development in the late nineteenth century,
1834340	1839300	which is the growth of humanitarianism, of kindness and gentleness. He's not against
1839300	1845300	those things in and of themselves, but they're totalitarian. They insist that everything
1845300	1852100	devolve around them. And he says, you know, there's this weird fruit that's grown on the
1852100	1857060	tree of the human species in the last few hundred years called the individual, which
1857060	1862300	doesn't follow the herd. But of course, if we can all become liberals and socialists,
1862300	1867300	we can stamp that out. It's a sort of happy-go-lucky totalitarianism.
1867300	1874620	And then he turns to the real issue, what are the meaning of teachers of the purpose
1874620	1880660	of existence? Heroes who show up on the stage and tell us, life means this, you must go
1880740	1886820	out and do your duty, you must save humanity, you must be kind to the poor and the oppressed.
1886820	1890060	There's something profound about the meaning of life. And he says, well, they actually
1890060	1896100	have a place. They actually have a function. Right? What they do is tell us there's something
1896100	1900620	in life that can't be laughed at. There's something serious beneath life, behind life,
1900620	1906380	underneath life. Beware, do not laugh. And he says, well, of course, ultimately all
1906380	1912780	of these systems get exposed to reason, and the result is always laughter and comedy because
1912780	1916580	they're all absurd and ridiculous, none of them are provable. But nonetheless, there's
1916580	1923580	something new that's come out of this. Humans are the only animals that have, how to say,
1924100	1931100	grown a new need, a need for a purpose. We feel the need to have a reason to go on living.
1931100	1935740	And he says, this is fascinating. Dogs don't do that. Has your dog ever come up to you
1935740	1939700	and say, it's a dog's life, alpoh three times a day. I'm just going to go ahead and do
1939700	1944020	it all. No, I mean, every animal does how to go on, but we have this other need. And
1944020	1949180	the reason is, because teachers of the purpose of existence offer us cultural narcotics.
1949180	1954460	They somatize us. They make us, as it were, stoned and happy so that we cannot look at
1954460	1960540	the suffering that is most of life. And Nietzsche's point then of tough love is, that's the way
1960540	1964740	you break the addiction. I point out to you that it is all absurd.
1964740	1970420	Then he turns to the problem of intellectual conscience. I keep having the same experience
1970420	1975300	and keep resisting it every time. I don't want to believe, although it's palpable, that
1975300	1980300	the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to
1980300	1985020	me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as lonely in the most densely
1985020	1991500	populated cities as if you were in a desert. Everyone goes right on weighing things in
1991500	1997140	their scales of good and bad and right and evil. When anyone who cares to take a close
1997140	2001380	look at that finds that it's absurd, that evil has an indispensable place in the evolution
2001380	2005180	of the human species. It creates the sort of stormy conditions which make a tree grow
2005180	2012540	strong and firm. And he says, I can't help feeling that deep down inside every single
2012580	2019460	person has at least the desire for an intellectual conscience. And he says, this is my type of
2019460	2023660	injustice, which leads directly to the next aphorism. We were going to find that Nietzsche
2023660	2029020	is actually a profoundly fair person. This aphorism is called noble and common. And he
2029020	2033900	says there's a certain confusion. You find that there are people called, quote, normal,
2033900	2038860	or noble, who are incredibly unreasonable. They somehow throw their life on the rocks
2038860	2045580	of art, or science, or philosophy, squandering their lives for some higher ideal. He says
2045580	2049380	the common person looks at that. And the first thing they think is, how's he getting over?
2049380	2053380	Right? How's he going to turn that into money? I know that's what he's doing. He's going
2053380	2057500	to turn it into money. Everyone does it, turns it into money. And then after a certain point,
2057500	2061620	when he realizes this guy's not making any money, he says, well, he's an idiot. He's
2061620	2066180	a dope. And he says, and that's the injustice of the common person. He can't imagine someone
2066180	2070700	who doesn't have his own straightforward proclivities. He says, on the other hand, there is the noble
2070700	2076180	person who aspires to higher things. But he too is unjust, because he turns to the common
2076180	2081020	person and says, well, you too have these aspirations. Why is history so stupid? People
2081020	2087900	live subveno lives. And Nietzsche says, that is the injustice of the noble. They assume
2087900	2092700	that everyone is just like them. And so they don't judge them by the proper standards.
2092700	2095980	So when you find common people and say, why don't you aspire to higher things? He just
2095980	2099900	says, that's an unfair criticism. They're not capable of that. You must judge them by
2099900	2106140	their own standards, by their own rationality. And in fact, he says the ultimate noble mindedness
2106140	2112580	is for those who are noble to want to be the exception and not the rule. For the bulk of
2112580	2118140	humanity must be sympathetically understood as common. And that's not a bad thing. That's
2118140	2122540	just the way they are. They're not to be rebuked for that any more than the noble are for being
2122540	2136340	profound. Finally, I want to turn to, in this shock treatment, his fifth aphorism, unconditional
2136340	2143900	duties. All those who feel the need, feel they need the strongest words and sounds, the most
2143900	2149020	eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective at all, such as revolutionary
2149020	2154300	politicians, socialists, preachers of repentance, with or without Christianity, all of whom
2154300	2160780	cannot tolerate semi-success, talk of duties and always of duties that are supposed to
2160780	2168500	be unconditional. And this clearly is a jive, it can't. This point is, oh yes, we have some
2168500	2172060	moral conviction I want to give you, which I can't prove to you. So all I do is I dress
2172060	2176660	it up in big words, oh, it's an unconditional duty. It's a categorical imperative. It's the
2176660	2181740	purpose of human existence. It says, well, you find that because there are certain people,
2181740	2187740	like, say, Kant, who are too noble, perhaps from their birth, perhaps from an experience
2187740	2193260	of their education, to be willing to serve as the function of a political party or to
2193260	2198540	be someone's personal servant. But they still feel the need to be a function of something.
2198540	2206460	So they come up with these pompous principles, unconditional duties. And as he states, refined
2206460	2212060	servility clings to the categorical imperative and is the mortal enemy of those who wish
2212060	2218980	to deprive duty of its unconditional character. That is what decency demands of them and not
2218980	2224740	only decency. And I think this is a deep point. He's not being an anti-moralist. He's saying,
2224740	2231180	look, morality has its place. But why can't you tolerate semi-success? Why can't you tolerate
2231180	2234580	saying, you know, kindness is better than cruelty? Not because I'm certain about it, but it
2234580	2238820	seems that way to me. He says, no problem with that. But no, you have to say, no, I
2238820	2249020	can prove to you that kindness is better than cruelty. He says, well, that's pathological.
2249020	2254260	I now want to turn to the discussion of the doctrine of feeling of power, one of the most
2254260	2258820	misunderstood doctrines in all of Nietzsche's writings. As we know, he believes that we're
2258820	2264540	all full of a will to power. And many people believe that means that he favored inflection
2264540	2270500	of cruelty and suffering. Nietzsche points out, no, no, no, no. Look, inflicting suffering
2270500	2274860	and cruelty on people is a form of showing your will to power. But it's the will to power
2274860	2281380	of a weak man. How much more easy is it to make someone suffer than to benefit them?
2281380	2284820	In other words, if you want to see who's the real megalomaniac, the one who's really full
2284820	2290700	of power, look at someone who's kind. What are they showing? I'm so overflowing with
2290700	2297420	life and power that I have some extra I can give you. And you'll be beholden to me. That
2297420	2302060	is the real warrior ideal of Nietzsche, not a cruel man, but a kind man. And a kind man
2302060	2306700	is kind for pathological reasons, because it fulfills his feeling of empowerment to
2306700	2316300	help people. That is, as he would say, a profound sense of empowerment. But he points out, never
2316300	2322820	will such a man be kind out of pity. Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those
2322820	2327660	who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests. Rather, he'll be kind out
2327660	2334060	of a sense of overflowing greatness. Another issue which Nietzsche has been incredibly
2334060	2338060	misunderstood about, because he's dialectical and he does say some ugly things on the subject,
2338060	2342340	is women. But as we'll find out, Nietzsche is a dialectical thinker. He sees two sides
2342340	2346180	of every issue. For all of his misogyny, he has this wonderful little passage called
2346180	2352340	Diverse Disatisfaction, which he says, you know, the weak and feminine type. What they
2352340	2357860	do when they see a problem or suffering is they make it more beautiful, more profound.
2357860	2362580	Whereas the masculine and strong type, it makes things better. It actually improves them.
2362580	2368380	Right, and here we see a little, sounds like it's going to be a great piece of misogyny.
2368380	2377700	But Nietzsche responds by saying, if this type, the feminine, had not been superabundant
2377700	2384100	in Europe since the Middle Ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant change might
2384100	2388220	never have come into existence. China, for example, is a country in which large-scale
2388220	2393260	dissatisfaction and the capacity for change have become extinct centuries ago, and the
2393260	2400420	socialists would like to bring that to Europe. But fortunately, Nietzsche is not masculine.
2400420	2406820	Nietzsche is feminine. Don't make it better. That just makes us stupid like a herd. The
2406820	2411620	feminine is the superior. We should make it beautiful. We should make it profound. That's
2411620	2424660	what enables change and dynamism in life. Okay, finally, I want to turn to the last
2424660	2428700	part of book one, from which we'll go right to the end of the text after that, called
2428700	2434060	The Craving for Suffering, which is a wonderfully liberating text for anyone who spent much
2434060	2442100	time on a college campus, where you will be surrounded by students who protest injustice
2442100	2447220	and suffering and cruelty in the world. And Nietzsche is not against protesting suffering
2447220	2451540	and cruelty. He thinks that's barbaric. He doesn't want barbarians. But he wants to be
2451540	2459980	honest about why they do it. He says, what you really find is, what young people want
2459980	2465060	is suffering to come to them in the form of a big dragon. There's evil thing out there
2465060	2470980	that's objective, so that they can dress up in armor and be heroes in chivalrous nights
2470980	2476620	and go kill the dragon. So they need suffering. They want suffering, and more and more suffering
2476620	2480780	and suffering with others. Let's save the whales. Let's save the amoebas. Let's save
2480780	2486940	the plankton. Oh, yes. And he says, and the reason is, of course, because they're bored
2486940	2491660	with themselves, as well as they should be. They don't have the ability to create their
2491660	2497380	own authentic suffering and then transcend it with art. So they look to paint suffering
2497380	2505100	on the wall like a big dragon. And he says, they do not know what to do with themselves
2505100	2509740	and therefore paint the distress of others on the wall. They always need others and continually
2509740	2517580	other others. Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall.
2517580	2521940	Why must we be obsessed with suffering? It's not going to go out of the world. The Buddha
2521940	2527860	was right. Life is suffering. So why dwell on it, young people? Think of the joys of
2527860	2535300	life. Paint your happiness on the wall. Okay, finally now, I wish to take you to the end
2535300	2542980	of the text. To two important, I think extremely important, aphorisms, one number 340, the
2542980	2550260	dying Socrates, in which he quite rightly points out that when Socrates is about to take hemlock,
2550260	2556740	he says, oh, Crito, one of the students, I owe Asclepius a rooster. Asclepius is the
2556740	2562580	god of medicine. And the rooster is obviously a sacrifice to him. And Nietzsche says, what
2562580	2570780	does this really mean? You give Asclepius a rooster when he's cured of disease. What's
2570780	2578620	the disease Nietzsche is being cured of? Life. Nietzsche experienced life as, excuse me,
2578620	2583180	Socrates experienced life as a weight. And he says, and this is a terrifying thought.
2583180	2589140	Because Nietzsche, Socrates, the good soldier who always wore a chipper and stoical domain
2589140	2594420	on his face in his last dying breath with a sort of vicious vengeance said, really life
2594420	2599860	is a disease and I've been cured at last. So he says, therefore we must overcome the
2599860	2605060	Greeks. Now that's a very perspectival point. You needn't read it that way. You could read
2605060	2610980	it as saying, I've overcome the fear of death, therefore give Asclepius a rooster. But it
2610980	2618340	is, in its own way, a perfect example of perspectivalism. I now want to turn to the last and most
2618340	2625380	important aphorism called the greatest weight. The greatest weight is Nietzsche's doctrine
2625380	2631780	of eternal return, eternal recurrence, which is, I think originally a Hindu notion, which
2631780	2636940	is that we have cyclical time. Everything that happens will happen again. Ten thousand
2636940	2640820	years from now, we'll all be sitting here all over again and I'll be saying the same
2640820	2646660	words to you. And as we know, what, when the Hindus thought of that as any sane man would,
2646660	2649780	not the first thing that occurred to them is what a nightmare. Ninety percent of my
2649780	2654620	life quit fantasizing. Ninety percent of each of our lives is embarrassment, humiliation
2654620	2660860	and stupidity. Who wants to relive their bedwetting? Right? Who wants to relive all the wrong answers
2660860	2664660	they gave in high school algebra? And all the times they got laughed at. And all the
2664660	2668780	times they said stupid, dopey things and felt bad about it later. Most of your life is embarrassing
2668780	2672580	and banal. So the Hindus said, well we want to get off the life death wheel of karma. We
2672580	2677820	want to achieve nirvana, which is basically cosmic death. We don't want to be reborn.
2677820	2682460	And Nietzsche said that that was one of the biggest dangers facing Europe at the time.
2682460	2687020	And it got a wonderful expression in Schopenhauer's work, who said, we will all have real freedom
2687020	2691540	when all of humanity gets together on one day and drinks Jim Jane Jones Kool-Aid, Kimitz
2691540	2694820	Collective Suicide. He really thought this was liberation. And it was considered a very
2694820	2700020	profound thought. And Nietzsche responds by saying, no, eternal return is an excellent
2700020	2704380	test of whether you have the possibility of being a quote, ubermensch, which is not a
2704380	2709260	superman, which is not a tyrant, which is an overman, which is the next stage of man,
2709260	2713940	the man who can see the truth of perspectivalism, the truth of groundlessness, the truth of
2713940	2717980	purposelessness, the truth of the fact that he might have to live this whole stupid life
2717980	2724140	over again and still say, yes, I'll take it anyways. Life is not a problem for me. It's
2724140	2729340	full of delightful possibilities. I can self create myself an art. I can overcome myself
2729340	2736780	an art. In fact, it is art that makes perspectival truth bearable by making it beautiful. So
2736780	2742340	eternal return then becomes a litmus test. If, if when you think to yourself, do I have
2742340	2747540	to live my life all over again exactly as I have, if you can say yes to that and say
2747540	2752100	with all its stupidity, with all my bedwetting, with all my wrong answers, I want it all over
2752100	2758300	again just as it is. Nietzsche says, then you are a philosophic soul. You've overcome
2758300	2764340	that narcotic need for a purpose to your life, and you are the next stage of human
2764340	2770540	cultural development. And let me be clear about one thing before I finish here. Very
2770540	2778540	often that is depicted as a sort of Aryan blonde beast in our old Schwarzenegger type.
2778540	2783260	Nietzsche thought, you can never go back to that. That's just barbarism. The higher
2783340	2789340	formed, the ubermensch would in fact be like Nietzsche, a very sensitive soul who for all
2789340	2795740	his quote anti-Semitism was really an anti-anti-Semite. He had the very obnoxious habit of saying
2795740	2800740	things like, you know, because by the way I should point out that Germany was intensely
2800740	2804460	anti-Semitic at this point in something called Christian anti-Semitism. So what he would
2804460	2807740	do is point that and say, you know, the Old Testament is actually a great book. The sick
2807740	2812060	part is the New Testament. To read the Old Testament, it's better than Homer. People kill,
2812060	2819060	they rape, they murder. Those were real men. It's the Nazarene that's distorted. And one
2819060	2823700	last point on that subject. He said the only people more despicable than the Christians
2823700	2830140	are of course the Germans who were afflicted with, he called it racial scabies of the heart,
2830140	2836140	who said, have you ever noticed a German musician? The moment he creates something beautiful,
2836140	2842020	he blushes, right? He has to always have his opera surrounded, and he is clearly referring
2842020	2846840	to Wagner, his ex-friend, has to have his opera surrounded with great, huge sets and
2846840	2850860	theories. He says, no, no, no, look at the Italian operas. Those are people who know
2850860	2855020	how to live. Those are Ubermench. Why? Because they'd be just as happy to have their, their
2855020	2858500	sopranos go up there and go, la, la, la, la, la, for three hours without a single word
2858500	2862300	in it. Because they're not trying to be profound, they're trying to be beautiful. They don't
2862340	2865940	feel uncomfortable when they say something nice, or when they say something beautiful,
2865940	2872140	a beautiful phrase. So only a German does that. And his perfect contrast is Beethoven
2872140	2878020	and Goethe. One day they were walking together supposedly, and along came a member of the
2878020	2882620	royal family, and Beethoven locked arms with Goethe and said, we shall walk through, and
2882620	2888020	they'll have to give way. And Goethe broke his arm. He said, what a barbarian, please
2888040	2895040	not a man for you. That is the Ubermench. Not some sadistic tyrant, but a cultivated,
2895540	2900900	refined, refined person who sees laughter in everything, and joyfulness in the truth,
2900900	2906660	who doesn't need a spiritual narcotic to get through life, who is compassionate out of
2906660	2913660	strength, not out of weakness and pity, and who judges the weak not as inferior, but as
2914420	2917860	common by their own standard, not by his.
2917860	2924860	Okay, I've given you a taste of Nietzsche. I think the only better way to cash in this
2926180	2930380	lecture is to turn to the text yourselves, and I think you'll find it richly rewarding.
