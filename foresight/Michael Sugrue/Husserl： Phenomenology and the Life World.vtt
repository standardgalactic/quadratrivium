00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Edmund Husserl is

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
one of the most important and influential figures in 20th century philosophy.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
And this is despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he's a particularly difficult

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
philosopher to interpret. His style is extremely recondite, his writings are voluminous,

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
almost to the point of compulsiveness, and he has a tendency to construct neologisms

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
to correspond to the new paths that he's breaking into the realm of the psyche,

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
or the realm of the mind. Husserl, his early background was in mathematics,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
which is very important. Husserl is, perhaps like all mathematicians,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
is a sort of closet platenist. I think that mathematicians on the whole

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
tend to look for something universal and abstract in all the thinking that they do.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
And Husserl, who got his PhD under Weierstrass in Germany in the 1880s,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
has a definite set of platonic tendencies and commitments.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So when you read his philosophy, when you think about Husserl's work,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
if you were to connect it and think of it in terms of Plato and the Cartesian tradition,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
the tradition of Western rationalism and idealism,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
you will be on the right track at the very least.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Now, like Descartes, what Husserl wished to do was to construct a new foundation for knowledge.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
It's a radical epistemological move which attempts to create certainty

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
in the face of contingency and the uncertainty that is generated by the other realms of knowledge.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
So in similar respects, perhaps like Kant, what Husserl's project involves

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
is finding a presuppositionless foundation to human knowledge.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
And what this would be is a sort of science of sciences that would inform and direct

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and correct all the other activities of the human mind, including natural science.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So what Husserl is trying to do is get down to the Urschtopf, the bedrock of the human psyche,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
and from there to generate all the other realms of knowledge, which correspond to it.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
In some respects, this is like the Cartesian project of looking into oneself

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
and after finding an indubitable foundation for that and for the contents of your mind

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
to move from there to generating the external world.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
So like Descartes, Husserl is working on the assumption that first of all, the self is self-evident.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
In other words, it's not controversial that we are selves and that we have selves and that we are conscious.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
He takes that to be simply a given and that that is indubitable

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
and not only is that indubitable, the interesting thing about it is that the knowing self, the cogito,

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
is in Husserl's view both temporally and logically prior to the world that's known by the cogito.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
In other words, the knower comes before the known. That has to come first.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And if you think about the idealist tradition, all these guys believe that.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Think about Descartes, think about Spinoza, think about Kant.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
The whole idealist or rationalist tradition tends to emphasize inwardness, internality.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And perhaps that's not only an important characteristic of Husserl,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
but I would be inclined to say that that's one of the most characteristic moves,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
the characteristic intellectual deployments of continental philosophy.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
In other words, unlike the Anglo-American tradition, which looks outward like Hume

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
and develops a theory of the external world and then afterwards as a sort of postscript to that activity,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
develops a theory of the psyche, of the mind, of what's internal to a human being.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, the continental tradition does the opposite.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
They start out with a theory of what's inside, and then from there they try and work outwards.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
And both the Anglo-American tradition and the continental tradition suffer from a sort of common problem.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
When they try and make the jump from one realm, what we might call the exocosm,

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
to the internal realm, the psyche, the soul, or the mind, or what we might call the introcosm,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
there's always a problem in leaping that hurdle.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And it doesn't really matter which side you start on.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The problem is always going to be the same.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
How do we move from one part of the hurdle to the other?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
How do we move from the beginning to the end?

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
So when you look at Husserl, when you look at this Cartesian continental tradition,

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
keep that in mind.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
They're starting out with the internal facts of human consciousness and generating the world from that.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
So it's a different problematic, a different starting point,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
and that's what you keep in mind when you look at Husserl.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
Now, corresponding to this way of developing a philosophy is the hope of getting certain knowledge,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
like Descartes.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Descartes' whole project of radical skepticism was to develop a knowledge that was foundational

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and completely certain, Husserl is trying to do the same thing.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
He's a sort of neo-Cartesian.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
And much of his work, when you actually start to read the stuff that he's published,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
because although he produced a tremendous amount of writing,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
most of what he produced was not published in his lifetime.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And he was in a voluminous writing, produced almost 45,000 pages of work,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
and it tends to be very repetitive.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
It is methodological for the most part and particularly programmatic.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
In other words, what his writings are about is how we engage in a method,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
which he calls phenomenology, which will allow us to discern these eternal essences

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
that exist within the human psyche.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And once we identify these essences, then we will know ourselves.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And once we know ourselves clearly and in a way that can't be doubted,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
that can't be called into question,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
then and only then can we construct all the other elements of knowledge.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
So what he wants is, what he described as philosophy as a rigorous science,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
which is a very radical sort of an idea.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I mean, by the 20th century, I think very few thinkers are willing to say

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
that philosophy is not only a rigorous science, but it's the foundation,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
the aura knowledge of all other possible cognition.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
So this is a long, it's a play that tries to go for all the marbles.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
He's trying to win the big philosophical game.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And if he fails to do that, and I think that he does,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and I think that his project is a failure,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I think that we have to admire the sort of nobility which tries to take on

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
a huge intellectual project like that.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
In many respects, because Husserl himself as a man rather than as a philosopher,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
was a kind of a saintly individual.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
He was conspicuous for his dedication and his devotion

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
and his moral seriousness to philosophy.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I would almost be tempted to compare him to sort of a Don Quixote of philosophy.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
We all laugh at the results of Don Quixote's misadventures

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
because, well, they're silly and he misunderstands the way the world works.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
But on the other hand, no one laughs at Don Quixote's intentions.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
They are intrinsically noble and we have no choice but to admire that.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I kind of feel that way about Husserl.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I think that the project, well, not only does it not complete itself,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
it never completely gets started, and it's probably impossible to do.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
But I sort of admire the idea of unifying all of knowledge.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
It is a sort of quest for the holy grail.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
And even if we never find it, there is something excellent about the quest.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And I say this initially in my treatment of Husserl

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
because I'm going to be kind of hard on him a little later on.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
So without being too hard, I think that we should give him a little bit of slack

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
because he's trying to do something that if it is not impossible,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
it's certainly exceedingly difficult, much more ambitious

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
than the local small individual project's characteristic of the Anglo-American tradition.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, first off, he starts out with the idea of certainty and intuition.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
In other words, if we're going to examine ourselves in a phenomenological way,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
if we're going to pursue this method of phenomenology,

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
we are going to have to find out what the procedure for knowing things is,

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
what phenomenology involves as a method, what it investigates, and how it investigates it.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Those are always all going to be informed, and since this is a methodological project,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
it makes sense to talk about how we do this as opposed to what we do.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
And one of the big issues here is the question of intuition.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Now, I guess perhaps when you hear me use a word like intuition,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
particularly because we live in contemporary America,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
we are in the thrall of the Anglo-American tradition,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
you perhaps think that I should put that in italics

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
because intuition is a kind of fishy, kind of mushy, kind of messy sort of a category.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And I want to start out suggesting that that's not the case

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
and that in fact it might be the truth some of the time,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
but I can imagine intuitions, and I'm going to help you imagine some intuitions,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
which are not only not controversial but they're not mushy and they're really not doubtable.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Just some ideas.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Let me ask you some questions.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I have a studio audience here which is live and kind of helps me out.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'd like your information or your answers to these questions.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
First of all, do I have a headache?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
You don't know.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You don't know.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And how about do I hope someday to be elected president?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You don't know.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Do I like spinach?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You don't know.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
My point is that I can answer these questions even though you can't.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I know if I have a headache or not.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And what would somebody else external to me presume to tell me that,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
no, I don't have a headache?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You going to correct me on that matter?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
No, of course not.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
It's silly, right?

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, may I suggest that my knowledge of my headache is a direct intuition of my experience,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
my psychic state, right?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And I don't need anybody else to help me out here.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And if you doubt that you say,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
no, Mike, you don't have a headache.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
What am I supposed to do?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Do some math and show you that I do?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Or should we go to the lab and will I do some experiments and show you that I have a headache?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Can you see why that project is silly?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
And we wouldn't gesture something external to my experience of the world

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
in order to validate the proposition that I have a headache?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Intuition, then, perhaps is not so gooey as we might imagine.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
There are certain things which we validate just by gesturing at our experience of them.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
In that respect, oddly enough, phenomenology, Husserl's method, and empiricism,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
the method of somebody like David Hume,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
even though they are so different in many respects,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
share a common property is that they're all ultimately based on our experience.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
Hume's phenomenalism, his empiricism, is based on our experience of the external world, observing it.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Husserl's phenomenology, alternatively, is based on our experience of the internal world.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And it reduces only to that, and there's nothing further that we can gesture at.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
So, on the one hand, I would recommend that you look at this with a certain degree of skepticism.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
In other words, intuition can be a very fishy category.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
It can be nebulous, and it can be a simple refusal to give reasons for what you believe.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And usually, the refusal to give a reason philosophically for what you believe

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
is a way of saying that you don't have a reason for what you believe.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
But my point is that that's not always the case.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
If you think about the idea of intuition in terms of questions like,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
do I have a headache, I believe you will realize that I'm the only one who knows that,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
and that it's not absurd or meaningless for me to say that I have a headache.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
So, I'm just trying to establish the idea of intuition as not being intrinsically preposterous.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Now, Husserl was a student of Brentano, which is an interesting fact

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
because Freud was also one of Brentano's students.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And from Brentano, apparently a very influential teacher,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
he borrowed, as Freud did, the idea of intentionality.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And that's where it revolves around the proposition that the facts of mental life,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
of our psychic life, are irreducible.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
In other words, we can't talk about love and hate and hope and guilt and lust in terms of chemicals.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Freud liked the idea that ultimately we could reduce one to the other,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
but in practice he treated it as a sort of autonomous inquiry into the mind.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, something analogous is happening when we look at Husserl.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
He believes that the facts of mental life are irreducible and they're real,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
and not only are they irreducible and real, but they come first.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
In other words, what Husserl wants to do is like the project of Descartes.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
He wants to construct the self first and out of that build nature,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
rather than say the empiricist project of constructing nature first

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and then later on constructing the self.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So the self comes first, and how do you find out about yourself?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Intuition, right?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And the reason why it's important for me to establish intuition is because

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
else-wise this seems like a tremendously nebulous and sort of baggy activity,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
but in fact it potentially could be more precise than one might immediately imagine.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Now what's the problem Husserl wants to solve?

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, in one of his most accessible books, and if you intend to read Husserl,

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
which can be quite trying, I would recommend you try a Philosophy in the Crisis of European Man.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
It's published in 1936, it's written in the 1930s, and he dies in 1938.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And the reason why that's a good introduction to Husserl is because it's easier to figure out

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
what Husserl is against than it is to figure out what Husserl is for.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
And what he's against are things like historicism, relativism, psychologism,

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
scientism, and what he's gesturing at here is the whole tendency of thought since the Enlightenment,

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
which tends to move away from theological or more precisely metaphysical structures

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
towards an emphasis on the empirical external world.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Perhaps this is a homage to the rise of modern natural science,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
but Husserl says that the rise of modern natural science has misled us,

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
has caused us to misunderstand the world around us, and has put philosophy on the wrong footing.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
The result of this has been an impoverishment of our culture.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
In some ways, I would say that Husserl's concerns are fundamentally cultural.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
He's putting together this epistemological project in order to rescue us from the degeneration

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
into a sort of pure materialism.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
What Husserl thinks, at least Husserl's self-conception is,

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
that what he's doing is renewing and reviving the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition of Greek rationalism,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
where our logos, our rationality, applies to the whole domain of human experience.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Let us juxtapose that to the tradition of scientism that we see in Mach and Alvinarius

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
and all those positivistic Germans.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
There, he calls that the tradition of Democritus.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Those of you who know the Greek philosopher Democritus will know that he reduced the world to atoms and the void.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Well, in some ways, that's what modern scientific project has done,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and Husserl says that is a wrong turn.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
We have moved down an intellectual cul-de-sac there.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
So what he's trying to say is that we must go back to ourselves.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
It's very interesting to know about the things in the world external to us,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
but the real important thing is for us to know ourselves.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
And once we know ourselves, then we will be able to construct our knowledge of the external world on an indubitable foundation.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
But if we start with the external world and its contingency and its messiness and its lack of certainty,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
all our other intellectual activities, including our knowledge of ourselves,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
is going to reflect that same contingency and uncertainty.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
So while the project may not be entirely successful,

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
the problem that he's formulating is in fact reasonable and serious and ought to be taken with great care.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
So we're going to move against the general tendency of Western culture since the breakup of the Middle Ages.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
There is a decidedly scholastic element to Husserl's work as well,

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
an infinite working out of carefully constructed logical oppositions in a sort of tautological way.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
The construction of elaborate tautologies is perhaps one of the characteristic philosophical problems

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
of mathematicians who eventually become philosophers.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
What were they doing in their training?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Constructing tautologies and working out the implications of definitions.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, that's what Husserl's whole project is,

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
because he moves from the domain of space or quantity to the whole domain of human experience.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
So a noble and exciting project, let's dive into it and see if we can make some sort of sense out of it.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Husserl is worried when he's writing philosophy and the crisis of European man.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Let's think about his context.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
He was a professor at the University of Freiburg until 1933 when he was dismissed from his post because he was a Jew.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
National socialism comes in and he gets replaced by one of his students, Martin Heidegger.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
And at that time it seems clear enough to Husserl that Western culture is collapsing.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
One of the results of this Democritian tradition as opposed to the revived Platonic Aristotelian tradition

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
is that the fact value distinction emerges.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
We get various kinds of relativisms.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
We get various kinds of will-to-power, volunteeristic philosophies.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
All of these, according to Husserl, are a sign of cultural degeneration.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
And the source of this cultural degeneration is our lack of knowledge of ourselves and the world around us.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
So what he's trying to do is sort of like Ajax, I don't know if you know the Iliad,

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
but Ajax preventing the Trojans from burning the Greek ships, he stands there and will not move.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
And there is something tremendously heroic about it even though he may be fighting phantom battles.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
He thinks, at least, that what he's doing is absolutely essential to the project of our culture.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And the problem that we're going to find, or one of the problems we're going to find in this procedure of looking into ourselves

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
is that it could easily become frivolous or arbitrary.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
In other words, once I look into myself, I suppose I could tell you the immediate contents of my experience,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
but the problem is that that would be arbitrary and completely subjective.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That's not going to give us an ultimate foundation.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
So we have to do something with our looking into ourselves, with our turning inward.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
And what Husserl wants to do is use a method for examining the contents of our psyche,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
and that method will be called phenomenology.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
What he will do is something called the epoché, which is a translation of the idea of suspension.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Like Descartes, when he says, I'm going to doubt the whole external world,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
what Husserl wants to do is, first of all, suspend the whole external world.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Now, it's not that he disbelieves in it.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
He's not being skeptical of the existence of tables and chairs the way Descartes did in the discourse on method.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
He's not denying their existence.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
He's just saying that the whole external world is irrelevant.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Bracket it.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
It's a strict mathematical sense of bracketing a problem, because remember, he had his training as a mathematician.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
So we're going to bracket the problem of the external world and leave out all that stuff.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
And bracketing the external world means that we're going to leave out a great deal of human experience.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
For example, this will leave out things like cause and effect relationships.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Why? Because as Jung points out, we don't see cause and effect in the world.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We just see one thing happening after another.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
All scientific theorems will be left out.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Mathematical deductions will be left out.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
We're going to be left with the pure raw data of being a human being.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
And what Husserl thinks is that there's something common to all of us that we're going to discern there.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
You might think of it as something like this.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
You know what it is to sift out sand, to look for something hidden in us in sand?

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
What he's trying to do is sift out the contents of human experience and find out the stuff that doesn't pass through the measure of phenomenology.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
What we hold on to there will be what Husserl calls an essence.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
Some invariable necessary quality to human experience.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And when we collect these essences together and reduce them still further,

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
I think what we will get is some common oar stuff of the human psyche.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Also think of the idea of reduction.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Reduction is a funny word.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
From Latin it means to lead back.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
We're going to be led back to our original kind of primal consciousness.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Another way of thinking of reduction would be the idea of boiling down.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Imagine the consciousness is a big whale and you're going to put it in a pot and boil away all the stuff that's irrelevant

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
so that you can get to something that's essential and structural and permanent there.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
And this longing for something essential and structural and permanent,

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
can't you hear the ghost of Plato here?

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
It's the typical intellectual move of somebody that's been trained in mathematics.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
And this has had a tremendous influence on the subsequent development of continental philosophy,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
particularly people like Heidegger.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
In the process of developing this presuppositionless philosophy,

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
what we're going to find out is something like the shape of the ego's transparent cage.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
Like Kant, he's going to tell us what the necessary limitations of our experience are.

19:30.000 --> 19:39.000
And once he's done that, he will think that he has done it permanently for all of time in the way that any mathematician would.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Now, the problem is to find some certain knowledge with which to combat historicism,

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
that we get in Diltai or scientism, that we get the positivists or various kinds of relativism.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
And the way we're going to do that is by boiling down with this epoché.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And in the first case, what we'll do is we will have a sort of purified subjectivity.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
We will boil it down until we get to the essential constructs from which human minds are made.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And the result will be that authentic reality will be disclosed.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
We're going to suspend our belief in the external world and just examine what's left over.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
And what's left over after we perform this kind of an activity of reduction

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
will be these essences that are permanent and eternal.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
And he will know then the structure of the human mind.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
And these will always be, they will always have a similar set of characteristics.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
And phenomenological statements will result from this phenomenological examination

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
of the internal contents of our psyche.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
And the key thing here is that it's not empirical in the sense that I can observe that

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
and have it be an empirical activity.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
It will be descriptive, but it won't describe anything out there.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
It's going to describe exclusively the stuff that's in here.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
So it's going to be a descriptive theory of the introcosm.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And what he's looking for is absolute certainty without presuppositions

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
and it will always be about internal intentional actions.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
What he's trying to do here is derive a priori statements.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
And if you remember Kant, what an a priori statement is is it has at least two qualities.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
One, it's non-empirical.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And two, it's necessarily true.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
So what he wants to find is to generate after looking into his own psyche in this phenomenological way,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
sifting out the contingent and the arbitrary and the irrelevant,

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
is a priori certain truths about what it means to be a human being.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Kant-Uberalis once again.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Now the problem that you might want to say that after this reduction,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
what we're getting is something like immediate direct apprehension

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
of what the scholastics called universals.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
We're looking directly into the self and since the self constructs and projects the world,

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
what we're going to do is cogitate our self and bootstrap our self into some permanent reality.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Now there are many difficulties with this.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Some of them we should look at directly.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
First of all, there are very few examples in Husserl's work of actually doing this.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
One of the problems with phenomenology, the nebulous baggy quality about it,

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
is that he says that the first thing we have to do is figure out what the phenomenological method is

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
and the way we develop the phenomenological method is to use phenomenology on itself.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
To inspect yourself.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
So there's something fishy going on here.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
In order to find out what a phenomenon is, remember in Greek phenomenon is that which is disclosed,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
that which is apparent and directly known.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Well, in order to find out what a phenomenon is,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
one of the things we're going to do is reduce the idea of the phenomenon

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
to find out what that essentially is and from there we'll be able to move directly on.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
So it's a method that hopes to pull itself up by its bootstraps

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
and I have some problems logically with this activity.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Let me give you some examples to kind of flesh this out

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
and make this a little bit easier to concretely think about.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
And Husserl himself was generating things like investigations of phenomenon

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
but also ideas like number, meaning, truth, pure abstractions

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
that he believes are common to all cognitive beings

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
and in every case we end up with some sort of a circle,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
what he calls the epistemological circle

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
and at other times the methodological circle.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
The reasoning always ends up being circle

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
but of course if you're going to restrict yourself to the domain of internality

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
what else could you be doing but talking about circular things in a circular way?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Where is there to go?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
It's almost not even a circle, it's something like a point.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
It almost lacks that interior quality

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
and his method or the method that he uses more often than any other

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
because it's very difficult to figure out exactly what this amounts to

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
is what he calls free imaginative variation.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Let's see what that's like.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
That's how we search for essences

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
and what we're going to do is think of something, let's take a human being

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
as something that I'm going to do a phenomenological reduction on

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I'm going to think about that problem now, cogitating with me.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Alright, let's give this a shot.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
What we're going to do is attribute predicates to this thing, human being

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and then add and subtract them in our imagination

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
and see which of these predicates we believe we can dispense with

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and which we believe we cannot dispense with.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
And then we'll make two categories, the ones we can dispense with

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
the contingent things we're trying to get rid of, that's the sand we're sifting away

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
and the things we can dispense with which are the essences

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and that's what we'll be looking for.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Let me give you an example.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Is it true that we necessarily have to attach the following predicate to the human mind

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
that the human mind is good at math?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Is that true of every human mind?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
No, I'm bad at math.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I mean, I know for a fact that it's not true of every human mind.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm no good at math.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Let's try another one.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
The human mind forgets birthdays.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Well, it's a predicate but some human minds remember birthdays.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Talk about this one.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
The human mind is self-conscious.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Do you think you could dispense with that?

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
No, I mean, it's built right into the idea of what we mean by being a human mind.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
So what we're doing here is attributing a great number of predicates.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
One of the great problems here is it seems to me there are an infinite number of predicates

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
and we're never going to get, we're never going to finish the first thing we try and reduce,

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
much less do all the other reductions that are going to be necessary to engage in this project.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
But at least this is an instantiation of what the guy is trying to do

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
to separate the necessary from the unnecessary, the inessential from the essential predicates.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And once you have the whole list of essential predicates of a thing, now you know what it is.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And then you get these things that are defined now as their essences,

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
just the essential predicates, and then we start to boil that down again.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
And you keep on boiling until you get to complete disclosure of what it means to be a human being.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I think this is a pretty fishy way of doing this.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
I think the idea of trying to find out what it's like to be a human being inwardly

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
is an interesting thought.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
The difficulty is that in practice it's awfully hard to talk about these things.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Now, here's the first difficulty.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Truth conditions.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
How do we know which of these predicates are the essential ones?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Help me out here.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
I can imagine some which it seems fairly clear.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Triangles have to have the property of having three sides.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I can believe that.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I mean, that's not too controversial, but I can imagine cases where it wouldn't be clear,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
even among phenomenologists, and there might be a lack of agreement.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And I'm not quite sure how we go about finding that out.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And even if I just look at it from my own perspective,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
you know, leave out the social interaction between phenomenologists,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I look at it in my case and I say, alright,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
so I've decided that one of the essential predicates of human being

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
is the fact that it is self-conscious.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That's just fine.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Now, suppose I'm uncertain about that.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Well, I guess I can't be uncertain about it because I found out by introspection

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
and I'm certain of all the things that I introspect.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So I guess I can't be uncertain about that.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
But suppose I talk to one of my students and I say, kid,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
one of the essential properties of the human mind is that it's self-conscious.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Suppose he says, professor, how do you know?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And what is it? Pound the table and say, look, don't ask me how I know.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I looked inside myself and I know.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
That's not a very satisfactory answer and you get the sense that there's no real way to gesture at this.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
The difficulty that we're going to find is something like this.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I can say, look, I'll do it right now.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I intuited this yesterday.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
I looked inside myself and I found out that one of the essential properties of human being

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
is that it should be self-conscious.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And if you don't believe me, I'm going to do it now.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm going to sit here and introspect and, yeah, I'm definitely right.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I've done the phenomenological reduction.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I bracketed the world and take my word for it.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
This is really the case.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Now, we would like this to be a universal logical procedure.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
We would like this to be univocal.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
My sense is that in practice it is not.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Problem number one.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
One of the things that sort of ruins Husserl for a man

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
is if you have been exposed to Ludwig Wittgenstein before you do Husserl

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
because Wittgenstein's work is a wonderful way of dissolving these kind of problems.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
In other words, Wittgenstein says he doesn't want to talk about whether this is true or false.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
He says, look, the whole problem is misconceived

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and that's the real difficulty we have here.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And let's think about what the criticism of this is going to be.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
What Husserl thinks he's doing when he finds out what the essence of a human being is,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
he thinks he's finding out something about the universal structure of the human mind

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
and that all people have to think that because these words, these terms like human being,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
correspond to natural kinds in the world.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
And the natural kinds in the world correspond to natural categories in human cognition.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
My point is that's probably not true.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Wittgenstein will help us out here.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
Wittgenstein says, I want to lead the fly out of the fly bottle.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
Husserl is a guy walking around, or like a fly, walking around inside the fly bottle unable to get out.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Here's the problem.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Instead of essences being a quality intrinsic to the human mind,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Wittgenstein will point out that essences are a quality intrinsic to a particular language.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
So when you find out that self-consciousness is a necessary predicate for essence,

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
you're not finding out some quality about the human mind intrinsically which corresponds to essence.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
What you're finding out is about the way we use the word essence in the English language.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
So Wittgenstein, by dissolving this, could have saved...

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I mean, if you'd just been born a generation apart,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
in other words, if Wittgenstein had come a generation before instead of Husserl coming a generation before,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
he could have saved the guy an awful lot of handwriting.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Because look, the whole idea is wrong.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
There's no such thing as an essence, and what you're trying to do,

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
what you're doing is reifying language and treating it as a model of the psyche, and it's just wrong.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
There was a wonderful...

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
I mean, think about my hypothetical situation with my student, where I said,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
look, I intuited this yesterday, I did the phenomenological reduction,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm going to do it now, and believe me, this will confirm what I said yesterday

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
that the essence of human being is consciousness.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
This is a lot like what Wittgenstein said when he said, look,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
suppose you bought a newspaper and you had some doubt as to what the story meant,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
or of the truth of a given story on page one.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
How would you find out if the story was true?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Well, there are different ways you might do that, but one way that you wouldn't do that

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
is to go out and buy another copy of the same paper.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Right? Now you see the point?

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
So when I said, look, I'm going to intuit this again for you.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
What I'm doing is I'm buying another copy of the same paper.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
This doesn't tell us anything, and this can't tell us anything.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I can buy an infinite number of copies of the same paper,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
but it's still not going to tell us anything.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
See the difficulty here? He's trapped within the intracosm,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
and he can't figure out how to get out.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
And neither can I if I follow this procedure.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Now can you see why this is going to be an extremely nebulous kind of philosophy,

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
where it's going to be very hard to talk about how we move from my internal consciousness

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
to certain facts of the psyche to yours?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
The difficulty here is that when we turn inward,

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
and when we get a symbolically unmediated knowledge of anything internal to my psyche,

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
the lack of those symbols, that lack of mediation between me and these objects,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
means that it's real hard for me to talk about them later on.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
And that means that it comes very close to talking to yourself,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
and that is the opposite of what philosophy ought to be.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
In a way, that's a betrayal of the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
The idea of logos demands that knowledge not just be rational, but that it be communicable.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That's one of the canons of rationality.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
And Husserl comes up to the barriers of language,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
what Wittgenstein calls the limits of what can be said.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And he'd like to step over, but he never quite manages to do it.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So that's the kind of problem that comes up again and again and again.

30:49.000 --> 30:56.000
Now towards the end of his life, he developed the idea of the Lebenswelt, the life world,

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
and this turn is toward the imminence of human experience and human consciousness.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Let me see if I can explain this idea.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
What he wants to do is to look at the world as it appears to human beings,

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
as it is given in human experience, as opposed to the impersonal,

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
abstract experience of the world that we get from our study of modern natural science.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
In other words, science tells us, for example, that time goes on indefinitely.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Human beings don't experience time like that.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
They have a very limited span in the world.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
That's one of the big differences.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Concrete time is human time, my life.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Abstract time is just T sub 1, T sub 2, T sub n.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
It goes on forever.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
In other words, science abstracts and to that extent somewhat falsifies the reality of human experience.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
He spends a lot of time discussing his views on time and his views on internal time consciousness.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
That's the kind of thing that phenomenology would be suited to

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
if we could ever get something done out of it.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
The difficulty is this.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Husserl spends a lot of his time, most of his career, not actually doing phenomenology,

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
applying this method, but rather figuring out what this method is

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
and refining it and trying to explain how it is we're going to do something later on

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
as soon as we figure out how to do it.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
It appears, from my reading of this, which has been most unsatisfactory,

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
because the philosophy itself is, in many respects, quite nebulous.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
The best understanding I could come away with is this,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
that at some point in the indefinite future,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
we will find out precisely what this method is.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
And I mean precisely, mathematically Cartesian in that sense.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
And then after we find out precisely what the method is at some point in the indefinite future,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
we will then actually be able to apply it to something and get some results

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
at some indefinite point beyond that.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
And then after that, at some indefinite point, after we've gotten all these essences and assembled them all in a lovely array,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
then we'll have some idea of what exactly we can do with this.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
I mean, I'm told initially that the whole point of it is to give us an indubitable foundation to knowledge.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
I would hope so, but it seems like we have to act on faith to a great extent,

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
because it's very hard for him to communicate with us directly what it is that we're supposed to do with this

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
and how it is we're supposed to do it.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
The best phenomenologists dispute questions like this.

33:09.000 --> 33:15.000
A further problem that we're going to get out of this neocartesian kind of a project is the question of other minds.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Descartes always had a problem.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
I mean, he didn't have any problem explaining how he knew he existed and what his existence was like.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
But he always ran up against a sort of glass barrier when he tried to explain what grounds we have for believing in the reality of other people's psyche.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Why is this not a kind of wilderness of objects?

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
And he thinks that there are other minds, but he can't quite explain why or how,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
and Husserl is doing something very much like that.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
He says among other things that we find out about human minds through something that is phenomenologically present to us, empathy.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
Alas, he doesn't have a satisfactory phenomenological analysis of empathy.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
He kind of pounds the desk and insists that yes, there are other minds, yes, we can know them, and yes, we do so through empathy.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
And to be honest, I think that that's kind of in a pre-philosophic kind of common sense way. That's true.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I mean, how else are you going to find that about other minds?

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I don't know why we need a philosophy to tell us this.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't know why we need this elaborate procedure in order to be able to affirm that.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
I don't think that he really made any progress along those lines.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
Here's the issue. Let's drop back a little bit and think about what the difficulty we have here is.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
He wants to turn inward, and he also wants to talk.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
And the advantage of the Anglo-American tradition is that by concentrating on external stuff on the public world,

34:29.000 --> 34:36.000
it's relatively easy to say what you're talking about, to refer directly to things in the world, because they're public, they're external, they're here.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
When I turn inward, it's very hard to make these questions public.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
And here's the difficulty. The temptation that the Anglo-American tradition has is to just abolish the internal world.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
Remember, I mean, think of the idea that we get with Locke and Hume, that the psyche is a kind of an empty box, a tabula rasa,

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
and all these impressions get sent in, and then we associate them, you get that association of psychology, and that's what the mind is.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
It's a bundle of sensations.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
That is an impoverished view of human experience.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
I mean, if you stop and think about it, nobody views the world and experiences the world as a bundle of sensations.

35:08.000 --> 35:15.000
Here's the difficulty. If we follow the Anglo-American tradition and we insist on the accuracy and precision of our speech,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
all we're able to talk about is the external world.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
Their statements about what goes on inside, in other words, the Anglo-American empiricists can't make the jump from the outside in.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
And that's why the theory of the internal world is so impoverished, and it doesn't really persuade anybody.

35:30.000 --> 35:37.000
In other words, the Anglo-American tradition is a theory of the things that are easy to talk about.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
The difficulty is that there are more things on heaven and earth that are dreamt of in your philosophy.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
I have an internal life. I experience the world that way.

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
And although these things are difficult to talk about, I feel the need to say something about them, even if it is unclear and nebulous.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Can you see then what the continental response to that is?

35:57.000 --> 36:05.000
What they're going to do is sacrifice precision in order to enlarge the domain of discourse.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
It is possible to truncate the domain of discourse, as the Anglo-American tradition does,

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
and you get an increased resolution in the precision of your speech,

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
but this resolution costs a very high price. You lose all of internal reality.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
You lose the internal world. They deny there is an internal world.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
What that sort of procedure will lead to is something like behavioral psychology,

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
Pavlov and Watson and Skinner, where there is no mind to talk about.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
Now here is the difficulty. If you follow that sort of a scientific Anglo-American path,

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
what you're going to get is a very elegant and precise set of verbal canons,

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
which account for the world around us, but don't do a very good job of telling you about yourself.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
And what Husserl and the Cartesians of various stripes will say is that,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
if you don't know yourself, how are you going to know the world?

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
Or what the Delphi says, know thyself? It's a precondition for knowledge.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
On the other hand, if you want to stay on the inside,

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
the difficulty is that we are unable to get even the most basic

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
or foundational gestures at this content across to other people.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
I know very well about my internal mental states.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I have a hard time getting them across to you.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Much of Ludwig Wittgenstein's work was an attempt to bridge this gap,

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
but it's very, very difficult and at least mysterious and startling formations.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
What Husserl did, kind of pounding on the desk in a kind of Cartesian way,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
is to construct the idea of intersubjectivity.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
In other words, the way in which these phenomenological psyches,

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
these transcendental egos communicate with each other is,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
or the matrix in which they communicate with each other,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
is his idea of intersubjectivity,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
an idea which is never completely or clearly defined.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
It allows us to form a sort of linguistic or verbal community with other minds.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
I kind of naively believe that there is such a thing,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
but he isn't able to give any very satisfactory account of it,

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
and the reason why is the structure I was gesturing at just a little while ago.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
All these continental guys, if you look at yourself,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
it's hard to break out of this solipsistic circle.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
If you start on the outside, the problem is you can't get into your own mind,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
and you started out as a mind, there are problems with both sides.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
What I'm trying to do here is something like this.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Not to vindicate or justify Husserl,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
because I think there probably isn't going to work.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
In many respects, you may want to think of Husserl as being German romanticism,

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
Cartesianized, the lonely ego of Schiller or Goethe,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
given a sort of mathematical Cartesian formulation,

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
and he insists in a kind of romantic way that I am a self,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I know I am conscious, and I can't doubt that.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
That's the fact of the matter.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
On this rock, I will build my church.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Well, I can see how you might have a certain desire to do that.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
My problem is that we're always going to end up either talking to ourselves

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
or constructing arbitrary, commonsensical bridges

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
from our philosophical solipsism into the regular world of everyday practice.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
That's built into the idea of this project that all the continental thinkers are involved with.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
What I'm asking for, in some respects,

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
is that you cut the continental philosophers a little bit of slack

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
because of the fact that the project they have undertaken is probably impossible.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
It may well be just impossible to talk about the internal facts of my psychic states.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Or it is so with a great deal of difficulty and a great deal of cloudiness.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
It is not any particular problem with Husserl or any specific philosopher.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
It is built into that kind of project of bridging this gap

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
between what's inside and what's outside.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
But here's the alternative.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
We can go to the Anglo-American tradition.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Professor Staloff and I have this argument essentially all the time,

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
because neither one is completely satisfactory.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Well, if you start out with the external world,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
you're never going to get a sense of yourself,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
you're never going to be able to talk about these internal facts,

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
and that means that you will have to impoverish the vocabulary of our experience.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
In other words, the problem with Hume or with any of these Anglo-American appearances

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
is that I just don't experience the world like that.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
And I think that that's a very fair objection.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Let me give you an example.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
There's an analogy here, and this would perhaps make this whole difference

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
between the Anglo-Americans and the Continentals more apparent.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
Let's try the idea of going to a tailor and getting a suit of clothes.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
It's a simple everyday thing.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
You go to a tailor, and he measures you,

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
and you come back next week, and you've got your suit of clothes.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And you put on the jacket, and you find out the jacket only has one arm.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
The tailor says, well, if your jacket only has one arm, your body is wrong.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
And the customer might well say, well, no, no, hold it.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Let me get this straight now.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
My body is wrong, and your suit is right.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
That's insane. I mean, that's not the idea here.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
In other words, my body starts out being right.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I'm sure that this is how I'm shaped.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
And that if you only have one sleeve in your jacket, change the jacket.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
The jacket is wrong, not my body.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
And if the tailor says, no, that's absurd of you.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You really have to remove that arm.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
That's crazy. I'm not removing my arm.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
You're definitely putting another arm to this jacket.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
In other words, do we change our body to suit our jacket?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
We change our jacket to suit our body.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Now let me suggest that our body is the set of our experiences,

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
and that the jacket is the philosophical theory with which we account for them.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
You really want to cut off your experience of cause and effect,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
of good and evil, of lust and rage and hatred and beauty,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
because you can't talk about them precisely.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
Or is this demand for philosophical precision taken to an unreasonable extreme?

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
In other words, when A.J. Ayer,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
that has the view that, say, more moral theory is non-cognitive.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
Well, I experience morals at least sometimes as being real and right and wrong.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
If these Anglo-American guys, these real hard-shell empiricists,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
tell me that my experience is wrong, it's like the tailor telling me my body's wrong.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Don't tell me that I'm experiencing the world wrong.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
No, your theory is wrong.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
And if it doesn't correspond to my experience, then fix the theory.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Don't tell me to fix my experience.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
My experience comes first.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Now can you see the strength of Husserl's point?

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
This is a devastating sort of an argument.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And in my view, it's actually true.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
In other words, I think that Husserl's attempt to find a way out of this labyrinth just doesn't work.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
He's spinning his wheels, he's caught in a snowdrift.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
But the idea of telling to these scientific, empirical, rational, logical guys

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
that if your theory doesn't correspond to my experience, your theory is wrong, not my experience,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I think that's right on the money.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And I think that's the strong point of all continental philosophies.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
They say, I'm going to look at myself in the way I experience the world first.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
And if your theory corresponds to that and accounts for that, so be it.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
If it doesn't, I am not going to say, well, look, I'll give up on beauty, I'll give up on morality,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
I'll give up on all my psychic states, all my emotions,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
because after all, either I talk about them clearly or I don't talk about them at all.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
No, this demand for clarity has been taken to an unreasonable extreme.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
It will be much better for us if we were to start with experience,

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
or as Husserl's slogan was, to the things themselves.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Well, modify that a bit. Let's start with experience.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Let's make our slogan experience first, me first.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And then I'll construct my world around that.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I'm not going to construct myself around the world. That's insane.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
It's like changing my body to suit my suit. That's crazy.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
This is the strong point of Husserl.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
And if it doesn't ultimately offer us intuition of the essence of being,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
whatever it is that he's trying to do here,

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
if it doesn't offer us the ultimate structure of human cognition,

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
it does make an important point against the problem that Western philosophy has drifted into.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
It makes the point that I come first.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And that's what phenomenology is.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
If you leave out all the verbiage and the elaborate intellectual apparatus that he constructs,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
it all proceeds from the basic intuition that my experience is right.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
And any theory that tells me my experience is mistaken is, fundamentally,

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
it has a cart before the horse.

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
And I think that's what holds together the whole tradition of continental philosophy in the 20th century.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
This will be true for Husserl, but it's also going to be true for Heidegger.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
It's going to be true for Bergson.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
It's going to be true for all these guys that start out looking at themselves.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
And if they get nebulous and fuzzy, well, that's just built into the problem.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
Another analogy that we can bring to this is that it's like singing.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
The precision of our diction costs something.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
The precision of our thinking and speech costs something.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
We can loosen up the diction so that it's not so precise what we're saying,

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
but we can gain in range.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
We can hit the high notes intellectually.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And I think that talking about right and wrong and talking about beauty

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and talking about the really important things psychically,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
those are the high notes of philosophy.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
And the problem is that the empiricists can't hit those notes.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
They have better diction than I do, but you can hit the high notes like this.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And this is what it's for.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
And so for all the nebulous and dubious and perhaps even mystical qualities

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
that we find in Husserl, this is a serious and worthwhile attempt

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
to account for what it means to be an ego in the 20th century.
