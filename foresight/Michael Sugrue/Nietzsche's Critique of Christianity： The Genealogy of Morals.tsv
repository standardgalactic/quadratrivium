0	28080	["Pomp and Circumstance"]
28080	36080	Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the most important philosophers in the tradition of Western thought.
36080	44080	He's one of the most artistic and ruthless and fascinating individuals in the intellectual history of the West.
44080	48080	He viewed himself as being the end of the Western intellectual tradition.
48080	52080	He saw himself as the destroyer of metaphysics.
52080	56080	He saw himself as the destroyer of Christianity.
56080	62080	He saw himself as a combination philosopher-artist in the tradition of Plato.
62080	67080	And he offered a comprehensive critique of the Western intellectual tradition,
67080	74080	not conceived merely or narrowly as a philosophical tradition, but as a cultural tradition.
74080	78080	Nietzsche, more than anyone else, was a philosopher of culture.
78080	81080	He offered criticism of every element in Western culture,
81080	85080	and his criticism is noteworthy for its refusal to compromise,
85080	90080	for his insistence that we get to the psychological heart of things.
90080	96080	What I'd like to talk about in this lecture is Nietzsche's treatment of Christianity and morality,
96080	102080	two of the central questions for most philosophers in the Western tradition,
102080	108080	and particularly important for Nietzsche because although he is something of a megalomaniac,
108080	113080	there's a certain amount of truth to the argument that he is, in fact, the Antichrist.
113080	120080	He, in fact, called himself the Antichrist more than once, and he wrote a book called The Antichrist.
120080	123080	And what he hoped to do was to get beyond Christianity.
123080	130080	He quite literally thought that he was going to supplant Jesus in the Western tradition,
130080	132080	which is quite a tall order.
132080	137080	Not many people have that sort of ambition, but Nietzsche was never a shrinking violet,
137080	141080	and in fact, he wanted to offer a new set of values.
141080	144080	He wished to offer a new cultural orientation to the West,
144080	148080	or perhaps to revive an old cultural orientation in the West.
148080	156080	And he wished to make us confront the half-truths, the lies, the evasions,
156080	161080	that are characteristic of almost everyone's life and thought.
161080	165080	Now, he wrote several books that criticized morality.
165080	170080	In some respects, the tradition of Western ethics is his main target.
170080	175080	And perhaps the most intriguing of these books, or one of the most intriguing of these books,
175080	178080	is called Beyond Good and Evil.
178080	183080	Now, getting beyond good and evil is a rather unusual activity for a philosopher,
183080	186080	particularly one concerned with morals,
186080	190080	but Nietzsche wants to take an extremely skeptical,
190080	196080	an extremely naturalistic approach to moral theory and moral valuation,
196080	202080	and he wishes to offer a criticism of Christianity and the values that it represents,
202080	207080	and in addition to supplant that with a new code of morals.
207080	210080	Nietzsche asks an important question,
210080	216080	that everyone living in this modern age, this one-world, anti-metaphysical age,
216080	223080	has to confront, which is, where does Christianity and its moral values come from?
223080	229080	How is it that human beings conceived of as animals, as featherless bipeds?
229080	232080	How is it that they come to have a thing called a conscience?
232080	234080	How is it that they make judgments of good and evil,
234080	239080	which is not characteristic of fish or birds or reptiles?
239080	243080	What is it about human beings, which causes them to construct moral systems,
243080	247080	which are in some respects the antithesis of nature?
247080	255080	Why is it that we feel the desire to conflict with nature and make judgments that nature never does?
255080	260080	Nietzsche thinks that he finds the answer in the psyche of the human individual,
260080	263080	and he thinks that we are very peculiar animals,
263080	275080	animals with strange attributes, which are natural and which are part of the human condition.
275080	282080	But in fact, Nietzsche says that most of our elevation of ourselves beyond nature,
282080	291080	beyond simple facticity, is a kind of spurious raising of ourselves outside of and above nature.
291080	293080	The German term for this is Zonderstellung.
293080	297080	What that means is other position, a position somehow outside of nature.
297080	301080	Nietzsche wants us to confront the fact that we are animals, that we are part of nature,
301080	305080	and that our moral judgments are in fact part of that natural process.
305080	310080	In looking at Christianity, Nietzsche goes back to the actual history of Christianity
310080	314080	and asks, what is it that Christian morals represent?
314080	316080	Whose interests do they serve?
316080	318080	And why are these interests disguised?
318080	325080	What is it about the moral judgment's characteristic of Christianity that needs to be disguised?
325080	330080	What is it, in other words, that's a lie in Christian morals?
330080	332080	Remarkable question.
332080	336080	Nietzsche's answer is that there are two kinds of morality,
336080	342080	and Christianity only represents one particular perspective on judgments of good and evil.
342080	345080	And this perspective is the perspective of the herd.
346080	349080	Nietzsche contrasts two kinds of morals,
349080	356080	herd morals, morals that are characteristic of the weak, the feeble, the inferior, the enslaved,
356080	358080	which is to say Christianity,
358080	364080	and master morals, morals of warriors, the predatory human beings,
364080	368080	who make judgments on the basis of their strength rather than their weakness.
368080	374080	Nietzsche wishes to supplant the herd morals characteristic of Christianity,
374080	379080	characteristic of Western culture for the previous 2,000 years, with a new morals,
379080	382080	morals that hearkens back to the age of the Homeric hero,
382080	386080	which hearkens back to the aristocratic warrior elite,
386080	388080	which is found all over the world,
388080	391080	which creates values out of nothing,
391080	396080	and which glories in the fact that their judgments can be enforced in this world,
396080	400080	independent of any metaphysical construct.
401080	405080	Now, Nietzsche asks, who was it that created Christianity?
405080	410080	Well, it's an outgrowth of Judaism, and Judaism is a priestly religion.
410080	412080	Christianity is an extension of that.
412080	418080	And Christianity in its earliest historical phases appeals to the slave class in Rome.
418080	423080	In fact, Christianity is the revolt of the oppressed masses in Rome.
424080	429080	And Nietzsche argues that Christianity and its myths was organized
429080	437080	so as to articulate the perspective of the slaves, of the inferior, of the feeble.
437080	441080	And it was a way of having revenge upon masters,
441080	443080	having revenge upon warriors,
443080	446080	having revenge upon those who could oppress them,
446080	451080	and turning the tables by offering a scale of values that was different from
451080	456080	and independent of that of the master class.
456080	460080	Nietzsche says that the slaves have their revenge,
460080	465080	and the triumph of Christianity in the West amounts to the triumph of the slave,
465080	470080	of the inferior, of the weak and impoverished.
470080	475080	Think about the ideas or the myths that underlie Christianity.
475080	479080	The idea that even in this world, if there's no justice,
479080	486080	there's another world, heaven and hell, where God's eternal justice gives everyone what they deserve.
486080	492080	Nietzsche says that what this, in fact, is, is the frustration, the impotence,
492080	496080	the anger of slaves transformed into a myth,
496080	502080	which allows them to get their revenge on those that oppress them,
502080	506080	if not in this world, at least in an unreal world,
507080	512080	which offers them some solace in a world of pain and misery.
512080	518080	Nietzsche contrasts the morality of Christianity with the morality of the Romans.
518080	522080	The Romans were fierce, independent, warlike men
522080	526080	who made their own scale of values based upon power,
526080	529080	based upon the desire to dominate,
529080	533080	and they showed no reluctance to inflict pain on those they viewed as inferior.
533080	537080	And here inferior means not morally inferior in the Christian sense,
537080	541080	but physically inferior in terms of practical strength.
541080	548080	Nietzsche's new alternative to Christianity will be a resuscitation of the warlike values of the ancient world,
548080	554080	and what he hopes will come out of this will be an evaluation of Christianity,
554080	556080	which allows us to get beyond Christianity,
556080	565080	and the one who is going to succeed Christ as the central figure in western moral theory will be Nietzsche himself.
565080	569080	He frequently signed himself as the Antichrist, or as Dionysus,
569080	575080	another incarnation of the Nietzschean judgment of good and evil.
575080	584080	And in doing this, he raises very disturbing questions about the kind of moral judgments that we make
584080	586080	that are still characteristic of this culture,
586080	591080	and the difficulty of maintaining the traditional judgments of good and evil, characteristic of the West,
591080	597080	in an age in which religion and theology are taken less and less seriously.
597080	601080	Now let's think about the idea of getting beyond good and evil.
601080	604080	Nietzsche contrasts the slave and the master moralities,
604080	609080	and he says what's characteristic of Christianity is the distinction between good and evil.
610080	617080	Good, in the Christian sense, means kindness, lovingness, pity, essentially.
617080	620080	Nietzsche thinks that Christian morality is a morality of pity,
620080	630080	which raises to a spurious level of distinction, feeling for the weak, the inferior, and the impoverished.
630080	634080	We might contrast this with the master morality, which doesn't distinguish between good and evil,
634080	637080	in fact it distinguishes between good and bad,
637080	642080	in the sense of capable or incapable, potent or impotent.
642080	650080	That's a totally different judgment of value from that characteristic of Christianity.
650080	656080	And in fact, this is the scale of values, this master morality,
656080	661080	is the one which Nietzsche expects will produce the highest type of human being.
661080	665080	Nietzsche holds the view, which at least in part is borrowed from Darwin,
665080	668080	that human beings have no intrinsic value.
668080	674080	If you remember that one of the great breakthroughs, or one of the great contributions of Christianity to the West,
674080	677080	is the idea that all souls are equal in the sight of God,
677080	683080	and that all people are equally value on some level, regardless of what their particular skills or capacities are,
683080	685080	well, Nietzsche says that's a mistake.
685080	688080	What that is is the revenge of those that can't do anything.
688080	692080	And Nietzsche says, if we are ever going to produce anything great in this culture,
692080	695080	if we are ever going to produce anything significant in this culture,
695080	698080	we must get away from the idea that other people really matter.
698080	702080	The only elements in the human species, which are important,
702080	705080	are the half dozen great geniuses in any culture.
705080	709080	And he says that Christianity inhibits the development of genius.
709080	714080	It inhibits the development of creativity because it is envious.
714080	719080	It is a way of mythologizing the envy of those that are incapable,
719080	723080	of those that don't have much in the way of capacity.
723080	728080	And Nietzsche says, if we are to get beyond that, then we must get beyond this morality of pity.
728080	732080	We must get beyond good and evil back or forward, if you want,
732080	738080	to the idea that good and bad are the main standards of our moral judgment.
738080	745080	So there will be none of the conscientiousness characteristic of Christianity,
745080	749080	none of the worry about heaven and hell, about God's judgment.
749080	753080	This good and bad morality, this master morality,
753080	755080	will be strictly oriented towards this world.
755080	759080	It will not be caught up with the problem of conscience.
759080	764080	It will not primarily be concerned with the state of one's soul
764080	767080	so much as it will be concerned with the state of one's achievements.
767080	772080	Nietzsche's judgment of good and bad, this master morality,
772080	776080	is oriented towards doing things, the masters of those that achieve.
776080	779080	And this is not necessarily to be taken into political sense,
779080	781080	although it can be taken into political sense.
781080	784080	Master moralities can also be the moralities of the artist.
784080	789080	Master moralities can also be the morality of the thinker.
789080	794080	But it has to be the kind of thinker or the kind of artist who despises mere mediocrity,
794080	799080	who wants to go beyond and formulate something in this world
799080	803080	that creates a justification for his entire society.
803080	806080	As Nietzsche says, in the use and abuse of history,
806080	811080	mankind can only be judged by its highest examples.
811080	815080	The average human being has no value, whatever.
815080	821080	Now, Nietzsche also inquires into the differences
821080	826080	between the warrior aristocrat who generates the master morality
826080	832080	and the priest, and the psychology of the priest is of great concern to Nietzsche.
832080	837080	Nietzsche believes that the priestly type and the warrior aristocrat
837080	840080	are both, in fact, superior kinds of men.
840080	845080	One type is the individual, the Nietzschean hero,
845080	847080	who's going to adopt the master morality.
847080	851080	The most dangerous opponent to the Nietzschean hero,
851080	855080	the man who adopts this master morality, is the priest.
855080	859080	The priest is the opposite of the warrior type.
859080	865080	And Nietzsche believes that the origin of this distinction lies in the human psyche,
865080	870080	that psychological differences are what distinguish these two.
870080	879080	Now, both the warrior and the priest have different kinds of the will to power.
879080	881080	They just express this will to power differently.
881080	886080	Nietzsche thinks, in fact, that all human beings can be characterized by their desire
886080	891080	to dominate themselves, to dominate their environment, and to dominate other people.
891080	895080	This puts Nietzsche squarely in the tradition of the Sophists,
895080	901080	do you think of Calakles and Gorgias in the Platonic dialogues?
901080	905080	He's also in the line of Machiavelli, Saad,
905080	908080	all of those people who adopt an atheistic perspective
908080	913080	and who believe that human life is caught up with the desire to dominate others
913080	918080	and to satisfy one's desires to the maximum extent, Nietzsche supports that idea.
918080	921080	Now, the warrior does it in a very straightforward way.
921080	924080	The warrior takes what he wants without any qualms of conscience.
924080	928080	Conscience is an afterthought invented at a much later date.
928080	932080	The warrior just comes in and does what he does because that is his nature.
932080	934080	The strong and the weak is the natural distinction.
934080	937080	Good and evil is an anti-natural distinction.
937080	940080	And if you think about it, there may be a certain grain of truth in this.
940080	941080	Think of it this way.
941080	944080	Think of the distinction between hawks and sparrows.
944080	950080	Sparrows eat grains or seeds or whatever and they're inoffensive birds
950080	952080	and there are quite many of them.
952080	956080	But in fact, there's nothing better about eating what sparrows eat
956080	958080	as compared to what hawks eat.
958080	962080	We don't make moral judgments about hawks and say that they ought not to eat sparrows.
962080	966080	We just recognize that in nature, different things feed in different ways
966080	970080	and predatory behavior is no worse and no better than any other behavior.
970080	973080	Nature just is what it is.
973080	976080	Nietzsche wants to force us back into nature.
976080	981080	He wants us to reevaluate our disapproval of the human hawks.
981080	988080	In fact, Nietzsche thinks that we have no more right to judge a warrior or an aristocrat evil
988080	990080	than we have a right to judge a hawk evil.
990080	993080	And he in fact thinks it doesn't make any more sense.
993080	998080	The world of nature, red and fang and claw, just is what it is.
998080	1002080	And as Nietzsche puts it in a beautiful passage, he says,
1002080	1004080	There are no moral phenomena.
1004080	1007080	There are only moral interpretations of phenomena.
1007080	1010080	A very profound idea.
1010080	1013080	Well, whose values are built into Christianity?
1013080	1017080	The values of the herd, the values of the weak.
1017080	1021080	And that's why it caught on among the underclass in Rome.
1021080	1027080	And the entire history of Western ethics has been extrapolations from this herd morality
1027080	1030080	which has inhibited the development of our culture.
1030080	1036080	If we were to go beyond that, we would have to allow for the fact that cruelty may not be an evil.
1036080	1039080	That pity may be a vice.
1039080	1044080	That the desire to dominate other people may be the highest expression of human being,
1044080	1048080	rather than its worst example.
1048080	1055080	And in that respect, Nietzsche is not only connected to Machiavelli and to Saad and to this office,
1055080	1058080	but if any of you are familiar with the work of Dostoevsky,
1058080	1062080	particularly something like crime and punishment, the idea of the singular man,
1062080	1065080	the man that's going to stand outside of good and evil,
1065080	1067080	and Raskolnikov commits that murder,
1067080	1070080	much the same issues are being discussed in that novel.
1070080	1074080	The question of whether, in fact, moral judgment is universal,
1074080	1078080	or whether it's an arbitrary series of conventions designed by the weak
1078080	1081080	to oppress the strong, strangely enough.
1081080	1086080	Now, in a book called The Genealogy of Morals, he tries to figure out
1086080	1088080	how it is we got into this predicament,
1088080	1093080	how it is we came to the point where the inferior and the weak
1093080	1095080	could start to make our moral judgments.
1095080	1101080	And he says, first of all, that the initial moral judgments that human beings made
1101080	1106080	came from the warrior aristocrats who imposed their will on the world.
1106080	1109080	This is not only his model of the warrior aristocrats,
1109080	1112080	also in some respects his model of the artist.
1112080	1114080	Think about, and his arguments are very interesting.
1114080	1118080	Nietzsche was a philologist and a professor of classical languages,
1118080	1122080	and he derives most of his arguments from an inquiry into Latin and German words
1122080	1124080	and what their origins might have been.
1124080	1127080	Now, since I can't presuppose that you know Latin and German,
1127080	1131080	let's try English just to see if, in fact, there's some evidence for this,
1131080	1133080	and I think there is.
1133080	1135080	Think about what a noble action is.
1135080	1137080	What makes an action noble?
1137080	1139080	Well, we know that a noble action is a good one.
1139080	1142080	If you look it up in the dictionary, you'll find that it's a term of approval.
1142080	1148080	Is it coincidental that nobility is also a section of the social structure
1148080	1150080	in ancient societies?
1150080	1154080	Consider the distinction between a noble action and a base action.
1154080	1156080	Who do you think the base are?
1156080	1161080	The base are, in fact, the inferior, the weak, those that take orders rather than give them.
1161080	1166080	The distinction between noble and base suggests that maybe our judgments of value
1166080	1172080	at the time when these words were coined are, in fact, simply the judgments of important warriors
1172080	1176080	contrasted with the judgments of people that have to suffer and put up with them.
1176080	1180080	Consider the distinction between being mean and being noble.
1180080	1184080	Well, being mean is a very bad thing nowadays to be mean,
1184080	1188080	but there was a time when to be mean meant that you were essentially a villain.
1188080	1192080	Villain means peasant in its origins.
1192080	1194080	Give that some thought.
1194080	1197080	Nietzsche has a very profound argument here.
1197080	1204080	Think about something like coming from a good family and coming from a bad family.
1204080	1205080	Yes, indeed.
1205080	1211080	Again, the judgments of power, characteristic of predatory warrior aristocrats,
1211080	1218080	were the actual source, according to Nietzsche, of our judgments of good and evil.
1218080	1223080	To be mean, to be base, to be a villain meant that you were bad.
1223080	1228080	To be noble, to be high-minded as opposed to low-minded, to have high moral standards
1228080	1232080	as opposed to low moral standards, ask yourself where they came from.
1232080	1236080	Nietzsche was the first man to force himself to consider the possibility
1236080	1241080	that what we take to be universal moral distinctions applicable to everyone
1241080	1245080	are, in fact, a disguised form of the will to power,
1245080	1251080	a way for the weak and the impotent to get back at the superior
1251080	1257080	by changing these aristocratic valuations, by moving from good and bad to good and evil.
1257080	1265080	In other words, the invention of evil was a way for the oppressed to strike back at the superior.
1265080	1267080	Nietzsche wants to erase that.
1267080	1270080	He says that's a mistake in Western culture.
1270080	1278080	That's a hole or a gap or an inferior part of the Western tradition.
1278080	1285080	And if we want to produce superior human beings, then we have to free them from the shackles of slave morality.
1285080	1292080	We have to prevent them from being undermined in their achievements or undermined in their aspirations
1292080	1298080	by creating in them the conscience, a conscience which prevents them from achieving what they could.
1298080	1302080	Now, here's another very interesting question, and it's very hard to answer.
1302080	1305080	Nietzsche offers us a very provocative conception.
1305080	1309080	Where does conscience come from and what is it?
1309080	1311080	Think about that for a moment.
1311080	1317080	If, in fact, human beings are animals, and I think that Darwin has conclusively shown that to be the case,
1317080	1322080	why are we the only animal with a conscience and where does it come from and what is it?
1322080	1324080	Very difficult question.
1324080	1327080	Nietzsche's argument is something like this.
1327080	1333080	Human beings have a natural desire to achieve power.
1333080	1337080	The will to power, that is characteristic of what makes people go.
1337080	1342080	And the usual route that the will to power takes is the desire to dominate other people.
1342080	1351080	There is a natural ruthlessness in people, a desire to take advantage of others, and it pleases people to cause pain.
1351080	1356080	Hard thing for us to swallow perhaps in these days, but with the degree of pain in the world
1356080	1362080	and the degree of evil that we see, to use a word that I might italicize, there may well be something to it.
1362080	1369080	If, in fact, people do like to create pain in others, of course, usually not themselves,
1369080	1372080	what happens when you frustrate this desire?
1372080	1375080	What happens when you say you can't enslave other people?
1375080	1378080	You can't kill other people and take their possessions?
1378080	1381080	You can't oppress other people because we will stop you?
1381080	1385080	Well, Nietzsche says, and this is a fascinating possibility, although I'm not certain if it's true,
1385080	1390080	he says that when people are frustrated in their desire to cause pain to others,
1390080	1395080	the consequence of that is that they decide to start imposing pain on themselves.
1395080	1404080	And this pain that they pose on themselves is called conscience, a horrifying possibility.
1404080	1410080	In German, the term for the pang of conscience is called Gewissenbisse, which means the bite of conscience.
1410080	1414080	And Nietzsche says essentially that people are predatory animals,
1414080	1417080	and if they can't bite other people, they bite themselves.
1417080	1426080	And when they begin to torture themselves, they find the last possible outlet for this desire to impose pain on the world.
1426080	1430080	If they can't do it to other people, they'll do it to themselves.
1430080	1436080	Now, this bite of conscience gets progressively worse when priests come on the scene,
1436080	1438080	when the priestly type comes on the scene.
1438080	1443080	It goes from inferior to even more inferior,
1443080	1449080	because the priests harness slave morality, they harness this morality of the herd,
1449080	1451080	and they use it for their own purposes.
1451080	1455080	The priests are the highest example of the herd animal, of the herd type.
1455080	1458080	They have a special set of morals that they keep for themselves,
1458080	1466080	and then they rule the herd using various kinds of myths and various kinds of verbal techniques
1466080	1473080	so that they can have their revenge, and so that they can oppose the warrior type.
1473080	1480080	Nietzsche sees among the highest types of human beings an intrinsic conflict between the priest and the warrior.
1480080	1486080	Nietzsche thinks that the warrior is the kind of person that knows how to forget things.
1486080	1489080	Again, this is an interesting psychological profile,
1489080	1493080	and there are many, incidentally, if you read the genealogy of morals and beyond good and evil,
1493080	1496080	you'll find that there are many anticipations of Freud,
1496080	1500080	especially the question of conscience and the question of resentment.
1500080	1505080	Nietzsche thinks that resentment, the hatred of being oppressed, is the source of slave moralities,
1505080	1510080	and that the priest takes that resentment, formulates it in a mythological way,
1510080	1515080	and uses that to orchestrate and control the herd so that they can be opposed to any superiority
1515080	1520080	among those that would break moral rules, among the would-be warriors.
1521080	1528080	What makes the priestly type so dangerous is the fact that they can dominate culture
1528080	1533080	and that they have chosen the wrong path, they have chosen the slave moralities,
1533080	1535080	and they have absolutized that.
1535080	1543080	The consequence of absolutizing that is that it seems that there is no possibility of reintroducing master morality
1543080	1549080	without a complete and thoroughgoing critique of the culture, and that is what Nietzsche thinks he is.
1549080	1553080	That's what it means for Nietzsche to be the Antichrist.
1553080	1559080	He's not just the Antichrist in some mythological sense, he literally takes that as a mark of distinction.
1559080	1562080	It shows just what a free thinker he is.
1562080	1565080	Nietzsche is willing to say, not only is he the Antichrist,
1565080	1569080	but that he thinks that that's the best development in culture since the time of Jesus.
1569080	1575080	It's about time that we got back to our morality which would allow for the development of superior people.
1576080	1580080	Now, Nietzsche's argument here is very disturbing.
1580080	1582080	It's disturbing in its consequences.
1582080	1585080	It's disturbing because it kind of rocks the moral boat for us.
1585080	1588080	But Nietzsche's critique goes even further than this.
1588080	1593080	He wants to investigate not just the question of pain and people's desire to impose pain on others,
1593080	1595080	and if not on others than on themselves,
1595080	1599080	he wants to look at the arguments about suffering made by the priests.
1599080	1604080	Christianity, if you remember, holds the view that God is providential,
1604080	1610080	that he supervises the entire world, and that I believe the phrase is not a sparrow falls but God knows about it.
1610080	1618080	Well, Nietzsche thinks that this myth was invented so that suffering could be justified and could be explained.
1618080	1621080	And in some respects, there's a certain amount of truth in that,
1621080	1627080	that part of what Christianity does is explain, or at least explain away, the fact of human suffering
1627080	1632080	by saying that God doubtless has some plan, although we don't know what that plan is,
1632080	1637080	it surely is there because the kind of God we've decided to construct, the kind of God we believe in,
1637080	1643080	is the kind of God, he's a good God, a loving God, the kind of God that would never do anything evil.
1643080	1648080	Since he would never do anything evil, the suffering that you get must have a meaning.
1648080	1653080	And Nietzsche thinks the worst thing that the priestly element ever did to human culture
1653080	1657080	was to sell people on the idea that suffering has meaning.
1657080	1662080	Nietzsche says that the entire world is completely meaningless, that the world is moral chaos,
1662080	1669080	that suffering has no meaning, and the idea that suffering has meaning just makes suffering infinitely worse.
1669080	1672080	It's not hard to see why.
1672080	1678080	It was bad when weak, feeble people had to put up with the strong,
1678080	1683080	had to put up with having things stolen from them, with being murdered and raped and tortured.
1683080	1689080	That was bad because of simple physical pain for the reason that any natural calamity is bad.
1689080	1695080	But the priestly idea of attaching a meaning to this suffering makes it all that much worse,
1695080	1700080	because if there is a God in heaven who is in fact supervising this entire procedure,
1700080	1706080	the reason why suffering must follow us, why evil must befall us, lies in ourselves.
1706080	1710080	We are somehow responsible for it. We brought it upon ourselves.
1710080	1714080	What does this mean? This infinitely increases our suffering,
1714080	1720080	because not only are the weak and the feeble still being tortured and killed and raped and maimed,
1720080	1723080	but in addition to that, it's their fault.
1723080	1726080	What a horrible turnaround.
1726080	1730080	What a dreadful addition to the suffering they already have.
1730080	1736080	After you recover from a terrible encounter with warrior aristocrats, with those who are beyond good and evil,
1736080	1742080	then you must live with the fact that you brought it on yourself and guilt enters the world.
1742080	1748080	After the superior, after the strong, after the ruthless have finished with you,
1748080	1752080	after they've caused their modicum of pain, you have to add to it.
1752080	1757080	The bite of conscience means you're going to impose pain on yourself.
1757080	1765080	This development is one of the worst turning points in the history of Western culture, according to Nietzsche.
1765080	1774080	And in that respect, Nietzsche believes that he is liberating us from the shackles of a self-imposed misery.
1774080	1781080	And for all his madness, there is a certain degree of coherence in this argument.
1781080	1787080	And it is hard to know where he's correct, how much of this we should accept,
1787080	1793080	and how much of it is just speculation that we could never really have much of an idea about.
1793080	1796080	So let's stop and think about it for a second.
1796080	1804080	My suspicion is that Nietzsche is probably wrong in his argument that good and bad come,
1804080	1810080	or that our judgments of good and bad and good and evil come from the distinction exclusively of masters and slaves.
1810080	1815080	Probably the distinction between good and bad is much older than aristocratic social structures,
1815080	1820080	which are relatively late in human development, maybe two or three thousand BC for the most part.
1820080	1824080	What it most likely is attached to is feelings of pleasure and pain.
1824080	1830080	My guess is, again, just speculating Allah and Nietzsche, which should be very much in the Nietzschean tradition,
1830080	1836080	that probably a full stomach was a good feeling, and going hungry was a bad feeling.
1836080	1840080	Probably breaking your leg was a bad feeling, and being healthy was a good feeling.
1840080	1847080	And these may well go before judgments of good and bad based upon aristocratic social structures.
1847080	1856080	But the fact remains that after these initial judgments of pleasure and pain got turned into our judgments of moral value,
1856080	1863080	there is a superimposed layer of aristocratic moral judgments in our culture and in our language.
1863080	1867080	I think that the distinction between noble and base, between noble and mean,
1867080	1873080	between high moral values and low moral values establishes that with a good degree of plausibility.
1874080	1877080	Now, what are we to make of this judgment?
1877080	1880080	What happens when we go beyond good and evil?
1880080	1883080	And this is a delicate and difficult question.
1883080	1890080	Nietzsche, in a book called The Antichrist, which he modestly named after himself, one would think,
1890080	1895080	he describes his procedure as philosophizing with a hammer.
1895080	1901080	And that's a very intriguing idea, because it shows the destructiveness of his philosophy, the skepticism of it,
1901080	1904080	and the gleeful malice that's in it.
1904080	1913080	And I think it's worth considering the fact that philosophizing with a hammer very easily shades over into intellectual vandalism.
1913080	1917080	And it may be that not everything that can be broken ought to be broken,
1917080	1927080	and it is not entirely clear that The Antichrist offers us more as a moral alternative than the Christian ethics.
1927080	1934080	But his willingness to ask questions about it, I think, is what makes Nietzsche of enduring significance to our culture.
1934080	1941080	For all the madness, for all the evil that's built into it, it's probably the most significant moral development since,
1941080	1943080	oh, I don't know, the Enlightenment anyway.
1943080	1950080	And in terms of its artistic qualities, I think that Nietzsche is probably in the same league as Plato.
1950080	1958080	And as a great poet-philosopher, Nietzsche and Plato are the two greatest figures who combine art and philosophy.
1958080	1966080	Those of you who have read Nietzsche will know that his critical capacity is awesome and his artistic capacity is quite great.
1966080	1970080	You would not find that primarily in his poems or in the songs that he writes.
1970080	1973080	Most of the art that he creates directly is quite inferior,
1973080	1980080	but his prose poetry is the greatest in the German language and probably the greatest in the Western tradition.
1980080	1986080	Now, when we finish up with the priest and we find the liabilities of the priest,
1986080	1991080	when we find that perhaps the priestly type has in fact been selling us a dangerous set of myths,
1991080	1997080	we wonder if we can go back to the warrior, probably not, except in a sublimated sense.
1997080	2005080	If we were to take the will to power, turn it into something perhaps not as catastrophic as, I don't know,
2005080	2014080	Aryan war-makers or superior brutish types, it may be that the type of the philosopher,
2014080	2026080	that the type of the artist is in fact the warrior type, the individual who needs no moral code to create his own conception of good and bad,
2026080	2034080	that this type is what can come out of a revaluation of all values and that, I believe, is what is advantageous in Nietzsche.
2034080	2042080	The difficulty is how we will know when we really are beyond good and evil rather than being beneath good and evil.
2042080	2050080	Many of Nietzsche's friends and his philosophical admirers have tried to shield Nietzsche from the criticism that he's a proto-Nazi
2050080	2054080	and in fact I don't think it works, I think in fact Nietzsche is a proto-Nazi.
2054080	2063080	There's a strong tinge of racism in his work, there is a strong tinge of refined cruelty in his work
2063080	2072080	and insofar as this was misused in the 20th century by the Nazis and by other racially oriented hate groups,
2072080	2075080	I think Nietzsche is at least in part to blame.
2076080	2082080	Those who like Nietzsche's work, who want to shield it from this criticism, will point out with considerable justification
2082080	2086080	that he would have nothing but contempt for the misuse of his work in the century,
2086080	2091080	but it won't entirely absolve him of the results of his statements because after all,
2091080	2096080	Nietzsche would have had contempt for everybody whether they adopt his position or not.
2096080	2102080	So I would say that the warrior type very easily shades over into the barbarian
2103080	2108080	and Nietzsche as he puts it beautifully says, I write in order to be misinterpreted
2108080	2112080	and if we only have a series of misinterpretations of Nietzsche
2112080	2115080	because he thinks that there is no one canonical interpretation
2115080	2120080	well then it seems to me that he should bear the brunt of responsibility for everything
2120080	2123080	both good and bad that comes out of his work
2123080	2131080	and if we live in a Nietzschean age, it seems to me that we have to find some way of tempering it
2131080	2134080	whatever it is that is good from the western intellectual tradition
2134080	2138080	and if we can't agree as to what we want to call undesirable
2138080	2143080	whether it's good, whether it's bad or evil, whether it's the master conception of what's undesirable
2143080	2148080	or the slave conception, we may perhaps be able to create a sense of the good
2148080	2152080	which goes beyond the dichotomy between the two
2152080	2156080	which allows us to create some sort of overlap between them
2156080	2161080	perhaps it would be possible, as Nietzsche says, to create an artistic socrates
2161080	2166080	a moral socrates who is able to both combine the strength of the artist
2166080	2170080	with the mythological capacities of the priest
2170080	2176080	who is willing to connect his individual judgment with the concern for what is good for the species
2176080	2181080	and I think Nietzsche himself would not have entirely disagreed with that
2181080	2186080	if one is going to create a beautiful artistic philosophy the way Nietzsche does
2186080	2189080	we have to allow him a certain poetic license
2189080	2193080	if we are willing to allow Plato's poetry and Plato's myths
2193080	2200080	a certain degree of consideration and a certain degree of leeway for interpretation
2200080	2204080	perhaps if we did that with Nietzsche we would come up with a more fertile reading
2204080	2210080	when you get a chance to read Nietzsche and of all the philosophers I have taught this in this series of lectures
2210080	2214080	I strongly and most strongly recommend that you do get a look at Nietzsche
2214080	2220080	when you do keep this in mind Nietzsche has one particular trope which is characteristic of him
2220080	2226080	which runs through all his work and it's analogous to the one trope which is central to Socrates
2226080	2229080	if Socrates is the man of inimitable irony
2229080	2235080	the man who constantly says ironic statements that can be interpreted as the opposite of what he says
2235080	2238080	Nietzsche's typical trope is the oxymoron
2238080	2242080	an oxymoron is something like cold fire or hot ice
2242080	2248080	it's to use words in the opposite way that they are to be interpreted literally
2248080	2252080	Nietzschean oxymoron is what makes his poetry so moving
2252080	2259080	and perhaps the idea that he writes in order to be misinterpreted is that kind of oxymoron
2259080	2270080	perhaps the idea that the distinction between good and evil and good and bad is an unbridgeable distinction
2270080	2274080	can also be seen as an oxymoronic construction
2274080	2279080	Nietzsche's treatment of the warrior, Nietzsche's treatment of the priest
2279080	2284080	if it's not persuasive historically and I think as a historian I think ultimately he's wrong
2284080	2287080	it is persuasive poetically
2287080	2293080	and I would ask you to consider the fact that poetic persuasiveness may itself be an oxymoron
2293080	2297080	Nietzsche believes that having undermined the western intellectual tradition
2297080	2302080	by having abolished metaphysics, by having abolished the plausibility of Christianity
2302080	2306080	what he's done is created a new blank slate for us
2306080	2309080	and if the slate isn't entirely blank
2309080	2312080	well let's not hold Nietzsche entirely responsible for that
2312080	2319080	let's allow for the fact that poetry and Nietzsche's strong point is the fact that he is a great prose poet
2319080	2323080	that poetry offers us a multitude of possible interpretations
2323080	2329080	and that by offering us a liberation from dogma, a liberation from metaphysics
2329080	2334080	by offering us a kind of poetry which can create new value
2334080	2337080	which can create new human superiority
2337080	2343080	which can create a new and finer culture that Nietzsche has in fact done our culture a great service
2343080	2349080	however much madness or evil or megalomania is built into the Nietzschean conception of the world
2349080	2352080	he is surely the greatest philosopher of the last hundred years
2352080	2359080	and the remainder of the 20th century philosophical tradition would be inconceivable without him
2359080	2363080	Nietzsche is one of the great forerunners of existentialism
2363080	2368080	Nietzsche is certainly the first person to articulate the nihilism that threatened our culture
2368080	2376080	as Christianity had to recede after the attack made by modern natural science in the late 19th century
2376080	2381080	Nietzsche is not in that respect the cause of the breakup of western religion
2381080	2385080	he's not the cause of the breakup of western metaphysics
2385080	2387080	Nietzsche just articulates it
2387080	2392080	you may think of Nietzsche to take a poetic figure as a kind of seismograph
2392080	2397080	he's the first and most sensitive writer who sees that the continents of our thought are shifting
2397080	2400080	and rather than causing it he tells us about it
2400080	2406080	and in telling us about it he forces us to confront something that sooner or later we would have to confront
2406080	2411080	and insofar as he does a lot of the intellectual dirty work for us
2411080	2415080	insofar as he's willing to be the antichrist
2415080	2422080	as he's willing to take upon himself the responsibility for questioning the very foundational elements of our culture
2422080	2425080	he's one of the greatest thinkers that ever lived
2425080	2428080	so whatever is liabilities and I think there are many
2428080	2432080	because he's an anti-Semite, he's a racist, he's a misogynist
2432080	2434080	there are many evils in Nietzsche's work
2434080	2439080	but like it or not he forces us to think in ways that we would not think otherwise
2439080	2447080	he forces us to consider closely ourselves and to ask ourselves how honest are we when we are alone
2447080	2450080	much less when we are with other people
2450080	2454080	he asks us not only to have the courage of our convictions
2454080	2461080	Nietzsche asks, no he demands, that we have the courage to question our convictions
2461080	2465080	which is a much rarer human quality
2465080	2470080	insofar as our convictions will stand up to this kind of critical scrutiny
2470080	2474080	Nietzsche can be thought of as one of the high points in Western culture
2474080	2479080	the idea of ruthless self-criticism is quintessentially Greek
2479080	2485080	Nietzsche wants to bring us back to the earlier, higher, finer conception of human beings
2485080	2488080	characteristic of the non-Socratic Greeks
2488080	2493080	if you could think of one particular figure that Nietzsche wishes to supplant
2493080	2497080	in philosophy as opposed to religion, that would be Socrates
2497080	2499080	Nietzsche is the new Socrates
2499080	2505080	the Socrates of art, the Socrates of the individual, the Socrates of subjectivity
2505080	2510080	what he has in common with Socrates is the willingness to ask uncomfortable questions
2510080	2521080	what he has in common with Socrates is a willingness to ask questions about issues that no one feels very comfortable with
2521080	2526080	what's more important about Nietzsche is that his answers are intrinsically provisional
2526080	2532080	just like Socrates, Nietzsche says everything is always open to question and always will be
2532080	2537080	Nietzsche calls us not to any dogma but to a higher and finer kind of life
2537080	2543080	and insofar as we are heeding that Socratic call, Nietzsche who would be the anti-Socrates
2543080	2547080	is in fact part of the Socratic tradition as well
2547080	2553080	and he is both Socrates and an anti-Socrates is a perfectly Nietzschean oxymoron
