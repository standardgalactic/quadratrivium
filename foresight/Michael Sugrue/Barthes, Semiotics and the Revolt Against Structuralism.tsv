25940	29820	Rollin Bart is one of the most
29820	33780	and influential of the contemporary French cultural critics.
33780	38580	He died in 1980, but before he had finished his final work,
38580	41340	he had broken decisively with the most important traditions
41340	44940	in post-World War II Western European thought.
44940	46560	Particularly, he made a decisive break
46560	48900	with structuralism and with Marxism.
48900	51940	And the result of his investigations,
51940	54260	which are organized around the theme of semiotics,
54260	57540	the theory of science, served to drive
57540	59660	the tendency of contemporary French culture
59660	62260	and perhaps to some degree the tendency of contemporary
62260	65540	high culture throughout the West towards post-structuralism
65540	66900	and post-modernism.
66900	69500	So this is Bart's great achievement,
69500	72860	which is bound up with his critical activities.
72860	75620	And we might be inclined to say that Bart
75620	78660	is, offers us one possible reading of Nietzsche.
78660	80460	In fact, Bart's reading of Nietzsche,
80460	82740	which emphasizes aesthetics, which emphasizes
82740	84620	a critical stance, which emphasizes
84620	88320	the outsider status of the critic,
88320	91840	actually transforms the critic into a creative artist.
91840	94800	And in the process of expanding the domain of the critic,
94800	97080	in expanding the creativity of the critic,
97080	99840	creates a new sort of art form, or if not
99840	103520	a new sort of art form, a new approach to human creativity,
103520	107400	which allows for the questioning of all previously
107400	110640	established verities and allows for the undermining
110640	112760	and interrogation of what post-modernists
112760	115800	call foundational discourses.
115800	118760	Now, because Bart was a French intellectual who
118760	121200	was simultaneously Protestant, homosexual,
121200	122640	and without a terminal degree.
122640	124560	He had become ill when he was supposed
124560	126480	to stand for his final examinations.
126480	131000	He was very much an outsider in the French Academy.
131000	134560	He was everything that most French intellectuals are not.
134560	136320	And for that reason, I think that there
136320	137920	were personal issues which tended
137920	141440	to drive his demythologizing project, which made him more
141440	144240	sensitive to the hidden coercions,
144240	149600	to the hidden hypocrisies in the contemporary state
149600	151720	of French intellectual culture, but also particularly
151720	153520	French mass culture.
153520	156240	Bart is remarkable for his very sensitive and very
156240	159840	intelligent readings of mass culture
159840	161800	and the artifacts of mass culture.
161800	165080	What he does is use semiotics, which I'll explain in a bit,
165080	168400	to try and decode the artifacts of mass culture
168400	170960	to discern what hidden messages are being generated
170960	173560	in these cultural artifacts and who
173560	176720	it is that's generating these messages for what purposes,
176720	179120	usually coercive, of course, because he at least
179120	181160	starts out in the Marxist tradition.
181160	183640	And ultimately, the point, or at least initially,
183640	187480	his point of demythologizing, of finding the hidden meanings
187480	189840	caught within the artifacts of mass culture
189840	195680	was to liberate us from the tyranny of mass-produced
195680	196680	consciousness.
196680	198560	So he wants to free us, to liberate us,
198560	200400	and perhaps individuate us.
200400	203600	He says in a piece called The Lover's Discourse,
203600	206840	which is a lovely book, very half-novelistic and half
206840	208520	essayist, it's quite a lovely piece.
208520	210480	He says that the reason why he wrote the book
210480	212320	is because The Lover's Discourse is a discourse
212320	214200	of profound loneliness.
214200	216440	And in fact, Bart is continuing a theme
216440	218960	that was developed in the middle part of the 20th century
218960	222680	in French culture, the idea of the lonely ego
222680	226040	existentially operating in a void of meaning,
226040	229280	in a void of coherence, deciding arbitrarily
229280	232480	how to arrange and fix the world in a way almost constructing
232480	233440	the world.
233440	235360	So Bart, like many French intellectuals,
235360	238000	is retreating into interiority, is
238000	240040	retreating away from the external world,
240040	243880	and trying to suggest that the external world is constructed
243880	246000	by us, not given to us.
246000	247400	If you can see, this is some ways
247400	249200	a derivation from the Kantian project
249200	251600	of showing that we actively construct the external world.
251600	254680	But it's much more radical than Kant's project,
254680	256320	because what Bart is going to argue
256320	259760	is ultimately that we construct not just the world of signs,
259760	262440	the area of society, the domain of history,
262440	266520	also ultimately nature is a social and linguistic construct.
266520	267720	So in a way, you could see that he's
267720	271080	formulating a sort of Cartesian aesthetics in which
271080	275200	the lonely ego confronts a completely indeterminate world.
275200	278400	And the project is then interesting, creative,
278400	280680	pleasurable world making.
280680	284080	So what Bart is doing is liberating the critic,
284080	286680	liberating the ego, and liberating the self
286680	291000	from preconceived identities, and from arbitrary and spurious
291000	293480	limitations on human activity.
293480	295960	We might want to say that Bart created a poetic protest
295960	298040	against human limitations, and it's
298040	300960	in the form of a demythologizing myth.
300960	303600	We will find, ironically enough, at the end of his project
303600	308360	that Bart goes so far in the process of semiotic demythologizing
308360	310240	that not only does he conclude that he
310240	313000	is able to demythologize the various artifacts
313040	317280	of mass culture around him, but he becomes reflexive and ironic
317280	320520	and undertakes to inquire into structuralism and Marxism
320520	323520	and semiotics itself if it is not also
323520	325680	a myth with a hidden agenda.
325680	329280	And so what we end up with is the demythologizer
329280	332960	ends up demythologizing demythology.
332960	336080	And what you end up with then is a sort of metamith,
336080	339240	an ironic assertion that instead of unmasking reality
339240	341680	so that we can see the true face, the substantial reality
341680	343760	beneath, we are going to unmask reality
343760	346360	and find beneath that it's just another mask.
346360	348760	And then it turns out to be masks all the way down.
348760	350000	There's no face underneath it.
350000	352160	There is no substantial reality.
352160	355360	So what Bart is doing is withdrawing into interiority
355360	360480	to a very carefully and thoroughly cultivated self.
360480	364160	And Bart is, I would say, the great philosophical exponent
364160	366280	of pleasure and the pleasure principle
366280	368400	in contemporary thought.
368400	370480	The sort of person that moves away
370480	374480	from the external world tries to render it dubious, contingent,
374480	377720	arbitrary, and depended upon construction by the self
377720	379800	is the sort of person that feels oppressed
379800	382120	by the external world and would like to remove
382120	383360	all those limitations.
383360	386400	I would be tempted to say that Bart's word in some respects
386400	389000	represents the triumph of the pleasure principle
389000	390880	over the reality principle.
390880	394600	He withdraws into his mind the way the Epicurean does
394600	398000	into withdraw into his pleasure garden.
398040	400920	And that's the reason why one of his finest and latest works
400920	403120	is called The Pleasures of the Text.
403120	406120	What he has done by liberating us from authority
406120	409760	and from the author and from any preconceived, predetermined
409760	413760	meaning within a text is to say that we, as critics,
413760	418440	as careful readers of the text, have completely free play.
418440	422400	Our domain is one of complete power and complete control.
422400	425760	By withdrawing any meaning, by killing off the author
425760	427240	and saying all we have is the text,
427240	431400	it makes the critic like a creative artist.
431400	433400	Now, the best book to start out with,
433400	435120	and if you're going to read Bart, and I personally
435120	437720	have really enjoyed reading Bart because he's such a wit.
437720	440320	He has a very morbid, sarcastic wit,
440320	442960	and he's somewhat like Oscar Wilde in the sense
442960	446240	that it's a kind of exercise in sarcasm
446240	450040	which is very, very arch and carefully drawn.
450040	452760	The strong point of French culture, or high culture,
452760	454480	has always been its powerful connection
454480	456520	between philosophy and poetry.
456520	459520	Well, their philosophical thinkers, for the most part,
459520	462880	are closely allied to poetic expression, poetic considerations,
462880	464240	aesthetic considerations.
464240	466360	And Bart, I think, is one of the extreme examples
466360	467680	of that tendency.
467680	470840	In a book called Mythologies, which he wrote in 57,
470840	473400	what we have here is a combination,
473400	477320	a rather ironic combination, of Marxist culture critique,
477320	479600	something like that which we found in, say, the Frankfurt
479600	483800	School, unmasking the media of mass communications,
483800	485960	things like advertising, showing that they
485960	488680	are a way of exercising social control performed
488680	492080	in the interest of a certain small elite within society.
492080	494800	Well, Bart is doing something like that in his mythologies.
494800	497200	It's a collection of short essays in which he examines
497200	500680	various artifacts from French culture in the 1950s
500680	502720	and demythologizes them.
502720	504600	He says, this is what it appears to mean,
504600	506280	this is what it appears to signify,
506280	509000	and yet there is another hidden second level of meaning
509000	510240	that goes beyond that.
510240	511840	And that's what he's searching for.
511840	515280	He calls this second level of meaning myth.
515280	519640	Now, at the end of it, at least in the English-American
519640	522760	edition, is an essay that Bart wrote 14 years
522760	525560	after he wrote his book Mythologies,
525560	527560	and that's called Myth Today.
527560	529640	And that's where he begins this project
529640	533760	of ironic reconsideration of the demythologizing project,
533760	536240	where he says, you know what, it may have been that I was
536240	539160	unable to pull off what I was trying to pull off,
539160	541840	because it may be masks all the way down.
541840	544720	If there is no substantial reality behind appearance,
544720	547000	then the possibility of demythologizing the world
547000	548280	completely disappears.
548280	550320	It's just one myth after another.
550320	553600	Let me give some examples of his activity,
553600	555960	and this may make it a little bit more sensible.
555960	557640	What he does is semiotics.
557640	560920	And semiotics can be defined as the science of science
560920	563600	or the theory of science, the general science of science
563600	565160	is what Desa-sur calls it.
565160	567920	It's a subset of structural linguistics,
567920	570920	which was founded and organized by Desa-sur
570920	573480	around the turn of the century.
573480	578760	And semiotics views the human domain
578760	582000	as the domain of symbols, as the domain of signs.
582000	584640	And what it does is try and read these symbols,
584640	588200	read these signs, and look for their internal coherence.
588200	591560	Semiotics is concerned primarily with the internal coherence
591560	593560	of relations between signs.
593560	596640	The relation between signs in the world is not memetic,
596640	598680	in the sense that it doesn't represent the world.
598680	602520	Rather, the relationship between signs is semiotic.
602520	605840	In other words, internal coherence of the system of symbols
605840	607960	is what we're talking about, not the correspondence
607960	610520	between the content of the symbols and the world.
610520	614040	It corresponds to a shift in the conception of truth.
614040	617480	Semiotics holds to the idea of a coherence conception
617480	618080	of truth.
618080	620880	If the symbol set is coherent, it's very much similar
620880	622200	to what Rory believes.
622200	623920	If the symbol set is coherent, well,
623920	625720	then there's nothing to judge it by.
625720	628560	We can judge it by whether it reflects the world,
628560	631200	because it is assumed at the outset
631240	633840	that systems of symbols do not mimic the world,
633840	635320	that Mises is impossible.
635320	637240	Rather, their truth is to be found
637240	639360	in the internal coherence of the systems.
639360	642040	Think about something like non-Euclidean geometry.
642040	643560	We look around for an application of it,
643560	644360	and there aren't very many.
644360	645680	Perhaps there are none.
645680	649640	Well, that may mean that non-Euclidean geometry fails
649640	652400	if our standard is correspondence to the world.
652400	655600	But if our understanding of truth is coherence,
655600	657200	well, then it's perfectly satisfactory.
657200	660000	It's just as true as something like Euclidean geometry.
660000	664120	Well, Bard is adopting a set of assumptions roughly like that.
664120	666240	Now, let me give some examples of this,
666240	667680	make it a little more sensible.
667680	669480	Examples of semiotic systems are something
669480	673320	like psychoanalysis or Marxism, linguistic systems,
673320	678680	that are separate and incommensurable.
678680	681600	And in addition, things like clothing, the kind of clothes
681600	685120	you wear, that's a semiotic system.
685120	688400	Mass culture, things like advertising or MTV,
688400	691480	an extremely powerful semiotic system.
691480	693400	Let me give you some examples of how something like this
693400	694600	would work.
694600	696120	And you'll realize that you have been doing
696120	698360	semiotic analysis all your life.
698360	701480	A sailor gets off a ship, comes into port,
701480	703880	two women come up and say, hi sailor.
703880	706000	One of them is wearing a long black dress
706000	708640	and has a crucifix around her neck, and she's a nun.
708640	710640	And she says to the sailor, hello sailor, hi.
710640	713120	And what she's doing is saying hello to the sailor.
713120	716560	Another woman comes out, she's dressed in red satin hot pants
716560	718600	and a see-through blouse says, hi sailor.
718600	721760	Now clearly, that person is a prostitute, not a nun.
721760	724280	And clearly, hi sailor means something very different
724280	726080	in that semiotic system.
726080	728480	The point being that the way she is dressed
728480	730920	is a text that the sailor is reading, which
730920	734000	is what he knows how not to proposition the nun.
734000	734920	Doesn't that make sense?
734920	736600	And we're doing it all the time.
736600	739040	Bart wrote a wonderful book called The System of Fashion,
739040	741440	in which he analyzes ladies' fashion.
741440	743360	And he treats it as a semiotic system.
743360	745240	And he's right, it is a system of science.
745240	746800	It's a remarkable idea.
746800	748680	So one of the utilities of this is
748680	752560	that it can be applied to the entire human domain.
752560	757400	All kinds of communicative activity, or every kind of sign,
757400	759720	can be broken down and analyzed.
759720	761320	We can find its first order meeting,
761320	764080	and then perhaps we can also find a second order meaning.
764080	767000	And that second order meaning, the myth that underlies it,
767000	769680	that hidden meaning, that's Bart's project.
769680	771400	It's a very interesting set of thoughts.
771400	773000	All right, now let me give you some examples of this
773000	774640	and make it a little more sensible.
774640	776280	Bart has a wonderful sense of humor,
776280	780560	and he seems to be attracted to kind of the bizarre and odd
780560	781320	in the world.
781320	784600	He finds things that approach the world
784600	786160	obliquely and ironically.
786160	790360	And it's strange that a highly cultivated, extremely
790360	793240	sensitive French intellectual should write
793240	798120	an essay on professional wrestling, on detergent,
798120	800800	on striptease, on the brain of Einstein.
800800	803120	Remember that Einstein's brain was taken out and put in a jar
803160	803960	and saved?
803960	806200	There's an essay on that as a cultural icon.
806200	808560	In other words, he asks, what does that mean?
808560	810720	Plastic, he reads it.
810720	811720	What does plastic mean?
811720	813120	What's the myth hidden in it?
813120	814560	You wouldn't have thought perhaps there was any myth
814560	815400	hidden in it.
815400	818080	In fact, this is Bart's project to go from surface structure
818080	819480	to deep structure.
819480	822400	After he reconsiders it, 10, 15 years later perhaps,
822400	825280	he realizes there's only surface structure,
825280	827440	and just move from one surface to another.
827440	829080	Let me give you some examples of what he tells us
829080	830480	about wrestling that's worthwhile,
830480	832080	and why I think this guy is really deep.
832240	834160	If not always deep and not always accurate,
834160	836720	always entertaining and very sharp.
836720	839160	He says, wrestling is something that's laughed at
839160	841560	by intellectuals, all us professional smart guys,
841560	844320	the PhDs, we look down upon professional wrestling
844320	846080	and the people that go, and it really doesn't amount
846080	848200	to very much, because it's kind of, well, childish,
848200	850520	it's silly, it's pseudo sport.
850520	851920	In fact, Bart has another reading,
851920	854240	and it's a much deeper reading, he says.
854240	856960	The reason why working class people go to wrestling
856960	858720	is because it's a spectacle, not a sport,
858720	860160	they're not stupid, they know full well
860200	862600	this is entirely rigged, entirely fixed.
862600	864320	So the question arises for Bart,
864320	866000	which wouldn't perhaps arise in the mind
866000	867280	of most intellectuals, what the hell
867280	869080	do they get out of this, what's the point of it?
869080	871040	Why go to see this spectacle?
871040	873520	Well, Bart has a real interesting way of looking at it.
873520	876560	He says, this idea of a community spectacle,
876560	878360	where we already know the outcome,
878360	881480	and what we're cheering really is symbols,
881480	885120	or the personified symbols of various kinds of
885120	887920	cultural trends, for example Hulk Hogan,
887960	889520	or someone like that comes out dressed
889520	891920	as an American hero wearing the flag,
891920	893360	we're all rooting for America,
893360	894720	and he's the personification of that,
894720	897600	which is why we know in advance that he's gotta win.
897600	900400	Well, here's what Bart says about wrestling,
900400	903760	he says, not only is this not what it appears to be,
903760	905420	but in fact, if you look back,
905420	907560	you will find in the spectacle of wrestling
907560	909200	the origin of attic drama.
911560	914120	When tragedy started out, it was not high art,
914120	916400	it was popular art, and everybody knew exactly
916400	918200	what was going on, and the end was foretold,
918200	919040	everybody knew it.
919040	920360	And what was going on in Oedipus?
920360	923040	The same thing is going on with Hulk Hogan in a way.
923040	925360	Oedipus is a symbol, not a person,
925360	926800	and we all know the outcome of the story,
926800	928120	we all know how this has to end,
928120	929800	we're just cheering on because it creates
929800	932200	a sense of social solidarity among us,
932200	934600	you know, he represents us.
934600	938680	So like, it's a real put down or come down,
938680	940800	because it's characteristic of contemporary intellectuals
940800	942160	to think of something like tragedy
942160	943720	as the highest of high art.
943720	946200	What is a greater achievement of attic culture
946200	947760	than Oedipus?
947760	950280	Well, Bart thinks that Oedipus at least started out
950280	951240	and that we've transformed it,
951240	952080	but at least the way it started out
952080	953400	was something like Hulk Hogan.
953400	955520	It was all the people, the average man in the street
955520	957640	or man in the Agora would go in there and cheer away,
957640	960240	no one for well that Oedipus has to get it in the end.
960240	963400	And the point is that it's a spectacle, not a sport,
963400	966240	it is a tale which is foregone,
966240	968180	and it is a system of signs.
969080	970160	She's a very interesting thought,
970160	971760	you didn't think you could read professional wrestling,
971760	975280	in fact, it's a text, very interesting thought.
975320	977040	All right, let me take it a little further.
977040	979600	Detergent, this is a very interesting thing.
979600	982920	And it's very funny because somehow I can't imagine
982920	985000	Bart covering something like,
985000	986960	he was doing something rather journalistic,
986960	990240	the World Congress of Detergents in 1954.
990240	991800	So apparently all the detergent manufacturers
991800	993680	got together in France, in Paris,
993680	995040	which it seems like an unlikely place
995040	997240	to hold a detergent convention.
997240	1000000	And they had all kinds of advertisements
1000000	1001920	for the various kinds of detergents.
1001920	1004560	And what he did was he actually looked at the advertisements
1004560	1006040	as a text and read them.
1006040	1007960	And he said, what is this telling us?
1007960	1010360	Well, for example, when we find out that Luxe
1010360	1012680	deep cleans linen, what does that tell us?
1012680	1014800	Well, first of all, it tells you that linen is deep.
1014800	1016120	Who would have thought that?
1016120	1017880	What does it mean for linen to be deep?
1017880	1019600	Mm, very odd stuff.
1019600	1024320	And he elaborates the carefully constructed distinctions
1024320	1026200	that are being created
1026200	1029200	between roughly equivalent identical products.
1029200	1030800	One is green, the other is blue.
1030800	1032280	Chemically, they may be completely identical.
1032280	1033680	We've changed the food coloring,
1033680	1035760	completely different advertising campaign
1035760	1036600	connected to them.
1036600	1039040	One is appealing to the man of the house,
1039040	1040680	because it shows a guy lumberjacking
1040680	1042440	and then washing his hands with the blue stuff.
1042440	1043920	Blue is masculine.
1043920	1046800	If you've got pink stuff and a woman is doing dishes,
1046800	1047880	pink is feminine.
1047880	1049800	Chemically, it may be completely identical.
1049800	1051720	But what we are doing here is constructing
1051720	1053160	a contemporary myth.
1053160	1056520	And what Bard is saying is that myth has become a commodity
1056520	1058760	and commodities have become myths.
1059760	1062840	In a way, it's a change in the old Marxist formula,
1062840	1066080	CMC, from capital, volume one.
1066080	1067480	Commodity, money, commodity.
1067480	1072160	What Bard is saying that we have is consumer goods
1072160	1075200	and then mythology and then more consumer goods.
1075200	1077800	And the consumer goods serve the purpose
1077800	1081000	in this culture that used to be served
1081000	1084040	by the transcendence of religious objects.
1084040	1086320	In other words, we fetishize consumer goods,
1086320	1088040	which is why we bow down and worship
1088080	1089560	this year's new Cadillac.
1089560	1092000	And there's a drumroll before we bring it out.
1092000	1094160	Why? Because it is a new kind of icon
1094160	1098360	of contemporary life, of ease, of luxury.
1098360	1100760	I mean, imagine a Cadillac commercial.
1100760	1102800	What you see is Cadillac style, right?
1102800	1104680	What this means is Cadillac style.
1104680	1107200	What is the myth implicit there?
1107200	1110560	Rich people, happy people, people who have good lives
1110560	1112000	have Cadillacs.
1112000	1114440	To have a Cadillac is to have a good life.
1114440	1117120	Cadillac means good life, right?
1117160	1118840	There are myths being constructed
1118840	1121400	and our new mythologizers are not Homer,
1121400	1123520	are not Shakespeare, they are Admin.
1125680	1128640	It's a real deep and caustic argument.
1128640	1132600	Now, he investigates striptease and he finds out,
1132600	1134440	or he comes, he draws the inference
1134440	1138480	that the process of striptease desexualizes women.
1138480	1141720	Why? Because it never goes the entire way.
1141720	1142960	It never turns into sex.
1142960	1145000	It's an elaborate ritual in which we get
1145040	1148040	a sort of catharsis for men's sex drives,
1148040	1149520	who are the vast majority of the people
1149520	1150920	who make up the audience.
1150920	1153920	And it is a sort of ritual, it is entirely stereotyped.
1153920	1156800	You could almost construct a formula for it.
1156800	1158720	And what he says is this is just the construction
1158720	1162200	of the myth of woman and in particular,
1162200	1165200	the idea that sexuality is incomplete
1165200	1166720	in this sort of ritual.
1166720	1168240	He moves to the brain of Einstein,
1168240	1169720	which is a wonderful little essay.
1169720	1171560	And what he says is what the myth underlying that is,
1171560	1173040	that knowledge is a formula.
1173040	1174600	We have knowledge in a box here.
1174600	1176800	Einstein's brain, somehow inside that,
1176800	1178640	knowledge is enclosed within space.
1178640	1179880	See, we have Einstein's brain.
1179880	1182520	Someday we're gonna know exactly what makes this knowledge
1182520	1183920	and exactly what makes us such a great brain,
1183920	1186120	but for now, we're just keeping it in a box.
1186120	1187360	Knowledge is in a box.
1187360	1190200	It's the opposite of a postmodern icon,
1190200	1193240	Einstein's brain, destroy the brain and break the box.
1193240	1194360	That's postmodernism.
1195480	1196440	All right.
1196440	1198040	And finally, plastic.
1198040	1199840	Who would have thought you could read plastic?
1199840	1201380	What a perverse idea.
1201380	1204580	Well, Bart reads plastic and what he finds underneath
1204620	1209420	the plastic image is the myth of infinite transformation.
1209420	1211220	You can turn plastic into anything.
1211220	1212060	You can change its color.
1212060	1213140	You can change its shape.
1213140	1214740	You can make it do all kinds of stuff.
1214740	1217420	Plastic is the ultimate postmodern substance.
1218260	1221740	Plastic is infinite freedom, infinite transformation.
1221740	1225340	Plastic in both its adjectival and noun senses.
1225340	1226180	Okay.
1226180	1227300	Now let's think about myth,
1227300	1229580	and particularly that essay on myth today.
1230660	1234100	What happens in myth and the reason why myth is misleading
1234140	1239140	is because myth dissolves the realm of history
1239820	1241420	by making it appear as nature.
1241420	1243940	It makes the world appear natural and given.
1243940	1247700	It disguises the message that is being proposed.
1247700	1250780	And the most important of Bart's examples of this,
1250780	1253940	which has been discussed, ad infinitum, ad nauseam,
1253940	1254900	and the criticism of Bart,
1254900	1257100	is the picture of the Negro soldier.
1257100	1257940	Here's the idea.
1257940	1259980	He's looking at some French magazine,
1259980	1262060	and what he sees in the mid 50s is the picture
1262060	1264900	of a Negro soldier saluting the French tricolor.
1264900	1267540	And apparently he's dressed in a military uniform.
1267540	1271700	And the idea is that on the first level,
1271700	1274020	on the first level of a relation between the sign
1274020	1276580	and the thing signified, let's examine that photograph.
1276580	1279780	Level one, we have a sign, which is this piece of paper,
1279780	1283000	which has a film of light and dark spots on it.
1283000	1285500	That's what a photograph is, in a literal strict sense.
1285500	1286620	Okay.
1286620	1289340	What that sign signifies is a picture,
1289340	1291620	is the saluting Negro soldier.
1291660	1292740	That's level one.
1292740	1295300	That's the obvious surface level
1295300	1296700	of what that photograph means.
1296700	1298980	But Bart says, you know what that photograph really means?
1298980	1301900	At level two, in which we transform,
1301900	1302820	think of it this way.
1302820	1306640	Think of the photograph relating to the idea
1306640	1308300	or the image of the Negro soldier
1308300	1310740	as a sign relating to a thing signified.
1310740	1314700	So far so good, because semiotics investigate signs
1314700	1316980	and the relationships to what they signify.
1316980	1319940	Now, let's take that image of the Negro soldier
1319940	1321340	and put it back in the first place
1321380	1324740	and turn that into a sign itself,
1324740	1327400	and then have that signify some second order thing.
1327400	1328940	So we're bootstrapping ourselves up
1328940	1330220	into a new level of meaning.
1330220	1332860	And what Bart says is obvious about this photo
1332860	1336060	is that it's an apology for French colonialism.
1336060	1337220	He's saying, despite the fact
1337220	1339500	that the French colonial empire is breaking down,
1339500	1341140	despite the fact that we have considerable move
1341140	1343860	against colonialism and that there's a considerable racist
1343860	1347060	element and imperialist element in French political life,
1347060	1348460	in fact, there's no problem at all.
1348460	1349420	What us worry?
1349420	1354260	Look, look at the happy, content, loyal, docile Negro soldier.
1354260	1355820	That's why he's saluting the tricolor there,
1355820	1358620	and that's what that message is really all about.
1358620	1360020	And he says, that's really exact,
1360020	1361820	in other words, he thinks all the artifacts
1361820	1362940	of modern culture are like that,
1362940	1364100	and we are all under influence
1364100	1366140	by a sort of disguised coercion.
1366140	1367180	It's a deep argument.
1367180	1368420	Let me make a different analogy
1368420	1369380	and make it a little more sensible
1369380	1371020	and bring it home in contemporary America.
1371020	1371860	Rambo.
1372900	1373740	What is Rambo?
1373740	1376740	Well, on one level, it's a series of dots on a movie screen.
1376940	1381020	And what it shows is Sylvester Stallone killing 500 people,
1381020	1383100	being the toughest guy around and being invincible.
1383100	1385580	He's something like the modern Achilles.
1385580	1386820	Now, that's the first level.
1386820	1388660	That's the obvious surface meaning.
1388660	1391700	What's the second level, the mythological meaning?
1391700	1393420	The mythological meaning is that America
1393420	1394540	didn't lose the Vietnam War.
1394540	1395540	We won the Vietnam War.
1395540	1396700	It was a strategic retreat,
1396700	1398660	and we're still strategically retreating from it
1398660	1400140	by constructing works of art,
1400140	1401900	which say it wasn't really a problem.
1401900	1403580	One American could kill 500 of anybody.
1403580	1404660	We're the toughest people in the world.
1404660	1405500	We never die.
1405500	1406340	We never bleed.
1406340	1407180	We never worry.
1407180	1408500	We always get the job done.
1408500	1410660	In other words, the myth of American invincibility
1410660	1412460	is built into the Rambo movies.
1412460	1414260	I mean, it's impossible to miss.
1414260	1418140	It obviously has ideological mythic content to it.
1418140	1419380	Now, there may turn out to be,
1419380	1421660	as I'm pretty sure there will turn out to be,
1421660	1424300	a plurality, perhaps an infinite plurality,
1424300	1426100	of possible mythic readings.
1426100	1428500	Remember, once the text becomes completely open,
1428500	1430700	that means you can do whatever you want with it,
1430700	1433500	and you can treat it and read it as being whatever you like
1433500	1436260	because there is no authority behind it.
1436260	1438340	So Bart, in some ways, gives with one hand
1438340	1440420	and takes away with the other, right?
1440420	1442180	Offers us one reading, but then points out
1442180	1443340	that this reading is not closed,
1443340	1446380	that there are an infinite number of other possible readings.
1446380	1447860	We might be tempted to say that
1447860	1450100	semiotics is what I would call an open system,
1450100	1451460	rather than a closed system.
1451460	1452340	In that respect, it's like
1452340	1455340	vikingshtini and language games, right?
1455340	1457260	And that means that there are an infinite number
1457260	1459340	of overlapping games that don't necessarily
1459340	1460660	conflict with each other.
1460660	1462420	Consider the proposition, for example,
1462420	1465660	that we do a Marxist analysis
1465660	1467300	of the American Civil War, and we find out
1467300	1469020	that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves
1469020	1470740	because of his feelings about authority
1470740	1471860	towards his father or something,
1471860	1473540	or we do a Freudian analysis.
1473540	1475260	We also might want to do a Marxist analysis,
1475260	1476820	saying that the reason Lincoln freed the slaves
1476820	1479500	is because he was the agent of advanced capitalism.
1479500	1482500	The point that is made by Bart is that
1482500	1484260	semiotics tells us that these systems
1484260	1487980	are not mutually exclusive, that what you're doing
1487980	1489620	is just describing the same thing
1489620	1492540	under the aegis of two different semiotic systems.
1492540	1494540	In other words, psychoanalysis does not refute
1494540	1496300	the Marxist interpretation of history.
1496300	1499220	The Marxist interpretation does not refute psychoanalysis.
1499220	1500860	They are two incommensurate
1500860	1503580	and mutually exclusive semiotic systems.
1503580	1505940	And there is an infinite possible proliferation
1505940	1508300	of semiotic systems, so we get an infinitude
1508300	1511460	of criticism and an infinitude of interpretation, right?
1511460	1514940	In some ways, you might say that Bart's project
1514940	1517180	is the inverse of that of Godomer.
1517180	1520180	Godomer says we should strive for clarity of interpretation,
1520180	1523460	strive to appropriate and renew our connection
1523460	1527380	to a cultural tradition, because it's a necessity for us,
1527380	1529060	but also what we should strive for
1529060	1531100	is the clarity of our interpretation,
1531100	1532900	transparency of interpretation.
1532900	1534380	Bart goes exactly the opposite way.
1534380	1536740	He says there is no clarity of interpretation.
1536740	1539340	That's one of the most dangerous myths of all.
1539340	1542340	In fact, once you think that you have clarified
1542340	1544700	to the one final and only interpretation,
1544700	1547380	that is the most ideological kind of self-delusion,
1547380	1548700	self-deception.
1548700	1551620	So what he's done then with the semiotic breakthrough
1551620	1553940	is undermine the presuppositions of Marxist
1553940	1556020	and structuralist culture critique.
1556020	1557380	Remember that structuralism thinks
1557380	1559060	that it's discerning the ultimate algebra
1559060	1561060	inside whatever it investigates.
1561060	1563180	And Marxism believes that it is truly
1563180	1566100	unmasking bourgeois ideology to get to the reality
1566100	1568740	of class conflict and exploitation.
1568740	1572100	Bart's point is that none of these activities are real,
1572100	1574060	they're just substituting one myth for another.
1574060	1575300	You can't get beyond it.
1575780	1580780	All right, now, let's look at the way he handles myth
1583900	1585380	and what he does with semiotics
1585380	1587980	in this final essay, Myth Today.
1587980	1589980	He calls myth the theft of language
1589980	1592260	because it depoliticizes language.
1592260	1595460	You don't see, or at least initially on first observation,
1595460	1598100	one does not notice that Rambo is an apology
1598100	1599700	for American interventionism.
1599700	1602060	It's an apology for American foreign policy,
1602060	1604460	which has been for the most part a failure,
1604460	1606420	at least with regard to Vietnam.
1606420	1609820	Well, his point is that what we want to move to
1609820	1612220	is politicized speech, where it is obvious
1612220	1615100	that there is some agenda behind that sort of a construction.
1615100	1618060	And once we repoliticize it, earlier in this career,
1618060	1620460	he thought that we could get to the real substantial truth.
1620460	1624260	Later on, what it turns out is that this mythic
1624260	1626500	demythologizing is, in fact,
1626500	1629140	the construction of a left-wing myth.
1630020	1632460	In fact, the demythologizer turns out
1632460	1634420	to be the remythologizer.
1634420	1636940	And that means that the critic is, in fact, the poet.
1636940	1638300	He's a creative artist.
1638300	1640260	And the critic relates to the work of art,
1640260	1642380	the way the artist relates to nature,
1642380	1644700	in the sense that, think about Plato's example
1644700	1648020	from the Fidris, Plato's example from the public,
1648020	1649820	where he says, an artist looks at a bed
1649820	1651860	and draws a picture of it.
1651860	1654180	And then a poet will look at that
1654180	1655500	and take it a little bit further.
1655500	1656780	We have three levels of reality.
1656780	1658260	We have the ultimate bed in the sky,
1658260	1659980	form of the bed, we have the bed down here,
1659980	1662260	and then we have the artistic reconstruction of it.
1662260	1664060	Well, Bart wants to add a new level to that.
1664060	1666420	We have the critical reconstruction of the artist's text.
1666420	1668540	It can be a painting, it can be a literary work,
1668540	1670820	it could be anything, but he is just as free
1670820	1671980	in how he interprets it.
1671980	1674860	So now we have a new domain for the artist to work in.
1674860	1676340	Previously, artists had been describing
1676340	1678700	the physical world, the social world.
1678700	1681620	Well, now it is possible for a new sort of critical art
1681620	1683980	to choose as its domain the world
1683980	1685900	of artistic creation itself.
1685900	1688620	It's a sort of, the criticism then becomes a meta art.
1689620	1694060	And then we get the completely free play of the text.
1694060	1696540	Now, here's the idea behind this.
1696540	1698860	What he is looking to do is undermine
1698860	1701060	the authority of the author.
1701060	1702900	He describes this as the death of the author.
1702900	1704220	The author has been abolished.
1704220	1706540	And the reason why he wants to abolish the author
1706540	1709380	and abolish authority is because that's what gives
1709380	1711500	the critic completely free play
1711500	1713460	within the domain of the text.
1713460	1715260	If, for example, a critic offers a reading
1715260	1720020	of a poem or a play and the author happens to be around
1720020	1722540	and he says to the critic, well, that's not what I meant.
1722540	1724020	Bart and that sort of critic,
1724020	1725740	this sort of post-structuralist critic,
1725740	1728380	this semiotic critic will say, so what?
1728380	1729780	The text is completely free.
1729780	1731340	What you think it means has nothing to do
1731340	1733540	with what it means as far as I'm concerned.
1733540	1735620	And there's no way you can legislate this for me.
1735620	1738300	The mere historical contingent fact
1738300	1741060	that you didn't mean that is just not my problem.
1741060	1742900	I got the text and that's all that matters.
1742900	1745780	So we eliminate intentionality and authority from the text.
1745780	1747980	We impose whatever we want on it.
1747980	1750860	You might want to say that what he's done is liberate
1750860	1752580	the connection between the signifier
1752580	1754260	and the thing signified.
1754260	1757620	He says you could have it signify whatever you want.
1757620	1759780	You take a text, you take a sign,
1759780	1761980	and whatever signification you want to attach to it,
1761980	1763580	that's perfectly satisfactory.
1763580	1766260	Do not be constrained by any externalities.
1766260	1768460	Retreat back into your own aesthetic judgment,
1768460	1769740	to your own aesthetic experience,
1769740	1771740	and the world is completely yours.
1771740	1775140	It's completely the domain of pleasure and your own freedom.
1776460	1778740	Now, what Bart says is something like this,
1778740	1780580	or the conclusion he ultimately comes to,
1780580	1783260	is that every limitation on human freedom
1783260	1784500	is ultimately a myth.
1785980	1788660	And in fact, clarity, which apparently
1788660	1792060	makes memesis possible, is one of the most dangerous myths,
1792060	1796060	because in fact, signs, discourse, communication
1796060	1798740	is neither clear nor obscure.
1798740	1800780	Do not create a myth of obscurity either.
1800780	1802580	That's not going to work, right?
1802580	1804220	So he doesn't want to go either way.
1804220	1805940	He says you can't generalize about it.
1805940	1807860	He doesn't have any satisfactory resolution.
1807860	1810060	He's caught between a rock and a hard place.
1811500	1813380	Towards the end of his essay on myth today,
1813380	1816540	he goes to great length to try and convince us
1816540	1819260	that right wing politics is more essentially
1819260	1822580	and closely caught up with myths than left wing politics.
1822580	1825220	But of course, it's so evidently done in bad faith.
1825220	1827180	He's so evidently trying to soft pedal
1827180	1829460	the mythic element of left wing politics
1829460	1831060	that when you step back and look at it,
1831060	1833660	what's clearly going on here is the ironic,
1833660	1836620	critical construction of a new meta myth,
1836620	1839020	which supports the projects he happens to like.
1839020	1842780	He has decided to read the domain of mythology
1842780	1845500	as if it particularly pertained to people
1845500	1848460	and tendencies that he disapproves of.
1848460	1850780	Of course, when you go back and read between the lines,
1850780	1853780	what he is is trashing the entire proposition
1853780	1856020	that we can demythologize the world.
1856020	1857740	There is no substantial reality.
1857740	1859860	He's retreated back into subjectivity.
1859860	1862420	Can you see why I call this a sort of Cartesian aesthetics?
1862420	1863660	It's me, me, me.
1863660	1865100	But instead of trying to find out,
1865100	1867020	say, the mathematical structure of the world,
1867020	1869500	he's trying to find out how can I maximize
1869500	1872420	my feelings of pleasure with regard to the text?
1872420	1874100	He says this in so many words,
1874100	1876540	or he comes pretty close to saying it in so many words,
1876540	1879620	the second to last page of mythology's myth today.
1879620	1882940	He says, even here in these mythologies,
1882940	1885380	I have used trickery, finding it painful,
1885380	1888260	constantly to work on the evaporation of reality.
1888260	1890220	I have started to make it excessively dense
1890220	1892860	and to discover in it a surprising compactness
1892860	1895020	which I savored with delight.
1895020	1898180	So the justification for this critical activity
1898180	1900220	is not the fact that it truly represents the world
1900220	1902220	because you can't truly represent the world.
1902220	1903660	The justification for it is that
1903660	1905860	he really savors it with delight.
1905860	1907340	In other words, this is the triumph
1907340	1909980	of the pleasure principle over the reality principle.
1911180	1914100	We can choose two ways to go in this domain
1914100	1918620	of post-modern, post-structuralist weightlessness.
1918620	1920660	We can move towards the will to power,
1920660	1922700	or we can move towards the will to pleasure.
1922700	1924820	Foucault chooses the first road.
1924820	1926300	He moves towards the will to power
1926300	1928100	and towards political activity.
1928100	1931220	Bart moves away from political power towards pleasure
1931220	1932740	and in moving towards pleasure,
1932740	1936060	he withdraws into a sort of aesthetic quietism
1936060	1938420	in which you could have political activity
1938420	1941060	as a sort of hobby, but you can't quite take it
1941060	1944540	with the grim and determined seriousness that Bart does.
1944540	1946620	He's involved too much in absorbing
1946620	1948100	the pleasures of the text.
1948100	1951380	He's become an intellectual aesthetic, all right?
1951380	1953260	And pleasure is the only justification
1953260	1954780	for any intellectual activity
1954780	1957060	because it can't mimic the world.
1957060	1960700	So all of human life is potentially
1960700	1964380	the domain of freedom, creativity, which is to say art.
1964380	1966460	And the transformation of life into art
1966460	1967700	is one of the most powerful
1967700	1970420	and worthwhile readings of Nietzsche.
1970420	1973260	You can see how this is all homage to Nietzsche in a way.
1973260	1975420	And the idea that there's no distinction
1975420	1977020	between appearance and reality,
1977020	1980020	that ultimately all we have is an infinite series of masks
1980020	1981660	and an infinite series of illusions,
1981660	1984060	what could be more Nietzschean and perspectival?
1984060	1985420	What could be more ironic,
1985420	1988620	and at the same time, gratify one's will to power?
1988620	1990740	Particularly if the will to power has been transformed
1990740	1993620	into me, me, me, simple internality,
1993620	1995820	the will to power becomes the will to pleasure.
1996540	2001540	It's worth comparing Bart's work
2002940	2004780	to the work of some of the other structuralists
2004780	2009260	or Marxists to see the uniqueness of his sort of position,
2009260	2010900	and also to see how, in some respects,
2010900	2013900	it all simultaneously expresses a general collective tendency
2013900	2017180	in particularly French intellectual high culture.
2017180	2019220	One of his contemporaries, Altausser,
2019220	2021740	tried to unify Marxism and structuralism.
2021740	2023140	And that, in some ways, is the last
2023140	2024620	of the modernist paradigms.
2024660	2026460	We get these giant deterministic systems,
2026460	2029380	and then try and show that they both operate simultaneously
2029380	2032180	and are both part of some larger meta-system.
2032180	2035860	Well, Bart knew Altausser and his reaction to this
2035860	2037180	was saying, look, this is the worst thing
2037180	2038420	you can possibly do.
2038420	2040580	The reason we are giving up structuralism,
2040580	2042380	the reason we are giving up Marxism,
2042380	2044740	is because these large deterministic systems,
2044740	2046580	first of all, inhibit, and as a matter of fact,
2046580	2049340	prohibit human freedom, right?
2049340	2050620	Freedom turns out to be an illusion.
2050620	2052780	You get these giant deterministic systems,
2052820	2055820	and in addition to that, they all entail
2055820	2059460	totalizing discourses, huge meta-narratives,
2059460	2062940	big picture stories which no one believes in anymore.
2062940	2065140	No one takes seriously, or at least Bart says,
2065140	2066780	that the people who are on the cutting edge
2066780	2068980	of high culture at the time that he is writing
2068980	2071140	can no longer take seriously the idea
2071140	2074500	that everything has a secret algebra hidden inside it,
2074500	2076020	and it's the job of structuralists
2076020	2078460	to find the secret algebra hidden in mathematics,
2078460	2081500	hidden in crystals, hidden in biological life forms,
2082500	2083700	hidden in literary constructs,
2083700	2085860	and also hidden in anthropology.
2085860	2087740	He says, no, there's no secret algebra
2087740	2088660	hidden in everything.
2088660	2090500	That's a myth that you people made up
2090500	2092780	so that you could legitimize structuralist discourse.
2092780	2094780	He says, the party's over for that.
2094780	2096540	We got so good at being critical.
2096540	2098940	We got so good at being negative and negating.
2098940	2101400	We negated the sort of structures
2101400	2103860	which made this criticism and negation possible.
2103860	2107260	In some respects, I think it was one of the artists
2107260	2110060	involved in the data movement who constructed a machine
2110060	2113380	that the first time you plugged it in, it destroyed itself.
2113380	2116380	Well, that is very much this conception of culture.
2116380	2118740	You plug the machine in, it criticizes everything around it,
2118740	2120140	and then when it gets kind of antsy,
2120140	2122820	it starts to criticize itself in that process of destruction
2122820	2125260	that Nietzschean philosophizing with a hammer
2125260	2127660	becomes a sort of intellectual vandalism.
2127660	2130300	And nothing is left except the ego,
2130300	2132660	but there isn't even a complete self
2132660	2136500	because when we break down the structures of communication,
2136500	2137900	the structures of knowledge,
2137900	2140540	and the structures of linguistic interaction
2140540	2144340	which give us some real hold to the external world,
2144340	2147180	it ultimately means that we're moving in the direction of solipsism.
2147180	2149660	Remember why I call this Cartesian aesthetics?
2149660	2151580	And that means that it's just me and my world
2151580	2154300	and whatever I might happen to wish to do with it.
2154300	2157980	The advantage of this is it allows us completely free play
2157980	2159740	within the domain of our experience
2159740	2162260	and within the domain of our mental activity.
2162260	2165220	The disadvantage of it is that it is a hopeless attempt
2165220	2167180	to avoid the external world.
2167180	2169180	And the problem is that the external world is still there
2169180	2170500	whether you like it or not,
2170500	2173820	as Dr. Johnson said, I refuted thus, there it is.
2173820	2176740	Bart thinks that this is another ideological construct
2176740	2179580	and that the external world is socially constructed,
2179580	2180780	linguistically constructed,
2180780	2184500	and we could simply unconstruct it if it gets in our way.
2184500	2187660	It's amazing the degree of egoism and wishful thinking
2187660	2189420	that you need to engage in
2189420	2192020	before you can argue a project like this.
2192020	2195580	It takes one set of presuppositions and radicalizes them,
2195580	2197780	take them as far as you can possibly go.
2197780	2199660	The problem is that the snake ultimately ends up
2199660	2203420	eating its own tail and the whole project disappears.
2203420	2207780	This is what we get when we get towards the end of Bart's life,
2207780	2209220	the last seven or eight years.
2209220	2211180	His work becomes intensely personal
2211180	2214500	and it's not clear at some times whether he's writing a novel
2214500	2216500	or whether he's writing a piece of literary criticism
2216500	2217980	or whether he's writing a series of essays
2217980	2219660	or whether he's writing one essay
2219660	2222620	or whether he's writing a book formally like that of Nietzsche
2222620	2223620	or say the Gay Science,
2223660	2225260	where it's just a series of vignettes
2225260	2227380	that don't really hold together.
2227380	2231060	He completely gives up on the idea of structure or form.
2231060	2232820	It all begins to break down
2232820	2234860	and this breakdown of literary structure,
2234860	2238820	this breakdown of communicative form,
2238820	2241740	is analogous to the breakdown of external reality.
2241740	2246740	And when we lose that direct mooring to the external world,
2246860	2249060	what happens is is that the self begins
2249060	2252700	to become contingent and dubious and fragmentary.
2252700	2254740	May I suggest that as Wittgenstein pointed out,
2254740	2257420	the self, like language, is socially constructed
2257420	2259500	and that when we try and remove ourselves
2259500	2261460	from the external world,
2261460	2265860	the result is that we end up talking to ourselves.
2265860	2268500	Now, I'm not certain that that's a problem for Bart.
2268500	2271700	I think that he finds this a sort of, how can I put it?
2273340	2276900	A sort of transcendence,
2276900	2279820	a sort of way of getting beyond the mere contingency,
2279820	2281900	the mere limitations of human life
2281940	2285300	towards some new external other realm.
2285300	2288100	In a way, I'd almost be tempted to say
2288100	2290060	that he's reinventing metaphysics
2290060	2291820	and instead of putting it somewhere else
2291820	2292820	outside of space and time,
2292820	2295220	he's putting it within the domain of his own consciousness
2295220	2297700	and then he's shooing away the rest of the world,
2297700	2298940	saying, I'll allow you to exist
2298940	2300420	if I decide to invent you linguistically,
2300420	2303500	but else wise, do not interfere with my activity.
2303500	2305220	I wish to be totally free.
2305220	2306660	So if Shakespeare were to come to him
2306660	2308980	and say, I think you're misinterpreting one of my plays,
2308980	2310300	he would say, well, what does your opinion
2310300	2311420	have to do with my freedom?
2311420	2313140	Get away from my face.
2313140	2316860	I have totally free play and what that amounts to
2316860	2320540	is the idea that Bart is a sort of anti-deadless.
2320540	2322940	If you know the deadless myth from Greek mythology,
2322940	2325660	he's the one who found the way out of the labyrinth.
2325660	2328980	Bart's reply is, labyrinth, what labyrinth?
2328980	2330220	I live here.
2330220	2331340	We're not trying to get out.
2331340	2332380	There is no out.
2332380	2333580	This is it.
2333580	2335820	You happen to be locked in your subjectivity
2335820	2338860	and the domain of your universe ends with your fingertips
2338860	2342740	and the idea that there is a way out of this problem
2342740	2345020	that will allow us to find the way the world really is
2345020	2347060	as opposed to the way the world is
2347060	2349060	within the domain of our semiotic system
2349060	2353580	is just the hopeless platonic dream of metaphysics
2353580	2355020	from the time of the ancient Greeks
2355020	2358220	to the time of the moderns, up to, say, Levy Strauss.
2358220	2360500	So what he's saying is, this is it.
2360500	2361660	I live here.
2361660	2365020	Get used to the absolute contingency of subjectivity
2365020	2368620	and get used to replacing all your other standards,
2368620	2371940	things like logical coherence or correspondence
2371940	2375140	to the external world, move away from all that reality
2375140	2377020	principle stuff just towards pleasure
2377020	2379180	because that's the only thing that could ever justify
2379180	2380740	any of your intellectual activity
2380740	2382140	and even that doesn't justify it.
2382140	2384580	There is no justification for intellectual activity.
2384580	2387820	What could we gesture at besides our own semiotic system?
2387820	2389060	And we're locked into that.
2389060	2392620	Semiotic systems are incommensurable and untranslatable.
2392620	2394900	And because they're incommensurable and untranslatable,
2394900	2397260	there's no necessarily conflict between Freudianism
2397260	2398140	and Marxism.
2398140	2400300	It's just there's no privileged position
2400300	2402220	from which we can decide that Freudianism,
2402220	2404660	as opposed to Marxism, is the true semiotic system
2404660	2406540	which discloses ultimate reality.
2406540	2408220	There's just no such thing.
2408220	2411980	There's an infinite number of perspectives, right?
2411980	2415260	And that means that we break down into a world
2415260	2418500	in which we're all profoundly lonely
2418500	2421780	and we have whole societies
2421780	2423900	composed of atomized individuals
2423900	2427140	speaking their own language, living in their own world.
2427140	2429940	Can you see how this is going to tend to liberate
2429940	2432540	the centripetal forces of the mind
2432540	2436140	and keep us from having any of those centrifugal forces
2436140	2439860	which hold language and society and culture together?
2439860	2444380	And can you see then why this is a negative critique
2444380	2447460	which finds certain tactical uses in asserting
2447460	2450020	that demythologizing is at least possible
2450020	2451660	or at least occasionally useful
2451660	2454020	in advancing left-wing politics?
2454020	2457420	What we have here then is the artist or critic
2457420	2459420	as political dilettante.
2459420	2462180	In other words, Bart likes to pursue politics once in a while
2462180	2463620	because he finds it pleasurable.
2463620	2465260	And the sort of politics he likes to pursue
2465260	2468340	is the politics which increases and extends his own pleasure.
2468340	2469860	And the reason why he does it,
2469860	2471460	well, at the fundamental level,
2471460	2472660	it's because he finds it pleasurable.
2472660	2474900	Pleasure is the only thing that one can refer to.
2474900	2476500	But for tactical reasons,
2476500	2478420	it may be useful not to suggest that.
2478420	2480300	It may be worthwhile to write a book
2480300	2482700	suggesting that left-wing myths
2482740	2484140	are very different from right-wing myths
2484140	2486220	and they're not nearly so mythological somehow.
2486220	2488220	And what he's doing is just creating a meta myth,
2488220	2489740	a new myth.
2489740	2492660	And that means that we have a new order of poetry
2492660	2494420	called literary criticism.
2494420	2495820	We have a new order of critic
2495820	2497780	who is now the ultimate poet
2497780	2500980	because where the poets had to accept contingency
2500980	2502700	and had to accept the simple determination
2502700	2503940	of the external world,
2503940	2506300	the critic is not bound by nature.
2506300	2508540	The critic is trying to undermine nature.
2508540	2512540	The critic flees from nature into the realm of the text.
2512580	2515820	And that's why I think it's correct to describe Bart
2515820	2517380	as anti-deadless,
2517380	2519420	the guy who says stop asking the question
2519420	2520900	of how to get out of the labyrinth.
2520900	2523740	Stop asking the question of how to find substantial reality
2523740	2526020	independent of your semiotic mythologizing.
2526020	2528860	In fact, it's masks all the way down.
2528860	2530340	And for that reason,
2530340	2532900	he adopts a sort of ironic stance
2532900	2534980	because what is there left for the critic to do?
2534980	2537900	Certainly he can't communicate any reality
2537900	2539540	about a text to anybody else
2539540	2541140	because it won't be any more real
2541140	2542420	than whatever they already believe
2542420	2544100	and whatever they already think.
2544100	2546820	The only thing he can do is indulge himself,
2546820	2548860	is gratify his desire for pleasure
2548860	2551660	by increasing the domain of his freedom
2551660	2554420	so that it covers all communicative behavior.
2554420	2556940	So it covers the whole set of signs.
2556940	2559340	Nature, for example, is one of our signs
2559340	2562260	for external coercion, the externality of things.
2562260	2565420	Well, we can treat that as a myth as well.
2565420	2568220	The whole world then becomes a human domain
2568220	2570660	constructed by human beings in society
2570660	2573020	and constructed by human beings in language.
2573020	2577180	It is Cartesianism raised to a social collective level
2577180	2580420	based not upon physics but upon aesthetics.
2580420	2582540	For some reasons that I think are clear,
2582540	2583900	Descartes such a great thinker,
2583900	2585580	French culture has never been able to get out
2585580	2587340	from under the shadow of Descartes.
2587340	2589300	They all have a problem with either accepting
2589300	2591740	their own selfhood or demonstrating the reality
2591740	2592980	of the external world.
2592980	2595100	It easily slips off into solitism
2595100	2597100	if you start your philosophical investigations
2597100	2598140	from the inside.
2598140	2600640	It's gonna be so hard to make that jump to outside stuff.
2600640	2603540	It may be there, but then again, it may not.
2603540	2606900	Summing up then, let's think about what this amounts to.
2606900	2610380	First of all, it's very clear that the demystifier,
2610380	2612620	in this case, Bart, is also a remystifier,
2612620	2614980	that the critic is an artist.
2614980	2617380	This is a position of extreme solitude,
2617380	2620520	a sort of epicurean withdrawal into the safety
2620520	2623540	and sanctity and security of the soul.
2623540	2626500	And the result is that we have an ironic metamith.
2626540	2630100	He intends to communicate to us the fact
2630100	2631900	that there's really nothing to communicate
2631900	2634060	about these texts, except the fact
2634060	2635260	that they are totally free and open
2635260	2637260	and that there's no authority which you can refer to
2637260	2640140	as coercing or limiting your interpretation.
2640140	2642060	What I would say goes on here then,
2642060	2645420	is that in constructing this Cartesian aesthetics,
2645420	2647940	Bart makes readers little gods
2647940	2651580	and gives them omnipotence over an infinite domain
2651580	2653540	called the literary text.
