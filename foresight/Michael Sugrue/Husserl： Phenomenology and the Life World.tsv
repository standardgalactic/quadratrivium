0	29000	Edmund Husserl is
29000	33000	one of the most important and influential figures in 20th century philosophy.
33000	38000	And this is despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he's a particularly difficult
38000	44000	philosopher to interpret. His style is extremely recondite, his writings are voluminous,
44000	50000	almost to the point of compulsiveness, and he has a tendency to construct neologisms
50000	57000	to correspond to the new paths that he's breaking into the realm of the psyche,
57000	62000	or the realm of the mind. Husserl, his early background was in mathematics,
62000	65000	which is very important. Husserl is, perhaps like all mathematicians,
65000	69000	is a sort of closet platenist. I think that mathematicians on the whole
69000	73000	tend to look for something universal and abstract in all the thinking that they do.
73000	78000	And Husserl, who got his PhD under Weierstrass in Germany in the 1880s,
78000	81000	has a definite set of platonic tendencies and commitments.
81000	85000	So when you read his philosophy, when you think about Husserl's work,
85000	89000	if you were to connect it and think of it in terms of Plato and the Cartesian tradition,
89000	92000	the tradition of Western rationalism and idealism,
92000	95000	you will be on the right track at the very least.
95000	101000	Now, like Descartes, what Husserl wished to do was to construct a new foundation for knowledge.
101000	106000	It's a radical epistemological move which attempts to create certainty
106000	112000	in the face of contingency and the uncertainty that is generated by the other realms of knowledge.
112000	116000	So in similar respects, perhaps like Kant, what Husserl's project involves
116000	120000	is finding a presuppositionless foundation to human knowledge.
120000	125000	And what this would be is a sort of science of sciences that would inform and direct
125000	130000	and correct all the other activities of the human mind, including natural science.
130000	136000	So what Husserl is trying to do is get down to the Urschtopf, the bedrock of the human psyche,
136000	141000	and from there to generate all the other realms of knowledge, which correspond to it.
141000	146000	In some respects, this is like the Cartesian project of looking into oneself
146000	152000	and after finding an indubitable foundation for that and for the contents of your mind
152000	155000	to move from there to generating the external world.
155000	162000	So like Descartes, Husserl is working on the assumption that first of all, the self is self-evident.
162000	166000	In other words, it's not controversial that we are selves and that we have selves and that we are conscious.
166000	170000	He takes that to be simply a given and that that is indubitable
170000	175000	and not only is that indubitable, the interesting thing about it is that the knowing self, the cogito,
175000	182000	is in Husserl's view both temporally and logically prior to the world that's known by the cogito.
182000	185000	In other words, the knower comes before the known. That has to come first.
185000	189000	And if you think about the idealist tradition, all these guys believe that.
189000	194000	Think about Descartes, think about Spinoza, think about Kant.
194000	199000	The whole idealist or rationalist tradition tends to emphasize inwardness, internality.
199000	202000	And perhaps that's not only an important characteristic of Husserl,
202000	206000	but I would be inclined to say that that's one of the most characteristic moves,
206000	210000	the characteristic intellectual deployments of continental philosophy.
210000	214000	In other words, unlike the Anglo-American tradition, which looks outward like Hume
214000	220000	and develops a theory of the external world and then afterwards as a sort of postscript to that activity,
220000	225000	develops a theory of the psyche, of the mind, of what's internal to a human being.
225000	227000	Well, the continental tradition does the opposite.
227000	231000	They start out with a theory of what's inside, and then from there they try and work outwards.
231000	236000	And both the Anglo-American tradition and the continental tradition suffer from a sort of common problem.
236000	241000	When they try and make the jump from one realm, what we might call the exocosm,
241000	247000	to the internal realm, the psyche, the soul, or the mind, or what we might call the introcosm,
247000	250000	there's always a problem in leaping that hurdle.
250000	252000	And it doesn't really matter which side you start on.
252000	254000	The problem is always going to be the same.
254000	256000	How do we move from one part of the hurdle to the other?
256000	258000	How do we move from the beginning to the end?
258000	263000	So when you look at Husserl, when you look at this Cartesian continental tradition,
263000	264000	keep that in mind.
264000	270000	They're starting out with the internal facts of human consciousness and generating the world from that.
270000	273000	So it's a different problematic, a different starting point,
273000	277000	and that's what you keep in mind when you look at Husserl.
277000	285000	Now, corresponding to this way of developing a philosophy is the hope of getting certain knowledge,
285000	286000	like Descartes.
286000	290000	Descartes' whole project of radical skepticism was to develop a knowledge that was foundational
290000	292000	and completely certain, Husserl is trying to do the same thing.
292000	294000	He's a sort of neo-Cartesian.
294000	298000	And much of his work, when you actually start to read the stuff that he's published,
298000	301000	because although he produced a tremendous amount of writing,
301000	304000	most of what he produced was not published in his lifetime.
304000	308000	And he was in a voluminous writing, produced almost 45,000 pages of work,
308000	311000	and it tends to be very repetitive.
311000	315000	It is methodological for the most part and particularly programmatic.
315000	319000	In other words, what his writings are about is how we engage in a method,
319000	324000	which he calls phenomenology, which will allow us to discern these eternal essences
324000	326000	that exist within the human psyche.
326000	329000	And once we identify these essences, then we will know ourselves.
329000	332000	And once we know ourselves clearly and in a way that can't be doubted,
332000	334000	that can't be called into question,
334000	337000	then and only then can we construct all the other elements of knowledge.
337000	341000	So what he wants is, what he described as philosophy as a rigorous science,
341000	343000	which is a very radical sort of an idea.
343000	346000	I mean, by the 20th century, I think very few thinkers are willing to say
346000	349000	that philosophy is not only a rigorous science, but it's the foundation,
349000	352000	the aura knowledge of all other possible cognition.
352000	357000	So this is a long, it's a play that tries to go for all the marbles.
357000	360000	He's trying to win the big philosophical game.
360000	362000	And if he fails to do that, and I think that he does,
362000	364000	and I think that his project is a failure,
364000	367000	I think that we have to admire the sort of nobility which tries to take on
367000	369000	a huge intellectual project like that.
369000	373000	In many respects, because Husserl himself as a man rather than as a philosopher,
373000	375000	was a kind of a saintly individual.
375000	378000	He was conspicuous for his dedication and his devotion
378000	380000	and his moral seriousness to philosophy.
380000	384000	I would almost be tempted to compare him to sort of a Don Quixote of philosophy.
384000	388000	We all laugh at the results of Don Quixote's misadventures
388000	391000	because, well, they're silly and he misunderstands the way the world works.
391000	394000	But on the other hand, no one laughs at Don Quixote's intentions.
394000	400000	They are intrinsically noble and we have no choice but to admire that.
400000	402000	I kind of feel that way about Husserl.
402000	405000	I think that the project, well, not only does it not complete itself,
405000	409000	it never completely gets started, and it's probably impossible to do.
409000	413000	But I sort of admire the idea of unifying all of knowledge.
413000	416000	It is a sort of quest for the holy grail.
416000	419000	And even if we never find it, there is something excellent about the quest.
420000	422000	And I say this initially in my treatment of Husserl
422000	424000	because I'm going to be kind of hard on him a little later on.
424000	428000	So without being too hard, I think that we should give him a little bit of slack
428000	431000	because he's trying to do something that if it is not impossible,
431000	435000	it's certainly exceedingly difficult, much more ambitious
435000	442000	than the local small individual project's characteristic of the Anglo-American tradition.
442000	446000	Now, first off, he starts out with the idea of certainty and intuition.
446000	449000	In other words, if we're going to examine ourselves in a phenomenological way,
449000	452000	if we're going to pursue this method of phenomenology,
452000	459000	we are going to have to find out what the procedure for knowing things is,
459000	464000	what phenomenology involves as a method, what it investigates, and how it investigates it.
464000	468000	Those are always all going to be informed, and since this is a methodological project,
468000	473000	it makes sense to talk about how we do this as opposed to what we do.
474000	477000	And one of the big issues here is the question of intuition.
477000	482000	Now, I guess perhaps when you hear me use a word like intuition,
482000	484000	particularly because we live in contemporary America,
484000	487000	we are in the thrall of the Anglo-American tradition,
487000	489000	you perhaps think that I should put that in italics
489000	494000	because intuition is a kind of fishy, kind of mushy, kind of messy sort of a category.
494000	496000	And I want to start out suggesting that that's not the case
496000	499000	and that in fact it might be the truth some of the time,
499000	502000	but I can imagine intuitions, and I'm going to help you imagine some intuitions,
502000	506000	which are not only not controversial but they're not mushy and they're really not doubtable.
506000	507000	Just some ideas.
507000	508000	Let me ask you some questions.
508000	511000	I have a studio audience here which is live and kind of helps me out.
511000	514000	I'd like your information or your answers to these questions.
514000	516000	First of all, do I have a headache?
516000	517000	You don't know.
517000	518000	You don't know.
518000	520000	And how about do I hope someday to be elected president?
520000	522000	You don't know.
522000	523000	Do I like spinach?
523000	524000	You don't know.
524000	527000	My point is that I can answer these questions even though you can't.
527000	529000	I know if I have a headache or not.
530000	533000	And what would somebody else external to me presume to tell me that,
533000	534000	no, I don't have a headache?
534000	536000	You going to correct me on that matter?
536000	537000	No, of course not.
537000	538000	It's silly, right?
538000	543000	Well, may I suggest that my knowledge of my headache is a direct intuition of my experience,
543000	545000	my psychic state, right?
545000	547000	And I don't need anybody else to help me out here.
547000	549000	And if you doubt that you say,
549000	551000	no, Mike, you don't have a headache.
551000	552000	What am I supposed to do?
552000	553000	Do some math and show you that I do?
553000	557000	Or should we go to the lab and will I do some experiments and show you that I have a headache?
557000	559000	Can you see why that project is silly?
559000	562000	And we wouldn't gesture something external to my experience of the world
562000	565000	in order to validate the proposition that I have a headache?
565000	568000	Intuition, then, perhaps is not so gooey as we might imagine.
568000	574000	There are certain things which we validate just by gesturing at our experience of them.
574000	579000	In that respect, oddly enough, phenomenology, Husserl's method, and empiricism,
579000	581000	the method of somebody like David Hume,
581000	583000	even though they are so different in many respects,
583000	586000	share a common property is that they're all ultimately based on our experience.
586000	593000	Hume's phenomenalism, his empiricism, is based on our experience of the external world, observing it.
593000	599000	Husserl's phenomenology, alternatively, is based on our experience of the internal world.
599000	603000	And it reduces only to that, and there's nothing further that we can gesture at.
603000	609000	So, on the one hand, I would recommend that you look at this with a certain degree of skepticism.
609000	612000	In other words, intuition can be a very fishy category.
612000	617000	It can be nebulous, and it can be a simple refusal to give reasons for what you believe.
617000	620000	And usually, the refusal to give a reason philosophically for what you believe
620000	623000	is a way of saying that you don't have a reason for what you believe.
623000	625000	But my point is that that's not always the case.
625000	628000	If you think about the idea of intuition in terms of questions like,
628000	631000	do I have a headache, I believe you will realize that I'm the only one who knows that,
631000	635000	and that it's not absurd or meaningless for me to say that I have a headache.
635000	641000	So, I'm just trying to establish the idea of intuition as not being intrinsically preposterous.
642000	646000	Now, Husserl was a student of Brentano, which is an interesting fact
646000	648000	because Freud was also one of Brentano's students.
648000	651000	And from Brentano, apparently a very influential teacher,
651000	654000	he borrowed, as Freud did, the idea of intentionality.
654000	659000	And that's where it revolves around the proposition that the facts of mental life,
659000	661000	of our psychic life, are irreducible.
661000	666000	In other words, we can't talk about love and hate and hope and guilt and lust in terms of chemicals.
666000	670000	Freud liked the idea that ultimately we could reduce one to the other,
670000	674000	but in practice he treated it as a sort of autonomous inquiry into the mind.
674000	678000	Well, something analogous is happening when we look at Husserl.
678000	683000	He believes that the facts of mental life are irreducible and they're real,
683000	686000	and not only are they irreducible and real, but they come first.
686000	690000	In other words, what Husserl wants to do is like the project of Descartes.
690000	694000	He wants to construct the self first and out of that build nature,
694000	698000	rather than say the empiricist project of constructing nature first
698000	700000	and then later on constructing the self.
700000	703000	So the self comes first, and how do you find out about yourself?
703000	705000	Intuition, right?
705000	707000	And the reason why it's important for me to establish intuition is because
707000	711000	else-wise this seems like a tremendously nebulous and sort of baggy activity,
711000	716000	but in fact it potentially could be more precise than one might immediately imagine.
719000	722000	Now what's the problem Husserl wants to solve?
722000	726000	Well, in one of his most accessible books, and if you intend to read Husserl,
726000	732000	which can be quite trying, I would recommend you try a Philosophy in the Crisis of European Man.
732000	737000	It's published in 1936, it's written in the 1930s, and he dies in 1938.
737000	743000	And the reason why that's a good introduction to Husserl is because it's easier to figure out
743000	747000	what Husserl is against than it is to figure out what Husserl is for.
747000	752000	And what he's against are things like historicism, relativism, psychologism,
752000	760000	scientism, and what he's gesturing at here is the whole tendency of thought since the Enlightenment,
760000	764000	which tends to move away from theological or more precisely metaphysical structures
764000	767000	towards an emphasis on the empirical external world.
767000	771000	Perhaps this is a homage to the rise of modern natural science,
771000	774000	but Husserl says that the rise of modern natural science has misled us,
774000	780000	has caused us to misunderstand the world around us, and has put philosophy on the wrong footing.
780000	784000	The result of this has been an impoverishment of our culture.
784000	788000	In some ways, I would say that Husserl's concerns are fundamentally cultural.
788000	794000	He's putting together this epistemological project in order to rescue us from the degeneration
794000	797000	into a sort of pure materialism.
797000	800000	What Husserl thinks, at least Husserl's self-conception is,
800000	806000	that what he's doing is renewing and reviving the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition of Greek rationalism,
806000	811000	where our logos, our rationality, applies to the whole domain of human experience.
811000	816000	Let us juxtapose that to the tradition of scientism that we see in Mach and Alvinarius
816000	818000	and all those positivistic Germans.
818000	821000	There, he calls that the tradition of Democritus.
821000	827000	Those of you who know the Greek philosopher Democritus will know that he reduced the world to atoms and the void.
827000	830000	Well, in some ways, that's what modern scientific project has done,
830000	832000	and Husserl says that is a wrong turn.
832000	834000	We have moved down an intellectual cul-de-sac there.
834000	837000	So what he's trying to say is that we must go back to ourselves.
837000	840000	It's very interesting to know about the things in the world external to us,
840000	843000	but the real important thing is for us to know ourselves.
843000	849000	And once we know ourselves, then we will be able to construct our knowledge of the external world on an indubitable foundation.
849000	854000	But if we start with the external world and its contingency and its messiness and its lack of certainty,
854000	857000	all our other intellectual activities, including our knowledge of ourselves,
857000	860000	is going to reflect that same contingency and uncertainty.
860000	863000	So while the project may not be entirely successful,
863000	869000	the problem that he's formulating is in fact reasonable and serious and ought to be taken with great care.
869000	876000	So we're going to move against the general tendency of Western culture since the breakup of the Middle Ages.
876000	881000	There is a decidedly scholastic element to Husserl's work as well,
881000	887000	an infinite working out of carefully constructed logical oppositions in a sort of tautological way.
888000	892000	The construction of elaborate tautologies is perhaps one of the characteristic philosophical problems
892000	895000	of mathematicians who eventually become philosophers.
895000	897000	What were they doing in their training?
897000	900000	Constructing tautologies and working out the implications of definitions.
900000	902000	Well, that's what Husserl's whole project is,
902000	909000	because he moves from the domain of space or quantity to the whole domain of human experience.
909000	916000	So a noble and exciting project, let's dive into it and see if we can make some sort of sense out of it.
916000	920000	Husserl is worried when he's writing philosophy and the crisis of European man.
920000	923000	Let's think about his context.
923000	929000	He was a professor at the University of Freiburg until 1933 when he was dismissed from his post because he was a Jew.
929000	934000	National socialism comes in and he gets replaced by one of his students, Martin Heidegger.
934000	939000	And at that time it seems clear enough to Husserl that Western culture is collapsing.
939000	946000	One of the results of this Democritian tradition as opposed to the revived Platonic Aristotelian tradition
946000	949000	is that the fact value distinction emerges.
949000	951000	We get various kinds of relativisms.
951000	954000	We get various kinds of will-to-power, volunteeristic philosophies.
954000	957000	All of these, according to Husserl, are a sign of cultural degeneration.
957000	963000	And the source of this cultural degeneration is our lack of knowledge of ourselves and the world around us.
963000	968000	So what he's trying to do is sort of like Ajax, I don't know if you know the Iliad,
968000	973000	but Ajax preventing the Trojans from burning the Greek ships, he stands there and will not move.
973000	978000	And there is something tremendously heroic about it even though he may be fighting phantom battles.
978000	984000	He thinks, at least, that what he's doing is absolutely essential to the project of our culture.
984000	989000	And the problem that we're going to find, or one of the problems we're going to find in this procedure of looking into ourselves
989000	992000	is that it could easily become frivolous or arbitrary.
992000	998000	In other words, once I look into myself, I suppose I could tell you the immediate contents of my experience,
998000	1002000	but the problem is that that would be arbitrary and completely subjective.
1002000	1004000	That's not going to give us an ultimate foundation.
1004000	1008000	So we have to do something with our looking into ourselves, with our turning inward.
1008000	1014000	And what Husserl wants to do is use a method for examining the contents of our psyche,
1014000	1016000	and that method will be called phenomenology.
1016000	1022000	What he will do is something called the epoché, which is a translation of the idea of suspension.
1022000	1026000	Like Descartes, when he says, I'm going to doubt the whole external world,
1026000	1030000	what Husserl wants to do is, first of all, suspend the whole external world.
1030000	1032000	Now, it's not that he disbelieves in it.
1032000	1036000	He's not being skeptical of the existence of tables and chairs the way Descartes did in the discourse on method.
1036000	1038000	He's not denying their existence.
1038000	1040000	He's just saying that the whole external world is irrelevant.
1040000	1042000	Bracket it.
1042000	1046000	It's a strict mathematical sense of bracketing a problem, because remember, he had his training as a mathematician.
1046000	1050000	So we're going to bracket the problem of the external world and leave out all that stuff.
1050000	1056000	And bracketing the external world means that we're going to leave out a great deal of human experience.
1056000	1061000	For example, this will leave out things like cause and effect relationships.
1061000	1064000	Why? Because as Jung points out, we don't see cause and effect in the world.
1064000	1066000	We just see one thing happening after another.
1066000	1068000	All scientific theorems will be left out.
1068000	1071000	Mathematical deductions will be left out.
1071000	1075000	We're going to be left with the pure raw data of being a human being.
1075000	1080000	And what Husserl thinks is that there's something common to all of us that we're going to discern there.
1080000	1082000	You might think of it as something like this.
1082000	1086000	You know what it is to sift out sand, to look for something hidden in us in sand?
1086000	1093000	What he's trying to do is sift out the contents of human experience and find out the stuff that doesn't pass through the measure of phenomenology.
1093000	1097000	What we hold on to there will be what Husserl calls an essence.
1097000	1102000	Some invariable necessary quality to human experience.
1102000	1106000	And when we collect these essences together and reduce them still further,
1106000	1111000	I think what we will get is some common oar stuff of the human psyche.
1111000	1113000	Also think of the idea of reduction.
1113000	1115000	Reduction is a funny word.
1115000	1118000	From Latin it means to lead back.
1118000	1122000	We're going to be led back to our original kind of primal consciousness.
1122000	1125000	Another way of thinking of reduction would be the idea of boiling down.
1125000	1129000	Imagine the consciousness is a big whale and you're going to put it in a pot and boil away all the stuff that's irrelevant
1129000	1133000	so that you can get to something that's essential and structural and permanent there.
1133000	1137000	And this longing for something essential and structural and permanent,
1137000	1140000	can't you hear the ghost of Plato here?
1140000	1145000	It's the typical intellectual move of somebody that's been trained in mathematics.
1145000	1151000	And this has had a tremendous influence on the subsequent development of continental philosophy,
1151000	1154000	particularly people like Heidegger.
1154000	1157000	In the process of developing this presuppositionless philosophy,
1157000	1164000	what we're going to find out is something like the shape of the ego's transparent cage.
1164000	1170000	Like Kant, he's going to tell us what the necessary limitations of our experience are.
1170000	1179000	And once he's done that, he will think that he has done it permanently for all of time in the way that any mathematician would.
1179000	1184000	Now, the problem is to find some certain knowledge with which to combat historicism,
1184000	1190000	that we get in Diltai or scientism, that we get the positivists or various kinds of relativism.
1190000	1195000	And the way we're going to do that is by boiling down with this epoché.
1195000	1200000	And in the first case, what we'll do is we will have a sort of purified subjectivity.
1200000	1205000	We will boil it down until we get to the essential constructs from which human minds are made.
1205000	1209000	And the result will be that authentic reality will be disclosed.
1209000	1212000	We're going to suspend our belief in the external world and just examine what's left over.
1212000	1217000	And what's left over after we perform this kind of an activity of reduction
1217000	1222000	will be these essences that are permanent and eternal.
1222000	1225000	And he will know then the structure of the human mind.
1225000	1230000	And these will always be, they will always have a similar set of characteristics.
1230000	1235000	And phenomenological statements will result from this phenomenological examination
1235000	1238000	of the internal contents of our psyche.
1238000	1243000	And the key thing here is that it's not empirical in the sense that I can observe that
1243000	1245000	and have it be an empirical activity.
1245000	1248000	It will be descriptive, but it won't describe anything out there.
1248000	1251000	It's going to describe exclusively the stuff that's in here.
1251000	1256000	So it's going to be a descriptive theory of the introcosm.
1256000	1260000	And what he's looking for is absolute certainty without presuppositions
1260000	1264000	and it will always be about internal intentional actions.
1264000	1268000	What he's trying to do here is derive a priori statements.
1268000	1273000	And if you remember Kant, what an a priori statement is is it has at least two qualities.
1273000	1275000	One, it's non-empirical.
1275000	1277000	And two, it's necessarily true.
1277000	1281000	So what he wants to find is to generate after looking into his own psyche in this phenomenological way,
1281000	1285000	sifting out the contingent and the arbitrary and the irrelevant,
1285000	1289000	is a priori certain truths about what it means to be a human being.
1289000	1291000	Kant-Uberalis once again.
1291000	1295000	Now the problem that you might want to say that after this reduction,
1295000	1299000	what we're getting is something like immediate direct apprehension
1299000	1302000	of what the scholastics called universals.
1302000	1306000	We're looking directly into the self and since the self constructs and projects the world,
1306000	1312000	what we're going to do is cogitate our self and bootstrap our self into some permanent reality.
1312000	1315000	Now there are many difficulties with this.
1315000	1318000	Some of them we should look at directly.
1318000	1321000	First of all, there are very few examples in Husserl's work of actually doing this.
1321000	1325000	One of the problems with phenomenology, the nebulous baggy quality about it,
1325000	1330000	is that he says that the first thing we have to do is figure out what the phenomenological method is
1330000	1335000	and the way we develop the phenomenological method is to use phenomenology on itself.
1335000	1337000	To inspect yourself.
1337000	1339000	So there's something fishy going on here.
1339000	1343000	In order to find out what a phenomenon is, remember in Greek phenomenon is that which is disclosed,
1343000	1345000	that which is apparent and directly known.
1345000	1348000	Well, in order to find out what a phenomenon is,
1348000	1351000	one of the things we're going to do is reduce the idea of the phenomenon
1351000	1354000	to find out what that essentially is and from there we'll be able to move directly on.
1354000	1357000	So it's a method that hopes to pull itself up by its bootstraps
1357000	1360000	and I have some problems logically with this activity.
1360000	1362000	Let me give you some examples to kind of flesh this out
1362000	1365000	and make this a little bit easier to concretely think about.
1365000	1371000	And Husserl himself was generating things like investigations of phenomenon
1371000	1376000	but also ideas like number, meaning, truth, pure abstractions
1376000	1379000	that he believes are common to all cognitive beings
1379000	1383000	and in every case we end up with some sort of a circle,
1383000	1385000	what he calls the epistemological circle
1385000	1387000	and at other times the methodological circle.
1387000	1389000	The reasoning always ends up being circle
1389000	1392000	but of course if you're going to restrict yourself to the domain of internality
1392000	1396000	what else could you be doing but talking about circular things in a circular way?
1396000	1398000	Where is there to go?
1398000	1400000	It's almost not even a circle, it's something like a point.
1400000	1403000	It almost lacks that interior quality
1403000	1407000	and his method or the method that he uses more often than any other
1407000	1410000	because it's very difficult to figure out exactly what this amounts to
1410000	1413000	is what he calls free imaginative variation.
1413000	1415000	Let's see what that's like.
1415000	1417000	That's how we search for essences
1417000	1421000	and what we're going to do is think of something, let's take a human being
1421000	1423000	as something that I'm going to do a phenomenological reduction on
1423000	1426000	I'm going to think about that problem now, cogitating with me.
1426000	1428000	Alright, let's give this a shot.
1428000	1432000	What we're going to do is attribute predicates to this thing, human being
1432000	1435000	and then add and subtract them in our imagination
1435000	1439000	and see which of these predicates we believe we can dispense with
1439000	1441000	and which we believe we cannot dispense with.
1441000	1444000	And then we'll make two categories, the ones we can dispense with
1444000	1447000	the contingent things we're trying to get rid of, that's the sand we're sifting away
1447000	1449000	and the things we can dispense with which are the essences
1449000	1451000	and that's what we'll be looking for.
1451000	1453000	Let me give you an example.
1453000	1457000	Is it true that we necessarily have to attach the following predicate to the human mind
1457000	1459000	that the human mind is good at math?
1459000	1461000	Is that true of every human mind?
1461000	1463000	No, I'm bad at math.
1463000	1465000	I mean, I know for a fact that it's not true of every human mind.
1465000	1466000	I'm no good at math.
1466000	1467000	Let's try another one.
1467000	1469000	The human mind forgets birthdays.
1469000	1472000	Well, it's a predicate but some human minds remember birthdays.
1472000	1473000	Talk about this one.
1473000	1476000	The human mind is self-conscious.
1476000	1478000	Do you think you could dispense with that?
1478000	1482000	No, I mean, it's built right into the idea of what we mean by being a human mind.
1482000	1487000	So what we're doing here is attributing a great number of predicates.
1487000	1490000	One of the great problems here is it seems to me there are an infinite number of predicates
1490000	1493000	and we're never going to get, we're never going to finish the first thing we try and reduce,
1493000	1497000	much less do all the other reductions that are going to be necessary to engage in this project.
1497000	1501000	But at least this is an instantiation of what the guy is trying to do
1501000	1505000	to separate the necessary from the unnecessary, the inessential from the essential predicates.
1505000	1509000	And once you have the whole list of essential predicates of a thing, now you know what it is.
1509000	1512000	And then you get these things that are defined now as their essences,
1512000	1516000	just the essential predicates, and then we start to boil that down again.
1516000	1521000	And you keep on boiling until you get to complete disclosure of what it means to be a human being.
1521000	1524000	I think this is a pretty fishy way of doing this.
1524000	1528000	I think the idea of trying to find out what it's like to be a human being inwardly
1528000	1530000	is an interesting thought.
1530000	1534000	The difficulty is that in practice it's awfully hard to talk about these things.
1534000	1537000	Now, here's the first difficulty.
1537000	1538000	Truth conditions.
1538000	1542000	How do we know which of these predicates are the essential ones?
1542000	1544000	Help me out here.
1544000	1547000	I can imagine some which it seems fairly clear.
1547000	1550000	Triangles have to have the property of having three sides.
1550000	1551000	I can believe that.
1551000	1555000	I mean, that's not too controversial, but I can imagine cases where it wouldn't be clear,
1555000	1559000	even among phenomenologists, and there might be a lack of agreement.
1559000	1561000	And I'm not quite sure how we go about finding that out.
1561000	1564000	And even if I just look at it from my own perspective,
1564000	1567000	you know, leave out the social interaction between phenomenologists,
1567000	1569000	I look at it in my case and I say, alright,
1569000	1572000	so I've decided that one of the essential predicates of human being
1572000	1574000	is the fact that it is self-conscious.
1574000	1575000	That's just fine.
1575000	1577000	Now, suppose I'm uncertain about that.
1577000	1580000	Well, I guess I can't be uncertain about it because I found out by introspection
1580000	1582000	and I'm certain of all the things that I introspect.
1582000	1584000	So I guess I can't be uncertain about that.
1584000	1587000	But suppose I talk to one of my students and I say, kid,
1587000	1590000	one of the essential properties of the human mind is that it's self-conscious.
1590000	1594000	Suppose he says, professor, how do you know?
1594000	1597000	And what is it? Pound the table and say, look, don't ask me how I know.
1597000	1599000	I looked inside myself and I know.
1599000	1604000	That's not a very satisfactory answer and you get the sense that there's no real way to gesture at this.
1604000	1606000	The difficulty that we're going to find is something like this.
1606000	1608000	I can say, look, I'll do it right now.
1608000	1609000	I intuited this yesterday.
1609000	1613000	I looked inside myself and I found out that one of the essential properties of human being
1613000	1615000	is that it should be self-conscious.
1615000	1617000	And if you don't believe me, I'm going to do it now.
1617000	1619000	I'm going to sit here and introspect and, yeah, I'm definitely right.
1619000	1621000	I've done the phenomenological reduction.
1621000	1623000	I bracketed the world and take my word for it.
1623000	1624000	This is really the case.
1624000	1627000	Now, we would like this to be a universal logical procedure.
1627000	1628000	We would like this to be univocal.
1628000	1630000	My sense is that in practice it is not.
1630000	1632000	Problem number one.
1632000	1636000	One of the things that sort of ruins Husserl for a man
1636000	1640000	is if you have been exposed to Ludwig Wittgenstein before you do Husserl
1640000	1645000	because Wittgenstein's work is a wonderful way of dissolving these kind of problems.
1645000	1648000	In other words, Wittgenstein says he doesn't want to talk about whether this is true or false.
1648000	1650000	He says, look, the whole problem is misconceived
1650000	1652000	and that's the real difficulty we have here.
1652000	1655000	And let's think about what the criticism of this is going to be.
1655000	1659000	What Husserl thinks he's doing when he finds out what the essence of a human being is,
1659000	1662000	he thinks he's finding out something about the universal structure of the human mind
1662000	1666000	and that all people have to think that because these words, these terms like human being,
1666000	1668000	correspond to natural kinds in the world.
1668000	1673000	And the natural kinds in the world correspond to natural categories in human cognition.
1673000	1676000	My point is that's probably not true.
1676000	1678000	Wittgenstein will help us out here.
1678000	1683000	Wittgenstein says, I want to lead the fly out of the fly bottle.
1683000	1689000	Husserl is a guy walking around, or like a fly, walking around inside the fly bottle unable to get out.
1689000	1690000	Here's the problem.
1690000	1694000	Instead of essences being a quality intrinsic to the human mind,
1694000	1698000	Wittgenstein will point out that essences are a quality intrinsic to a particular language.
1698000	1703000	So when you find out that self-consciousness is a necessary predicate for essence,
1703000	1709000	you're not finding out some quality about the human mind intrinsically which corresponds to essence.
1709000	1713000	What you're finding out is about the way we use the word essence in the English language.
1713000	1716000	So Wittgenstein, by dissolving this, could have saved...
1716000	1718000	I mean, if you'd just been born a generation apart,
1718000	1722000	in other words, if Wittgenstein had come a generation before instead of Husserl coming a generation before,
1722000	1725000	he could have saved the guy an awful lot of handwriting.
1725000	1727000	Because look, the whole idea is wrong.
1727000	1730000	There's no such thing as an essence, and what you're trying to do,
1730000	1735000	what you're doing is reifying language and treating it as a model of the psyche, and it's just wrong.
1735000	1736000	There was a wonderful...
1736000	1740000	I mean, think about my hypothetical situation with my student, where I said,
1740000	1743000	look, I intuited this yesterday, I did the phenomenological reduction,
1743000	1746000	I'm going to do it now, and believe me, this will confirm what I said yesterday
1746000	1751000	that the essence of human being is consciousness.
1751000	1754000	This is a lot like what Wittgenstein said when he said, look,
1754000	1757000	suppose you bought a newspaper and you had some doubt as to what the story meant,
1757000	1759000	or of the truth of a given story on page one.
1759000	1762000	How would you find out if the story was true?
1762000	1765000	Well, there are different ways you might do that, but one way that you wouldn't do that
1765000	1767000	is to go out and buy another copy of the same paper.
1767000	1769000	Right? Now you see the point?
1769000	1772000	So when I said, look, I'm going to intuit this again for you.
1772000	1774000	What I'm doing is I'm buying another copy of the same paper.
1774000	1776000	This doesn't tell us anything, and this can't tell us anything.
1776000	1778000	I can buy an infinite number of copies of the same paper,
1778000	1780000	but it's still not going to tell us anything.
1780000	1783000	See the difficulty here? He's trapped within the intracosm,
1783000	1785000	and he can't figure out how to get out.
1785000	1787000	And neither can I if I follow this procedure.
1787000	1790000	Now can you see why this is going to be an extremely nebulous kind of philosophy,
1790000	1796000	where it's going to be very hard to talk about how we move from my internal consciousness
1796000	1798000	to certain facts of the psyche to yours?
1798000	1801000	The difficulty here is that when we turn inward,
1801000	1807000	and when we get a symbolically unmediated knowledge of anything internal to my psyche,
1807000	1812000	the lack of those symbols, that lack of mediation between me and these objects,
1812000	1815000	means that it's real hard for me to talk about them later on.
1815000	1820000	And that means that it comes very close to talking to yourself,
1820000	1824000	and that is the opposite of what philosophy ought to be.
1824000	1828000	In a way, that's a betrayal of the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition.
1828000	1832000	The idea of logos demands that knowledge not just be rational, but that it be communicable.
1832000	1834000	That's one of the canons of rationality.
1834000	1837000	And Husserl comes up to the barriers of language,
1837000	1841000	what Wittgenstein calls the limits of what can be said.
1841000	1845000	And he'd like to step over, but he never quite manages to do it.
1845000	1849000	So that's the kind of problem that comes up again and again and again.
1849000	1856000	Now towards the end of his life, he developed the idea of the Lebenswelt, the life world,
1856000	1862000	and this turn is toward the imminence of human experience and human consciousness.
1862000	1865000	Let me see if I can explain this idea.
1865000	1870000	What he wants to do is to look at the world as it appears to human beings,
1870000	1874000	as it is given in human experience, as opposed to the impersonal,
1874000	1879000	abstract experience of the world that we get from our study of modern natural science.
1879000	1883000	In other words, science tells us, for example, that time goes on indefinitely.
1883000	1885000	Human beings don't experience time like that.
1885000	1887000	They have a very limited span in the world.
1887000	1889000	That's one of the big differences.
1889000	1891000	Concrete time is human time, my life.
1891000	1894000	Abstract time is just T sub 1, T sub 2, T sub n.
1894000	1895000	It goes on forever.
1895000	1901000	In other words, science abstracts and to that extent somewhat falsifies the reality of human experience.
1901000	1907000	He spends a lot of time discussing his views on time and his views on internal time consciousness.
1907000	1911000	That's the kind of thing that phenomenology would be suited to
1911000	1913000	if we could ever get something done out of it.
1913000	1914000	The difficulty is this.
1914000	1919000	Husserl spends a lot of his time, most of his career, not actually doing phenomenology,
1919000	1923000	applying this method, but rather figuring out what this method is
1923000	1928000	and refining it and trying to explain how it is we're going to do something later on
1928000	1931000	as soon as we figure out how to do it.
1931000	1936000	It appears, from my reading of this, which has been most unsatisfactory,
1936000	1942000	because the philosophy itself is, in many respects, quite nebulous.
1942000	1945000	The best understanding I could come away with is this,
1945000	1947000	that at some point in the indefinite future,
1947000	1949000	we will find out precisely what this method is.
1949000	1952000	And I mean precisely, mathematically Cartesian in that sense.
1952000	1956000	And then after we find out precisely what the method is at some point in the indefinite future,
1956000	1959000	we will then actually be able to apply it to something and get some results
1959000	1961000	at some indefinite point beyond that.
1961000	1966000	And then after that, at some indefinite point, after we've gotten all these essences and assembled them all in a lovely array,
1966000	1969000	then we'll have some idea of what exactly we can do with this.
1969000	1974000	I mean, I'm told initially that the whole point of it is to give us an indubitable foundation to knowledge.
1974000	1978000	I would hope so, but it seems like we have to act on faith to a great extent,
1978000	1983000	because it's very hard for him to communicate with us directly what it is that we're supposed to do with this
1983000	1985000	and how it is we're supposed to do it.
1985000	1989000	The best phenomenologists dispute questions like this.
1989000	1995000	A further problem that we're going to get out of this neocartesian kind of a project is the question of other minds.
1995000	1997000	Descartes always had a problem.
1997000	2001000	I mean, he didn't have any problem explaining how he knew he existed and what his existence was like.
2001000	2008000	But he always ran up against a sort of glass barrier when he tried to explain what grounds we have for believing in the reality of other people's psyche.
2008000	2011000	Why is this not a kind of wilderness of objects?
2011000	2014000	And he thinks that there are other minds, but he can't quite explain why or how,
2014000	2017000	and Husserl is doing something very much like that.
2017000	2025000	He says among other things that we find out about human minds through something that is phenomenologically present to us, empathy.
2025000	2029000	Alas, he doesn't have a satisfactory phenomenological analysis of empathy.
2029000	2035000	He kind of pounds the desk and insists that yes, there are other minds, yes, we can know them, and yes, we do so through empathy.
2035000	2039000	And to be honest, I think that that's kind of in a pre-philosophic kind of common sense way. That's true.
2039000	2041000	I mean, how else are you going to find that about other minds?
2041000	2044000	I don't know why we need a philosophy to tell us this.
2044000	2050000	I don't know why we need this elaborate procedure in order to be able to affirm that.
2050000	2054000	I don't think that he really made any progress along those lines.
2054000	2059000	Here's the issue. Let's drop back a little bit and think about what the difficulty we have here is.
2059000	2063000	He wants to turn inward, and he also wants to talk.
2063000	2069000	And the advantage of the Anglo-American tradition is that by concentrating on external stuff on the public world,
2069000	2076000	it's relatively easy to say what you're talking about, to refer directly to things in the world, because they're public, they're external, they're here.
2076000	2080000	When I turn inward, it's very hard to make these questions public.
2080000	2086000	And here's the difficulty. The temptation that the Anglo-American tradition has is to just abolish the internal world.
2086000	2093000	Remember, I mean, think of the idea that we get with Locke and Hume, that the psyche is a kind of an empty box, a tabula rasa,
2093000	2098000	and all these impressions get sent in, and then we associate them, you get that association of psychology, and that's what the mind is.
2098000	2100000	It's a bundle of sensations.
2100000	2103000	That is an impoverished view of human experience.
2103000	2108000	I mean, if you stop and think about it, nobody views the world and experiences the world as a bundle of sensations.
2108000	2115000	Here's the difficulty. If we follow the Anglo-American tradition and we insist on the accuracy and precision of our speech,
2115000	2118000	all we're able to talk about is the external world.
2118000	2124000	Their statements about what goes on inside, in other words, the Anglo-American empiricists can't make the jump from the outside in.
2124000	2130000	And that's why the theory of the internal world is so impoverished, and it doesn't really persuade anybody.
2130000	2137000	In other words, the Anglo-American tradition is a theory of the things that are easy to talk about.
2138000	2143000	The difficulty is that there are more things on heaven and earth that are dreamt of in your philosophy.
2143000	2146000	I have an internal life. I experience the world that way.
2146000	2153000	And although these things are difficult to talk about, I feel the need to say something about them, even if it is unclear and nebulous.
2153000	2157000	Can you see then what the continental response to that is?
2157000	2165000	What they're going to do is sacrifice precision in order to enlarge the domain of discourse.
2165000	2169000	It is possible to truncate the domain of discourse, as the Anglo-American tradition does,
2169000	2174000	and you get an increased resolution in the precision of your speech,
2174000	2179000	but this resolution costs a very high price. You lose all of internal reality.
2179000	2182000	You lose the internal world. They deny there is an internal world.
2182000	2185000	What that sort of procedure will lead to is something like behavioral psychology,
2185000	2189000	Pavlov and Watson and Skinner, where there is no mind to talk about.
2189000	2195000	Now here is the difficulty. If you follow that sort of a scientific Anglo-American path,
2195000	2201000	what you're going to get is a very elegant and precise set of verbal canons,
2201000	2207000	which account for the world around us, but don't do a very good job of telling you about yourself.
2207000	2210000	And what Husserl and the Cartesians of various stripes will say is that,
2210000	2213000	if you don't know yourself, how are you going to know the world?
2213000	2218000	Or what the Delphi says, know thyself? It's a precondition for knowledge.
2218000	2222000	On the other hand, if you want to stay on the inside,
2222000	2226000	the difficulty is that we are unable to get even the most basic
2226000	2232000	or foundational gestures at this content across to other people.
2232000	2235000	I know very well about my internal mental states.
2235000	2237000	I have a hard time getting them across to you.
2237000	2240000	Much of Ludwig Wittgenstein's work was an attempt to bridge this gap,
2240000	2246000	but it's very, very difficult and at least mysterious and startling formations.
2246000	2251000	What Husserl did, kind of pounding on the desk in a kind of Cartesian way,
2251000	2254000	is to construct the idea of intersubjectivity.
2254000	2258000	In other words, the way in which these phenomenological psyches,
2258000	2261000	these transcendental egos communicate with each other is,
2261000	2264000	or the matrix in which they communicate with each other,
2264000	2266000	is his idea of intersubjectivity,
2266000	2269000	an idea which is never completely or clearly defined.
2269000	2273000	It allows us to form a sort of linguistic or verbal community with other minds.
2273000	2276000	I kind of naively believe that there is such a thing,
2276000	2279000	but he isn't able to give any very satisfactory account of it,
2279000	2283000	and the reason why is the structure I was gesturing at just a little while ago.
2283000	2285000	All these continental guys, if you look at yourself,
2285000	2288000	it's hard to break out of this solipsistic circle.
2288000	2291000	If you start on the outside, the problem is you can't get into your own mind,
2291000	2294000	and you started out as a mind, there are problems with both sides.
2294000	2297000	What I'm trying to do here is something like this.
2297000	2299000	Not to vindicate or justify Husserl,
2299000	2301000	because I think there probably isn't going to work.
2301000	2305000	In many respects, you may want to think of Husserl as being German romanticism,
2305000	2311000	Cartesianized, the lonely ego of Schiller or Goethe,
2311000	2314000	given a sort of mathematical Cartesian formulation,
2314000	2319000	and he insists in a kind of romantic way that I am a self,
2319000	2321000	I know I am conscious, and I can't doubt that.
2321000	2323000	That's the fact of the matter.
2323000	2326000	On this rock, I will build my church.
2326000	2331000	Well, I can see how you might have a certain desire to do that.
2331000	2335000	My problem is that we're always going to end up either talking to ourselves
2335000	2338000	or constructing arbitrary, commonsensical bridges
2338000	2342000	from our philosophical solipsism into the regular world of everyday practice.
2342000	2348000	That's built into the idea of this project that all the continental thinkers are involved with.
2348000	2350000	What I'm asking for, in some respects,
2350000	2354000	is that you cut the continental philosophers a little bit of slack
2354000	2358000	because of the fact that the project they have undertaken is probably impossible.
2358000	2364000	It may well be just impossible to talk about the internal facts of my psychic states.
2364000	2368000	Or it is so with a great deal of difficulty and a great deal of cloudiness.
2368000	2372000	It is not any particular problem with Husserl or any specific philosopher.
2372000	2375000	It is built into that kind of project of bridging this gap
2375000	2377000	between what's inside and what's outside.
2377000	2379000	But here's the alternative.
2379000	2381000	We can go to the Anglo-American tradition.
2381000	2384000	Professor Staloff and I have this argument essentially all the time,
2384000	2388000	because neither one is completely satisfactory.
2388000	2390000	Well, if you start out with the external world,
2390000	2392000	you're never going to get a sense of yourself,
2392000	2394000	you're never going to be able to talk about these internal facts,
2394000	2399000	and that means that you will have to impoverish the vocabulary of our experience.
2399000	2403000	In other words, the problem with Hume or with any of these Anglo-American appearances
2403000	2405000	is that I just don't experience the world like that.
2405000	2408000	And I think that that's a very fair objection.
2408000	2410000	Let me give you an example.
2410000	2414000	There's an analogy here, and this would perhaps make this whole difference
2414000	2417000	between the Anglo-Americans and the Continentals more apparent.
2417000	2421000	Let's try the idea of going to a tailor and getting a suit of clothes.
2421000	2423000	It's a simple everyday thing.
2423000	2425000	You go to a tailor, and he measures you,
2425000	2428000	and you come back next week, and you've got your suit of clothes.
2428000	2431000	And you put on the jacket, and you find out the jacket only has one arm.
2431000	2437000	The tailor says, well, if your jacket only has one arm, your body is wrong.
2437000	2439000	And the customer might well say, well, no, no, hold it.
2439000	2441000	Let me get this straight now.
2441000	2443000	My body is wrong, and your suit is right.
2443000	2446000	That's insane. I mean, that's not the idea here.
2446000	2448000	In other words, my body starts out being right.
2448000	2450000	I'm sure that this is how I'm shaped.
2450000	2453000	And that if you only have one sleeve in your jacket, change the jacket.
2453000	2455000	The jacket is wrong, not my body.
2455000	2458000	And if the tailor says, no, that's absurd of you.
2458000	2460000	You really have to remove that arm.
2460000	2461000	That's crazy. I'm not removing my arm.
2461000	2464000	You're definitely putting another arm to this jacket.
2464000	2466000	In other words, do we change our body to suit our jacket?
2466000	2468000	We change our jacket to suit our body.
2468000	2471000	Now let me suggest that our body is the set of our experiences,
2471000	2475000	and that the jacket is the philosophical theory with which we account for them.
2475000	2478000	You really want to cut off your experience of cause and effect,
2478000	2481000	of good and evil, of lust and rage and hatred and beauty,
2481000	2484000	because you can't talk about them precisely.
2484000	2490000	Or is this demand for philosophical precision taken to an unreasonable extreme?
2490000	2493000	In other words, when A.J. Ayer,
2493000	2497000	that has the view that, say, more moral theory is non-cognitive.
2497000	2502000	Well, I experience morals at least sometimes as being real and right and wrong.
2502000	2505000	If these Anglo-American guys, these real hard-shell empiricists,
2505000	2508000	tell me that my experience is wrong, it's like the tailor telling me my body's wrong.
2508000	2510000	Don't tell me that I'm experiencing the world wrong.
2510000	2512000	No, your theory is wrong.
2512000	2515000	And if it doesn't correspond to my experience, then fix the theory.
2515000	2516000	Don't tell me to fix my experience.
2516000	2518000	My experience comes first.
2518000	2521000	Now can you see the strength of Husserl's point?
2521000	2524000	This is a devastating sort of an argument.
2524000	2526000	And in my view, it's actually true.
2526000	2531000	In other words, I think that Husserl's attempt to find a way out of this labyrinth just doesn't work.
2531000	2533000	He's spinning his wheels, he's caught in a snowdrift.
2533000	2538000	But the idea of telling to these scientific, empirical, rational, logical guys
2538000	2543000	that if your theory doesn't correspond to my experience, your theory is wrong, not my experience,
2543000	2545000	I think that's right on the money.
2545000	2547000	And I think that's the strong point of all continental philosophies.
2547000	2550000	They say, I'm going to look at myself in the way I experience the world first.
2550000	2554000	And if your theory corresponds to that and accounts for that, so be it.
2554000	2558000	If it doesn't, I am not going to say, well, look, I'll give up on beauty, I'll give up on morality,
2558000	2561000	I'll give up on all my psychic states, all my emotions,
2561000	2565000	because after all, either I talk about them clearly or I don't talk about them at all.
2565000	2569000	No, this demand for clarity has been taken to an unreasonable extreme.
2569000	2573000	It will be much better for us if we were to start with experience,
2573000	2577000	or as Husserl's slogan was, to the things themselves.
2577000	2581000	Well, modify that a bit. Let's start with experience.
2581000	2584000	Let's make our slogan experience first, me first.
2584000	2586000	And then I'll construct my world around that.
2586000	2589000	I'm not going to construct myself around the world. That's insane.
2589000	2592000	It's like changing my body to suit my suit. That's crazy.
2592000	2594000	This is the strong point of Husserl.
2594000	2599000	And if it doesn't ultimately offer us intuition of the essence of being,
2599000	2601000	whatever it is that he's trying to do here,
2601000	2606000	if it doesn't offer us the ultimate structure of human cognition,
2606000	2613000	it does make an important point against the problem that Western philosophy has drifted into.
2613000	2616000	It makes the point that I come first.
2616000	2618000	And that's what phenomenology is.
2618000	2622000	If you leave out all the verbiage and the elaborate intellectual apparatus that he constructs,
2622000	2626000	it all proceeds from the basic intuition that my experience is right.
2626000	2630000	And any theory that tells me my experience is mistaken is, fundamentally,
2630000	2633000	it has a cart before the horse.
2633000	2640000	And I think that's what holds together the whole tradition of continental philosophy in the 20th century.
2640000	2643000	This will be true for Husserl, but it's also going to be true for Heidegger.
2643000	2645000	It's going to be true for Bergson.
2645000	2649000	It's going to be true for all these guys that start out looking at themselves.
2649000	2653000	And if they get nebulous and fuzzy, well, that's just built into the problem.
2653000	2659000	Another analogy that we can bring to this is that it's like singing.
2659000	2662000	The precision of our diction costs something.
2662000	2665000	The precision of our thinking and speech costs something.
2665000	2668000	We can loosen up the diction so that it's not so precise what we're saying,
2668000	2669000	but we can gain in range.
2669000	2671000	We can hit the high notes intellectually.
2671000	2673000	And I think that talking about right and wrong and talking about beauty
2673000	2675000	and talking about the really important things psychically,
2675000	2677000	those are the high notes of philosophy.
2677000	2680000	And the problem is that the empiricists can't hit those notes.
2680000	2683000	They have better diction than I do, but you can hit the high notes like this.
2683000	2685000	And this is what it's for.
2685000	2689000	And so for all the nebulous and dubious and perhaps even mystical qualities
2689000	2692000	that we find in Husserl, this is a serious and worthwhile attempt
2692000	2696000	to account for what it means to be an ego in the 20th century.
