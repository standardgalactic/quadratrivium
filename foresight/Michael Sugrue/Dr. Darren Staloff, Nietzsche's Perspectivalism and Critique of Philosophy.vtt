00:00.000 --> 00:28.680
The

00:28.680 --> 00:34.680
text that I'm going to be discussing today, Nietzsche's Gay Science, was by his own admission

00:34.680 --> 00:44.680
his most personal book, a text that more fully than any other revealed his self-created persona.

00:44.680 --> 00:54.400
And I say self-created persona advisedly. Nietzsche was in personality, nothing like the

00:54.400 --> 00:59.720
character you would have gotten from the previous lecture, which quite aptly describes

00:59.720 --> 01:03.840
genealogy of morals beyond good and evil. And from that you get a sense of a sort of

01:03.840 --> 01:14.840
philosophic Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actual Nietzsche was an incredible nerd, an extremely

01:14.840 --> 01:22.720
sickly frail philology professor, prodigious in his youthful scholarship, but his self-created

01:22.720 --> 01:27.840
persona that most accurately described the way he liked to think of himself was actually

01:27.840 --> 01:33.160
less like Arnold Schwarzenegger than Oscar Wilde. He was very much a dandy, a very dapper

01:33.160 --> 01:40.200
dresser, playful, had a very good sense of humor, at least in his writings. And I want

01:40.200 --> 01:45.720
to try whenever possible to give you a sense of that side of him, because that's what

01:45.720 --> 01:50.840
he tries to communicate in Gay Science. For example, it's a work that's comprised of

01:50.840 --> 01:58.200
a series of aphorisms, poems, riddles, jokes, songs, none of which are more than a few

01:58.200 --> 02:04.040
paragraphs long. The form of the work is Nietzsche's attempt to overcome what he considered

02:04.040 --> 02:10.480
the dreary, systematic nature of traditional philosophy, which he felt was hampered with

02:10.480 --> 02:16.320
a sort of ponderous, heavy-handed seriousness as if we were getting deep and getting to

02:16.320 --> 02:25.120
the bottom of things. Rather than be systematic, Nietzsche endeavors to be edifying, playful,

02:25.120 --> 02:34.920
to offer wisdom rather than a lie called truth. And as we'll see, Nietzsche argued that given

02:34.920 --> 02:41.040
the philosophical conception of truth, there could be no such thing. The text is, I would

02:41.040 --> 02:47.840
urge, a wonderfully beautiful piece of prose. In fact, it's one of the very few pleasurable

02:47.840 --> 02:52.560
reads in all of German philosophy. Not to say that German philosophy is not rewarding,

02:52.560 --> 02:57.880
I mean reading Kant, reading Hegel is intensely rewarding, but it is also very much like having

02:57.880 --> 03:04.560
your teeth drilled without anesthetics. And Nietzsche was critically aware of this and

03:04.560 --> 03:10.640
was in fact revolted by it. So my presentation, well as I've mentioned, whenever possible,

03:10.640 --> 03:18.560
I attempt to capture this quality of playfulness, good-hearted mischievousness, and what I would

03:18.560 --> 03:26.880
call a certain happy-go-lucky skepticism. Now, I must confess, in spite of his best efforts,

03:26.880 --> 03:33.240
Nietzsche was, unfortunately, a systematic thinker. Therefore, I'm afraid, before I

03:33.240 --> 03:36.840
can actually delve into the text, and what I plan to do is actually read you passages

03:36.840 --> 03:41.880
and explicate them, I have to present one of his central doctrines that I believe informs

03:41.880 --> 03:48.200
and underlies everything he writes. And this is a doctrine that's known as perspectivalism,

03:48.200 --> 03:55.520
alternately called perspectivism. In brief, the doctrine holds that all of our concepts,

03:55.520 --> 04:02.520
our language, our culture represent perspectives which we impose on experience. We put a mask

04:02.560 --> 04:10.840
as it were over the realm of experience to create a, quote, world. And since Nietzsche

04:10.840 --> 04:16.840
is systematic in all of his theories and theorems and to relate, I can draw on the last lecture

04:16.840 --> 04:24.040
to give you an example of this. Take morality. Is morality an absolute reflection of the

04:24.040 --> 04:30.920
truth? Or is morality, as Nietzsche says, perspectival? In other words, consider the

04:30.920 --> 04:37.520
master morality that Professor Sugru has so aptly described. It is a morality of not

04:37.520 --> 04:43.320
of what one does, but what one is. From a certain perspective, it has an intuitive sense. The

04:43.320 --> 04:48.800
good man is a man who's good for something, and one can easily picture the situation.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.800
You're going off into battle with spears and swords against people with spears and swords,

04:53.800 --> 04:59.640
and you have a choice. You can have on your side either, well, Lawrence Taylor, or you

04:59.680 --> 05:05.640
can have on your side Mahatma Gandhi. He says, well, this was the master sense of morality.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.720
One of them is good. Lawrence Taylor. Why? Because he's good for something. When you're

05:09.720 --> 05:14.200
in the middle of a battle, you'd rather have Lawrence Taylor by your side. Mahatma Gandhi

05:14.200 --> 05:18.560
is bad because he's useless. He can't do anything for us. In the middle of a battle,

05:18.560 --> 05:22.520
he's going to sit down and start, you know, eating rice or something like that. Perfectly

05:22.520 --> 05:28.560
useless. So that's one perspective. And then there's the slave perspective, right, that

05:28.600 --> 05:34.640
Lawrence Taylor is in fact a bad man because he's violent. He's contemptuous of those

05:34.640 --> 05:40.320
beneath him, and Mahatma Gandhi was a good man because he had universal love. And Nietzsche

05:40.320 --> 05:45.280
says, well, which of these are really true? Neither. There isn't a real truth to this.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.760
There's just those perspectives, and you choose the perspective which works best for you.

05:49.760 --> 05:56.760
Now, this is not a complete innovation. That such perspectives are imposed rather than quote

05:56.760 --> 06:02.000
red off of nature. Kant pointed out, right, with his discussion of the Copernican Revolution

06:02.000 --> 06:07.960
and conceptual schemes. A lot of what we quote, call the world actually arises from our own

06:07.960 --> 06:14.960
a priori categories. Now, Hegel had historicized that. He said, you know, it really doesn't

06:14.960 --> 06:19.040
come from our a priori categories of mind because we find different conceptual schemes

06:19.040 --> 06:26.040
in different parts of the world, and we find conceptual schemes evolve over time. Nonetheless,

06:26.480 --> 06:32.680
philosophers after Hegel, and certainly before, held that what makes a perspective true is

06:32.680 --> 06:39.680
that it in some sense corresponds to the way the world is, right? And we might accept Hegel

06:40.680 --> 06:46.640
by saying, well, each of our following perspectives comes closer and closer to an accurate correspondence

06:46.640 --> 06:51.440
of the world. And this is a doctrine called realism, the notion that the world is just

06:51.480 --> 06:56.420
like the picture represented of it by the beliefs we hold or by our language or common

06:56.420 --> 07:03.420
sense. Nature felt this was a piece of pre-Darwinian nonsense, literally a philosophic antique

07:05.040 --> 07:12.040
piece. Nature says, what if we take Darwin seriously? What possibly can make a perspective

07:13.280 --> 07:19.840
believable except the fact, not that it corresponds to reality, but rather that it empowers us

07:19.840 --> 07:25.720
and allows us to cope with reality more effectively. So the key to evaluating belief as good or

07:25.720 --> 07:30.120
bad is not whether it corresponds to reality, which is a vacuous notion because we never

07:30.120 --> 07:37.120
quite get in touch with reality, but rather whether it fulfills our will to power, right?

07:37.120 --> 07:42.080
Whether it allows us to control nature, to control ourselves, to control our environment,

07:42.080 --> 07:49.080
including other humans. So in short, realism for Nietzsche is dogmatic and unjustifiable.

07:50.320 --> 07:55.640
For the world in itself is nothing like the way we describe it. Now I want to urge that

07:55.640 --> 08:02.640
perspectivalism runs in two disparate directions, one external and one internal. Externally

08:04.640 --> 08:10.920
it takes the form of scientific realism, which is the belief that science accurately

08:10.920 --> 08:16.160
depicts the way the world is. But Nietzsche disagrees, he says science is just another

08:16.160 --> 08:21.200
perspective. It's certainly the perspective he believes in, hence gay science, but not

08:21.200 --> 08:25.840
because it corresponds to the world, but because it's an extremely useful thing to believe.

08:25.840 --> 08:32.840
Right? It actually helps us control nature. Reality itself is actually just chaos and

08:34.880 --> 08:41.040
flux. Nietzsche does occasionally, I must confess, fall into metaphysics. His metaphysics

08:41.040 --> 08:47.000
are thoroughly Heracletian, which is to say they are the metaphysics we found in Heraclitus,

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
the Presocratic philosopher. Persons for Nietzsche are nothing other than a series of

08:54.000 --> 09:00.240
drives and instincts. And this is a really Darwinian conception, right? What describes

09:00.240 --> 09:05.400
a human is the particular conjury of drives and instincts, and Nietzsche sums that up

09:05.440 --> 09:11.880
with the phrase will to power. So all of nature, not just humans, are various wills to power.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.000
All the animals are wills to power, trying to dominate their environment, replicate their

09:16.000 --> 09:21.800
genetic code as much as they possibly can, and eat other things lower in the food chain.

09:21.800 --> 09:27.880
That's the notion of will to power. So science in common sense are just masks that we throw

09:27.880 --> 09:34.880
on reality so that we can cope with it, so that we can manipulate it. Now Nietzsche accepts

09:35.640 --> 09:39.360
the correspondence theory of truth as the only tenable theory of truth, and it is for

09:39.360 --> 09:46.280
that reason he says there is no truth, right? Because there is no fixed, final, parsed reality

09:46.280 --> 09:50.840
for it to correspond to. So don't be upset when we find out that everything is a lie,

09:50.840 --> 09:54.680
that there is no truth. It doesn't mean that there's nothing to believe in. It simply means

09:54.680 --> 09:59.520
that there is nothing to correspond to our beliefs, that our beliefs simply interact

09:59.520 --> 10:06.520
with the world causally, rather than correspondentially, that they give us a handle on the world.

10:09.720 --> 10:14.840
And as I've suggested, therefore grounds for belief have nothing to do with truth, but

10:14.840 --> 10:21.340
rather are all about power over nature and ourselves. Now, perspectivalism also cuts

10:21.340 --> 10:28.340
internally. It undermines something which we might call the internal realism of the self.

10:29.260 --> 10:34.780
Now we're all aware at some point in our lives, we wear masks, right? We present a persona.

10:34.780 --> 10:40.500
When you meet your boss, and he looks like an old bald, who knows what, you don't say

10:40.500 --> 10:45.100
hi, old bald, who know what, rather you smile and say, oh you look so good, I love that

10:45.100 --> 10:49.300
tie, that's really charming. And we wear these masks when we deal with our children and they

10:49.300 --> 10:53.060
do something silly which is dangerous, we don't laugh and say that's silly, we take

10:53.060 --> 10:58.860
a stern face and say, why not not do that? And we put these masks on, we all do this

10:58.860 --> 11:04.980
all the time. Nonetheless, we have this belief that if we could ever take those masks off,

11:04.980 --> 11:11.980
we would find our real self, the real Professor Staloff as it were. Nietzsche finds this view

11:13.260 --> 11:20.140
embarrassingly dogmatic and stupid. There is no real self, any more than a real world.

11:20.140 --> 11:25.820
That's an incredibly dogmatic myth. We create ourselves. We create ourselves by putting

11:25.820 --> 11:31.340
on masks, masks that we build, perhaps on the basis of models of others, but perhaps on

11:31.340 --> 11:36.700
our own. And in fact, that's the distinction he draws about mask wearing. Some people are

11:36.700 --> 11:43.700
more than satisfied to wear the masks that their culture presupposes. For Nietzsche,

11:44.380 --> 11:51.140
that's dangerous, at least for him. He says that sort of a person has no terror of being

11:51.140 --> 11:58.140
a copy, a replica, one just like any other cut out of a cookie cutter mold. The interesting

11:59.100 --> 12:06.100
person is like an artist who self-consciously and artistically creates his own masks. He

12:08.220 --> 12:13.300
may not even do it in his personal life. He may do it through his works. And that is

12:13.300 --> 12:17.980
exactly what Nietzsche's works represent for him, his own self-created persona, his

12:17.980 --> 12:24.100
own self-projected mask. Now, I want to very briefly to say that there are some would-be

12:24.100 --> 12:28.580
friends of Nietzsche who've claimed that he was not a perspectivalist because that would

12:28.580 --> 12:34.020
be a stupid view. I mean, if it's all just perspective, then one perspective is as good

12:34.020 --> 12:41.020
as another. Well, Nietzsche has a great line. He says, I wish such disciples on my enemies.

12:42.020 --> 12:49.020
He says, that's a cloven-minded thought, the inference limps. And the reason it limps

12:49.500 --> 12:55.700
is because such friends assume that the only thing which could count as truth, as grounds

12:55.700 --> 13:00.300
for belief, is correspondence. When Nietzsche says, not at all. There's plenty of reasons

13:00.300 --> 13:04.380
to decide that physics is more true, say, than the belief that I have wings and can

13:04.380 --> 13:09.140
fly off this podium. In fact, the best example of that would be that if I tried it, I'd break

13:09.140 --> 13:15.660
my leg. He says, so that's the grounds for belief. Perspectivalism isn't undermined

13:15.660 --> 13:21.340
by the critique of relativism. Simply because none of the beliefs are absolutely true doesn't

13:21.340 --> 13:28.340
mean we can't choose between them, which fulfill our purposes better.

13:31.900 --> 13:38.500
Perspectivalism does mean, however, that our views of things are interpretations, not

13:38.540 --> 13:45.540
correspondence readings. And nowhere is this more true than in reading texts. Every reading

13:46.420 --> 13:52.860
of a text is an interpretation of it. And in no text is this more obvious than in Nietzsche's,

13:52.860 --> 13:58.420
which are disparate, often contradictory, confusing. So what I'm going to offer is an

13:58.420 --> 14:04.060
interpretation of the gay science, which will take the form of looking at particular passages

14:04.100 --> 14:11.100
which I find edifying and explicating them. I'll try, of course, because I'm not quite

14:12.220 --> 14:18.020
Nietzsche, to cover all the important topics. But whether I do or not is in no way significant.

14:18.020 --> 14:23.420
Whether I cover two or two hundred aphorisms is important. What is important is that I

14:23.420 --> 14:29.420
try and give you a sense of the style, of the flavor of this text.

14:30.420 --> 14:35.740
Alright, so that brings us to the beginning of the text. What is gay science, after all?

14:35.740 --> 14:42.740
The illusion, I believe, was to the gay sebert of the Provence troubadours, which were chivalric

14:44.140 --> 14:49.780
knights who created the first love songs and love poems and were destroyed during the middle

14:49.780 --> 14:52.940
of a papal crusade, because obviously they weren't very good Christians, they believed

14:52.940 --> 14:57.620
in adultery. And the point for Nietzsche, and other thinkers since him, I mean Joseph

14:57.660 --> 15:03.780
Campbell has thought the same view, is that these were the first people who created individuals,

15:03.780 --> 15:09.180
who said, I will stand against authority, and if the church tells me what I'm doing

15:09.180 --> 15:15.180
is a sin, well, so much for the church. I will fulfill my own path. And I think that's

15:15.180 --> 15:20.380
a fair sense of part of what gay science is about, the creating of individuals, the cherishing

15:20.380 --> 15:27.380
of individuality as opposed to commonality, universality. Nietzsche, however, in his preface

15:29.060 --> 15:36.060
to the work, refers to his gay science as the result of a convalescence. He says, gay

15:37.180 --> 15:43.540
science, that signifies the Saturnalia of a spirit who has patiently resisted a terrible

15:43.540 --> 15:50.540
long pressure, patiently, severely, coldly without submitting, but also without hope.

15:51.460 --> 15:57.900
And it was now all at once attacked by hope, the hope for health, and the intoxication

15:57.900 --> 16:03.140
of convalescence. Is it any wonder that in the process much that is unreasonable and foolish

16:03.140 --> 16:09.780
comes to light, much playful tenderness that is lavished even on problems that have a prickly

16:09.780 --> 16:15.820
hide and are not made to be caressed and enticed? This whole book is nothing but a bit of merry

16:15.820 --> 16:22.660
making after long privation and powerlessness, the rejoicing of strength that is returning

16:22.660 --> 16:28.180
of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Well, what is this sickness

16:28.180 --> 16:33.740
or as he calls it, nausea that he's getting better from? The nausea, he says, is the result

16:33.740 --> 16:39.420
of having an over-large dose of a very unhealthy European diet called Romanticism, which fills

16:39.460 --> 16:46.220
us with great aspirations. Problem with such a conviction is, it only lasts as long as

16:46.220 --> 16:51.700
you're scientifically illiterate. If you read Darwin, you realize that there's no purpose

16:51.700 --> 16:58.700
behind our existence. We are, in fact, simply the agents of the big actor behind history,

16:59.020 --> 17:05.020
Mr. DNA, right, who's a sort of viral infection that's infected the planet and where it's

17:05.020 --> 17:10.220
laid a strategy for dominating that infection. But in a sense, don't worry, it'll die off

17:10.220 --> 17:17.220
eventually. So Nietzsche says that's the sort of thing which can induce Veltschmer's

17:18.180 --> 17:23.500
world weariness, a sense of anxiety and dread over it all. And Nietzsche went through this

17:23.500 --> 17:29.260
intense depression, life is meaningless, there's no purpose, there's no goal, and then he

17:29.260 --> 17:36.260
got better. And as he gets better, he takes on a new perspective. He's no longer serious

17:38.400 --> 17:45.400
and somber, what he would call, oh, too, German. Now, he's pricklish, he's gay. Let me be

17:45.540 --> 17:51.160
clear, gay at the time did not have the connotation of homosexuality that it does today. But Walter

17:51.160 --> 17:56.080
Kaufman has quite persuasively, I think, argued that it's no coincidence that homosexuals

17:56.080 --> 18:00.720
would have reached for the same term that Nietzsche used to describe his science, because

18:00.720 --> 18:06.760
it suggests a sort of studied superficiality, a sense of the beauty of mere appearance,

18:06.760 --> 18:12.080
a refusal to take serious things seriously, rather take them trivially, and take trivial

18:12.080 --> 18:19.080
things seriously, which some of you may recognize as the dictum of Oscar Wilde. So this text

18:20.080 --> 18:26.440
is, in a sense, then, at least for Nietzsche, a study of his psychological experience of

18:26.440 --> 18:31.360
world weariness and its philosophical results. And Nietzsche makes an important point. He

18:31.360 --> 18:37.200
says, this is not just me, I'm aware of it. I'm a philosophical psychologist. But every

18:37.200 --> 18:42.320
philosopher, if he really is an interpretation of the body, in a sense, every philosopher

18:42.320 --> 18:47.960
feels some sort of psychological tension or pull and need for meaning or purpose. And in

18:48.000 --> 18:53.760
fact, he says, most of them are misinterpretations of the body. They're a tendency to read one's

18:53.760 --> 19:00.760
psychic organic needs into nature. Given that, Nietzsche says, I will not do that. I will

19:04.800 --> 19:10.920
not treat my own projections as a serious, profound, deep thing that underlies the world.

19:11.200 --> 19:18.200
Rather than being profound and deep, we should be, as he says, like the Greeks. Oh, those

19:19.920 --> 19:26.920
Greeks, they knew how to live. What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface,

19:27.080 --> 19:32.680
the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, and the whole

19:32.680 --> 19:39.680
Olympus of appearance. Those Greeks were superficial, out of profundity. And this is, and is not

19:40.320 --> 19:45.600
this precisely what we are again coming back to. We dare devils of the spirit who have

19:45.600 --> 19:49.840
climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought and looked down from up

19:49.840 --> 19:56.840
there. We have looked down from there. Are we not precisely in this respect Greeks, adores

19:57.480 --> 20:04.480
of forms, of tones of words, and therefore, artists? And I think that celebration is the

20:04.600 --> 20:09.600
realization that, you know, there are some serious questions that might be raised, which

20:09.600 --> 20:14.600
it's just indecent for any gentleman to raise. And he tells a story of, you know, there's

20:14.600 --> 20:20.600
this anecdote about this woman who, this young girl who once asked her mother, is God everywhere?

20:20.600 --> 20:24.600
She said, of course, God is everywhere. And the child said, well, that's, I think that's

20:24.600 --> 20:30.600
thoroughly indecent. God follows me into the bathroom. I mean, is God aware, is God there

20:31.600 --> 20:37.600
when I'm picking my nose? Oh, that's, that's horrible. And Nietzsche says, well, there

20:37.600 --> 20:42.040
may be something to that. A wise man knows what are the fair questions and what sort

20:42.040 --> 20:49.040
of questions not to ask. Okay, now we turn to the body of the text itself. Nietzsche

20:49.040 --> 20:55.360
added a sort of introduction, which he called joke, cunning, and revenge, which will turn

20:55.360 --> 21:01.560
out to be the strategies of gay science. And the book introduces all of the major themes

21:01.560 --> 21:08.560
that will be discussed in the text. The very first of these little poems is called invitation,

21:09.120 --> 21:14.640
and it is exactly that. It's an invitation to the text. Take a chance and try my affair.

21:14.640 --> 21:20.120
It will grow on you, I swear. Soon it will taste good to you if by then you should want

21:20.120 --> 21:27.120
more. All the things I've done before will inspire things quite new. And the point Nietzsche

21:28.440 --> 21:34.120
is making is if you follow this book and begin to think dangerous thoughts, you won't follow

21:34.120 --> 21:40.360
me. You will create your own. And I think he wonderfully expresses this in his ninth

21:40.360 --> 21:47.360
little poem called My Roses. Yes, my joy wants to amuse. Every joy wants to amuse. Would

21:47.960 --> 21:53.560
you like to pick my roses? You must stoop and stick your noses between thorns and rocky

21:53.560 --> 22:00.460
views and not be afraid of bruises. For my joy enjoys good teases. For my joy enjoys

22:00.460 --> 22:06.960
good roses. Would you like to pick my roses? All of the aphorisms in this book are Nietzsche's

22:06.960 --> 22:12.760
roses. He's beckoning us and saying, look, you're going to find some thorny issues here,

22:12.760 --> 22:18.760
some pricklish issues here. But that is the nature of his joy, of his happiness, of his

22:18.760 --> 22:25.760
happy-go-lucky mischievousness. In his fifth little poem, he introduces his, what I would

22:27.280 --> 22:32.240
call, meta-ethical critique, which is not his ethical doctrine, but his doctrine about

22:32.240 --> 22:38.000
the way we should feel towards ethics. What troubled Nietzsche was how particular parts

22:38.000 --> 22:42.560
of our culture, particularly of our philosophical culture, are claimed to trump the others.

22:42.560 --> 22:47.360
Our moral duties come first. And Nietzsche said, well, morality is fine, of course. But

22:47.360 --> 22:52.840
is it all of life? Must we learn how to morally eat our food? Must we learn what are the morally

22:52.840 --> 22:59.840
correct ways to fold our napkins? Why should our virtues be grave? We like ours nimble-footed.

22:59.960 --> 23:06.960
Even like Homer's verse, they have to come and go. Sometimes virtue and morality should

23:08.880 --> 23:13.680
leave us in peace for a while so we can do something else, like be creative, do art,

23:13.680 --> 23:20.680
do science. Morality is not the measure of all things. And I think perhaps his most wonderful

23:20.760 --> 23:26.240
expression of this is in the text itself, I'm jumping out of place, I know, called dealing

23:26.240 --> 23:33.240
with virtues. In dealing with a virtue, too, one can lack dignity and fawn. And clearly

23:34.360 --> 23:41.360
I think the figure he's responding to here is Kant. Oh yes, we must do our duties. Don't

23:41.360 --> 23:44.880
you think that's rather bad form, Kant? Don't you think it's rather bad form to constantly

23:44.880 --> 23:49.800
fawn before your duties, like they were a sort of surrogate god? It shows a real lack of

23:49.800 --> 23:56.800
taste. Well, he also introduces himself as a problem in the text. He says, in a wonderful

23:58.080 --> 24:05.080
passage called Request, the minds of others I know well, but who I am, I cannot tell.

24:05.520 --> 24:11.760
My eye is much too close to me, I am not what I saw and see. It would be quite a benefit.

24:11.760 --> 24:17.720
If only I could sometimes sit farther away, but my foes are too distant, close friends

24:17.720 --> 24:24.720
still too far, between my friends and me the middle would do my wish, you guess my riddle.

24:24.760 --> 24:30.760
I need you to make a deep point. If there is no real self in there, but only masks, perspectives,

24:30.760 --> 24:36.200
I'm a little too close to my own mask to see who I really am. That's your job, the reader

24:36.200 --> 24:40.200
and my job, the reader, the expositor, to try and figure out Nietzsche and come back to

24:40.200 --> 24:47.200
him and tell him who he is. But, of course, this has a sort of selfish side to it too,

24:48.920 --> 24:53.480
which Nietzsche is quite aware of, as in for your consideration. Double pain is easier

24:53.480 --> 25:00.480
to bear than single pain. Do you accept my dare? Try and think my, quote, dangerous thoughts.

25:01.480 --> 25:08.480
Okay, and then finally one last theme in this introduction, and we can turn to the rest

25:10.760 --> 25:17.760
of the body of the text, and that is his, what I would call, tasteful critique of Christianity.

25:18.820 --> 25:25.820
He says, in a wonderful little poem called, Chusy Taste, if it depended on my choice,

25:25.980 --> 25:32.980
I think it might be great to have a place in paradise, better yet, outside the gate.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.100
And Nietzsche is making a very deep point here. He's saying, look, stop being pious

25:37.100 --> 25:41.100
for a minute and be honest with me. What do you think goes on in heaven? Everyone sits

25:41.100 --> 25:46.940
in beatific vision, genuflecting towards the deity. What a particularly boring person he

25:46.940 --> 25:51.780
must be. Would you really want to spend time there? All the interesting people are in hell.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.900
Well, they may well be suffering, of course. We don't want to be in hell. We might want

25:55.900 --> 26:01.060
to look at paradise to see that wonderful splendor, but it's beneath the dignity of a

26:01.060 --> 26:07.420
gentleman to waste his time in heaven, and that's Chusy Taste. He doesn't want to be

26:07.420 --> 26:14.420
part of that, shall we call it, herd? Nietzsche always does. One more passage about his Chusy

26:14.780 --> 26:21.780
Taste, and then we can leave it behind, and that is his statement against Christianity,

26:23.460 --> 26:29.960
which again is not only sharp and invective, but actually extremely accurate. Against Christianity,

26:29.960 --> 26:35.060
what is now decisive against Christianity is our taste, no longer our reason. That may

26:35.060 --> 26:40.300
seem absurd at first, but go to a college campus and listen to, especially an elite one, and

26:40.340 --> 26:44.540
listen to the young rail against the stupidities of religion, and you'll notice something.

26:44.540 --> 26:49.740
They haven't a good argument among them. Any sophisticated theologian will persistently

26:49.740 --> 26:54.980
best them in argument, and Nietzsche's point is, but the young won't be convinced. It's

26:54.980 --> 27:00.980
not reasons that turn them against Christianity anymore. It's taste. How thoroughly musty

27:00.980 --> 27:07.980
and brown to believe in that sort of heavy-handed, baroque sort of belief. The youth have developed

27:08.780 --> 27:15.780
a higher form of taste, which clearly shows that it's too stolid, too, as it were, beef-headed.

27:18.460 --> 27:24.060
As he says, mystical explanations are thought to be profound. The truth is, they're not

27:24.060 --> 27:31.060
even superficial. Nietzsche is saying, look, stop looking at religion from the scales of

27:31.300 --> 27:38.300
piety, and look at it literally, and it's thoroughly absurd. Okay. We now turn to Book

27:39.100 --> 27:46.100
One, which I would argue constitutes a species of shock therapy. Nietzsche is, in a certain

27:49.940 --> 27:55.620
way, trying to preach what I would call tough love. We've all been brought up in a culture

27:55.660 --> 28:01.740
which has brainwashed us into thinking like, it wants us to think, thinking like members

28:01.740 --> 28:06.780
of a herd. And the only way to break us free from that and liberate us is to shock us,

28:06.780 --> 28:13.300
is to scare us, is to show us the absurdity of these views in a most harsh fashion. So

28:13.300 --> 28:19.620
he begins with his very first aphorism, the teachers of the purpose of existence. He says,

28:19.620 --> 28:24.260
whether I contemplate men with benevolence or with an evil eye, I always find them concerned

28:24.260 --> 28:28.380
with a single task, all of them and every one of them in particular, to do what is good

28:28.380 --> 28:35.220
for the preservation of the species. Not from any feeling of love, but merely because nothing

28:35.220 --> 28:41.300
in them is older, stronger, more inexorable, and unconquerable than this instinct, because

28:41.300 --> 28:47.820
this instinct constitutes the essence of our species, our herd. And this is extremely

28:47.820 --> 28:52.980
Darwinian point he's making, that if you're kind to other people, and if you try to help

28:52.980 --> 28:57.060
the species, it's not because you've thought about it, if you have sentences that describe

28:57.060 --> 29:02.020
why you do it, you added those lies later. You do it because you're genetically programmed

29:02.020 --> 29:09.020
to do that. That's how Mr. DNA uses us to replicate ourselves. He goes on to say, if

29:09.860 --> 29:16.860
you think about it, hatred, mischievousness, evil, are all indispensable for the life of

29:18.220 --> 29:23.300
the species? They bring out characteristics, noble characteristics in us, perhaps virtuous

29:23.300 --> 29:27.260
and kind characteristics, which would otherwise go rotten if they weren't occasionally evil

29:27.260 --> 29:33.760
people and bad things. In fact, if we look at it scientifically, we can prove that it

29:33.760 --> 29:40.760
has, in fact, preserved the species so far. But Nietzsche's fear is that we may have reached

29:40.920 --> 29:47.080
the point where we can no longer even think bad thoughts, even think our way outside of

29:47.080 --> 29:54.080
the herd. For if one could, one could then respond not with a sort of vitriolic anger,

29:54.960 --> 30:00.000
but with laughter, as he says, to laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in order

30:00.000 --> 30:07.000
to laugh out of the whole truth, to do that, even the best so far lacks sufficient genius.

30:07.600 --> 30:14.240
Even laughter may yet have a future. I mean, when the proposition, the species is everything,

30:14.240 --> 30:19.600
one is always none, has become part of humanity, and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility

30:19.600 --> 30:23.940
has become accessible to all at all times, perhaps laughter will then have formed an

30:23.940 --> 30:30.260
alliance with wisdom. Perhaps only gay science will then be left. And Nietzsche's referring

30:30.260 --> 30:34.340
to what he thinks is an extremely dangerous development in the late nineteenth century,

30:34.340 --> 30:39.300
which is the growth of humanitarianism, of kindness and gentleness. He's not against

30:39.300 --> 30:45.300
those things in and of themselves, but they're totalitarian. They insist that everything

30:45.300 --> 30:52.100
devolve around them. And he says, you know, there's this weird fruit that's grown on the

30:52.100 --> 30:57.060
tree of the human species in the last few hundred years called the individual, which

30:57.060 --> 31:02.300
doesn't follow the herd. But of course, if we can all become liberals and socialists,

31:02.300 --> 31:07.300
we can stamp that out. It's a sort of happy-go-lucky totalitarianism.

31:07.300 --> 31:14.620
And then he turns to the real issue, what are the meaning of teachers of the purpose

31:14.620 --> 31:20.660
of existence? Heroes who show up on the stage and tell us, life means this, you must go

31:20.740 --> 31:26.820
out and do your duty, you must save humanity, you must be kind to the poor and the oppressed.

31:26.820 --> 31:30.060
There's something profound about the meaning of life. And he says, well, they actually

31:30.060 --> 31:36.100
have a place. They actually have a function. Right? What they do is tell us there's something

31:36.100 --> 31:40.620
in life that can't be laughed at. There's something serious beneath life, behind life,

31:40.620 --> 31:46.380
underneath life. Beware, do not laugh. And he says, well, of course, ultimately all

31:46.380 --> 31:52.780
of these systems get exposed to reason, and the result is always laughter and comedy because

31:52.780 --> 31:56.580
they're all absurd and ridiculous, none of them are provable. But nonetheless, there's

31:56.580 --> 32:03.580
something new that's come out of this. Humans are the only animals that have, how to say,

32:04.100 --> 32:11.100
grown a new need, a need for a purpose. We feel the need to have a reason to go on living.

32:11.100 --> 32:15.740
And he says, this is fascinating. Dogs don't do that. Has your dog ever come up to you

32:15.740 --> 32:19.700
and say, it's a dog's life, alpoh three times a day. I'm just going to go ahead and do

32:19.700 --> 32:24.020
it all. No, I mean, every animal does how to go on, but we have this other need. And

32:24.020 --> 32:29.180
the reason is, because teachers of the purpose of existence offer us cultural narcotics.

32:29.180 --> 32:34.460
They somatize us. They make us, as it were, stoned and happy so that we cannot look at

32:34.460 --> 32:40.540
the suffering that is most of life. And Nietzsche's point then of tough love is, that's the way

32:40.540 --> 32:44.740
you break the addiction. I point out to you that it is all absurd.

32:44.740 --> 32:50.420
Then he turns to the problem of intellectual conscience. I keep having the same experience

32:50.420 --> 32:55.300
and keep resisting it every time. I don't want to believe, although it's palpable, that

32:55.300 --> 33:00.300
the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to

33:00.300 --> 33:05.020
me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as lonely in the most densely

33:05.020 --> 33:11.500
populated cities as if you were in a desert. Everyone goes right on weighing things in

33:11.500 --> 33:17.140
their scales of good and bad and right and evil. When anyone who cares to take a close

33:17.140 --> 33:21.380
look at that finds that it's absurd, that evil has an indispensable place in the evolution

33:21.380 --> 33:25.180
of the human species. It creates the sort of stormy conditions which make a tree grow

33:25.180 --> 33:32.540
strong and firm. And he says, I can't help feeling that deep down inside every single

33:32.580 --> 33:39.460
person has at least the desire for an intellectual conscience. And he says, this is my type of

33:39.460 --> 33:43.660
injustice, which leads directly to the next aphorism. We were going to find that Nietzsche

33:43.660 --> 33:49.020
is actually a profoundly fair person. This aphorism is called noble and common. And he

33:49.020 --> 33:53.900
says there's a certain confusion. You find that there are people called, quote, normal,

33:53.900 --> 33:58.860
or noble, who are incredibly unreasonable. They somehow throw their life on the rocks

33:58.860 --> 34:05.580
of art, or science, or philosophy, squandering their lives for some higher ideal. He says

34:05.580 --> 34:09.380
the common person looks at that. And the first thing they think is, how's he getting over?

34:09.380 --> 34:13.380
Right? How's he going to turn that into money? I know that's what he's doing. He's going

34:13.380 --> 34:17.500
to turn it into money. Everyone does it, turns it into money. And then after a certain point,

34:17.500 --> 34:21.620
when he realizes this guy's not making any money, he says, well, he's an idiot. He's

34:21.620 --> 34:26.180
a dope. And he says, and that's the injustice of the common person. He can't imagine someone

34:26.180 --> 34:30.700
who doesn't have his own straightforward proclivities. He says, on the other hand, there is the noble

34:30.700 --> 34:36.180
person who aspires to higher things. But he too is unjust, because he turns to the common

34:36.180 --> 34:41.020
person and says, well, you too have these aspirations. Why is history so stupid? People

34:41.020 --> 34:47.900
live subveno lives. And Nietzsche says, that is the injustice of the noble. They assume

34:47.900 --> 34:52.700
that everyone is just like them. And so they don't judge them by the proper standards.

34:52.700 --> 34:55.980
So when you find common people and say, why don't you aspire to higher things? He just

34:55.980 --> 34:59.900
says, that's an unfair criticism. They're not capable of that. You must judge them by

34:59.900 --> 35:06.140
their own standards, by their own rationality. And in fact, he says the ultimate noble mindedness

35:06.140 --> 35:12.580
is for those who are noble to want to be the exception and not the rule. For the bulk of

35:12.580 --> 35:18.140
humanity must be sympathetically understood as common. And that's not a bad thing. That's

35:18.140 --> 35:22.540
just the way they are. They're not to be rebuked for that any more than the noble are for being

35:22.540 --> 35:36.340
profound. Finally, I want to turn to, in this shock treatment, his fifth aphorism, unconditional

35:36.340 --> 35:43.900
duties. All those who feel the need, feel they need the strongest words and sounds, the most

35:43.900 --> 35:49.020
eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective at all, such as revolutionary

35:49.020 --> 35:54.300
politicians, socialists, preachers of repentance, with or without Christianity, all of whom

35:54.300 --> 36:00.780
cannot tolerate semi-success, talk of duties and always of duties that are supposed to

36:00.780 --> 36:08.500
be unconditional. And this clearly is a jive, it can't. This point is, oh yes, we have some

36:08.500 --> 36:12.060
moral conviction I want to give you, which I can't prove to you. So all I do is I dress

36:12.060 --> 36:16.660
it up in big words, oh, it's an unconditional duty. It's a categorical imperative. It's the

36:16.660 --> 36:21.740
purpose of human existence. It says, well, you find that because there are certain people,

36:21.740 --> 36:27.740
like, say, Kant, who are too noble, perhaps from their birth, perhaps from an experience

36:27.740 --> 36:33.260
of their education, to be willing to serve as the function of a political party or to

36:33.260 --> 36:38.540
be someone's personal servant. But they still feel the need to be a function of something.

36:38.540 --> 36:46.460
So they come up with these pompous principles, unconditional duties. And as he states, refined

36:46.460 --> 36:52.060
servility clings to the categorical imperative and is the mortal enemy of those who wish

36:52.060 --> 36:58.980
to deprive duty of its unconditional character. That is what decency demands of them and not

36:58.980 --> 37:04.740
only decency. And I think this is a deep point. He's not being an anti-moralist. He's saying,

37:04.740 --> 37:11.180
look, morality has its place. But why can't you tolerate semi-success? Why can't you tolerate

37:11.180 --> 37:14.580
saying, you know, kindness is better than cruelty? Not because I'm certain about it, but it

37:14.580 --> 37:18.820
seems that way to me. He says, no problem with that. But no, you have to say, no, I

37:18.820 --> 37:29.020
can prove to you that kindness is better than cruelty. He says, well, that's pathological.

37:29.020 --> 37:34.260
I now want to turn to the discussion of the doctrine of feeling of power, one of the most

37:34.260 --> 37:38.820
misunderstood doctrines in all of Nietzsche's writings. As we know, he believes that we're

37:38.820 --> 37:44.540
all full of a will to power. And many people believe that means that he favored inflection

37:44.540 --> 37:50.500
of cruelty and suffering. Nietzsche points out, no, no, no, no. Look, inflicting suffering

37:50.500 --> 37:54.860
and cruelty on people is a form of showing your will to power. But it's the will to power

37:54.860 --> 38:01.380
of a weak man. How much more easy is it to make someone suffer than to benefit them?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.820
In other words, if you want to see who's the real megalomaniac, the one who's really full

38:04.820 --> 38:10.700
of power, look at someone who's kind. What are they showing? I'm so overflowing with

38:10.700 --> 38:17.420
life and power that I have some extra I can give you. And you'll be beholden to me. That

38:17.420 --> 38:22.060
is the real warrior ideal of Nietzsche, not a cruel man, but a kind man. And a kind man

38:22.060 --> 38:26.700
is kind for pathological reasons, because it fulfills his feeling of empowerment to

38:26.700 --> 38:36.300
help people. That is, as he would say, a profound sense of empowerment. But he points out, never

38:36.300 --> 38:42.820
will such a man be kind out of pity. Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those

38:42.820 --> 38:47.660
who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests. Rather, he'll be kind out

38:47.660 --> 38:54.060
of a sense of overflowing greatness. Another issue which Nietzsche has been incredibly

38:54.060 --> 38:58.060
misunderstood about, because he's dialectical and he does say some ugly things on the subject,

38:58.060 --> 39:02.340
is women. But as we'll find out, Nietzsche is a dialectical thinker. He sees two sides

39:02.340 --> 39:06.180
of every issue. For all of his misogyny, he has this wonderful little passage called

39:06.180 --> 39:12.340
Diverse Disatisfaction, which he says, you know, the weak and feminine type. What they

39:12.340 --> 39:17.860
do when they see a problem or suffering is they make it more beautiful, more profound.

39:17.860 --> 39:22.580
Whereas the masculine and strong type, it makes things better. It actually improves them.

39:22.580 --> 39:28.380
Right, and here we see a little, sounds like it's going to be a great piece of misogyny.

39:28.380 --> 39:37.700
But Nietzsche responds by saying, if this type, the feminine, had not been superabundant

39:37.700 --> 39:44.100
in Europe since the Middle Ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant change might

39:44.100 --> 39:48.220
never have come into existence. China, for example, is a country in which large-scale

39:48.220 --> 39:53.260
dissatisfaction and the capacity for change have become extinct centuries ago, and the

39:53.260 --> 40:00.420
socialists would like to bring that to Europe. But fortunately, Nietzsche is not masculine.

40:00.420 --> 40:06.820
Nietzsche is feminine. Don't make it better. That just makes us stupid like a herd. The

40:06.820 --> 40:11.620
feminine is the superior. We should make it beautiful. We should make it profound. That's

40:11.620 --> 40:24.660
what enables change and dynamism in life. Okay, finally, I want to turn to the last

40:24.660 --> 40:28.700
part of book one, from which we'll go right to the end of the text after that, called

40:28.700 --> 40:34.060
The Craving for Suffering, which is a wonderfully liberating text for anyone who spent much

40:34.060 --> 40:42.100
time on a college campus, where you will be surrounded by students who protest injustice

40:42.100 --> 40:47.220
and suffering and cruelty in the world. And Nietzsche is not against protesting suffering

40:47.220 --> 40:51.540
and cruelty. He thinks that's barbaric. He doesn't want barbarians. But he wants to be

40:51.540 --> 40:59.980
honest about why they do it. He says, what you really find is, what young people want

40:59.980 --> 41:05.060
is suffering to come to them in the form of a big dragon. There's evil thing out there

41:05.060 --> 41:10.980
that's objective, so that they can dress up in armor and be heroes in chivalrous nights

41:10.980 --> 41:16.620
and go kill the dragon. So they need suffering. They want suffering, and more and more suffering

41:16.620 --> 41:20.780
and suffering with others. Let's save the whales. Let's save the amoebas. Let's save

41:20.780 --> 41:26.940
the plankton. Oh, yes. And he says, and the reason is, of course, because they're bored

41:26.940 --> 41:31.660
with themselves, as well as they should be. They don't have the ability to create their

41:31.660 --> 41:37.380
own authentic suffering and then transcend it with art. So they look to paint suffering

41:37.380 --> 41:45.100
on the wall like a big dragon. And he says, they do not know what to do with themselves

41:45.100 --> 41:49.740
and therefore paint the distress of others on the wall. They always need others and continually

41:49.740 --> 41:57.580
other others. Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall.

41:57.580 --> 42:01.940
Why must we be obsessed with suffering? It's not going to go out of the world. The Buddha

42:01.940 --> 42:07.860
was right. Life is suffering. So why dwell on it, young people? Think of the joys of

42:07.860 --> 42:15.300
life. Paint your happiness on the wall. Okay, finally now, I wish to take you to the end

42:15.300 --> 42:22.980
of the text. To two important, I think extremely important, aphorisms, one number 340, the

42:22.980 --> 42:30.260
dying Socrates, in which he quite rightly points out that when Socrates is about to take hemlock,

42:30.260 --> 42:36.740
he says, oh, Crito, one of the students, I owe Asclepius a rooster. Asclepius is the

42:36.740 --> 42:42.580
god of medicine. And the rooster is obviously a sacrifice to him. And Nietzsche says, what

42:42.580 --> 42:50.780
does this really mean? You give Asclepius a rooster when he's cured of disease. What's

42:50.780 --> 42:58.620
the disease Nietzsche is being cured of? Life. Nietzsche experienced life as, excuse me,

42:58.620 --> 43:03.180
Socrates experienced life as a weight. And he says, and this is a terrifying thought.

43:03.180 --> 43:09.140
Because Nietzsche, Socrates, the good soldier who always wore a chipper and stoical domain

43:09.140 --> 43:14.420
on his face in his last dying breath with a sort of vicious vengeance said, really life

43:14.420 --> 43:19.860
is a disease and I've been cured at last. So he says, therefore we must overcome the

43:19.860 --> 43:25.060
Greeks. Now that's a very perspectival point. You needn't read it that way. You could read

43:25.060 --> 43:30.980
it as saying, I've overcome the fear of death, therefore give Asclepius a rooster. But it

43:30.980 --> 43:38.340
is, in its own way, a perfect example of perspectivalism. I now want to turn to the last and most

43:38.340 --> 43:45.380
important aphorism called the greatest weight. The greatest weight is Nietzsche's doctrine

43:45.380 --> 43:51.780
of eternal return, eternal recurrence, which is, I think originally a Hindu notion, which

43:51.780 --> 43:56.940
is that we have cyclical time. Everything that happens will happen again. Ten thousand

43:56.940 --> 44:00.820
years from now, we'll all be sitting here all over again and I'll be saying the same

44:00.820 --> 44:06.660
words to you. And as we know, what, when the Hindus thought of that as any sane man would,

44:06.660 --> 44:09.780
not the first thing that occurred to them is what a nightmare. Ninety percent of my

44:09.780 --> 44:14.620
life quit fantasizing. Ninety percent of each of our lives is embarrassment, humiliation

44:14.620 --> 44:20.860
and stupidity. Who wants to relive their bedwetting? Right? Who wants to relive all the wrong answers

44:20.860 --> 44:24.660
they gave in high school algebra? And all the times they got laughed at. And all the

44:24.660 --> 44:28.780
times they said stupid, dopey things and felt bad about it later. Most of your life is embarrassing

44:28.780 --> 44:32.580
and banal. So the Hindus said, well we want to get off the life death wheel of karma. We

44:32.580 --> 44:37.820
want to achieve nirvana, which is basically cosmic death. We don't want to be reborn.

44:37.820 --> 44:42.460
And Nietzsche said that that was one of the biggest dangers facing Europe at the time.

44:42.460 --> 44:47.020
And it got a wonderful expression in Schopenhauer's work, who said, we will all have real freedom

44:47.020 --> 44:51.540
when all of humanity gets together on one day and drinks Jim Jane Jones Kool-Aid, Kimitz

44:51.540 --> 44:54.820
Collective Suicide. He really thought this was liberation. And it was considered a very

44:54.820 --> 45:00.020
profound thought. And Nietzsche responds by saying, no, eternal return is an excellent

45:00.020 --> 45:04.380
test of whether you have the possibility of being a quote, ubermensch, which is not a

45:04.380 --> 45:09.260
superman, which is not a tyrant, which is an overman, which is the next stage of man,

45:09.260 --> 45:13.940
the man who can see the truth of perspectivalism, the truth of groundlessness, the truth of

45:13.940 --> 45:17.980
purposelessness, the truth of the fact that he might have to live this whole stupid life

45:17.980 --> 45:24.140
over again and still say, yes, I'll take it anyways. Life is not a problem for me. It's

45:24.140 --> 45:29.340
full of delightful possibilities. I can self create myself an art. I can overcome myself

45:29.340 --> 45:36.780
an art. In fact, it is art that makes perspectival truth bearable by making it beautiful. So

45:36.780 --> 45:42.340
eternal return then becomes a litmus test. If, if when you think to yourself, do I have

45:42.340 --> 45:47.540
to live my life all over again exactly as I have, if you can say yes to that and say

45:47.540 --> 45:52.100
with all its stupidity, with all my bedwetting, with all my wrong answers, I want it all over

45:52.100 --> 45:58.300
again just as it is. Nietzsche says, then you are a philosophic soul. You've overcome

45:58.300 --> 46:04.340
that narcotic need for a purpose to your life, and you are the next stage of human

46:04.340 --> 46:10.540
cultural development. And let me be clear about one thing before I finish here. Very

46:10.540 --> 46:18.540
often that is depicted as a sort of Aryan blonde beast in our old Schwarzenegger type.

46:18.540 --> 46:23.260
Nietzsche thought, you can never go back to that. That's just barbarism. The higher

46:23.340 --> 46:29.340
formed, the ubermensch would in fact be like Nietzsche, a very sensitive soul who for all

46:29.340 --> 46:35.740
his quote anti-Semitism was really an anti-anti-Semite. He had the very obnoxious habit of saying

46:35.740 --> 46:40.740
things like, you know, because by the way I should point out that Germany was intensely

46:40.740 --> 46:44.460
anti-Semitic at this point in something called Christian anti-Semitism. So what he would

46:44.460 --> 46:47.740
do is point that and say, you know, the Old Testament is actually a great book. The sick

46:47.740 --> 46:52.060
part is the New Testament. To read the Old Testament, it's better than Homer. People kill,

46:52.060 --> 46:59.060
they rape, they murder. Those were real men. It's the Nazarene that's distorted. And one

46:59.060 --> 47:03.700
last point on that subject. He said the only people more despicable than the Christians

47:03.700 --> 47:10.140
are of course the Germans who were afflicted with, he called it racial scabies of the heart,

47:10.140 --> 47:16.140
who said, have you ever noticed a German musician? The moment he creates something beautiful,

47:16.140 --> 47:22.020
he blushes, right? He has to always have his opera surrounded, and he is clearly referring

47:22.020 --> 47:26.840
to Wagner, his ex-friend, has to have his opera surrounded with great, huge sets and

47:26.840 --> 47:30.860
theories. He says, no, no, no, look at the Italian operas. Those are people who know

47:30.860 --> 47:35.020
how to live. Those are Ubermench. Why? Because they'd be just as happy to have their, their

47:35.020 --> 47:38.500
sopranos go up there and go, la, la, la, la, la, for three hours without a single word

47:38.500 --> 47:42.300
in it. Because they're not trying to be profound, they're trying to be beautiful. They don't

47:42.340 --> 47:45.940
feel uncomfortable when they say something nice, or when they say something beautiful,

47:45.940 --> 47:52.140
a beautiful phrase. So only a German does that. And his perfect contrast is Beethoven

47:52.140 --> 47:58.020
and Goethe. One day they were walking together supposedly, and along came a member of the

47:58.020 --> 48:02.620
royal family, and Beethoven locked arms with Goethe and said, we shall walk through, and

48:02.620 --> 48:08.020
they'll have to give way. And Goethe broke his arm. He said, what a barbarian, please

48:08.040 --> 48:15.040
not a man for you. That is the Ubermench. Not some sadistic tyrant, but a cultivated,

48:15.540 --> 48:20.900
refined, refined person who sees laughter in everything, and joyfulness in the truth,

48:20.900 --> 48:26.660
who doesn't need a spiritual narcotic to get through life, who is compassionate out of

48:26.660 --> 48:33.660
strength, not out of weakness and pity, and who judges the weak not as inferior, but as

48:34.420 --> 48:37.860
common by their own standard, not by his.

48:37.860 --> 48:44.860
Okay, I've given you a taste of Nietzsche. I think the only better way to cash in this

48:46.180 --> 48:50.380
lecture is to turn to the text yourselves, and I think you'll find it richly rewarding.
