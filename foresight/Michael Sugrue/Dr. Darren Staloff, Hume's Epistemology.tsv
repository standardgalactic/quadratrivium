23900	33300	David Hume is, in many ways, one of the most important, and I would urge, attractive figures
33300	43100	in the Western philosophical tradition, a man of great wit, affability, charm.
43100	50620	Hume was, by all who knew him, regarded as a admirable person, a pleasant person, a man
50620	55580	who had very few arguments in his life, was very difficult to ever race his temper, he
55580	61140	only once became angry, apparently, and that was against Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had
61140	64140	stated his house and accused Hume of stealing his ideas.
64140	69820	If any of you have read Rousseau and read Hume, you know that's a sign of Rousseau's
69820	72100	paranoid insanity.
72100	76540	Hume and Rousseau could not be more entirely apart in their views.
76940	84580	Nonetheless, given this about Hume, he was, in his own lifetime, a remarkably obscure
84580	91100	philosophical figure, and this was largely the result of, one, the very skeptical nature
91100	99180	of his conclusions, he was thought to be very dreary and uninspiring, and the rather technical
99180	103900	precision of his arguments, he was a very difficult writer, he didn't inspire people.
104660	111380	I will argue that Hume has an inspirational side, but it's very much in keeping with
111380	115660	his character, it's very dry, it's very a dour sort of inspiration.
115660	121260	In fact, as a way of illustrating the way people misconceive Hume, when I first read
121260	125940	Hume in college, I immediately assumed, because he's an incredibly powerful and accurate
125940	131860	analytic thinker, that I had a mental picture of the fellow as a very thin, wiry, school
131940	137780	marmish professor, very, very accurate and precise, in fact, the very picture of Immanuel
137780	146540	Kant, I was much surprised to learn that, in fact, he was a large, robust, rotund Scotsman
146540	153820	with a heavy, heavy brogue, who could always be counted on for a good joke, a pint of ale
153820	158380	and a leg of mutton, he was very much a laughing philosopher.
158380	163620	In many ways, is one of the most challenging figures in the philosophic tradition up to
163620	165460	this point.
165460	170220	The only one I could compare him to in this regard is Spinoza, you remember that Spinoza
170220	178260	was challenging in that he was the first complete rejecter of the Judeo-Christian ethic, completely
178260	183620	rejected the notion of the immortality of the soul, of freedom of the will, and we will
183620	190340	find Hume shares those beliefs, also his skeptical Judeo-Christian tradition.
190340	197700	In a way, he's far more damaging and challenging than Spinoza, whereas Spinoza is disgusted
197700	204780	with that tradition and finds it a name, Hume, as is his want, is amused by it, he thinks
204780	209540	it's absolutely hilarious that there are people who go to church, he thinks it's wonderful,
209540	213800	he thinks it's the absolute quote, these knees that people believe that somehow they're
213800	218060	not animals, and he thinks this is just part of the good sport of life, that there are
218060	221820	people out there who really believe such absurd things, and he does not want to dissuade them
221820	230620	in any sense, he rather wants to laugh with his small group of esoteric insiders, as it
230620	232100	were.
232100	239260	Hume's historical significance is that he brought to full fruition the empiricist epistemology
239260	245100	and a phenomenology that really begins with Hobbes, matures with Locke, as we saw, is developed
245100	248780	by Barclay, Hume in a certain way brings it to a close.
248780	254740	He takes it to its logical extremes, to its point of logical conclusion, and sort of ties
254740	258740	it up with a very nice bow.
258740	266140	Although he never made much great fame in his lifetime, afterwards he has become one
266140	268620	of the most important philosophers in the tradition.
268620	273900	He had a profound effect on a certain Prussian philosopher by the name of Immanuel Kant,
273900	279500	who claims, I read David Hume, he awoke me from my dogmatic slumbers.
279500	284620	Kant claimed that Hume was, and I think one could say in defense of Kant, that Kant was
284620	288340	the only one who understood Hume in the 18th century with the possible exception of Adam
288340	289340	Smith.
289340	294940	He was the only one who realized that this incredibly dry, dull, boring Scotsman is in
295020	300780	fact a wild man and is in fact on to the deepest critique of the philosophical tradition we
300780	303060	have found yet.
303060	309620	Since then, Hume has become a source of inspiration for utilitarian ethics in the 19th century.
309620	314620	We'll see the logical positivist movement of the 19th century, figures like Karnath,
314620	319580	Schick, Ayer, Wittgenstein, all claim that their ancestry runs to David Hume.
319580	322940	He's become an incredibly important thinker after his death.
322940	325940	I would urge he was strongly ahead of his time.
325940	330540	Okay, enough sort of background on Hume.
330540	335940	Let's then begin with his empiricist phenomenology.
335940	342620	Hume, like Barkley and Locke before him, recognized that all of our mental representations can
342620	345740	be divided into two classes.
345740	351180	On the one hand are impressions, and on the other hand are ideas.
351180	360420	Now, Hume is aware that, in fact, beyond aware, Hume's perhaps biggest project as a philosopher
360420	363260	is the avoidance of dogmatism.
363260	366380	And so he's aware that it would be dogmatic to say that our impressions are the result
366380	367980	of sense-statem.
367980	371860	He wants to suggest that that's provisionally the case, and that's what we seem to believe
371860	372860	in common sense.
372860	376540	And Hume, by the way, is a great partisan of common sense.
376540	380700	Presumably then let us say that our impressions are the results of sense-statem, but actually
380700	386540	the way we distinguish between those and our ideas, copies of impressions, is by their
386540	387540	vivacity.
387540	390380	Again, by that phenomenological property.
390380	396860	Your visual representation of me, when you look at me, is far more powerful and profound
396860	400140	and sharp than is, say, your recollection of what I looked like.
400140	402540	There's far more detail in the first class.
402540	407780	So that's the first class of our mental representations, impressions, distinguished
407780	409220	by their greater vivacity.
409220	415140	The second class are ideas or thoughts, and these are distinguished by their relative
415140	417540	lack of force and internal clarity.
417540	420540	Presumably, there are copies of impressions.
420540	426500	Again, your notion of your mental representation of me when you close your eyes is a copy of
426500	430740	your actual sense-datum of me, presumably.
430740	435260	And in fact, there's another mark to suggest that one is the copy of the other, the process
435260	437500	of temporal sequence.
437500	441780	You never have an idea of what I look like or image of me before you've actually seen
441780	442780	me.
442780	449580	If anything, your ideas follow your impressions, and that temporal sequence is a mark of copying
449580	451580	or causality.
451580	458460	Okay, now, Hume argued, or claimed, rather, I should say, on the basis of an introspective
458460	463460	and scientific observation, that there were only three principles with which the mind
463460	469620	associated the various ideas, not impressions, but ideas that it entertains.
469620	473820	And again, I want to be clear about something about Hume.
473820	478100	Hume is not arguing for any foundational view of the human mind.
478100	480980	He claimed to be the Newton of the moral sciences.
480980	485140	He was going to establish his philosophy on the basis of scientific observation.
485140	490580	He says, from his introspective scientific observation of his own cognitive states, there
490580	496860	are only three principles that associate the various ideas or images we have in the show
496860	502380	between our ears.
502380	504580	And the first of those is, of course, resemblance.
504580	505580	Right?
505580	512420	We say that the representation you have of me now strongly resembles the representation
512420	517860	you had of me when I was giving perchance to my Markley lecture.
517860	523860	And certain strength of resemblance leads one to posit identity, right?
523860	528140	But similarly, short of identity, we may say, there is a stronger resemblance between my
528140	533500	appearance and some other member of the audience's appearance than either of our appearance towards,
533500	535260	say, this lectern.
535260	540460	And therefore, we see how we form elementary set theory and elementary sorts of kinds.
540460	545500	There's a stronger, again, resemblance between the idea of me and any of you than between
545500	548860	myself and the lectern.
548860	551420	That's the first principle of association.
551420	556380	The second is contiguity, right?
556380	562900	All of our ideas can be related in terms of their spatial relationships or temporal relationships.
562900	568860	So I am, from my perspective, to the right of the lectern presently and behind it.
568860	573020	Now I'm to the left of the lectern and behind it, again, from my perspective.
573380	577700	Similarly, the sentences I am pronouncing now follow the sentences I pronounced, say,
577700	578860	some one minute ago.
578860	584700	So all of those representations fit into, as it were, spatial configuration and temporal
584700	585700	configuration.
585700	589940	That's the other principle, contiguity.
589940	594260	Now we get to the third and far and away, the most important.
594260	597540	And that has caused an effect, right?
597540	600540	You see me release the watch.
600540	602340	You see the effect of it falling.
602340	606500	You attribute a causal agency.
606500	608500	Okay.
608500	612220	Now, we have all the principles of association.
612220	614900	Let's now talk about our knowledge.
614900	619660	And again, that can be broken down into one of two classes.
619660	626220	The first class deals with the relations between ideas in a purely formal sense.
626220	632460	A human such knowledge is either intuitively certain or, if not, it is demonstrable.
632460	634580	Okay.
634580	637020	So what would be examples?
637020	644980	The common examples are the propositions of mathematics, geometry, algebra, formula logic.
644980	651180	Are all cases with the association where the truth of the sentences hinges on the relation
651180	655460	between the ideas and that relationship is purely formal.
655460	663420	In other words, a computer can formulate true mathematical or logical propositions.
663420	670740	The key for Hume is that such propositions have absolutely no existential implications.
670740	674540	We can accept all of Euclidean geometry as being true.
674540	678580	Every proposition, provable in the Euclidean geometry, we can accept is true without there
678580	680900	existing such a thing as a triangle.
681500	686380	Similarly, we can accept all the propositions as logic as true without believing that there
686380	693060	exists somewhere in the world a operator called the conditional or the disjunctive.
693060	699140	So that's a key point that that first class of knowledge, the relation between ideas is
699140	702060	purely formal and has no existential implications.
702060	706300	It teaches us nothing about the world, it only teaches us, as it were, a very rigorous
706300	710780	sort of vocabulary that we might be able to use in talking about the world.
711660	717100	In and of itself has nothing to say about existence and things of the world.
717100	724660	Things of the world are discussed in that second class of knowledge, which he calls
724660	727180	matters of fact.
727180	732220	Those propositions which concern existential statements are statements of fact.
732220	736860	The first thing to note is that there is no logical basis for all of our knowledge of
736860	738740	fact.
738740	739940	And how do we know that?
739940	745660	Because counterfactuals are all possible, which is to say, it is a fact that if I release
745660	747980	this watch, it will fall.
747980	753500	But it is entirely logically possible that if I release this watch, it would float up
753500	755020	to heaven.
755020	756940	It never has, right?
756940	761340	I've never observed that myself, but there is nothing that logically constrains this
761340	767140	watch to either fall down or not to simply remain sustained in the air.
767140	769940	If I was the amazing Kresge or something, I could do such a trick.
769940	776140	But this point is, since counterfactuals are all logically possible, right, then there
776140	780460	is no logical basis for knowledge of matters of fact.
780460	785700	Well, then that raises, for Hume, the critical epistemological question.
785700	787860	How do we know matters of fact?
787860	792500	Specifically, how do we know any matters of fact other than that which you are presently
792500	794820	sensing, right?
794820	801660	So you have good sensual evidence to believe that I am up here walking around.
801660	809940	But how do you know, for example, that I really was here earlier talking about Barclay?
809940	810940	How can you infer that?
810940	815380	How do you know that if you leave this room, this podium will still be here?
815380	817940	Oh, this lectern, I should say.
817940	823700	And Hume says that the answer is the principle of cause and effect, right?
823700	830020	You see my contiguity moving over from an earlier lecture to this one, and you assume
830020	833900	that there's one agent who is causing all of these changes, similarly with the lectern.
833900	838840	You assume that unless something comes in to move it, its inertial force will make it
838840	839840	remain here.
839840	844980	So the only way you can argue beyond your present sense datum is the fact that there
844980	849780	is a world outside, that there are lights above you producing heat and light, is because
849780	852100	of the principle of cause and effect.
852100	860100	It's the fundamental glue, as it were, epistemological glue of the factual world, because it allows
860100	864620	us to infer from sense to uncensed phenomena.
864620	870260	Now cause and effect is not known what we might call a priori, or before the fact, or
870260	872140	before experience.
872140	877740	Rather, it only comes from the experience of constant conjunction.
877740	880700	So again, back to our great experiment.
880700	885340	You did not know before you ever saw someone release an object that it would fall.
885340	891580	The only way you know that is that every time you've seen an object released, it falls.
891580	898980	That constant conjunction, release, fall, release, fall, is the only evidence you have
898980	904220	of that causal relation, and similarly it is with all the other causal relations.
904220	908540	The only way you know that eating a cheeseburger will satisfy you when you're hungry, if in
908540	912740	fact it does, is because that's happened in the past.
912740	916700	It is entirely conceivable that you can eat a cheeseburger and be three times as hungry
916700	917860	afterwards as before.
917860	922620	It doesn't happen that way because of the nature of our constant conjunctions and experience,
922620	924540	but all of our causal laws are just that.
924540	931020	We see regularity, constant conjunction, and from that we infer a causal relation.
931020	935820	Well, the implications for science, therefore, are very important.
935820	940700	If science gives us causal explanations, all it does in a way to use the metaphor from
940700	946140	the right stuff is it pushes back at the envelope of ignorance.
946140	953900	So when we learn the causal law, what causes this watch to fall, well, I release it.
953900	957540	What causes it to accelerate at the rate it does, the laws of gravity.
957540	959900	What causes the laws of gravity beats me.
959900	960900	We don't know yet.
960900	961900	Perhaps we will someday.
961900	964940	Perhaps Grand Unified Theory will supply the explanation, but all you do is you push
965020	968380	back that envelope of ignorance one step further.
968380	973140	That's an important empiricist and humane point, is that science never offers absolute
973140	974300	truth.
974300	978500	It's provisional truth, constantly subject to revision on the basis of new experience
978500	984980	and new formulation.
984980	988260	Back to our big epistemological fish we want to fry.
988260	993140	Given that all our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, and that
993140	998340	cause and effect is in turn based on experience, the experience of conscious and conjunctions,
998340	1002100	what warrants our belief and experience, right?
1002100	1006060	Well, it can't be reason, can it, or logic.
1006060	1011660	That can't warrant our belief and experience, for it's logically possible that the future
1011660	1013900	won't resemble the past, right?
1013900	1019340	It's entirely possible that in 15 minutes from now God will so change the universe that
1019340	1024500	whenever you release a watch it will float up to heaven, or it will remain suspended.
1024500	1028380	You have no logical evidence to suggest that that won't happen.
1028380	1033260	All you have is your past experience, right, and your present experience.
1033260	1037580	So clearly experience, which is the judgment that the future in fact will resemble the
1037580	1040780	present, can't be based on reason.
1040780	1044260	And by the way I should point out, you could also make that argument retrospectively, as
1044260	1045780	Bertrand Russell does.
1045780	1049980	How do we know the past is not different from the present?
1049980	1054700	How do we in fact know that once upon a time the sun really didn't move around the earth
1054700	1058860	and that the Bible didn't have it right and things have changed since then?
1058860	1063620	And that's the puzzle that Cune feels is the critical epistemological puzzle that has to
1063620	1065500	be solved.
1065500	1072260	And clearly we do not have any recourse to logic or reason in answering this question.
1073260	1080300	Well, you can't base experience on cause and effect for the obvious reason that cause
1080300	1082940	and effect is based on experience, right?
1082940	1088460	Our belief in causal laws is based on our experience of constant conjunction, so you
1088460	1094740	can't use those causal laws then circularly to support the belief that the future will
1094740	1101900	resemble the present or the past, because of course causal laws presuppose that resemblance.
1101900	1108340	This Hume luxuriates in this riddle for a while because he has a very obvious answer
1108340	1114340	and an answer which is going to offend all of the high-brow intellectuals of Europe.
1114340	1115980	Why do we believe in cause and effect?
1115980	1120420	It's a habit, it's a custom, no rational basis for it whatsoever.
1120420	1125780	It's not reason that teaches us cause and effect, it's instinct.
1125780	1129580	You can't dispense with believing in causal laws as you go about the world.
1129580	1132020	When you get hungry or you're going to say, well, I'm not going to eat for three days,
1132020	1133520	that will fill me up.
1133520	1140020	It's habitual to believe that as cheeseburgers did me good before, they'll do me well again.
1140020	1146620	So the point is there's something extra-rational which orients our behavior and understanding
1146620	1149100	of the physical world.
1149100	1154580	It is irrational to believe in experience that the future will resemble the present,
1154580	1158380	but it's customary and it's in fact inescapable in practical life.
1158380	1162700	And sense knows better than philosophic insight.
1162700	1168180	So experience then is warranted by a sort of natural instinct instead of a rational proof.
1168180	1174060	How can we in fact argue that pervasively?
1174060	1181620	The first thing he points out is, notice simpletons, children, animals all follow causal laws,
1181620	1182620	don't they?
1182620	1183620	Right?
1183740	1190620	You've all heard the experiment of Pavlov's dog, but can children, simpletons, and animals
1190620	1192540	do logical proofs?
1192540	1199100	They are all able to observe causal laws and clearly can't rationally demonstrate anything.
1199100	1200380	All right?
1200380	1204740	So the implication is it must be some sort of instinctual response.
1204740	1209900	Okay, if all of our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, right?
1209900	1217060	And all matters of cause and effect is based on experience, what is the origin of the roughly
1217060	1223740	interchangeable metaphysical doctrines of power, force, and necessary connection?
1223740	1228860	Well, he points out, first of all, there's no logical doctrine of necessary connections
1228860	1233740	in the world because as we've seen before, logical proofs have no existential implications.
1233740	1234740	Right?
1234740	1239300	So if we want to argue that there is force in the world, we can't do so on a logical
1239300	1240460	basis.
1240460	1245740	Also, force, necessary connection, can't arise from sense.
1245740	1248660	I mean, what color is a necessary connection?
1248660	1250220	What flavor is it?
1250220	1252940	When do you actually experience a necessary connection?
1252940	1257660	And he's careful to point out some of the errors that in fact later thinkers will think
1257660	1259980	are profound proofs of it.
1259980	1265100	Tolstoy made a lot out of it, he said, you want to show, you want me to show you force?
1265100	1266100	Look.
1266100	1267100	Right?
1267260	1271100	And it's up, force, and he says, no, no, no.
1271100	1273620	That's in fact the experience of constant conjunction.
1273620	1276540	Every time you desire to lift your arm, it's gone up.
1276540	1277540	You want to do the proof?
1277540	1279100	Want me to prove it to you?
1279100	1282380	We'll see if we can't give you palsy somehow.
1282380	1286660	And you'll sit there for the next three hours and try and lift your arm and it won't go
1286660	1287660	up.
1287660	1288660	Where'd the force go?
1288660	1290220	Where'd the necessary connection go?
1290220	1291220	Must have disappeared.
1291220	1292220	Maybe God intervened.
1292220	1296460	So he points out that in fact all of your sense of physical force in controlling your
1296460	1300580	bodily actions are entirely on the basis of the constant conjunction you've had between
1300580	1304060	your will and the movement of your body.
1304060	1307500	And there are times when you'll be in deliriums or sick when you won't be able to move them
1307500	1310260	and you'll try and you'll fail.
1310260	1315060	Okay, so then Hugh answers this question finally.
1315060	1319540	Necessary connection, force, energy, all those metaphysical doctrines, they're just powerful
1319540	1321300	psychological conditions.
1321300	1325580	You've seen constant conjunctions which are so constant and so sure that your mind just
1325580	1329620	leaves the next step and says, well, it's necessary, can't be avoided, but it's just
1329620	1333580	a psychological phenomena.
1333580	1338340	In fact, since all ideas have their origin and sense, if there's no sensual basis for
1338340	1344700	an idea, we can say as a fact that there is no, that the notion itself is a chimera,
1344700	1348900	right, is a myth, is a fantasy.
1348900	1353500	And here is where we turn of course to Barclay's, Hugh's discussion of Barclay.
1353860	1358620	All right, Barclay has said, well, when do we experience matter, the most sensual experience
1358620	1364860	of matter, and Hugh in his wonderful sense of what says, well, of course you're right.
1364860	1368700	As a brilliant criticism by Barclay, we never do experience matter.
1368700	1374220	Now, what color was a mind again, and what flavor is your mind?
1374220	1375500	What does it taste like?
1375500	1377860	We never experienced a mind either.
1377860	1381700	Well, in that case, if you want to get rid of matter, fine, but we'll throw a mind out
1381740	1382740	with it too.
1382740	1386580	And then all that there'll be in our universe is one damn thing after another, right?
1386580	1391460	We just have one representation after another, no mind to hold them, no matter to project
1391460	1392460	them.
1392460	1398300	And Hugh, of course, is happy with that answer, because his point is that our belief in matter
1398300	1405740	and our belief in mind isn't a result of metaphysical speculation, it's life, right?
1405740	1409500	It's a common sense intuition, and common sense is more than functional for getting
1409500	1411740	us through the world.
1411740	1420580	Okay, then Hugh moves on to the discussion of freedom or liberty and necessity.
1420580	1424900	And again, Hugh, the peacemaker, argues quite controversially, you know, no one's ever really
1424900	1426340	disagreed about this.
1426340	1429340	People think they disagreed, but they didn't.
1429340	1434780	The more you think about it, all reasonable people know that necessity and causation,
1434780	1439260	which are the essence of determinism, are simply the experience of constant conjunctions
1439260	1442420	and the belief that the future will resemble the past.
1442420	1446580	And that's natural to all animals, or all higher animals, right?
1446580	1449340	And if you've got that, you're happy with determinism.
1449340	1453540	The other side, liberty, is simply the absence of external restraint.
1453540	1459220	No one's tying you down, you are free to stand up and leave at any moment.
1459220	1464020	Liberty then has nothing to do with some abstruse doctrine of a free and uncaused will, and it's
1464020	1466980	perfectly consistent with the causally-determined universe.
1466980	1473140	So we have liberty, hopefully, if we have libertarian governments, and we have determinism, and
1473140	1477380	that certainly all of our actions follow causal laws.
1477380	1484100	In fact, he says, if our actions had no causal laws, right, if our actions were not a result
1484100	1489660	or caused by our character, then we would have no basis for moral evaluation, for punishment
1489660	1490660	or blame.
1490860	1497660	And consider, if I was, at this moment, to pull out a gun and shoot someone in this audience,
1497660	1502500	Hume says, you must believe that that was caused by the nature of my character.
1502500	1508260	If you don't, you think that was a truly free act, that is to say uncaused, then it is spontaneous.
1508260	1511500	There's no reason for you to believe that I would ever do that again, since nothing
1511500	1512500	caused me to do it.
1512500	1514620	I did it once, maybe I won't do it again.
1514620	1517500	So then why in heaven's name would you bother to punish me?
1517500	1518500	Right?
1518500	1521780	You certainly won't deter me from doing it again, I'm not caused to do it, you just
1521780	1525700	point out to me, we wish you wouldn't do that, and then we cart the body off and I go on
1525700	1526700	with my lecture.
1526700	1532300	Hume says, of course it's not that way, if I pulled out a gun you would infer from that
1532300	1537780	that I'm some sort of psychopathic maniac, and that it's on the basis of that causal
1537780	1543940	connection between psychopathic maniacism and shooting members of an audience that you
1543940	1546740	are going to grab a pair of handcuffs and drag me out of here.
1547220	1550340	And if you didn't believe there was that causal relation, then punishment would only be an
1550340	1553420	act of bizarre vengeance.
1553420	1559860	So we obviously believe in that sort of causal law in action, and in fact it's demonstrated
1559860	1562460	in our interactions with our friends.
1562460	1566420	Francis, we know what our friends are going to do, if I put my hand out he's going to
1566420	1570180	grab it and shake it, if I ask him how he is he's not going to spit in my eye, I know
1570180	1575260	it fell nice enough, he's going to give me a stock answer, fine, how are you?
1575260	1582500	There's no surprises there, and Hume of course has a wonderful little joke, he says, everyone
1582500	1587700	believes in causal determinacy and behavior and practice, it's only in theory they don't.
1587700	1592100	Go by, well he talks about Sharon Cross, but let's say Times Square in New York City.
1592100	1596140	So to anyone, have you ever noticed that people don't go by Times Square, take out their wallet
1596140	1600140	and stick it in the middle of the ground, and walk away and say, I'll come back for
1600140	1602180	that in an hour?
1602180	1605700	For some reason or other they seem to think that people will be costly determined to pick
1605700	1610220	it up and take the funny green paper out, and Hume says the fact that no one does that
1610220	1615700	proves that everyone believes in causal determinacy, and that if you put your wallet in the middle
1615700	1620020	of Times Square and came back for it an hour later, you wouldn't find it, and we all feel
1620020	1625180	fairly certain of that.
1625180	1631300	Now Hume now turns to, in his discussion of the inquiry concerning human understanding,
1632300	1636900	for what I would call sort of payback, Hume was a remarkable prodigy in his youth, wrote
1636900	1644260	a fantastic book at I think the age of 24, called The Treatise Concerning Human Nature,
1644260	1649940	and applied for a position teaching pneumatic philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,
1649940	1658940	and was blackballed by the Scottish Calvinist clergy because of his agnosticism.
1658940	1664620	I think that profoundly affected Hume's beliefs ever since and his motivations in philosophy,
1664620	1669540	but he certainly realized that the best way of getting back was not to denounce or scream
1669540	1676540	or be angry, but to laugh, to joke, and that raises his discussion of miracles. He says,
1676540	1682620	let's first define what do we mean by a miracle? A miracle is simply by definition a violation
1682620	1687900	of the rules of nature, of the laws of nature, which are established through the sum of human
1687940	1693220	experience, through the sum of our observed constant conjunctions. So miracles are that
1693220	1697740	which there is no rational basis to believe in. That's the definition of a miracle, something
1697740	1699700	which is incredibly irrational to believe in.
1699700	1704580	He says, well, notice something. Have you ever noticed how there are very few miracles
1704580	1711580	that occur in Times Square? Very few miracles occur in the White House or in NASA labs.
1712580	1719580	Most miracles seem to occur among very primitive peoples and in very barbaric situations. We
1720380	1726880	have our Lady of Guadalupe, but we don't seem to have our Lady of Cambridge. It's one thing
1726880	1733880	to make you sort of suspicious about miracles to begin with. Then he goes on to, however,
1734540	1741540	say something, which raises the relationship between something called exoterica and esoterica.
1742020	1747340	It's one of the forms of free thinking and lightened humor. There is, however, a deep
1747340	1752900	philosophic point to that. There's a deep philosophic point to the laughter itself. What is the
1752900	1759900	only thing you can't laugh at? The sacred. Everything else can be laughed at. In effect
1760580	1767260	then, by laughing at everything, humans desacralizing everything. Everything is worthy of laughter.
1767260	1773260	Everything is a jest. And that, he thinks, is a means of human liberation.
1773260	1778180	Okay. I've gone through skepticism. I should point out one of his interesting arguments
1778180	1783300	about religion that comes up. He has a mock dialogue in the text with a Epicurean who
1783300	1787100	says, well, actually, morality has nothing to do with religion. We could all be atheists
1787100	1790900	and we would still be just as moral as we were before. There's no logical basis from
1790900	1796380	which you can go to a belief in a God, to moral behavior. And Hume says, I think quite
1796420	1803420	wisely, sir, I would acknowledge you to be a just reasoner, but not a good citizen. You
1803460	1808700	say that because there is no logical reason or argument from the belief in God to moral
1808700	1815200	behavior, that in fact no one actually makes that leap from belief in God to moral behavior.
1815200	1819620	But of course, most people aren't very good reasoners. There are a lot of people who do
1819620	1824640	believe in God and it restrains them from the most hideous acts. And therefore, I would
1824680	1828800	account you a very bad citizen for speaking that argument publicly. And that, I think,
1828800	1832280	is Hume's considered view. He does not believe in God. He doesn't believe in religion. He
1832280	1836840	thinks it's absolutely laughable, but he would be extremely upset if anyone were attempt
1836840	1841560	to argue against it publicly. Right. If there are people who would go out there and commit
1841560	1845360	hideous crimes if they didn't believe in God, best to keep those sheep in line and stop
1845360	1850120	them from becoming wolves. And it's very much again that exoteric, esoteric notion. There's
1850160	1855760	a small circle of people who are mature enough and responsible enough to realize that even
1855760	1860400	if God does not exist, they still have moral duties and responsibilities. For those who
1860400	1863840	do not realize that it's simple, the best thing is to keep your mouth shut and not tell
1863840	1870840	them anything. All right. We're left, however, with a certain amount of skepticism from Hume.
1872520	1877760	And Hume is quite direct about skepticism. He says, if we take the Cartesian problematic
1877800	1882520	seriously and doubt our faculties, there is no way to think your way out of a paper bag.
1882520	1887800	If you doubt your faculties, there's no solution to skepticism. And in fact, skepticism is
1887800	1892800	not ever logically refutable. It is entirely logical, logically possible that each and every
1892800	1896440	one of you are the only thing in existence in the universe. And everything else is just
1896440	1903440	a dream or delusion. Well, how then do you refute skepticism? And this assumes brilliant
1903440	1910440	answer. You certainly don't do it philosophically. How do you do it? You get hungry. You may
1911360	1915120	think you're the only thing in the universe, but when you get hungry, you will go out for
1915120	1920920	a cheeseburger and a Coke. Practical life is the solution to skepticism. It has no practical
1920920	1927240	consequences. Why would anyone ever believe in such a doctrine? So skepticism is refuted
1927240	1932920	by common life, and that's the Humean Scottish School of Common Sense. You want to know how
1932920	1937160	to answer these questions, not through abstract reason, through life. What's the point of
1937160	1940760	believing you're the only one in the world? It's awfully lonely. Wouldn't it be better
1940760	1945320	off to, wouldn't we all be better off to believe we're each other there? Isn't it practically
1945320	1949600	more fulfilling and hence the importance of practical life?
1949600	1956600	Okay. Well, if that extreme skepticism then is simply a joke, and Hume does in fact think
1957360	1964360	it is. He has a wonderful little passage where he says that our skeptic, who doubts his own
1964720	1970000	existence, is like a dreamer. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join
1970000	1974760	in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement
1974760	1980280	and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind a most
1980280	1985240	act and reason and believe, though they are not able by their most diligent inquiry to
1985240	1989640	satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections
1989640	1995040	which may be raised against them. What's important about that passage is he's saying,
1995040	2000760	skepticism, right, is irrefutable except for practical life, at which point you realize
2000760	2007280	that all skepticism is just a joke. It's just a sort of a very dry sense of humor.
2007280	2012520	What have we read so far in this book? It is filled with skepticism. What kind of a book
2012560	2018600	is this? This is a joke book, Hume is saying. There's nothing serious in this book. Read
2018600	2022120	this and laugh. That's what you should get out of philosophy. It's a lot of fun. It's
2022120	2029120	like playing chess. Nothing hangs on it. What hangs on life? Good mutton, good ale, good
2029240	2035760	fellowship, good humor. That's what's important in life. This, if I've amused you for 30
2035760	2039080	minutes, wonderful. You've gotten more than enough out of philosophy. That's all you could
2039120	2042880	get out of it. But then he does get serious. He says there, however, there is a lesson
2042880	2049880	to be drawn. Not from an extreme skepticism, but from a moderate skepticism. And this comes
2051120	2055080	back to his own personal history. And this is where I think Hume's ultimately most liberating
2055080	2062080	project and one of the reasons why he still speaks to us today. He tells us that the great
2062540	2069540	majority of mankind have a tendency to be rather certain of their opinions. They tend
2076120	2080360	to believe that what they believe is absolutely certain and true. What other people believe
2080360	2087120	is insane and evil. And yet we can't even know, we can't even show any logical basis
2087280	2094280	for our belief in cause and effect. So then what do we call that nature of belief? Dogmatism.
2094280	2098680	And that is the Humean project. What do you do with skepticism? When you find some dogmatic
2098680	2103360	thinker who tells you, well, the world is really mind and matter, or someone else says,
2103360	2108360	no, it isn't, it's just matter. You sit them down and you give them a wee, small tincture
2108360	2113560	of fear. A wee, small tincture of skepticism. And from that, hopefully they'll learn a little
2113680	2119960	bit about, quote, hubris. Before they blackball someone from a university, because he doesn't
2119960	2124240	believe in the right version of Calvinism, he pointed out to him how impossible it is
2124240	2129080	to demonstrate Calvinism in the first place. And maybe they'll be a little more open-minded.
2129080	2133480	I think this is a topic which is very germane, not only for our culture and society, but
2133480	2139980	for our high culture today as well, and academy. I think it's important for us to realize that
2139980	2145580	Hume is right. The point of skepticism is to teach us to be a little bit less dogmatic,
2145580	2149900	to realize that even if I think A and you think B, that doesn't mean that you're stupid
2149900	2155460	or I'm evil. We may just have equally tenable views, or I may think minus slightly more
2155460	2159180	tenable, but it doesn't make you wrong or stupid because you disagree. There's plenty
2159180	2163620	of room for disagreement short of logical demonstration. And Hume's point is that the
2163620	2168100	vast bulk of what's important to us is short of logical demonstration, therefore the ultimate
2168500	2174300	virtue that we must have is toleration, is to learn to be open-minded, especially with
2174300	2181300	people we disagree with, to overcome our tendency towards dogmatism. And I don't think it's
2184660	2191660	coincidental that Hume speaks of those he thinks are worst in the dogmatism. And he
2192540	2199540	says, if any of the learned, if we're speaking of university professors, if any of the learned
2202300	2208200	be inclined from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tainture of
2208200	2214260	parentism, skepticism, might abate their pride by showing them that the few advantages which
2214260	2219100	they may have attained over their fellows are but inconsiderable if compared with the
2219100	2224760	universal perplexity and confusion which is inherent in human nature. In general, there
2224760	2231680	is a degree of doubt and caution and monesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision
2231680	2238680	ought forever to accompany a just reason. And I can't help feeling that that is in
2239020	2243820	fact the ultimately most fruitful project of the Enlightenment, and Hume represents
2243820	2248320	it, the critique of dogmatism, which he associated with rationalism. He associated with the
2248340	2255340	continental tradition, is the critique of the tendency to pound the desk. And certainly
2256060	2259620	we've seen that, and we'll see it in subsequent thinkers, philosophers who tells everyone
2259620	2265300	before me was an idiot. All the people who disagree with me are swine. And Hume's
2265300	2272300	deep point is that nowhere is that more prevalent than among people with PhDs. They are probably
2272440	2279040	the most dogmatic people on the planet. And Hume, I think, is actually angry. His view
2279040	2285160	is of all the people in the world, they are the least excusable for that. For if they
2285160	2289820	could think their way out of a paper bag, they would realize they can't be sure about
2289820	2294820	almost any of their beliefs except for mathematics and logic. Aside from that, everything is
2294820	2299760	provisional. Then how dare they, and I think what he's really concerned about is not just
2299820	2306020	blackballing young professors, as we found happened during the McCarthy period, but also
2306020	2311820	something worse, perhaps the pedagogical equivalent of eating one's young, telling
2311820	2316380	your students that, well, this is the truth, I'm teaching you now. I know you'll read
2316380	2320380	other books, but they're wrong. My opinions, those are the important ones, and I can prove
2320380	2326620	it all. And that's what Hume distains. The life of the mind, the life of education, should
2326640	2332480	be cheerful, should be happy, should be open-minded, should be playful, there's nothing very serious
2332480	2336920	going on here, there's nothing crucial worth killing one another over, or denouncing one
2336920	2341480	another over. We should enjoy ourselves, it should be light, it should be open-minded,
2341480	2348480	it should be just and moderate. I think from this you will get a sense that for all of
2349480	2356480	his agnosticism, Hume is in his own way, perhaps the most vocal expression of Jobian secularism.
2359480	2366480	He in a way does have that Augustinian strain of humility and of piety, and yet he's completely
2367480	2373080	secular. I think that's what's intriguing about that tradition, which very much diffuses
2373080	2380080	in the Anglo-American world, is once it becomes secularized, that sort of metaphysical posture
2380240	2385480	has a certain charm and endearing value to it. It is the first time, it is only from
2385480	2391880	that perspective that tolerance, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion, can actually be
2391880	2398080	seen as a virtue. I should point out that Hume dies in 1776, the year of the American
2398080	2404440	Revolution. America does enact freedom of belief, freedom of speech, but not as a positive
2404440	2409440	good. I mean, most Americans had done it because they had no choice. There were too many sects
2409440	2414760	in North America to maintain an orthodoxy, and so it was a marriage of convenience, they
2414760	2420320	were forced to allow freedom of belief. In fact, it didn't always obtain everywhere.
2420320	2425380	Massachusetts retained an established church until the 1830s, as did Connecticut, as did
2425380	2430620	several colonies. It was only with Hume that he begins to say that's not a necessary evil
2430620	2435340	at all, that's the essence of the good life. There's nothing so serious in those churches
2435340	2440820	that can't be laughed at occasionally, and there's nothing so serious about my own work
2440820	2446220	that can't be laughed at, and in fact should be laughed at. If you want to know really
2446220	2453220	moral insight about the world, it's not philosophy texts. Maybe it's history, Hume became an historian,
2453460	2456980	that's one of the other reasons I know he's such a wise man. He realized what was really
2456980	2463820	important. Finally, I want to offer one more reason I think that this Humean liberation,
2463820	2468860	critique of dogmatism and rationalism is so valuable for us, and it's because it's something
2468860	2475060	philosophers call reflexive. It can be used upon itself. Hume ends his work with a bit
2475060	2482060	of spleen at the rationalist and scholastic tradition that he felt was oppressive. He
2482860	2487620	says, once we know that the only sort of knowledge you can have, that's certain, demonstratively
2487620	2494620	certain, is logic and mathematics, or matters of fact evidence based on experience, when
2496460	2501900	we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our
2501900	2507460	hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us ask, does it contain
2507540	2514540	any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental
2514540	2521040	reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Committed to bend to the flames, for
2521040	2528040	it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. How would we reflectively apply Hume to Hume?
2529620	2534300	We would point out, Dave, there's more to religion than that. Religion gives people
2534740	2541740	spiritual solace. If people need what William James called moral holidays or cosmological
2541780	2548780	holidays, why deny them? As long as they're not dogmatic, why should you be dogmatic?
2548780	2554660	And I think that is ultimately when that Humean ethos hits the United States in the late 19th
2554660	2560100	century and gets its ultimate clarification on William James, that is exactly where it
2561020	2566100	Hume has turned against himself to say, look, you too must be tolerant of people who believe
2566100	2571420	in religion and in Christianity. It has its value for those people, and you must be open-minded.
