00:00.000 --> 00:28.080
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

00:28.080 --> 00:36.080
Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the most important philosophers in the tradition of Western thought.

00:36.080 --> 00:44.080
He's one of the most artistic and ruthless and fascinating individuals in the intellectual history of the West.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.080
He viewed himself as being the end of the Western intellectual tradition.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.080
He saw himself as the destroyer of metaphysics.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.080
He saw himself as the destroyer of Christianity.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.080
He saw himself as a combination philosopher-artist in the tradition of Plato.

01:02.080 --> 01:07.080
And he offered a comprehensive critique of the Western intellectual tradition,

01:07.080 --> 01:14.080
not conceived merely or narrowly as a philosophical tradition, but as a cultural tradition.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.080
Nietzsche, more than anyone else, was a philosopher of culture.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.080
He offered criticism of every element in Western culture,

01:21.080 --> 01:25.080
and his criticism is noteworthy for its refusal to compromise,

01:25.080 --> 01:30.080
for his insistence that we get to the psychological heart of things.

01:30.080 --> 01:36.080
What I'd like to talk about in this lecture is Nietzsche's treatment of Christianity and morality,

01:36.080 --> 01:42.080
two of the central questions for most philosophers in the Western tradition,

01:42.080 --> 01:48.080
and particularly important for Nietzsche because although he is something of a megalomaniac,

01:48.080 --> 01:53.080
there's a certain amount of truth to the argument that he is, in fact, the Antichrist.

01:53.080 --> 02:00.080
He, in fact, called himself the Antichrist more than once, and he wrote a book called The Antichrist.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.080
And what he hoped to do was to get beyond Christianity.

02:03.080 --> 02:10.080
He quite literally thought that he was going to supplant Jesus in the Western tradition,

02:10.080 --> 02:12.080
which is quite a tall order.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.080
Not many people have that sort of ambition, but Nietzsche was never a shrinking violet,

02:17.080 --> 02:21.080
and in fact, he wanted to offer a new set of values.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.080
He wished to offer a new cultural orientation to the West,

02:24.080 --> 02:28.080
or perhaps to revive an old cultural orientation in the West.

02:28.080 --> 02:36.080
And he wished to make us confront the half-truths, the lies, the evasions,

02:36.080 --> 02:41.080
that are characteristic of almost everyone's life and thought.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.080
Now, he wrote several books that criticized morality.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.080
In some respects, the tradition of Western ethics is his main target.

02:50.080 --> 02:55.080
And perhaps the most intriguing of these books, or one of the most intriguing of these books,

02:55.080 --> 02:58.080
is called Beyond Good and Evil.

02:58.080 --> 03:03.080
Now, getting beyond good and evil is a rather unusual activity for a philosopher,

03:03.080 --> 03:06.080
particularly one concerned with morals,

03:06.080 --> 03:10.080
but Nietzsche wants to take an extremely skeptical,

03:10.080 --> 03:16.080
an extremely naturalistic approach to moral theory and moral valuation,

03:16.080 --> 03:22.080
and he wishes to offer a criticism of Christianity and the values that it represents,

03:22.080 --> 03:27.080
and in addition to supplant that with a new code of morals.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.080
Nietzsche asks an important question,

03:30.080 --> 03:36.080
that everyone living in this modern age, this one-world, anti-metaphysical age,

03:36.080 --> 03:43.080
has to confront, which is, where does Christianity and its moral values come from?

03:43.080 --> 03:49.080
How is it that human beings conceived of as animals, as featherless bipeds?

03:49.080 --> 03:52.080
How is it that they come to have a thing called a conscience?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.080
How is it that they make judgments of good and evil,

03:54.080 --> 03:59.080
which is not characteristic of fish or birds or reptiles?

03:59.080 --> 04:03.080
What is it about human beings, which causes them to construct moral systems,

04:03.080 --> 04:07.080
which are in some respects the antithesis of nature?

04:07.080 --> 04:15.080
Why is it that we feel the desire to conflict with nature and make judgments that nature never does?

04:15.080 --> 04:20.080
Nietzsche thinks that he finds the answer in the psyche of the human individual,

04:20.080 --> 04:23.080
and he thinks that we are very peculiar animals,

04:23.080 --> 04:35.080
animals with strange attributes, which are natural and which are part of the human condition.

04:35.080 --> 04:42.080
But in fact, Nietzsche says that most of our elevation of ourselves beyond nature,

04:42.080 --> 04:51.080
beyond simple facticity, is a kind of spurious raising of ourselves outside of and above nature.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.080
The German term for this is Zonderstellung.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.080
What that means is other position, a position somehow outside of nature.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.080
Nietzsche wants us to confront the fact that we are animals, that we are part of nature,

05:01.080 --> 05:05.080
and that our moral judgments are in fact part of that natural process.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.080
In looking at Christianity, Nietzsche goes back to the actual history of Christianity

05:10.080 --> 05:14.080
and asks, what is it that Christian morals represent?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
Whose interests do they serve?

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
And why are these interests disguised?

05:18.080 --> 05:25.080
What is it about the moral judgment's characteristic of Christianity that needs to be disguised?

05:25.080 --> 05:30.080
What is it, in other words, that's a lie in Christian morals?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.080
Remarkable question.

05:32.080 --> 05:36.080
Nietzsche's answer is that there are two kinds of morality,

05:36.080 --> 05:42.080
and Christianity only represents one particular perspective on judgments of good and evil.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.080
And this perspective is the perspective of the herd.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.080
Nietzsche contrasts two kinds of morals,

05:49.080 --> 05:56.080
herd morals, morals that are characteristic of the weak, the feeble, the inferior, the enslaved,

05:56.080 --> 05:58.080
which is to say Christianity,

05:58.080 --> 06:04.080
and master morals, morals of warriors, the predatory human beings,

06:04.080 --> 06:08.080
who make judgments on the basis of their strength rather than their weakness.

06:08.080 --> 06:14.080
Nietzsche wishes to supplant the herd morals characteristic of Christianity,

06:14.080 --> 06:19.080
characteristic of Western culture for the previous 2,000 years, with a new morals,

06:19.080 --> 06:22.080
morals that hearkens back to the age of the Homeric hero,

06:22.080 --> 06:26.080
which hearkens back to the aristocratic warrior elite,

06:26.080 --> 06:28.080
which is found all over the world,

06:28.080 --> 06:31.080
which creates values out of nothing,

06:31.080 --> 06:36.080
and which glories in the fact that their judgments can be enforced in this world,

06:36.080 --> 06:40.080
independent of any metaphysical construct.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.080
Now, Nietzsche asks, who was it that created Christianity?

06:45.080 --> 06:50.080
Well, it's an outgrowth of Judaism, and Judaism is a priestly religion.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
Christianity is an extension of that.

06:52.080 --> 06:58.080
And Christianity in its earliest historical phases appeals to the slave class in Rome.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.080
In fact, Christianity is the revolt of the oppressed masses in Rome.

07:04.080 --> 07:09.080
And Nietzsche argues that Christianity and its myths was organized

07:09.080 --> 07:17.080
so as to articulate the perspective of the slaves, of the inferior, of the feeble.

07:17.080 --> 07:21.080
And it was a way of having revenge upon masters,

07:21.080 --> 07:23.080
having revenge upon warriors,

07:23.080 --> 07:26.080
having revenge upon those who could oppress them,

07:26.080 --> 07:31.080
and turning the tables by offering a scale of values that was different from

07:31.080 --> 07:36.080
and independent of that of the master class.

07:36.080 --> 07:40.080
Nietzsche says that the slaves have their revenge,

07:40.080 --> 07:45.080
and the triumph of Christianity in the West amounts to the triumph of the slave,

07:45.080 --> 07:50.080
of the inferior, of the weak and impoverished.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.080
Think about the ideas or the myths that underlie Christianity.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.080
The idea that even in this world, if there's no justice,

07:59.080 --> 08:06.080
there's another world, heaven and hell, where God's eternal justice gives everyone what they deserve.

08:06.080 --> 08:12.080
Nietzsche says that what this, in fact, is, is the frustration, the impotence,

08:12.080 --> 08:16.080
the anger of slaves transformed into a myth,

08:16.080 --> 08:22.080
which allows them to get their revenge on those that oppress them,

08:22.080 --> 08:26.080
if not in this world, at least in an unreal world,

08:27.080 --> 08:32.080
which offers them some solace in a world of pain and misery.

08:32.080 --> 08:38.080
Nietzsche contrasts the morality of Christianity with the morality of the Romans.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.080
The Romans were fierce, independent, warlike men

08:42.080 --> 08:46.080
who made their own scale of values based upon power,

08:46.080 --> 08:49.080
based upon the desire to dominate,

08:49.080 --> 08:53.080
and they showed no reluctance to inflict pain on those they viewed as inferior.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.080
And here inferior means not morally inferior in the Christian sense,

08:57.080 --> 09:01.080
but physically inferior in terms of practical strength.

09:01.080 --> 09:08.080
Nietzsche's new alternative to Christianity will be a resuscitation of the warlike values of the ancient world,

09:08.080 --> 09:14.080
and what he hopes will come out of this will be an evaluation of Christianity,

09:14.080 --> 09:16.080
which allows us to get beyond Christianity,

09:16.080 --> 09:25.080
and the one who is going to succeed Christ as the central figure in western moral theory will be Nietzsche himself.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.080
He frequently signed himself as the Antichrist, or as Dionysus,

09:29.080 --> 09:35.080
another incarnation of the Nietzschean judgment of good and evil.

09:35.080 --> 09:44.080
And in doing this, he raises very disturbing questions about the kind of moral judgments that we make

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
that are still characteristic of this culture,

09:46.080 --> 09:51.080
and the difficulty of maintaining the traditional judgments of good and evil, characteristic of the West,

09:51.080 --> 09:57.080
in an age in which religion and theology are taken less and less seriously.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.080
Now let's think about the idea of getting beyond good and evil.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.080
Nietzsche contrasts the slave and the master moralities,

10:04.080 --> 10:09.080
and he says what's characteristic of Christianity is the distinction between good and evil.

10:10.080 --> 10:17.080
Good, in the Christian sense, means kindness, lovingness, pity, essentially.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.080
Nietzsche thinks that Christian morality is a morality of pity,

10:20.080 --> 10:30.080
which raises to a spurious level of distinction, feeling for the weak, the inferior, and the impoverished.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.080
We might contrast this with the master morality, which doesn't distinguish between good and evil,

10:34.080 --> 10:37.080
in fact it distinguishes between good and bad,

10:37.080 --> 10:42.080
in the sense of capable or incapable, potent or impotent.

10:42.080 --> 10:50.080
That's a totally different judgment of value from that characteristic of Christianity.

10:50.080 --> 10:56.080
And in fact, this is the scale of values, this master morality,

10:56.080 --> 11:01.080
is the one which Nietzsche expects will produce the highest type of human being.

11:01.080 --> 11:05.080
Nietzsche holds the view, which at least in part is borrowed from Darwin,

11:05.080 --> 11:08.080
that human beings have no intrinsic value.

11:08.080 --> 11:14.080
If you remember that one of the great breakthroughs, or one of the great contributions of Christianity to the West,

11:14.080 --> 11:17.080
is the idea that all souls are equal in the sight of God,

11:17.080 --> 11:23.080
and that all people are equally value on some level, regardless of what their particular skills or capacities are,

11:23.080 --> 11:25.080
well, Nietzsche says that's a mistake.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.080
What that is is the revenge of those that can't do anything.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.080
And Nietzsche says, if we are ever going to produce anything great in this culture,

11:32.080 --> 11:35.080
if we are ever going to produce anything significant in this culture,

11:35.080 --> 11:38.080
we must get away from the idea that other people really matter.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.080
The only elements in the human species, which are important,

11:42.080 --> 11:45.080
are the half dozen great geniuses in any culture.

11:45.080 --> 11:49.080
And he says that Christianity inhibits the development of genius.

11:49.080 --> 11:54.080
It inhibits the development of creativity because it is envious.

11:54.080 --> 11:59.080
It is a way of mythologizing the envy of those that are incapable,

11:59.080 --> 12:03.080
of those that don't have much in the way of capacity.

12:03.080 --> 12:08.080
And Nietzsche says, if we are to get beyond that, then we must get beyond this morality of pity.

12:08.080 --> 12:12.080
We must get beyond good and evil back or forward, if you want,

12:12.080 --> 12:18.080
to the idea that good and bad are the main standards of our moral judgment.

12:18.080 --> 12:25.080
So there will be none of the conscientiousness characteristic of Christianity,

12:25.080 --> 12:29.080
none of the worry about heaven and hell, about God's judgment.

12:29.080 --> 12:33.080
This good and bad morality, this master morality,

12:33.080 --> 12:35.080
will be strictly oriented towards this world.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.080
It will not be caught up with the problem of conscience.

12:39.080 --> 12:44.080
It will not primarily be concerned with the state of one's soul

12:44.080 --> 12:47.080
so much as it will be concerned with the state of one's achievements.

12:47.080 --> 12:52.080
Nietzsche's judgment of good and bad, this master morality,

12:52.080 --> 12:56.080
is oriented towards doing things, the masters of those that achieve.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.080
And this is not necessarily to be taken into political sense,

12:59.080 --> 13:01.080
although it can be taken into political sense.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.080
Master moralities can also be the moralities of the artist.

13:04.080 --> 13:09.080
Master moralities can also be the morality of the thinker.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.080
But it has to be the kind of thinker or the kind of artist who despises mere mediocrity,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.080
who wants to go beyond and formulate something in this world

13:19.080 --> 13:23.080
that creates a justification for his entire society.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.080
As Nietzsche says, in the use and abuse of history,

13:26.080 --> 13:31.080
mankind can only be judged by its highest examples.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.080
The average human being has no value, whatever.

13:35.080 --> 13:41.080
Now, Nietzsche also inquires into the differences

13:41.080 --> 13:46.080
between the warrior aristocrat who generates the master morality

13:46.080 --> 13:52.080
and the priest, and the psychology of the priest is of great concern to Nietzsche.

13:52.080 --> 13:57.080
Nietzsche believes that the priestly type and the warrior aristocrat

13:57.080 --> 14:00.080
are both, in fact, superior kinds of men.

14:00.080 --> 14:05.080
One type is the individual, the Nietzschean hero,

14:05.080 --> 14:07.080
who's going to adopt the master morality.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.080
The most dangerous opponent to the Nietzschean hero,

14:11.080 --> 14:15.080
the man who adopts this master morality, is the priest.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.080
The priest is the opposite of the warrior type.

14:19.080 --> 14:25.080
And Nietzsche believes that the origin of this distinction lies in the human psyche,

14:25.080 --> 14:30.080
that psychological differences are what distinguish these two.

14:30.080 --> 14:39.080
Now, both the warrior and the priest have different kinds of the will to power.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.080
They just express this will to power differently.

14:41.080 --> 14:46.080
Nietzsche thinks, in fact, that all human beings can be characterized by their desire

14:46.080 --> 14:51.080
to dominate themselves, to dominate their environment, and to dominate other people.

14:51.080 --> 14:55.080
This puts Nietzsche squarely in the tradition of the Sophists,

14:55.080 --> 15:01.080
do you think of Calakles and Gorgias in the Platonic dialogues?

15:01.080 --> 15:05.080
He's also in the line of Machiavelli, Saad,

15:05.080 --> 15:08.080
all of those people who adopt an atheistic perspective

15:08.080 --> 15:13.080
and who believe that human life is caught up with the desire to dominate others

15:13.080 --> 15:18.080
and to satisfy one's desires to the maximum extent, Nietzsche supports that idea.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.080
Now, the warrior does it in a very straightforward way.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.080
The warrior takes what he wants without any qualms of conscience.

15:24.080 --> 15:28.080
Conscience is an afterthought invented at a much later date.

15:28.080 --> 15:32.080
The warrior just comes in and does what he does because that is his nature.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.080
The strong and the weak is the natural distinction.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.080
Good and evil is an anti-natural distinction.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.080
And if you think about it, there may be a certain grain of truth in this.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.080
Think of it this way.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.080
Think of the distinction between hawks and sparrows.

15:44.080 --> 15:50.080
Sparrows eat grains or seeds or whatever and they're inoffensive birds

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
and there are quite many of them.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
But in fact, there's nothing better about eating what sparrows eat

15:56.080 --> 15:58.080
as compared to what hawks eat.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.080
We don't make moral judgments about hawks and say that they ought not to eat sparrows.

16:02.080 --> 16:06.080
We just recognize that in nature, different things feed in different ways

16:06.080 --> 16:10.080
and predatory behavior is no worse and no better than any other behavior.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.080
Nature just is what it is.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.080
Nietzsche wants to force us back into nature.

16:16.080 --> 16:21.080
He wants us to reevaluate our disapproval of the human hawks.

16:21.080 --> 16:28.080
In fact, Nietzsche thinks that we have no more right to judge a warrior or an aristocrat evil

16:28.080 --> 16:30.080
than we have a right to judge a hawk evil.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.080
And he in fact thinks it doesn't make any more sense.

16:33.080 --> 16:38.080
The world of nature, red and fang and claw, just is what it is.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.080
And as Nietzsche puts it in a beautiful passage, he says,

16:42.080 --> 16:44.080
There are no moral phenomena.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.080
There are only moral interpretations of phenomena.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.080
A very profound idea.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.080
Well, whose values are built into Christianity?

16:53.080 --> 16:57.080
The values of the herd, the values of the weak.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.080
And that's why it caught on among the underclass in Rome.

17:01.080 --> 17:07.080
And the entire history of Western ethics has been extrapolations from this herd morality

17:07.080 --> 17:10.080
which has inhibited the development of our culture.

17:10.080 --> 17:16.080
If we were to go beyond that, we would have to allow for the fact that cruelty may not be an evil.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.080
That pity may be a vice.

17:19.080 --> 17:24.080
That the desire to dominate other people may be the highest expression of human being,

17:24.080 --> 17:28.080
rather than its worst example.

17:28.080 --> 17:35.080
And in that respect, Nietzsche is not only connected to Machiavelli and to Saad and to this office,

17:35.080 --> 17:38.080
but if any of you are familiar with the work of Dostoevsky,

17:38.080 --> 17:42.080
particularly something like crime and punishment, the idea of the singular man,

17:42.080 --> 17:45.080
the man that's going to stand outside of good and evil,

17:45.080 --> 17:47.080
and Raskolnikov commits that murder,

17:47.080 --> 17:50.080
much the same issues are being discussed in that novel.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.080
The question of whether, in fact, moral judgment is universal,

17:54.080 --> 17:58.080
or whether it's an arbitrary series of conventions designed by the weak

17:58.080 --> 18:01.080
to oppress the strong, strangely enough.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.080
Now, in a book called The Genealogy of Morals, he tries to figure out

18:06.080 --> 18:08.080
how it is we got into this predicament,

18:08.080 --> 18:13.080
how it is we came to the point where the inferior and the weak

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
could start to make our moral judgments.

18:15.080 --> 18:21.080
And he says, first of all, that the initial moral judgments that human beings made

18:21.080 --> 18:26.080
came from the warrior aristocrats who imposed their will on the world.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.080
This is not only his model of the warrior aristocrats,

18:29.080 --> 18:32.080
also in some respects his model of the artist.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.080
Think about, and his arguments are very interesting.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.080
Nietzsche was a philologist and a professor of classical languages,

18:38.080 --> 18:42.080
and he derives most of his arguments from an inquiry into Latin and German words

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
and what their origins might have been.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.080
Now, since I can't presuppose that you know Latin and German,

18:47.080 --> 18:51.080
let's try English just to see if, in fact, there's some evidence for this,

18:51.080 --> 18:53.080
and I think there is.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.080
Think about what a noble action is.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.080
What makes an action noble?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.080
Well, we know that a noble action is a good one.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.080
If you look it up in the dictionary, you'll find that it's a term of approval.

19:02.080 --> 19:08.080
Is it coincidental that nobility is also a section of the social structure

19:08.080 --> 19:10.080
in ancient societies?

19:10.080 --> 19:14.080
Consider the distinction between a noble action and a base action.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.080
Who do you think the base are?

19:16.080 --> 19:21.080
The base are, in fact, the inferior, the weak, those that take orders rather than give them.

19:21.080 --> 19:26.080
The distinction between noble and base suggests that maybe our judgments of value

19:26.080 --> 19:32.080
at the time when these words were coined are, in fact, simply the judgments of important warriors

19:32.080 --> 19:36.080
contrasted with the judgments of people that have to suffer and put up with them.

19:36.080 --> 19:40.080
Consider the distinction between being mean and being noble.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.080
Well, being mean is a very bad thing nowadays to be mean,

19:44.080 --> 19:48.080
but there was a time when to be mean meant that you were essentially a villain.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.080
Villain means peasant in its origins.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.080
Give that some thought.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.080
Nietzsche has a very profound argument here.

19:57.080 --> 20:04.080
Think about something like coming from a good family and coming from a bad family.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.080
Yes, indeed.

20:05.080 --> 20:11.080
Again, the judgments of power, characteristic of predatory warrior aristocrats,

20:11.080 --> 20:18.080
were the actual source, according to Nietzsche, of our judgments of good and evil.

20:18.080 --> 20:23.080
To be mean, to be base, to be a villain meant that you were bad.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.080
To be noble, to be high-minded as opposed to low-minded, to have high moral standards

20:28.080 --> 20:32.080
as opposed to low moral standards, ask yourself where they came from.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.080
Nietzsche was the first man to force himself to consider the possibility

20:36.080 --> 20:41.080
that what we take to be universal moral distinctions applicable to everyone

20:41.080 --> 20:45.080
are, in fact, a disguised form of the will to power,

20:45.080 --> 20:51.080
a way for the weak and the impotent to get back at the superior

20:51.080 --> 20:57.080
by changing these aristocratic valuations, by moving from good and bad to good and evil.

20:57.080 --> 21:05.080
In other words, the invention of evil was a way for the oppressed to strike back at the superior.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.080
Nietzsche wants to erase that.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.080
He says that's a mistake in Western culture.

21:10.080 --> 21:18.080
That's a hole or a gap or an inferior part of the Western tradition.

21:18.080 --> 21:25.080
And if we want to produce superior human beings, then we have to free them from the shackles of slave morality.

21:25.080 --> 21:32.080
We have to prevent them from being undermined in their achievements or undermined in their aspirations

21:32.080 --> 21:38.080
by creating in them the conscience, a conscience which prevents them from achieving what they could.

21:38.080 --> 21:42.080
Now, here's another very interesting question, and it's very hard to answer.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.080
Nietzsche offers us a very provocative conception.

21:45.080 --> 21:49.080
Where does conscience come from and what is it?

21:49.080 --> 21:51.080
Think about that for a moment.

21:51.080 --> 21:57.080
If, in fact, human beings are animals, and I think that Darwin has conclusively shown that to be the case,

21:57.080 --> 22:02.080
why are we the only animal with a conscience and where does it come from and what is it?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.080
Very difficult question.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.080
Nietzsche's argument is something like this.

22:07.080 --> 22:13.080
Human beings have a natural desire to achieve power.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.080
The will to power, that is characteristic of what makes people go.

22:17.080 --> 22:22.080
And the usual route that the will to power takes is the desire to dominate other people.

22:22.080 --> 22:31.080
There is a natural ruthlessness in people, a desire to take advantage of others, and it pleases people to cause pain.

22:31.080 --> 22:36.080
Hard thing for us to swallow perhaps in these days, but with the degree of pain in the world

22:36.080 --> 22:42.080
and the degree of evil that we see, to use a word that I might italicize, there may well be something to it.

22:42.080 --> 22:49.080
If, in fact, people do like to create pain in others, of course, usually not themselves,

22:49.080 --> 22:52.080
what happens when you frustrate this desire?

22:52.080 --> 22:55.080
What happens when you say you can't enslave other people?

22:55.080 --> 22:58.080
You can't kill other people and take their possessions?

22:58.080 --> 23:01.080
You can't oppress other people because we will stop you?

23:01.080 --> 23:05.080
Well, Nietzsche says, and this is a fascinating possibility, although I'm not certain if it's true,

23:05.080 --> 23:10.080
he says that when people are frustrated in their desire to cause pain to others,

23:10.080 --> 23:15.080
the consequence of that is that they decide to start imposing pain on themselves.

23:15.080 --> 23:24.080
And this pain that they pose on themselves is called conscience, a horrifying possibility.

23:24.080 --> 23:30.080
In German, the term for the pang of conscience is called Gewissenbisse, which means the bite of conscience.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.080
And Nietzsche says essentially that people are predatory animals,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.080
and if they can't bite other people, they bite themselves.

23:37.080 --> 23:46.080
And when they begin to torture themselves, they find the last possible outlet for this desire to impose pain on the world.

23:46.080 --> 23:50.080
If they can't do it to other people, they'll do it to themselves.

23:50.080 --> 23:56.080
Now, this bite of conscience gets progressively worse when priests come on the scene,

23:56.080 --> 23:58.080
when the priestly type comes on the scene.

23:58.080 --> 24:03.080
It goes from inferior to even more inferior,

24:03.080 --> 24:09.080
because the priests harness slave morality, they harness this morality of the herd,

24:09.080 --> 24:11.080
and they use it for their own purposes.

24:11.080 --> 24:15.080
The priests are the highest example of the herd animal, of the herd type.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.080
They have a special set of morals that they keep for themselves,

24:18.080 --> 24:26.080
and then they rule the herd using various kinds of myths and various kinds of verbal techniques

24:26.080 --> 24:33.080
so that they can have their revenge, and so that they can oppose the warrior type.

24:33.080 --> 24:40.080
Nietzsche sees among the highest types of human beings an intrinsic conflict between the priest and the warrior.

24:40.080 --> 24:46.080
Nietzsche thinks that the warrior is the kind of person that knows how to forget things.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.080
Again, this is an interesting psychological profile,

24:49.080 --> 24:53.080
and there are many, incidentally, if you read the genealogy of morals and beyond good and evil,

24:53.080 --> 24:56.080
you'll find that there are many anticipations of Freud,

24:56.080 --> 25:00.080
especially the question of conscience and the question of resentment.

25:00.080 --> 25:05.080
Nietzsche thinks that resentment, the hatred of being oppressed, is the source of slave moralities,

25:05.080 --> 25:10.080
and that the priest takes that resentment, formulates it in a mythological way,

25:10.080 --> 25:15.080
and uses that to orchestrate and control the herd so that they can be opposed to any superiority

25:15.080 --> 25:20.080
among those that would break moral rules, among the would-be warriors.

25:21.080 --> 25:28.080
What makes the priestly type so dangerous is the fact that they can dominate culture

25:28.080 --> 25:33.080
and that they have chosen the wrong path, they have chosen the slave moralities,

25:33.080 --> 25:35.080
and they have absolutized that.

25:35.080 --> 25:43.080
The consequence of absolutizing that is that it seems that there is no possibility of reintroducing master morality

25:43.080 --> 25:49.080
without a complete and thoroughgoing critique of the culture, and that is what Nietzsche thinks he is.

25:49.080 --> 25:53.080
That's what it means for Nietzsche to be the Antichrist.

25:53.080 --> 25:59.080
He's not just the Antichrist in some mythological sense, he literally takes that as a mark of distinction.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.080
It shows just what a free thinker he is.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.080
Nietzsche is willing to say, not only is he the Antichrist,

26:05.080 --> 26:09.080
but that he thinks that that's the best development in culture since the time of Jesus.

26:09.080 --> 26:15.080
It's about time that we got back to our morality which would allow for the development of superior people.

26:16.080 --> 26:20.080
Now, Nietzsche's argument here is very disturbing.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
It's disturbing in its consequences.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.080
It's disturbing because it kind of rocks the moral boat for us.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.080
But Nietzsche's critique goes even further than this.

26:28.080 --> 26:33.080
He wants to investigate not just the question of pain and people's desire to impose pain on others,

26:33.080 --> 26:35.080
and if not on others than on themselves,

26:35.080 --> 26:39.080
he wants to look at the arguments about suffering made by the priests.

26:39.080 --> 26:44.080
Christianity, if you remember, holds the view that God is providential,

26:44.080 --> 26:50.080
that he supervises the entire world, and that I believe the phrase is not a sparrow falls but God knows about it.

26:50.080 --> 26:58.080
Well, Nietzsche thinks that this myth was invented so that suffering could be justified and could be explained.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.080
And in some respects, there's a certain amount of truth in that,

27:01.080 --> 27:07.080
that part of what Christianity does is explain, or at least explain away, the fact of human suffering

27:07.080 --> 27:12.080
by saying that God doubtless has some plan, although we don't know what that plan is,

27:12.080 --> 27:17.080
it surely is there because the kind of God we've decided to construct, the kind of God we believe in,

27:17.080 --> 27:23.080
is the kind of God, he's a good God, a loving God, the kind of God that would never do anything evil.

27:23.080 --> 27:28.080
Since he would never do anything evil, the suffering that you get must have a meaning.

27:28.080 --> 27:33.080
And Nietzsche thinks the worst thing that the priestly element ever did to human culture

27:33.080 --> 27:37.080
was to sell people on the idea that suffering has meaning.

27:37.080 --> 27:42.080
Nietzsche says that the entire world is completely meaningless, that the world is moral chaos,

27:42.080 --> 27:49.080
that suffering has no meaning, and the idea that suffering has meaning just makes suffering infinitely worse.

27:49.080 --> 27:52.080
It's not hard to see why.

27:52.080 --> 27:58.080
It was bad when weak, feeble people had to put up with the strong,

27:58.080 --> 28:03.080
had to put up with having things stolen from them, with being murdered and raped and tortured.

28:03.080 --> 28:09.080
That was bad because of simple physical pain for the reason that any natural calamity is bad.

28:09.080 --> 28:15.080
But the priestly idea of attaching a meaning to this suffering makes it all that much worse,

28:15.080 --> 28:20.080
because if there is a God in heaven who is in fact supervising this entire procedure,

28:20.080 --> 28:26.080
the reason why suffering must follow us, why evil must befall us, lies in ourselves.

28:26.080 --> 28:30.080
We are somehow responsible for it. We brought it upon ourselves.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.080
What does this mean? This infinitely increases our suffering,

28:34.080 --> 28:40.080
because not only are the weak and the feeble still being tortured and killed and raped and maimed,

28:40.080 --> 28:43.080
but in addition to that, it's their fault.

28:43.080 --> 28:46.080
What a horrible turnaround.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.080
What a dreadful addition to the suffering they already have.

28:50.080 --> 28:56.080
After you recover from a terrible encounter with warrior aristocrats, with those who are beyond good and evil,

28:56.080 --> 29:02.080
then you must live with the fact that you brought it on yourself and guilt enters the world.

29:02.080 --> 29:08.080
After the superior, after the strong, after the ruthless have finished with you,

29:08.080 --> 29:12.080
after they've caused their modicum of pain, you have to add to it.

29:12.080 --> 29:17.080
The bite of conscience means you're going to impose pain on yourself.

29:17.080 --> 29:25.080
This development is one of the worst turning points in the history of Western culture, according to Nietzsche.

29:25.080 --> 29:34.080
And in that respect, Nietzsche believes that he is liberating us from the shackles of a self-imposed misery.

29:34.080 --> 29:41.080
And for all his madness, there is a certain degree of coherence in this argument.

29:41.080 --> 29:47.080
And it is hard to know where he's correct, how much of this we should accept,

29:47.080 --> 29:53.080
and how much of it is just speculation that we could never really have much of an idea about.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.080
So let's stop and think about it for a second.

29:56.080 --> 30:04.080
My suspicion is that Nietzsche is probably wrong in his argument that good and bad come,

30:04.080 --> 30:10.080
or that our judgments of good and bad and good and evil come from the distinction exclusively of masters and slaves.

30:10.080 --> 30:15.080
Probably the distinction between good and bad is much older than aristocratic social structures,

30:15.080 --> 30:20.080
which are relatively late in human development, maybe two or three thousand BC for the most part.

30:20.080 --> 30:24.080
What it most likely is attached to is feelings of pleasure and pain.

30:24.080 --> 30:30.080
My guess is, again, just speculating Allah and Nietzsche, which should be very much in the Nietzschean tradition,

30:30.080 --> 30:36.080
that probably a full stomach was a good feeling, and going hungry was a bad feeling.

30:36.080 --> 30:40.080
Probably breaking your leg was a bad feeling, and being healthy was a good feeling.

30:40.080 --> 30:47.080
And these may well go before judgments of good and bad based upon aristocratic social structures.

30:47.080 --> 30:56.080
But the fact remains that after these initial judgments of pleasure and pain got turned into our judgments of moral value,

30:56.080 --> 31:03.080
there is a superimposed layer of aristocratic moral judgments in our culture and in our language.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.080
I think that the distinction between noble and base, between noble and mean,

31:07.080 --> 31:13.080
between high moral values and low moral values establishes that with a good degree of plausibility.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.080
Now, what are we to make of this judgment?

31:17.080 --> 31:20.080
What happens when we go beyond good and evil?

31:20.080 --> 31:23.080
And this is a delicate and difficult question.

31:23.080 --> 31:30.080
Nietzsche, in a book called The Antichrist, which he modestly named after himself, one would think,

31:30.080 --> 31:35.080
he describes his procedure as philosophizing with a hammer.

31:35.080 --> 31:41.080
And that's a very intriguing idea, because it shows the destructiveness of his philosophy, the skepticism of it,

31:41.080 --> 31:44.080
and the gleeful malice that's in it.

31:44.080 --> 31:53.080
And I think it's worth considering the fact that philosophizing with a hammer very easily shades over into intellectual vandalism.

31:53.080 --> 31:57.080
And it may be that not everything that can be broken ought to be broken,

31:57.080 --> 32:07.080
and it is not entirely clear that The Antichrist offers us more as a moral alternative than the Christian ethics.

32:07.080 --> 32:14.080
But his willingness to ask questions about it, I think, is what makes Nietzsche of enduring significance to our culture.

32:14.080 --> 32:21.080
For all the madness, for all the evil that's built into it, it's probably the most significant moral development since,

32:21.080 --> 32:23.080
oh, I don't know, the Enlightenment anyway.

32:23.080 --> 32:30.080
And in terms of its artistic qualities, I think that Nietzsche is probably in the same league as Plato.

32:30.080 --> 32:38.080
And as a great poet-philosopher, Nietzsche and Plato are the two greatest figures who combine art and philosophy.

32:38.080 --> 32:46.080
Those of you who have read Nietzsche will know that his critical capacity is awesome and his artistic capacity is quite great.

32:46.080 --> 32:50.080
You would not find that primarily in his poems or in the songs that he writes.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.080
Most of the art that he creates directly is quite inferior,

32:53.080 --> 33:00.080
but his prose poetry is the greatest in the German language and probably the greatest in the Western tradition.

33:00.080 --> 33:06.080
Now, when we finish up with the priest and we find the liabilities of the priest,

33:06.080 --> 33:11.080
when we find that perhaps the priestly type has in fact been selling us a dangerous set of myths,

33:11.080 --> 33:17.080
we wonder if we can go back to the warrior, probably not, except in a sublimated sense.

33:17.080 --> 33:25.080
If we were to take the will to power, turn it into something perhaps not as catastrophic as, I don't know,

33:25.080 --> 33:34.080
Aryan war-makers or superior brutish types, it may be that the type of the philosopher,

33:34.080 --> 33:46.080
that the type of the artist is in fact the warrior type, the individual who needs no moral code to create his own conception of good and bad,

33:46.080 --> 33:54.080
that this type is what can come out of a revaluation of all values and that, I believe, is what is advantageous in Nietzsche.

33:54.080 --> 34:02.080
The difficulty is how we will know when we really are beyond good and evil rather than being beneath good and evil.

34:02.080 --> 34:10.080
Many of Nietzsche's friends and his philosophical admirers have tried to shield Nietzsche from the criticism that he's a proto-Nazi

34:10.080 --> 34:14.080
and in fact I don't think it works, I think in fact Nietzsche is a proto-Nazi.

34:14.080 --> 34:23.080
There's a strong tinge of racism in his work, there is a strong tinge of refined cruelty in his work

34:23.080 --> 34:32.080
and insofar as this was misused in the 20th century by the Nazis and by other racially oriented hate groups,

34:32.080 --> 34:35.080
I think Nietzsche is at least in part to blame.

34:36.080 --> 34:42.080
Those who like Nietzsche's work, who want to shield it from this criticism, will point out with considerable justification

34:42.080 --> 34:46.080
that he would have nothing but contempt for the misuse of his work in the century,

34:46.080 --> 34:51.080
but it won't entirely absolve him of the results of his statements because after all,

34:51.080 --> 34:56.080
Nietzsche would have had contempt for everybody whether they adopt his position or not.

34:56.080 --> 35:02.080
So I would say that the warrior type very easily shades over into the barbarian

35:03.080 --> 35:08.080
and Nietzsche as he puts it beautifully says, I write in order to be misinterpreted

35:08.080 --> 35:12.080
and if we only have a series of misinterpretations of Nietzsche

35:12.080 --> 35:15.080
because he thinks that there is no one canonical interpretation

35:15.080 --> 35:20.080
well then it seems to me that he should bear the brunt of responsibility for everything

35:20.080 --> 35:23.080
both good and bad that comes out of his work

35:23.080 --> 35:31.080
and if we live in a Nietzschean age, it seems to me that we have to find some way of tempering it

35:31.080 --> 35:34.080
whatever it is that is good from the western intellectual tradition

35:34.080 --> 35:38.080
and if we can't agree as to what we want to call undesirable

35:38.080 --> 35:43.080
whether it's good, whether it's bad or evil, whether it's the master conception of what's undesirable

35:43.080 --> 35:48.080
or the slave conception, we may perhaps be able to create a sense of the good

35:48.080 --> 35:52.080
which goes beyond the dichotomy between the two

35:52.080 --> 35:56.080
which allows us to create some sort of overlap between them

35:56.080 --> 36:01.080
perhaps it would be possible, as Nietzsche says, to create an artistic socrates

36:01.080 --> 36:06.080
a moral socrates who is able to both combine the strength of the artist

36:06.080 --> 36:10.080
with the mythological capacities of the priest

36:10.080 --> 36:16.080
who is willing to connect his individual judgment with the concern for what is good for the species

36:16.080 --> 36:21.080
and I think Nietzsche himself would not have entirely disagreed with that

36:21.080 --> 36:26.080
if one is going to create a beautiful artistic philosophy the way Nietzsche does

36:26.080 --> 36:29.080
we have to allow him a certain poetic license

36:29.080 --> 36:33.080
if we are willing to allow Plato's poetry and Plato's myths

36:33.080 --> 36:40.080
a certain degree of consideration and a certain degree of leeway for interpretation

36:40.080 --> 36:44.080
perhaps if we did that with Nietzsche we would come up with a more fertile reading

36:44.080 --> 36:50.080
when you get a chance to read Nietzsche and of all the philosophers I have taught this in this series of lectures

36:50.080 --> 36:54.080
I strongly and most strongly recommend that you do get a look at Nietzsche

36:54.080 --> 37:00.080
when you do keep this in mind Nietzsche has one particular trope which is characteristic of him

37:00.080 --> 37:06.080
which runs through all his work and it's analogous to the one trope which is central to Socrates

37:06.080 --> 37:09.080
if Socrates is the man of inimitable irony

37:09.080 --> 37:15.080
the man who constantly says ironic statements that can be interpreted as the opposite of what he says

37:15.080 --> 37:18.080
Nietzsche's typical trope is the oxymoron

37:18.080 --> 37:22.080
an oxymoron is something like cold fire or hot ice

37:22.080 --> 37:28.080
it's to use words in the opposite way that they are to be interpreted literally

37:28.080 --> 37:32.080
Nietzschean oxymoron is what makes his poetry so moving

37:32.080 --> 37:39.080
and perhaps the idea that he writes in order to be misinterpreted is that kind of oxymoron

37:39.080 --> 37:50.080
perhaps the idea that the distinction between good and evil and good and bad is an unbridgeable distinction

37:50.080 --> 37:54.080
can also be seen as an oxymoronic construction

37:54.080 --> 37:59.080
Nietzsche's treatment of the warrior, Nietzsche's treatment of the priest

37:59.080 --> 38:04.080
if it's not persuasive historically and I think as a historian I think ultimately he's wrong

38:04.080 --> 38:07.080
it is persuasive poetically

38:07.080 --> 38:13.080
and I would ask you to consider the fact that poetic persuasiveness may itself be an oxymoron

38:13.080 --> 38:17.080
Nietzsche believes that having undermined the western intellectual tradition

38:17.080 --> 38:22.080
by having abolished metaphysics, by having abolished the plausibility of Christianity

38:22.080 --> 38:26.080
what he's done is created a new blank slate for us

38:26.080 --> 38:29.080
and if the slate isn't entirely blank

38:29.080 --> 38:32.080
well let's not hold Nietzsche entirely responsible for that

38:32.080 --> 38:39.080
let's allow for the fact that poetry and Nietzsche's strong point is the fact that he is a great prose poet

38:39.080 --> 38:43.080
that poetry offers us a multitude of possible interpretations

38:43.080 --> 38:49.080
and that by offering us a liberation from dogma, a liberation from metaphysics

38:49.080 --> 38:54.080
by offering us a kind of poetry which can create new value

38:54.080 --> 38:57.080
which can create new human superiority

38:57.080 --> 39:03.080
which can create a new and finer culture that Nietzsche has in fact done our culture a great service

39:03.080 --> 39:09.080
however much madness or evil or megalomania is built into the Nietzschean conception of the world

39:09.080 --> 39:12.080
he is surely the greatest philosopher of the last hundred years

39:12.080 --> 39:19.080
and the remainder of the 20th century philosophical tradition would be inconceivable without him

39:19.080 --> 39:23.080
Nietzsche is one of the great forerunners of existentialism

39:23.080 --> 39:28.080
Nietzsche is certainly the first person to articulate the nihilism that threatened our culture

39:28.080 --> 39:36.080
as Christianity had to recede after the attack made by modern natural science in the late 19th century

39:36.080 --> 39:41.080
Nietzsche is not in that respect the cause of the breakup of western religion

39:41.080 --> 39:45.080
he's not the cause of the breakup of western metaphysics

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
Nietzsche just articulates it

39:47.080 --> 39:52.080
you may think of Nietzsche to take a poetic figure as a kind of seismograph

39:52.080 --> 39:57.080
he's the first and most sensitive writer who sees that the continents of our thought are shifting

39:57.080 --> 40:00.080
and rather than causing it he tells us about it

40:00.080 --> 40:06.080
and in telling us about it he forces us to confront something that sooner or later we would have to confront

40:06.080 --> 40:11.080
and insofar as he does a lot of the intellectual dirty work for us

40:11.080 --> 40:15.080
insofar as he's willing to be the antichrist

40:15.080 --> 40:22.080
as he's willing to take upon himself the responsibility for questioning the very foundational elements of our culture

40:22.080 --> 40:25.080
he's one of the greatest thinkers that ever lived

40:25.080 --> 40:28.080
so whatever is liabilities and I think there are many

40:28.080 --> 40:32.080
because he's an anti-Semite, he's a racist, he's a misogynist

40:32.080 --> 40:34.080
there are many evils in Nietzsche's work

40:34.080 --> 40:39.080
but like it or not he forces us to think in ways that we would not think otherwise

40:39.080 --> 40:47.080
he forces us to consider closely ourselves and to ask ourselves how honest are we when we are alone

40:47.080 --> 40:50.080
much less when we are with other people

40:50.080 --> 40:54.080
he asks us not only to have the courage of our convictions

40:54.080 --> 41:01.080
Nietzsche asks, no he demands, that we have the courage to question our convictions

41:01.080 --> 41:05.080
which is a much rarer human quality

41:05.080 --> 41:10.080
insofar as our convictions will stand up to this kind of critical scrutiny

41:10.080 --> 41:14.080
Nietzsche can be thought of as one of the high points in Western culture

41:14.080 --> 41:19.080
the idea of ruthless self-criticism is quintessentially Greek

41:19.080 --> 41:25.080
Nietzsche wants to bring us back to the earlier, higher, finer conception of human beings

41:25.080 --> 41:28.080
characteristic of the non-Socratic Greeks

41:28.080 --> 41:33.080
if you could think of one particular figure that Nietzsche wishes to supplant

41:33.080 --> 41:37.080
in philosophy as opposed to religion, that would be Socrates

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
Nietzsche is the new Socrates

41:39.080 --> 41:45.080
the Socrates of art, the Socrates of the individual, the Socrates of subjectivity

41:45.080 --> 41:50.080
what he has in common with Socrates is the willingness to ask uncomfortable questions

41:50.080 --> 42:01.080
what he has in common with Socrates is a willingness to ask questions about issues that no one feels very comfortable with

42:01.080 --> 42:06.080
what's more important about Nietzsche is that his answers are intrinsically provisional

42:06.080 --> 42:12.080
just like Socrates, Nietzsche says everything is always open to question and always will be

42:12.080 --> 42:17.080
Nietzsche calls us not to any dogma but to a higher and finer kind of life

42:17.080 --> 42:23.080
and insofar as we are heeding that Socratic call, Nietzsche who would be the anti-Socrates

42:23.080 --> 42:27.080
is in fact part of the Socratic tradition as well

42:27.080 --> 42:33.080
and he is both Socrates and an anti-Socrates is a perfectly Nietzschean oxymoron
