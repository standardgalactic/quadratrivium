1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Edmund Husserl is

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
one of the most important and influential figures in 20th century philosophy.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And this is despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he's a particularly difficult

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
philosopher to interpret. His style is extremely recondite, his writings are voluminous,

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
almost to the point of compulsiveness, and he has a tendency to construct neologisms

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to correspond to the new paths that he's breaking into the realm of the psyche,

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or the realm of the mind. Husserl, his early background was in mathematics,

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is very important. Husserl is, perhaps like all mathematicians,

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is a sort of closet platenist. I think that mathematicians on the whole

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
tend to look for something universal and abstract in all the thinking that they do.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And Husserl, who got his PhD under Weierstrass in Germany in the 1880s,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
has a definite set of platonic tendencies and commitments.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So when you read his philosophy, when you think about Husserl's work,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
if you were to connect it and think of it in terms of Plato and the Cartesian tradition,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the tradition of Western rationalism and idealism,

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you will be on the right track at the very least.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, like Descartes, what Husserl wished to do was to construct a new foundation for knowledge.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a radical epistemological move which attempts to create certainty

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
in the face of contingency and the uncertainty that is generated by the other realms of knowledge.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So in similar respects, perhaps like Kant, what Husserl's project involves

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is finding a presuppositionless foundation to human knowledge.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And what this would be is a sort of science of sciences that would inform and direct

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and correct all the other activities of the human mind, including natural science.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So what Husserl is trying to do is get down to the Urschtopf, the bedrock of the human psyche,

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and from there to generate all the other realms of knowledge, which correspond to it.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In some respects, this is like the Cartesian project of looking into oneself

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and after finding an indubitable foundation for that and for the contents of your mind

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to move from there to generating the external world.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So like Descartes, Husserl is working on the assumption that first of all, the self is self-evident.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In other words, it's not controversial that we are selves and that we have selves and that we are conscious.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He takes that to be simply a given and that that is indubitable

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and not only is that indubitable, the interesting thing about it is that the knowing self, the cogito,

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is in Husserl's view both temporally and logically prior to the world that's known by the cogito.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In other words, the knower comes before the known. That has to come first.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And if you think about the idealist tradition, all these guys believe that.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Think about Descartes, think about Spinoza, think about Kant.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The whole idealist or rationalist tradition tends to emphasize inwardness, internality.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And perhaps that's not only an important characteristic of Husserl,

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but I would be inclined to say that that's one of the most characteristic moves,

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the characteristic intellectual deployments of continental philosophy.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In other words, unlike the Anglo-American tradition, which looks outward like Hume

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and develops a theory of the external world and then afterwards as a sort of postscript to that activity,

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
develops a theory of the psyche, of the mind, of what's internal to a human being.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, the continental tradition does the opposite.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They start out with a theory of what's inside, and then from there they try and work outwards.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And both the Anglo-American tradition and the continental tradition suffer from a sort of common problem.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
When they try and make the jump from one realm, what we might call the exocosm,

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to the internal realm, the psyche, the soul, or the mind, or what we might call the introcosm,

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
there's always a problem in leaping that hurdle.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And it doesn't really matter which side you start on.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The problem is always going to be the same.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How do we move from one part of the hurdle to the other?

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How do we move from the beginning to the end?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So when you look at Husserl, when you look at this Cartesian continental tradition,

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
keep that in mind.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They're starting out with the internal facts of human consciousness and generating the world from that.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So it's a different problematic, a different starting point,

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and that's what you keep in mind when you look at Husserl.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now, corresponding to this way of developing a philosophy is the hope of getting certain knowledge,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
like Descartes.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Descartes' whole project of radical skepticism was to develop a knowledge that was foundational

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and completely certain, Husserl is trying to do the same thing.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's a sort of neo-Cartesian.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And much of his work, when you actually start to read the stuff that he's published,

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because although he produced a tremendous amount of writing,

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
most of what he produced was not published in his lifetime.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And he was in a voluminous writing, produced almost 45,000 pages of work,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and it tends to be very repetitive.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It is methodological for the most part and particularly programmatic.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In other words, what his writings are about is how we engage in a method,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
which he calls phenomenology, which will allow us to discern these eternal essences

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that exist within the human psyche.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And once we identify these essences, then we will know ourselves.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And once we know ourselves clearly and in a way that can't be doubted,

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that can't be called into question,

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
then and only then can we construct all the other elements of knowledge.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So what he wants is, what he described as philosophy as a rigorous science,

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which is a very radical sort of an idea.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean, by the 20th century, I think very few thinkers are willing to say

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that philosophy is not only a rigorous science, but it's the foundation,

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the aura knowledge of all other possible cognition.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So this is a long, it's a play that tries to go for all the marbles.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's trying to win the big philosophical game.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And if he fails to do that, and I think that he does,

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and I think that his project is a failure,

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think that we have to admire the sort of nobility which tries to take on

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
a huge intellectual project like that.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
In many respects, because Husserl himself as a man rather than as a philosopher,

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
was a kind of a saintly individual.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He was conspicuous for his dedication and his devotion

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and his moral seriousness to philosophy.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I would almost be tempted to compare him to sort of a Don Quixote of philosophy.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We all laugh at the results of Don Quixote's misadventures

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because, well, they're silly and he misunderstands the way the world works.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But on the other hand, no one laughs at Don Quixote's intentions.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They are intrinsically noble and we have no choice but to admire that.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I kind of feel that way about Husserl.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think that the project, well, not only does it not complete itself,

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it never completely gets started, and it's probably impossible to do.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But I sort of admire the idea of unifying all of knowledge.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is a sort of quest for the holy grail.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And even if we never find it, there is something excellent about the quest.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I say this initially in my treatment of Husserl

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
because I'm going to be kind of hard on him a little later on.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So without being too hard, I think that we should give him a little bit of slack

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because he's trying to do something that if it is not impossible,

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
it's certainly exceedingly difficult, much more ambitious

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
than the local small individual project's characteristic of the Anglo-American tradition.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, first off, he starts out with the idea of certainty and intuition.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In other words, if we're going to examine ourselves in a phenomenological way,

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if we're going to pursue this method of phenomenology,

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we are going to have to find out what the procedure for knowing things is,

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what phenomenology involves as a method, what it investigates, and how it investigates it.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Those are always all going to be informed, and since this is a methodological project,

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it makes sense to talk about how we do this as opposed to what we do.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And one of the big issues here is the question of intuition.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, I guess perhaps when you hear me use a word like intuition,

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
particularly because we live in contemporary America,

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
we are in the thrall of the Anglo-American tradition,

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
you perhaps think that I should put that in italics

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
because intuition is a kind of fishy, kind of mushy, kind of messy sort of a category.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I want to start out suggesting that that's not the case

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and that in fact it might be the truth some of the time,

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but I can imagine intuitions, and I'm going to help you imagine some intuitions,

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
which are not only not controversial but they're not mushy and they're really not doubtable.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Just some ideas.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let me ask you some questions.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have a studio audience here which is live and kind of helps me out.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'd like your information or your answers to these questions.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
First of all, do I have a headache?

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You don't know.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't know.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And how about do I hope someday to be elected president?

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't know.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do I like spinach?

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't know.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My point is that I can answer these questions even though you can't.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I know if I have a headache or not.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And what would somebody else external to me presume to tell me that,

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
no, I don't have a headache?

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You going to correct me on that matter?

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No, of course not.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's silly, right?

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, may I suggest that my knowledge of my headache is a direct intuition of my experience,

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
my psychic state, right?

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I don't need anybody else to help me out here.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And if you doubt that you say,

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
no, Mike, you don't have a headache.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What am I supposed to do?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do some math and show you that I do?

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or should we go to the lab and will I do some experiments and show you that I have a headache?

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can you see why that project is silly?

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we wouldn't gesture something external to my experience of the world

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
in order to validate the proposition that I have a headache?

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Intuition, then, perhaps is not so gooey as we might imagine.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There are certain things which we validate just by gesturing at our experience of them.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In that respect, oddly enough, phenomenology, Husserl's method, and empiricism,

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the method of somebody like David Hume,

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
even though they are so different in many respects,

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
share a common property is that they're all ultimately based on our experience.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hume's phenomenalism, his empiricism, is based on our experience of the external world, observing it.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Husserl's phenomenology, alternatively, is based on our experience of the internal world.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And it reduces only to that, and there's nothing further that we can gesture at.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So, on the one hand, I would recommend that you look at this with a certain degree of skepticism.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In other words, intuition can be a very fishy category.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It can be nebulous, and it can be a simple refusal to give reasons for what you believe.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And usually, the refusal to give a reason philosophically for what you believe

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
is a way of saying that you don't have a reason for what you believe.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But my point is that that's not always the case.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you think about the idea of intuition in terms of questions like,

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
do I have a headache, I believe you will realize that I'm the only one who knows that,

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and that it's not absurd or meaningless for me to say that I have a headache.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, I'm just trying to establish the idea of intuition as not being intrinsically preposterous.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, Husserl was a student of Brentano, which is an interesting fact

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
because Freud was also one of Brentano's students.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And from Brentano, apparently a very influential teacher,

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
he borrowed, as Freud did, the idea of intentionality.

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And that's where it revolves around the proposition that the facts of mental life,

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
of our psychic life, are irreducible.

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In other words, we can't talk about love and hate and hope and guilt and lust in terms of chemicals.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Freud liked the idea that ultimately we could reduce one to the other,

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but in practice he treated it as a sort of autonomous inquiry into the mind.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, something analogous is happening when we look at Husserl.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He believes that the facts of mental life are irreducible and they're real,

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and not only are they irreducible and real, but they come first.

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
In other words, what Husserl wants to do is like the project of Descartes.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He wants to construct the self first and out of that build nature,

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
rather than say the empiricist project of constructing nature first

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then later on constructing the self.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So the self comes first, and how do you find out about yourself?

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Intuition, right?

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the reason why it's important for me to establish intuition is because

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
else-wise this seems like a tremendously nebulous and sort of baggy activity,

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but in fact it potentially could be more precise than one might immediately imagine.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Now what's the problem Husserl wants to solve?

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, in one of his most accessible books, and if you intend to read Husserl,

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
which can be quite trying, I would recommend you try a Philosophy in the Crisis of European Man.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's published in 1936, it's written in the 1930s, and he dies in 1938.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And the reason why that's a good introduction to Husserl is because it's easier to figure out

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
what Husserl is against than it is to figure out what Husserl is for.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And what he's against are things like historicism, relativism, psychologism,

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
scientism, and what he's gesturing at here is the whole tendency of thought since the Enlightenment,

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
which tends to move away from theological or more precisely metaphysical structures

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
towards an emphasis on the empirical external world.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Perhaps this is a homage to the rise of modern natural science,

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but Husserl says that the rise of modern natural science has misled us,

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
has caused us to misunderstand the world around us, and has put philosophy on the wrong footing.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The result of this has been an impoverishment of our culture.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In some ways, I would say that Husserl's concerns are fundamentally cultural.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's putting together this epistemological project in order to rescue us from the degeneration

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
into a sort of pure materialism.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What Husserl thinks, at least Husserl's self-conception is,

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that what he's doing is renewing and reviving the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition of Greek rationalism,

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
where our logos, our rationality, applies to the whole domain of human experience.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let us juxtapose that to the tradition of scientism that we see in Mach and Alvinarius

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and all those positivistic Germans.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There, he calls that the tradition of Democritus.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Those of you who know the Greek philosopher Democritus will know that he reduced the world to atoms and the void.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, in some ways, that's what modern scientific project has done,

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and Husserl says that is a wrong turn.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We have moved down an intellectual cul-de-sac there.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So what he's trying to say is that we must go back to ourselves.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's very interesting to know about the things in the world external to us,

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but the real important thing is for us to know ourselves.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And once we know ourselves, then we will be able to construct our knowledge of the external world on an indubitable foundation.

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But if we start with the external world and its contingency and its messiness and its lack of certainty,

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
all our other intellectual activities, including our knowledge of ourselves,

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is going to reflect that same contingency and uncertainty.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So while the project may not be entirely successful,

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the problem that he's formulating is in fact reasonable and serious and ought to be taken with great care.

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So we're going to move against the general tendency of Western culture since the breakup of the Middle Ages.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There is a decidedly scholastic element to Husserl's work as well,

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
an infinite working out of carefully constructed logical oppositions in a sort of tautological way.

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The construction of elaborate tautologies is perhaps one of the characteristic philosophical problems

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
of mathematicians who eventually become philosophers.

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What were they doing in their training?

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Constructing tautologies and working out the implications of definitions.

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, that's what Husserl's whole project is,

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
because he moves from the domain of space or quantity to the whole domain of human experience.

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So a noble and exciting project, let's dive into it and see if we can make some sort of sense out of it.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Husserl is worried when he's writing philosophy and the crisis of European man.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's think about his context.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He was a professor at the University of Freiburg until 1933 when he was dismissed from his post because he was a Jew.

244
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
National socialism comes in and he gets replaced by one of his students, Martin Heidegger.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And at that time it seems clear enough to Husserl that Western culture is collapsing.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
One of the results of this Democritian tradition as opposed to the revived Platonic Aristotelian tradition

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is that the fact value distinction emerges.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We get various kinds of relativisms.

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We get various kinds of will-to-power, volunteeristic philosophies.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
All of these, according to Husserl, are a sign of cultural degeneration.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And the source of this cultural degeneration is our lack of knowledge of ourselves and the world around us.

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So what he's trying to do is sort of like Ajax, I don't know if you know the Iliad,

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but Ajax preventing the Trojans from burning the Greek ships, he stands there and will not move.

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And there is something tremendously heroic about it even though he may be fighting phantom battles.

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He thinks, at least, that what he's doing is absolutely essential to the project of our culture.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And the problem that we're going to find, or one of the problems we're going to find in this procedure of looking into ourselves

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
is that it could easily become frivolous or arbitrary.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In other words, once I look into myself, I suppose I could tell you the immediate contents of my experience,

259
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but the problem is that that would be arbitrary and completely subjective.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's not going to give us an ultimate foundation.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So we have to do something with our looking into ourselves, with our turning inward.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And what Husserl wants to do is use a method for examining the contents of our psyche,

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and that method will be called phenomenology.

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What he will do is something called the epoché, which is a translation of the idea of suspension.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like Descartes, when he says, I'm going to doubt the whole external world,

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
what Husserl wants to do is, first of all, suspend the whole external world.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now, it's not that he disbelieves in it.

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's not being skeptical of the existence of tables and chairs the way Descartes did in the discourse on method.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's not denying their existence.

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He's just saying that the whole external world is irrelevant.

271
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Bracket it.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's a strict mathematical sense of bracketing a problem, because remember, he had his training as a mathematician.

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So we're going to bracket the problem of the external world and leave out all that stuff.

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And bracketing the external world means that we're going to leave out a great deal of human experience.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
For example, this will leave out things like cause and effect relationships.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why? Because as Jung points out, we don't see cause and effect in the world.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We just see one thing happening after another.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All scientific theorems will be left out.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Mathematical deductions will be left out.

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We're going to be left with the pure raw data of being a human being.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And what Husserl thinks is that there's something common to all of us that we're going to discern there.

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You might think of it as something like this.

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You know what it is to sift out sand, to look for something hidden in us in sand?

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What he's trying to do is sift out the contents of human experience and find out the stuff that doesn't pass through the measure of phenomenology.

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What we hold on to there will be what Husserl calls an essence.

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Some invariable necessary quality to human experience.

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And when we collect these essences together and reduce them still further,

288
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think what we will get is some common oar stuff of the human psyche.

289
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Also think of the idea of reduction.

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Reduction is a funny word.

291
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
From Latin it means to lead back.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We're going to be led back to our original kind of primal consciousness.

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Another way of thinking of reduction would be the idea of boiling down.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Imagine the consciousness is a big whale and you're going to put it in a pot and boil away all the stuff that's irrelevant

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
so that you can get to something that's essential and structural and permanent there.

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And this longing for something essential and structural and permanent,

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
can't you hear the ghost of Plato here?

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's the typical intellectual move of somebody that's been trained in mathematics.

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And this has had a tremendous influence on the subsequent development of continental philosophy,

300
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
particularly people like Heidegger.

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In the process of developing this presuppositionless philosophy,

302
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
what we're going to find out is something like the shape of the ego's transparent cage.

303
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Like Kant, he's going to tell us what the necessary limitations of our experience are.

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And once he's done that, he will think that he has done it permanently for all of time in the way that any mathematician would.

305
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Now, the problem is to find some certain knowledge with which to combat historicism,

306
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that we get in Diltai or scientism, that we get the positivists or various kinds of relativism.

307
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And the way we're going to do that is by boiling down with this epoché.

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And in the first case, what we'll do is we will have a sort of purified subjectivity.

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We will boil it down until we get to the essential constructs from which human minds are made.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And the result will be that authentic reality will be disclosed.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We're going to suspend our belief in the external world and just examine what's left over.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And what's left over after we perform this kind of an activity of reduction

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
will be these essences that are permanent and eternal.

314
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And he will know then the structure of the human mind.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And these will always be, they will always have a similar set of characteristics.

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And phenomenological statements will result from this phenomenological examination

317
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
of the internal contents of our psyche.

318
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And the key thing here is that it's not empirical in the sense that I can observe that

319
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and have it be an empirical activity.

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It will be descriptive, but it won't describe anything out there.

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's going to describe exclusively the stuff that's in here.

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So it's going to be a descriptive theory of the introcosm.

323
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And what he's looking for is absolute certainty without presuppositions

324
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and it will always be about internal intentional actions.

325
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What he's trying to do here is derive a priori statements.

326
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And if you remember Kant, what an a priori statement is is it has at least two qualities.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
One, it's non-empirical.

328
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And two, it's necessarily true.

329
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So what he wants to find is to generate after looking into his own psyche in this phenomenological way,

330
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
sifting out the contingent and the arbitrary and the irrelevant,

331
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
is a priori certain truths about what it means to be a human being.

332
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Kant-Uberalis once again.

333
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Now the problem that you might want to say that after this reduction,

334
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what we're getting is something like immediate direct apprehension

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
of what the scholastics called universals.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We're looking directly into the self and since the self constructs and projects the world,

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
what we're going to do is cogitate our self and bootstrap our self into some permanent reality.

338
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Now there are many difficulties with this.

339
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Some of them we should look at directly.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
First of all, there are very few examples in Husserl's work of actually doing this.

341
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
One of the problems with phenomenology, the nebulous baggy quality about it,

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
is that he says that the first thing we have to do is figure out what the phenomenological method is

343
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and the way we develop the phenomenological method is to use phenomenology on itself.

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
To inspect yourself.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So there's something fishy going on here.

346
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
In order to find out what a phenomenon is, remember in Greek phenomenon is that which is disclosed,

347
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that which is apparent and directly known.

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well, in order to find out what a phenomenon is,

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
one of the things we're going to do is reduce the idea of the phenomenon

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to find out what that essentially is and from there we'll be able to move directly on.

351
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So it's a method that hopes to pull itself up by its bootstraps

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and I have some problems logically with this activity.

353
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let me give you some examples to kind of flesh this out

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and make this a little bit easier to concretely think about.

355
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And Husserl himself was generating things like investigations of phenomenon

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but also ideas like number, meaning, truth, pure abstractions

357
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that he believes are common to all cognitive beings

358
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and in every case we end up with some sort of a circle,

359
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
what he calls the epistemological circle

360
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and at other times the methodological circle.

361
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The reasoning always ends up being circle

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but of course if you're going to restrict yourself to the domain of internality

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
what else could you be doing but talking about circular things in a circular way?

364
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Where is there to go?

365
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's almost not even a circle, it's something like a point.

366
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It almost lacks that interior quality

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and his method or the method that he uses more often than any other

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
because it's very difficult to figure out exactly what this amounts to

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
is what he calls free imaginative variation.

370
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's see what that's like.

371
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's how we search for essences

372
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and what we're going to do is think of something, let's take a human being

373
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
as something that I'm going to do a phenomenological reduction on

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm going to think about that problem now, cogitating with me.

375
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Alright, let's give this a shot.

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What we're going to do is attribute predicates to this thing, human being

377
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and then add and subtract them in our imagination

378
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and see which of these predicates we believe we can dispense with

379
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and which we believe we cannot dispense with.

380
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And then we'll make two categories, the ones we can dispense with

381
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the contingent things we're trying to get rid of, that's the sand we're sifting away

382
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and the things we can dispense with which are the essences

383
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and that's what we'll be looking for.

384
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Let me give you an example.

385
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Is it true that we necessarily have to attach the following predicate to the human mind

386
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
that the human mind is good at math?

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Is that true of every human mind?

388
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No, I'm bad at math.

389
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I mean, I know for a fact that it's not true of every human mind.

390
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm no good at math.

391
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let's try another one.

392
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The human mind forgets birthdays.

393
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, it's a predicate but some human minds remember birthdays.

394
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Talk about this one.

395
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The human mind is self-conscious.

396
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you think you could dispense with that?

397
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No, I mean, it's built right into the idea of what we mean by being a human mind.

398
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So what we're doing here is attributing a great number of predicates.

399
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
One of the great problems here is it seems to me there are an infinite number of predicates

400
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and we're never going to get, we're never going to finish the first thing we try and reduce,

401
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
much less do all the other reductions that are going to be necessary to engage in this project.

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But at least this is an instantiation of what the guy is trying to do

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
to separate the necessary from the unnecessary, the inessential from the essential predicates.

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And once you have the whole list of essential predicates of a thing, now you know what it is.

405
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And then you get these things that are defined now as their essences,

406
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
just the essential predicates, and then we start to boil that down again.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And you keep on boiling until you get to complete disclosure of what it means to be a human being.

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I think this is a pretty fishy way of doing this.

409
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I think the idea of trying to find out what it's like to be a human being inwardly

410
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is an interesting thought.

411
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The difficulty is that in practice it's awfully hard to talk about these things.

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Now, here's the first difficulty.

413
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Truth conditions.

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
How do we know which of these predicates are the essential ones?

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Help me out here.

416
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I can imagine some which it seems fairly clear.

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Triangles have to have the property of having three sides.

418
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I can believe that.

419
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I mean, that's not too controversial, but I can imagine cases where it wouldn't be clear,

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
even among phenomenologists, and there might be a lack of agreement.

421
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I'm not quite sure how we go about finding that out.

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And even if I just look at it from my own perspective,

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you know, leave out the social interaction between phenomenologists,

424
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I look at it in my case and I say, alright,

425
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
so I've decided that one of the essential predicates of human being

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
is the fact that it is self-conscious.

427
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's just fine.

428
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Now, suppose I'm uncertain about that.

429
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, I guess I can't be uncertain about it because I found out by introspection

430
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and I'm certain of all the things that I introspect.

431
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So I guess I can't be uncertain about that.

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But suppose I talk to one of my students and I say, kid,

433
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
one of the essential properties of the human mind is that it's self-conscious.

434
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Suppose he says, professor, how do you know?

435
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And what is it? Pound the table and say, look, don't ask me how I know.

436
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I looked inside myself and I know.

437
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's not a very satisfactory answer and you get the sense that there's no real way to gesture at this.

438
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The difficulty that we're going to find is something like this.

439
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I can say, look, I'll do it right now.

440
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I intuited this yesterday.

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I looked inside myself and I found out that one of the essential properties of human being

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
is that it should be self-conscious.

443
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And if you don't believe me, I'm going to do it now.

444
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm going to sit here and introspect and, yeah, I'm definitely right.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I've done the phenomenological reduction.

446
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I bracketed the world and take my word for it.

447
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is really the case.

448
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Now, we would like this to be a universal logical procedure.

449
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We would like this to be univocal.

450
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
My sense is that in practice it is not.

451
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Problem number one.

452
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
One of the things that sort of ruins Husserl for a man

453
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
is if you have been exposed to Ludwig Wittgenstein before you do Husserl

454
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
because Wittgenstein's work is a wonderful way of dissolving these kind of problems.

455
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
In other words, Wittgenstein says he doesn't want to talk about whether this is true or false.

456
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He says, look, the whole problem is misconceived

457
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and that's the real difficulty we have here.

458
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And let's think about what the criticism of this is going to be.

459
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What Husserl thinks he's doing when he finds out what the essence of a human being is,

460
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
he thinks he's finding out something about the universal structure of the human mind

461
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and that all people have to think that because these words, these terms like human being,

462
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
correspond to natural kinds in the world.

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And the natural kinds in the world correspond to natural categories in human cognition.

464
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
My point is that's probably not true.

465
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Wittgenstein will help us out here.

466
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Wittgenstein says, I want to lead the fly out of the fly bottle.

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Husserl is a guy walking around, or like a fly, walking around inside the fly bottle unable to get out.

468
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Here's the problem.

469
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Instead of essences being a quality intrinsic to the human mind,

470
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wittgenstein will point out that essences are a quality intrinsic to a particular language.

471
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So when you find out that self-consciousness is a necessary predicate for essence,

472
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you're not finding out some quality about the human mind intrinsically which corresponds to essence.

473
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What you're finding out is about the way we use the word essence in the English language.

474
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So Wittgenstein, by dissolving this, could have saved...

475
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I mean, if you'd just been born a generation apart,

476
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
in other words, if Wittgenstein had come a generation before instead of Husserl coming a generation before,

477
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
he could have saved the guy an awful lot of handwriting.

478
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because look, the whole idea is wrong.

479
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
There's no such thing as an essence, and what you're trying to do,

480
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
what you're doing is reifying language and treating it as a model of the psyche, and it's just wrong.

481
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
There was a wonderful...

482
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, think about my hypothetical situation with my student, where I said,

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
look, I intuited this yesterday, I did the phenomenological reduction,

484
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm going to do it now, and believe me, this will confirm what I said yesterday

485
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
that the essence of human being is consciousness.

486
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This is a lot like what Wittgenstein said when he said, look,

487
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
suppose you bought a newspaper and you had some doubt as to what the story meant,

488
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
or of the truth of a given story on page one.

489
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
How would you find out if the story was true?

490
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Well, there are different ways you might do that, but one way that you wouldn't do that

491
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
is to go out and buy another copy of the same paper.

492
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Right? Now you see the point?

493
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So when I said, look, I'm going to intuit this again for you.

494
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What I'm doing is I'm buying another copy of the same paper.

495
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This doesn't tell us anything, and this can't tell us anything.

496
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I can buy an infinite number of copies of the same paper,

497
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
but it's still not going to tell us anything.

498
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
See the difficulty here? He's trapped within the intracosm,

499
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and he can't figure out how to get out.

500
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And neither can I if I follow this procedure.

501
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now can you see why this is going to be an extremely nebulous kind of philosophy,

502
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
where it's going to be very hard to talk about how we move from my internal consciousness

503
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to certain facts of the psyche to yours?

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The difficulty here is that when we turn inward,

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and when we get a symbolically unmediated knowledge of anything internal to my psyche,

506
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the lack of those symbols, that lack of mediation between me and these objects,

507
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
means that it's real hard for me to talk about them later on.

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And that means that it comes very close to talking to yourself,

509
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and that is the opposite of what philosophy ought to be.

510
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
In a way, that's a betrayal of the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition.

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The idea of logos demands that knowledge not just be rational, but that it be communicable.

512
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's one of the canons of rationality.

513
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And Husserl comes up to the barriers of language,

514
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
what Wittgenstein calls the limits of what can be said.

515
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And he'd like to step over, but he never quite manages to do it.

516
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So that's the kind of problem that comes up again and again and again.

517
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Now towards the end of his life, he developed the idea of the Lebenswelt, the life world,

518
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and this turn is toward the imminence of human experience and human consciousness.

519
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Let me see if I can explain this idea.

520
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What he wants to do is to look at the world as it appears to human beings,

521
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
as it is given in human experience, as opposed to the impersonal,

522
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
abstract experience of the world that we get from our study of modern natural science.

523
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
In other words, science tells us, for example, that time goes on indefinitely.

524
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Human beings don't experience time like that.

525
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They have a very limited span in the world.

526
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's one of the big differences.

527
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Concrete time is human time, my life.

528
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Abstract time is just T sub 1, T sub 2, T sub n.

529
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It goes on forever.

530
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
In other words, science abstracts and to that extent somewhat falsifies the reality of human experience.

531
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
He spends a lot of time discussing his views on time and his views on internal time consciousness.

532
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's the kind of thing that phenomenology would be suited to

533
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
if we could ever get something done out of it.

534
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The difficulty is this.

535
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Husserl spends a lot of his time, most of his career, not actually doing phenomenology,

536
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
applying this method, but rather figuring out what this method is

537
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and refining it and trying to explain how it is we're going to do something later on

538
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
as soon as we figure out how to do it.

539
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It appears, from my reading of this, which has been most unsatisfactory,

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
because the philosophy itself is, in many respects, quite nebulous.

541
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The best understanding I could come away with is this,

542
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that at some point in the indefinite future,

543
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
we will find out precisely what this method is.

544
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I mean precisely, mathematically Cartesian in that sense.

545
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And then after we find out precisely what the method is at some point in the indefinite future,

546
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
we will then actually be able to apply it to something and get some results

547
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
at some indefinite point beyond that.

548
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And then after that, at some indefinite point, after we've gotten all these essences and assembled them all in a lovely array,

549
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
then we'll have some idea of what exactly we can do with this.

550
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean, I'm told initially that the whole point of it is to give us an indubitable foundation to knowledge.

551
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I would hope so, but it seems like we have to act on faith to a great extent,

552
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
because it's very hard for him to communicate with us directly what it is that we're supposed to do with this

553
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and how it is we're supposed to do it.

554
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The best phenomenologists dispute questions like this.

555
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A further problem that we're going to get out of this neocartesian kind of a project is the question of other minds.

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Descartes always had a problem.

557
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, he didn't have any problem explaining how he knew he existed and what his existence was like.

558
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But he always ran up against a sort of glass barrier when he tried to explain what grounds we have for believing in the reality of other people's psyche.

559
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why is this not a kind of wilderness of objects?

560
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And he thinks that there are other minds, but he can't quite explain why or how,

561
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and Husserl is doing something very much like that.

562
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He says among other things that we find out about human minds through something that is phenomenologically present to us, empathy.

563
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Alas, he doesn't have a satisfactory phenomenological analysis of empathy.

564
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He kind of pounds the desk and insists that yes, there are other minds, yes, we can know them, and yes, we do so through empathy.

565
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And to be honest, I think that that's kind of in a pre-philosophic kind of common sense way. That's true.

566
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I mean, how else are you going to find that about other minds?

567
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know why we need a philosophy to tell us this.

568
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know why we need this elaborate procedure in order to be able to affirm that.

569
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't think that he really made any progress along those lines.

570
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Here's the issue. Let's drop back a little bit and think about what the difficulty we have here is.

571
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
He wants to turn inward, and he also wants to talk.

572
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And the advantage of the Anglo-American tradition is that by concentrating on external stuff on the public world,

573
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
it's relatively easy to say what you're talking about, to refer directly to things in the world, because they're public, they're external, they're here.

574
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
When I turn inward, it's very hard to make these questions public.

575
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And here's the difficulty. The temptation that the Anglo-American tradition has is to just abolish the internal world.

576
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Remember, I mean, think of the idea that we get with Locke and Hume, that the psyche is a kind of an empty box, a tabula rasa,

577
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and all these impressions get sent in, and then we associate them, you get that association of psychology, and that's what the mind is.

578
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's a bundle of sensations.

579
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That is an impoverished view of human experience.

580
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I mean, if you stop and think about it, nobody views the world and experiences the world as a bundle of sensations.

581
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Here's the difficulty. If we follow the Anglo-American tradition and we insist on the accuracy and precision of our speech,

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
all we're able to talk about is the external world.

583
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Their statements about what goes on inside, in other words, the Anglo-American empiricists can't make the jump from the outside in.

584
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And that's why the theory of the internal world is so impoverished, and it doesn't really persuade anybody.

585
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
In other words, the Anglo-American tradition is a theory of the things that are easy to talk about.

586
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The difficulty is that there are more things on heaven and earth that are dreamt of in your philosophy.

587
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I have an internal life. I experience the world that way.

588
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And although these things are difficult to talk about, I feel the need to say something about them, even if it is unclear and nebulous.

589
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Can you see then what the continental response to that is?

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
What they're going to do is sacrifice precision in order to enlarge the domain of discourse.

591
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It is possible to truncate the domain of discourse, as the Anglo-American tradition does,

592
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and you get an increased resolution in the precision of your speech,

593
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
but this resolution costs a very high price. You lose all of internal reality.

594
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You lose the internal world. They deny there is an internal world.

595
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What that sort of procedure will lead to is something like behavioral psychology,

596
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Pavlov and Watson and Skinner, where there is no mind to talk about.

597
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Now here is the difficulty. If you follow that sort of a scientific Anglo-American path,

598
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
what you're going to get is a very elegant and precise set of verbal canons,

599
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
which account for the world around us, but don't do a very good job of telling you about yourself.

600
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And what Husserl and the Cartesians of various stripes will say is that,

601
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
if you don't know yourself, how are you going to know the world?

602
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Or what the Delphi says, know thyself? It's a precondition for knowledge.

603
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
On the other hand, if you want to stay on the inside,

604
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the difficulty is that we are unable to get even the most basic

605
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
or foundational gestures at this content across to other people.

606
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I know very well about my internal mental states.

607
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I have a hard time getting them across to you.

608
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Much of Ludwig Wittgenstein's work was an attempt to bridge this gap,

609
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
but it's very, very difficult and at least mysterious and startling formations.

610
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What Husserl did, kind of pounding on the desk in a kind of Cartesian way,

611
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
is to construct the idea of intersubjectivity.

612
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In other words, the way in which these phenomenological psyches,

613
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
these transcendental egos communicate with each other is,

614
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
or the matrix in which they communicate with each other,

615
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
is his idea of intersubjectivity,

616
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
an idea which is never completely or clearly defined.

617
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It allows us to form a sort of linguistic or verbal community with other minds.

618
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I kind of naively believe that there is such a thing,

619
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
but he isn't able to give any very satisfactory account of it,

620
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and the reason why is the structure I was gesturing at just a little while ago.

621
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
All these continental guys, if you look at yourself,

622
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it's hard to break out of this solipsistic circle.

623
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
If you start on the outside, the problem is you can't get into your own mind,

624
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and you started out as a mind, there are problems with both sides.

625
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What I'm trying to do here is something like this.

626
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Not to vindicate or justify Husserl,

627
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
because I think there probably isn't going to work.

628
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
In many respects, you may want to think of Husserl as being German romanticism,

629
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Cartesianized, the lonely ego of Schiller or Goethe,

630
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
given a sort of mathematical Cartesian formulation,

631
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and he insists in a kind of romantic way that I am a self,

632
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I know I am conscious, and I can't doubt that.

633
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's the fact of the matter.

634
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
On this rock, I will build my church.

635
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Well, I can see how you might have a certain desire to do that.

636
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
My problem is that we're always going to end up either talking to ourselves

637
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
or constructing arbitrary, commonsensical bridges

638
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
from our philosophical solipsism into the regular world of everyday practice.

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That's built into the idea of this project that all the continental thinkers are involved with.

640
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What I'm asking for, in some respects,

641
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
is that you cut the continental philosophers a little bit of slack

642
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
because of the fact that the project they have undertaken is probably impossible.

643
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It may well be just impossible to talk about the internal facts of my psychic states.

644
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Or it is so with a great deal of difficulty and a great deal of cloudiness.

645
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It is not any particular problem with Husserl or any specific philosopher.

646
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It is built into that kind of project of bridging this gap

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
between what's inside and what's outside.

648
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But here's the alternative.

649
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We can go to the Anglo-American tradition.

650
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Professor Staloff and I have this argument essentially all the time,

651
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
because neither one is completely satisfactory.

652
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Well, if you start out with the external world,

653
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you're never going to get a sense of yourself,

654
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you're never going to be able to talk about these internal facts,

655
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and that means that you will have to impoverish the vocabulary of our experience.

656
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
In other words, the problem with Hume or with any of these Anglo-American appearances

657
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
is that I just don't experience the world like that.

658
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I think that that's a very fair objection.

659
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let me give you an example.

660
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
There's an analogy here, and this would perhaps make this whole difference

661
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
between the Anglo-Americans and the Continentals more apparent.

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Let's try the idea of going to a tailor and getting a suit of clothes.

663
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's a simple everyday thing.

664
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You go to a tailor, and he measures you,

665
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and you come back next week, and you've got your suit of clothes.

666
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And you put on the jacket, and you find out the jacket only has one arm.

667
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The tailor says, well, if your jacket only has one arm, your body is wrong.

668
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And the customer might well say, well, no, no, hold it.

669
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Let me get this straight now.

670
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
My body is wrong, and your suit is right.

671
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's insane. I mean, that's not the idea here.

672
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
In other words, my body starts out being right.

673
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm sure that this is how I'm shaped.

674
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And that if you only have one sleeve in your jacket, change the jacket.

675
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The jacket is wrong, not my body.

676
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And if the tailor says, no, that's absurd of you.

677
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You really have to remove that arm.

678
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
That's crazy. I'm not removing my arm.

679
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You're definitely putting another arm to this jacket.

680
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
In other words, do we change our body to suit our jacket?

681
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
We change our jacket to suit our body.

682
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Now let me suggest that our body is the set of our experiences,

683
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
and that the jacket is the philosophical theory with which we account for them.

684
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You really want to cut off your experience of cause and effect,

685
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
of good and evil, of lust and rage and hatred and beauty,

686
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
because you can't talk about them precisely.

687
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Or is this demand for philosophical precision taken to an unreasonable extreme?

688
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
In other words, when A.J. Ayer,

689
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that has the view that, say, more moral theory is non-cognitive.

690
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Well, I experience morals at least sometimes as being real and right and wrong.

691
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
If these Anglo-American guys, these real hard-shell empiricists,

692
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
tell me that my experience is wrong, it's like the tailor telling me my body's wrong.

693
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't tell me that I'm experiencing the world wrong.

694
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No, your theory is wrong.

695
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And if it doesn't correspond to my experience, then fix the theory.

696
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Don't tell me to fix my experience.

697
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
My experience comes first.

698
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Now can you see the strength of Husserl's point?

699
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This is a devastating sort of an argument.

700
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And in my view, it's actually true.

701
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
In other words, I think that Husserl's attempt to find a way out of this labyrinth just doesn't work.

702
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
He's spinning his wheels, he's caught in a snowdrift.

703
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But the idea of telling to these scientific, empirical, rational, logical guys

704
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that if your theory doesn't correspond to my experience, your theory is wrong, not my experience,

705
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I think that's right on the money.

706
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I think that's the strong point of all continental philosophies.

707
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
They say, I'm going to look at myself in the way I experience the world first.

708
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And if your theory corresponds to that and accounts for that, so be it.

709
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
If it doesn't, I am not going to say, well, look, I'll give up on beauty, I'll give up on morality,

710
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll give up on all my psychic states, all my emotions,

711
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
because after all, either I talk about them clearly or I don't talk about them at all.

712
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No, this demand for clarity has been taken to an unreasonable extreme.

713
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It will be much better for us if we were to start with experience,

714
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
or as Husserl's slogan was, to the things themselves.

715
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Well, modify that a bit. Let's start with experience.

716
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Let's make our slogan experience first, me first.

717
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And then I'll construct my world around that.

718
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm not going to construct myself around the world. That's insane.

719
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's like changing my body to suit my suit. That's crazy.

720
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This is the strong point of Husserl.

721
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And if it doesn't ultimately offer us intuition of the essence of being,

722
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
whatever it is that he's trying to do here,

723
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
if it doesn't offer us the ultimate structure of human cognition,

724
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it does make an important point against the problem that Western philosophy has drifted into.

725
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It makes the point that I come first.

726
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And that's what phenomenology is.

727
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
If you leave out all the verbiage and the elaborate intellectual apparatus that he constructs,

728
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it all proceeds from the basic intuition that my experience is right.

729
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And any theory that tells me my experience is mistaken is, fundamentally,

730
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
it has a cart before the horse.

731
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And I think that's what holds together the whole tradition of continental philosophy in the 20th century.

732
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
This will be true for Husserl, but it's also going to be true for Heidegger.

733
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's going to be true for Bergson.

734
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's going to be true for all these guys that start out looking at themselves.

735
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And if they get nebulous and fuzzy, well, that's just built into the problem.

736
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Another analogy that we can bring to this is that it's like singing.

737
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The precision of our diction costs something.

738
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The precision of our thinking and speech costs something.

739
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We can loosen up the diction so that it's not so precise what we're saying,

740
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
but we can gain in range.

741
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
We can hit the high notes intellectually.

742
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I think that talking about right and wrong and talking about beauty

743
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and talking about the really important things psychically,

744
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
those are the high notes of philosophy.

745
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And the problem is that the empiricists can't hit those notes.

746
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
They have better diction than I do, but you can hit the high notes like this.

747
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And this is what it's for.

748
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And so for all the nebulous and dubious and perhaps even mystical qualities

749
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that we find in Husserl, this is a serious and worthwhile attempt

750
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
to account for what it means to be an ego in the 20th century.
