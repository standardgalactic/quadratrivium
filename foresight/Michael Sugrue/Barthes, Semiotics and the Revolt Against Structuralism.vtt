00:25.940 --> 00:29.820
Rollin Bart is one of the most

00:29.820 --> 00:33.780
and influential of the contemporary French cultural critics.

00:33.780 --> 00:38.580
He died in 1980, but before he had finished his final work,

00:38.580 --> 00:41.340
he had broken decisively with the most important traditions

00:41.340 --> 00:44.940
in post-World War II Western European thought.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.560
Particularly, he made a decisive break

00:46.560 --> 00:48.900
with structuralism and with Marxism.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.940
And the result of his investigations,

00:51.940 --> 00:54.260
which are organized around the theme of semiotics,

00:54.260 --> 00:57.540
the theory of science, served to drive

00:57.540 --> 00:59.660
the tendency of contemporary French culture

00:59.660 --> 01:02.260
and perhaps to some degree the tendency of contemporary

01:02.260 --> 01:05.540
high culture throughout the West towards post-structuralism

01:05.540 --> 01:06.900
and post-modernism.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.500
So this is Bart's great achievement,

01:09.500 --> 01:12.860
which is bound up with his critical activities.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.620
And we might be inclined to say that Bart

01:15.620 --> 01:18.660
is, offers us one possible reading of Nietzsche.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.460
In fact, Bart's reading of Nietzsche,

01:20.460 --> 01:22.740
which emphasizes aesthetics, which emphasizes

01:22.740 --> 01:24.620
a critical stance, which emphasizes

01:24.620 --> 01:28.320
the outsider status of the critic,

01:28.320 --> 01:31.840
actually transforms the critic into a creative artist.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.800
And in the process of expanding the domain of the critic,

01:34.800 --> 01:37.080
in expanding the creativity of the critic,

01:37.080 --> 01:39.840
creates a new sort of art form, or if not

01:39.840 --> 01:43.520
a new sort of art form, a new approach to human creativity,

01:43.520 --> 01:47.400
which allows for the questioning of all previously

01:47.400 --> 01:50.640
established verities and allows for the undermining

01:50.640 --> 01:52.760
and interrogation of what post-modernists

01:52.760 --> 01:55.800
call foundational discourses.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.760
Now, because Bart was a French intellectual who

01:58.760 --> 02:01.200
was simultaneously Protestant, homosexual,

02:01.200 --> 02:02.640
and without a terminal degree.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.560
He had become ill when he was supposed

02:04.560 --> 02:06.480
to stand for his final examinations.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.000
He was very much an outsider in the French Academy.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.560
He was everything that most French intellectuals are not.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.320
And for that reason, I think that there

02:16.320 --> 02:17.920
were personal issues which tended

02:17.920 --> 02:21.440
to drive his demythologizing project, which made him more

02:21.440 --> 02:24.240
sensitive to the hidden coercions,

02:24.240 --> 02:29.600
to the hidden hypocrisies in the contemporary state

02:29.600 --> 02:31.720
of French intellectual culture, but also particularly

02:31.720 --> 02:33.520
French mass culture.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.240
Bart is remarkable for his very sensitive and very

02:36.240 --> 02:39.840
intelligent readings of mass culture

02:39.840 --> 02:41.800
and the artifacts of mass culture.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.080
What he does is use semiotics, which I'll explain in a bit,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.400
to try and decode the artifacts of mass culture

02:48.400 --> 02:50.960
to discern what hidden messages are being generated

02:50.960 --> 02:53.560
in these cultural artifacts and who

02:53.560 --> 02:56.720
it is that's generating these messages for what purposes,

02:56.720 --> 02:59.120
usually coercive, of course, because he at least

02:59.120 --> 03:01.160
starts out in the Marxist tradition.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.640
And ultimately, the point, or at least initially,

03:03.640 --> 03:07.480
his point of demythologizing, of finding the hidden meanings

03:07.480 --> 03:09.840
caught within the artifacts of mass culture

03:09.840 --> 03:15.680
was to liberate us from the tyranny of mass-produced

03:15.680 --> 03:16.680
consciousness.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.560
So he wants to free us, to liberate us,

03:18.560 --> 03:20.400
and perhaps individuate us.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
He says in a piece called The Lover's Discourse,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.840
which is a lovely book, very half-novelistic and half

03:26.840 --> 03:28.520
essayist, it's quite a lovely piece.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.480
He says that the reason why he wrote the book

03:30.480 --> 03:32.320
is because The Lover's Discourse is a discourse

03:32.320 --> 03:34.200
of profound loneliness.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.440
And in fact, Bart is continuing a theme

03:36.440 --> 03:38.960
that was developed in the middle part of the 20th century

03:38.960 --> 03:42.680
in French culture, the idea of the lonely ego

03:42.680 --> 03:46.040
existentially operating in a void of meaning,

03:46.040 --> 03:49.280
in a void of coherence, deciding arbitrarily

03:49.280 --> 03:52.480
how to arrange and fix the world in a way almost constructing

03:52.480 --> 03:53.440
the world.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.360
So Bart, like many French intellectuals,

03:55.360 --> 03:58.000
is retreating into interiority, is

03:58.000 --> 04:00.040
retreating away from the external world,

04:00.040 --> 04:03.880
and trying to suggest that the external world is constructed

04:03.880 --> 04:06.000
by us, not given to us.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.400
If you can see, this is some ways

04:07.400 --> 04:09.200
a derivation from the Kantian project

04:09.200 --> 04:11.600
of showing that we actively construct the external world.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.680
But it's much more radical than Kant's project,

04:14.680 --> 04:16.320
because what Bart is going to argue

04:16.320 --> 04:19.760
is ultimately that we construct not just the world of signs,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.440
the area of society, the domain of history,

04:22.440 --> 04:26.520
also ultimately nature is a social and linguistic construct.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.720
So in a way, you could see that he's

04:27.720 --> 04:31.080
formulating a sort of Cartesian aesthetics in which

04:31.080 --> 04:35.200
the lonely ego confronts a completely indeterminate world.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.400
And the project is then interesting, creative,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.680
pleasurable world making.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.080
So what Bart is doing is liberating the critic,

04:44.080 --> 04:46.680
liberating the ego, and liberating the self

04:46.680 --> 04:51.000
from preconceived identities, and from arbitrary and spurious

04:51.000 --> 04:53.480
limitations on human activity.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.960
We might want to say that Bart created a poetic protest

04:55.960 --> 04:58.040
against human limitations, and it's

04:58.040 --> 05:00.960
in the form of a demythologizing myth.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.600
We will find, ironically enough, at the end of his project

05:03.600 --> 05:08.360
that Bart goes so far in the process of semiotic demythologizing

05:08.360 --> 05:10.240
that not only does he conclude that he

05:10.240 --> 05:13.000
is able to demythologize the various artifacts

05:13.040 --> 05:17.280
of mass culture around him, but he becomes reflexive and ironic

05:17.280 --> 05:20.520
and undertakes to inquire into structuralism and Marxism

05:20.520 --> 05:23.520
and semiotics itself if it is not also

05:23.520 --> 05:25.680
a myth with a hidden agenda.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.280
And so what we end up with is the demythologizer

05:29.280 --> 05:32.960
ends up demythologizing demythology.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.080
And what you end up with then is a sort of metamith,

05:36.080 --> 05:39.240
an ironic assertion that instead of unmasking reality

05:39.240 --> 05:41.680
so that we can see the true face, the substantial reality

05:41.680 --> 05:43.760
beneath, we are going to unmask reality

05:43.760 --> 05:46.360
and find beneath that it's just another mask.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.760
And then it turns out to be masks all the way down.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.000
There's no face underneath it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.160
There is no substantial reality.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.360
So what Bart is doing is withdrawing into interiority

05:55.360 --> 06:00.480
to a very carefully and thoroughly cultivated self.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.160
And Bart is, I would say, the great philosophical exponent

06:04.160 --> 06:06.280
of pleasure and the pleasure principle

06:06.280 --> 06:08.400
in contemporary thought.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.480
The sort of person that moves away

06:10.480 --> 06:14.480
from the external world tries to render it dubious, contingent,

06:14.480 --> 06:17.720
arbitrary, and depended upon construction by the self

06:17.720 --> 06:19.800
is the sort of person that feels oppressed

06:19.800 --> 06:22.120
by the external world and would like to remove

06:22.120 --> 06:23.360
all those limitations.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.400
I would be tempted to say that Bart's word in some respects

06:26.400 --> 06:29.000
represents the triumph of the pleasure principle

06:29.000 --> 06:30.880
over the reality principle.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.600
He withdraws into his mind the way the Epicurean does

06:34.600 --> 06:38.000
into withdraw into his pleasure garden.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.920
And that's the reason why one of his finest and latest works

06:40.920 --> 06:43.120
is called The Pleasures of the Text.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.120
What he has done by liberating us from authority

06:46.120 --> 06:49.760
and from the author and from any preconceived, predetermined

06:49.760 --> 06:53.760
meaning within a text is to say that we, as critics,

06:53.760 --> 06:58.440
as careful readers of the text, have completely free play.

06:58.440 --> 07:02.400
Our domain is one of complete power and complete control.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.760
By withdrawing any meaning, by killing off the author

07:05.760 --> 07:07.240
and saying all we have is the text,

07:07.240 --> 07:11.400
it makes the critic like a creative artist.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.400
Now, the best book to start out with,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.120
and if you're going to read Bart, and I personally

07:15.120 --> 07:17.720
have really enjoyed reading Bart because he's such a wit.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.320
He has a very morbid, sarcastic wit,

07:20.320 --> 07:22.960
and he's somewhat like Oscar Wilde in the sense

07:22.960 --> 07:26.240
that it's a kind of exercise in sarcasm

07:26.240 --> 07:30.040
which is very, very arch and carefully drawn.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.760
The strong point of French culture, or high culture,

07:32.760 --> 07:34.480
has always been its powerful connection

07:34.480 --> 07:36.520
between philosophy and poetry.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.520
Well, their philosophical thinkers, for the most part,

07:39.520 --> 07:42.880
are closely allied to poetic expression, poetic considerations,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.240
aesthetic considerations.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.360
And Bart, I think, is one of the extreme examples

07:46.360 --> 07:47.680
of that tendency.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.840
In a book called Mythologies, which he wrote in 57,

07:50.840 --> 07:53.400
what we have here is a combination,

07:53.400 --> 07:57.320
a rather ironic combination, of Marxist culture critique,

07:57.320 --> 07:59.600
something like that which we found in, say, the Frankfurt

07:59.600 --> 08:03.800
School, unmasking the media of mass communications,

08:03.800 --> 08:05.960
things like advertising, showing that they

08:05.960 --> 08:08.680
are a way of exercising social control performed

08:08.680 --> 08:12.080
in the interest of a certain small elite within society.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.800
Well, Bart is doing something like that in his mythologies.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.200
It's a collection of short essays in which he examines

08:17.200 --> 08:20.680
various artifacts from French culture in the 1950s

08:20.680 --> 08:22.720
and demythologizes them.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.600
He says, this is what it appears to mean,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.280
this is what it appears to signify,

08:26.280 --> 08:29.000
and yet there is another hidden second level of meaning

08:29.000 --> 08:30.240
that goes beyond that.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.840
And that's what he's searching for.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.280
He calls this second level of meaning myth.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.640
Now, at the end of it, at least in the English-American

08:39.640 --> 08:42.760
edition, is an essay that Bart wrote 14 years

08:42.760 --> 08:45.560
after he wrote his book Mythologies,

08:45.560 --> 08:47.560
and that's called Myth Today.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.640
And that's where he begins this project

08:49.640 --> 08:53.760
of ironic reconsideration of the demythologizing project,

08:53.760 --> 08:56.240
where he says, you know what, it may have been that I was

08:56.240 --> 08:59.160
unable to pull off what I was trying to pull off,

08:59.160 --> 09:01.840
because it may be masks all the way down.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.720
If there is no substantial reality behind appearance,

09:04.720 --> 09:07.000
then the possibility of demythologizing the world

09:07.000 --> 09:08.280
completely disappears.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.320
It's just one myth after another.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.600
Let me give some examples of his activity,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.960
and this may make it a little bit more sensible.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.640
What he does is semiotics.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.920
And semiotics can be defined as the science of science

09:20.920 --> 09:23.600
or the theory of science, the general science of science

09:23.600 --> 09:25.160
is what Desa-sur calls it.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.920
It's a subset of structural linguistics,

09:27.920 --> 09:30.920
which was founded and organized by Desa-sur

09:30.920 --> 09:33.480
around the turn of the century.

09:33.480 --> 09:38.760
And semiotics views the human domain

09:38.760 --> 09:42.000
as the domain of symbols, as the domain of signs.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.640
And what it does is try and read these symbols,

09:44.640 --> 09:48.200
read these signs, and look for their internal coherence.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.560
Semiotics is concerned primarily with the internal coherence

09:51.560 --> 09:53.560
of relations between signs.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.640
The relation between signs in the world is not memetic,

09:56.640 --> 09:58.680
in the sense that it doesn't represent the world.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.520
Rather, the relationship between signs is semiotic.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.840
In other words, internal coherence of the system of symbols

10:05.840 --> 10:07.960
is what we're talking about, not the correspondence

10:07.960 --> 10:10.520
between the content of the symbols and the world.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.040
It corresponds to a shift in the conception of truth.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.480
Semiotics holds to the idea of a coherence conception

10:17.480 --> 10:18.080
of truth.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.880
If the symbol set is coherent, it's very much similar

10:20.880 --> 10:22.200
to what Rory believes.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.920
If the symbol set is coherent, well,

10:23.920 --> 10:25.720
then there's nothing to judge it by.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.560
We can judge it by whether it reflects the world,

10:28.560 --> 10:31.200
because it is assumed at the outset

10:31.240 --> 10:33.840
that systems of symbols do not mimic the world,

10:33.840 --> 10:35.320
that Mises is impossible.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.240
Rather, their truth is to be found

10:37.240 --> 10:39.360
in the internal coherence of the systems.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.040
Think about something like non-Euclidean geometry.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.560
We look around for an application of it,

10:43.560 --> 10:44.360
and there aren't very many.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.680
Perhaps there are none.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.640
Well, that may mean that non-Euclidean geometry fails

10:49.640 --> 10:52.400
if our standard is correspondence to the world.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.600
But if our understanding of truth is coherence,

10:55.600 --> 10:57.200
well, then it's perfectly satisfactory.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.000
It's just as true as something like Euclidean geometry.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.120
Well, Bard is adopting a set of assumptions roughly like that.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.240
Now, let me give some examples of this,

11:06.240 --> 11:07.680
make it a little more sensible.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.480
Examples of semiotic systems are something

11:09.480 --> 11:13.320
like psychoanalysis or Marxism, linguistic systems,

11:13.320 --> 11:18.680
that are separate and incommensurable.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.600
And in addition, things like clothing, the kind of clothes

11:21.600 --> 11:25.120
you wear, that's a semiotic system.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.400
Mass culture, things like advertising or MTV,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.480
an extremely powerful semiotic system.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.400
Let me give you some examples of how something like this

11:33.400 --> 11:34.600
would work.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.120
And you'll realize that you have been doing

11:36.120 --> 11:38.360
semiotic analysis all your life.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.480
A sailor gets off a ship, comes into port,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.880
two women come up and say, hi sailor.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.000
One of them is wearing a long black dress

11:46.000 --> 11:48.640
and has a crucifix around her neck, and she's a nun.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.640
And she says to the sailor, hello sailor, hi.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.120
And what she's doing is saying hello to the sailor.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.560
Another woman comes out, she's dressed in red satin hot pants

11:56.560 --> 11:58.600
and a see-through blouse says, hi sailor.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.760
Now clearly, that person is a prostitute, not a nun.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.280
And clearly, hi sailor means something very different

12:04.280 --> 12:06.080
in that semiotic system.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.480
The point being that the way she is dressed

12:08.480 --> 12:10.920
is a text that the sailor is reading, which

12:10.920 --> 12:14.000
is what he knows how not to proposition the nun.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.920
Doesn't that make sense?

12:14.920 --> 12:16.600
And we're doing it all the time.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.040
Bart wrote a wonderful book called The System of Fashion,

12:19.040 --> 12:21.440
in which he analyzes ladies' fashion.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.360
And he treats it as a semiotic system.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.240
And he's right, it is a system of science.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.800
It's a remarkable idea.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.680
So one of the utilities of this is

12:28.680 --> 12:32.560
that it can be applied to the entire human domain.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.400
All kinds of communicative activity, or every kind of sign,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.720
can be broken down and analyzed.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.320
We can find its first order meeting,

12:41.320 --> 12:44.080
and then perhaps we can also find a second order meaning.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.000
And that second order meaning, the myth that underlies it,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.680
that hidden meaning, that's Bart's project.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.400
It's a very interesting set of thoughts.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.000
All right, now let me give you some examples of this

12:53.000 --> 12:54.640
and make it a little more sensible.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.280
Bart has a wonderful sense of humor,

12:56.280 --> 13:00.560
and he seems to be attracted to kind of the bizarre and odd

13:00.560 --> 13:01.320
in the world.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.600
He finds things that approach the world

13:04.600 --> 13:06.160
obliquely and ironically.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.360
And it's strange that a highly cultivated, extremely

13:10.360 --> 13:13.240
sensitive French intellectual should write

13:13.240 --> 13:18.120
an essay on professional wrestling, on detergent,

13:18.120 --> 13:20.800
on striptease, on the brain of Einstein.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.120
Remember that Einstein's brain was taken out and put in a jar

13:23.160 --> 13:23.960
and saved?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.200
There's an essay on that as a cultural icon.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.560
In other words, he asks, what does that mean?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.720
Plastic, he reads it.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
What does plastic mean?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.120
What's the myth hidden in it?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.560
You wouldn't have thought perhaps there was any myth

13:34.560 --> 13:35.400
hidden in it.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.080
In fact, this is Bart's project to go from surface structure

13:38.080 --> 13:39.480
to deep structure.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.400
After he reconsiders it, 10, 15 years later perhaps,

13:42.400 --> 13:45.280
he realizes there's only surface structure,

13:45.280 --> 13:47.440
and just move from one surface to another.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.080
Let me give you some examples of what he tells us

13:49.080 --> 13:50.480
about wrestling that's worthwhile,

13:50.480 --> 13:52.080
and why I think this guy is really deep.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.160
If not always deep and not always accurate,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
always entertaining and very sharp.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.160
He says, wrestling is something that's laughed at

13:59.160 --> 14:01.560
by intellectuals, all us professional smart guys,

14:01.560 --> 14:04.320
the PhDs, we look down upon professional wrestling

14:04.320 --> 14:06.080
and the people that go, and it really doesn't amount

14:06.080 --> 14:08.200
to very much, because it's kind of, well, childish,

14:08.200 --> 14:10.520
it's silly, it's pseudo sport.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.920
In fact, Bart has another reading,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.240
and it's a much deeper reading, he says.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.960
The reason why working class people go to wrestling

14:16.960 --> 14:18.720
is because it's a spectacle, not a sport,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.160
they're not stupid, they know full well

14:20.200 --> 14:22.600
this is entirely rigged, entirely fixed.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.320
So the question arises for Bart,

14:24.320 --> 14:26.000
which wouldn't perhaps arise in the mind

14:26.000 --> 14:27.280
of most intellectuals, what the hell

14:27.280 --> 14:29.080
do they get out of this, what's the point of it?

14:29.080 --> 14:31.040
Why go to see this spectacle?

14:31.040 --> 14:33.520
Well, Bart has a real interesting way of looking at it.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.560
He says, this idea of a community spectacle,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.360
where we already know the outcome,

14:38.360 --> 14:41.480
and what we're cheering really is symbols,

14:41.480 --> 14:45.120
or the personified symbols of various kinds of

14:45.120 --> 14:47.920
cultural trends, for example Hulk Hogan,

14:47.960 --> 14:49.520
or someone like that comes out dressed

14:49.520 --> 14:51.920
as an American hero wearing the flag,

14:51.920 --> 14:53.360
we're all rooting for America,

14:53.360 --> 14:54.720
and he's the personification of that,

14:54.720 --> 14:57.600
which is why we know in advance that he's gotta win.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.400
Well, here's what Bart says about wrestling,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.760
he says, not only is this not what it appears to be,

15:03.760 --> 15:05.420
but in fact, if you look back,

15:05.420 --> 15:07.560
you will find in the spectacle of wrestling

15:07.560 --> 15:09.200
the origin of attic drama.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.120
When tragedy started out, it was not high art,

15:14.120 --> 15:16.400
it was popular art, and everybody knew exactly

15:16.400 --> 15:18.200
what was going on, and the end was foretold,

15:18.200 --> 15:19.040
everybody knew it.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.360
And what was going on in Oedipus?

15:20.360 --> 15:23.040
The same thing is going on with Hulk Hogan in a way.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.360
Oedipus is a symbol, not a person,

15:25.360 --> 15:26.800
and we all know the outcome of the story,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.120
we all know how this has to end,

15:28.120 --> 15:29.800
we're just cheering on because it creates

15:29.800 --> 15:32.200
a sense of social solidarity among us,

15:32.200 --> 15:34.600
you know, he represents us.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.680
So like, it's a real put down or come down,

15:38.680 --> 15:40.800
because it's characteristic of contemporary intellectuals

15:40.800 --> 15:42.160
to think of something like tragedy

15:42.160 --> 15:43.720
as the highest of high art.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.200
What is a greater achievement of attic culture

15:46.200 --> 15:47.760
than Oedipus?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.280
Well, Bart thinks that Oedipus at least started out

15:50.280 --> 15:51.240
and that we've transformed it,

15:51.240 --> 15:52.080
but at least the way it started out

15:52.080 --> 15:53.400
was something like Hulk Hogan.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.520
It was all the people, the average man in the street

15:55.520 --> 15:57.640
or man in the Agora would go in there and cheer away,

15:57.640 --> 16:00.240
no one for well that Oedipus has to get it in the end.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.400
And the point is that it's a spectacle, not a sport,

16:03.400 --> 16:06.240
it is a tale which is foregone,

16:06.240 --> 16:08.180
and it is a system of signs.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.160
She's a very interesting thought,

16:10.160 --> 16:11.760
you didn't think you could read professional wrestling,

16:11.760 --> 16:15.280
in fact, it's a text, very interesting thought.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.040
All right, let me take it a little further.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.600
Detergent, this is a very interesting thing.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.920
And it's very funny because somehow I can't imagine

16:22.920 --> 16:25.000
Bart covering something like,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.960
he was doing something rather journalistic,

16:26.960 --> 16:30.240
the World Congress of Detergents in 1954.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.800
So apparently all the detergent manufacturers

16:31.800 --> 16:33.680
got together in France, in Paris,

16:33.680 --> 16:35.040
which it seems like an unlikely place

16:35.040 --> 16:37.240
to hold a detergent convention.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.000
And they had all kinds of advertisements

16:40.000 --> 16:41.920
for the various kinds of detergents.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.560
And what he did was he actually looked at the advertisements

16:44.560 --> 16:46.040
as a text and read them.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.960
And he said, what is this telling us?

16:47.960 --> 16:50.360
Well, for example, when we find out that Luxe

16:50.360 --> 16:52.680
deep cleans linen, what does that tell us?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.800
Well, first of all, it tells you that linen is deep.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.120
Who would have thought that?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.880
What does it mean for linen to be deep?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.600
Mm, very odd stuff.

16:59.600 --> 17:04.320
And he elaborates the carefully constructed distinctions

17:04.320 --> 17:06.200
that are being created

17:06.200 --> 17:09.200
between roughly equivalent identical products.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.800
One is green, the other is blue.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.280
Chemically, they may be completely identical.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.680
We've changed the food coloring,

17:13.680 --> 17:15.760
completely different advertising campaign

17:15.760 --> 17:16.600
connected to them.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.040
One is appealing to the man of the house,

17:19.040 --> 17:20.680
because it shows a guy lumberjacking

17:20.680 --> 17:22.440
and then washing his hands with the blue stuff.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.920
Blue is masculine.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.800
If you've got pink stuff and a woman is doing dishes,

17:26.800 --> 17:27.880
pink is feminine.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.800
Chemically, it may be completely identical.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.720
But what we are doing here is constructing

17:31.720 --> 17:33.160
a contemporary myth.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.520
And what Bard is saying is that myth has become a commodity

17:36.520 --> 17:38.760
and commodities have become myths.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.840
In a way, it's a change in the old Marxist formula,

17:42.840 --> 17:46.080
CMC, from capital, volume one.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.480
Commodity, money, commodity.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.160
What Bard is saying that we have is consumer goods

17:52.160 --> 17:55.200
and then mythology and then more consumer goods.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.800
And the consumer goods serve the purpose

17:57.800 --> 18:01.000
in this culture that used to be served

18:01.000 --> 18:04.040
by the transcendence of religious objects.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.320
In other words, we fetishize consumer goods,

18:06.320 --> 18:08.040
which is why we bow down and worship

18:08.080 --> 18:09.560
this year's new Cadillac.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.000
And there's a drumroll before we bring it out.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.160
Why? Because it is a new kind of icon

18:14.160 --> 18:18.360
of contemporary life, of ease, of luxury.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.760
I mean, imagine a Cadillac commercial.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.800
What you see is Cadillac style, right?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.680
What this means is Cadillac style.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.200
What is the myth implicit there?

18:27.200 --> 18:30.560
Rich people, happy people, people who have good lives

18:30.560 --> 18:32.000
have Cadillacs.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.440
To have a Cadillac is to have a good life.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.120
Cadillac means good life, right?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.840
There are myths being constructed

18:38.840 --> 18:41.400
and our new mythologizers are not Homer,

18:41.400 --> 18:43.520
are not Shakespeare, they are Admin.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.640
It's a real deep and caustic argument.

18:48.640 --> 18:52.600
Now, he investigates striptease and he finds out,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.440
or he comes, he draws the inference

18:54.440 --> 18:58.480
that the process of striptease desexualizes women.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.720
Why? Because it never goes the entire way.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.960
It never turns into sex.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.000
It's an elaborate ritual in which we get

19:05.040 --> 19:08.040
a sort of catharsis for men's sex drives,

19:08.040 --> 19:09.520
who are the vast majority of the people

19:09.520 --> 19:10.920
who make up the audience.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.920
And it is a sort of ritual, it is entirely stereotyped.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.800
You could almost construct a formula for it.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.720
And what he says is this is just the construction

19:18.720 --> 19:22.200
of the myth of woman and in particular,

19:22.200 --> 19:25.200
the idea that sexuality is incomplete

19:25.200 --> 19:26.720
in this sort of ritual.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.240
He moves to the brain of Einstein,

19:28.240 --> 19:29.720
which is a wonderful little essay.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.560
And what he says is what the myth underlying that is,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.040
that knowledge is a formula.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.600
We have knowledge in a box here.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.800
Einstein's brain, somehow inside that,

19:36.800 --> 19:38.640
knowledge is enclosed within space.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.880
See, we have Einstein's brain.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.520
Someday we're gonna know exactly what makes this knowledge

19:42.520 --> 19:43.920
and exactly what makes us such a great brain,

19:43.920 --> 19:46.120
but for now, we're just keeping it in a box.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.360
Knowledge is in a box.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.200
It's the opposite of a postmodern icon,

19:50.200 --> 19:53.240
Einstein's brain, destroy the brain and break the box.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.360
That's postmodernism.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.440
All right.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.040
And finally, plastic.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.840
Who would have thought you could read plastic?

19:59.840 --> 20:01.380
What a perverse idea.

20:01.380 --> 20:04.580
Well, Bart reads plastic and what he finds underneath

20:04.620 --> 20:09.420
the plastic image is the myth of infinite transformation.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.220
You can turn plastic into anything.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.060
You can change its color.

20:12.060 --> 20:13.140
You can change its shape.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.740
You can make it do all kinds of stuff.

20:14.740 --> 20:17.420
Plastic is the ultimate postmodern substance.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.740
Plastic is infinite freedom, infinite transformation.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.340
Plastic in both its adjectival and noun senses.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.180
Okay.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.300
Now let's think about myth,

20:27.300 --> 20:29.580
and particularly that essay on myth today.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.100
What happens in myth and the reason why myth is misleading

20:34.140 --> 20:39.140
is because myth dissolves the realm of history

20:39.820 --> 20:41.420
by making it appear as nature.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.940
It makes the world appear natural and given.

20:43.940 --> 20:47.700
It disguises the message that is being proposed.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.780
And the most important of Bart's examples of this,

20:50.780 --> 20:53.940
which has been discussed, ad infinitum, ad nauseam,

20:53.940 --> 20:54.900
and the criticism of Bart,

20:54.900 --> 20:57.100
is the picture of the Negro soldier.

20:57.100 --> 20:57.940
Here's the idea.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.980
He's looking at some French magazine,

20:59.980 --> 21:02.060
and what he sees in the mid 50s is the picture

21:02.060 --> 21:04.900
of a Negro soldier saluting the French tricolor.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.540
And apparently he's dressed in a military uniform.

21:07.540 --> 21:11.700
And the idea is that on the first level,

21:11.700 --> 21:14.020
on the first level of a relation between the sign

21:14.020 --> 21:16.580
and the thing signified, let's examine that photograph.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.780
Level one, we have a sign, which is this piece of paper,

21:19.780 --> 21:23.000
which has a film of light and dark spots on it.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.500
That's what a photograph is, in a literal strict sense.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.620
Okay.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.340
What that sign signifies is a picture,

21:29.340 --> 21:31.620
is the saluting Negro soldier.

21:31.660 --> 21:32.740
That's level one.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.300
That's the obvious surface level

21:35.300 --> 21:36.700
of what that photograph means.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.980
But Bart says, you know what that photograph really means?

21:38.980 --> 21:41.900
At level two, in which we transform,

21:41.900 --> 21:42.820
think of it this way.

21:42.820 --> 21:46.640
Think of the photograph relating to the idea

21:46.640 --> 21:48.300
or the image of the Negro soldier

21:48.300 --> 21:50.740
as a sign relating to a thing signified.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.700
So far so good, because semiotics investigate signs

21:54.700 --> 21:56.980
and the relationships to what they signify.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.940
Now, let's take that image of the Negro soldier

21:59.940 --> 22:01.340
and put it back in the first place

22:01.380 --> 22:04.740
and turn that into a sign itself,

22:04.740 --> 22:07.400
and then have that signify some second order thing.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.940
So we're bootstrapping ourselves up

22:08.940 --> 22:10.220
into a new level of meaning.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.860
And what Bart says is obvious about this photo

22:12.860 --> 22:16.060
is that it's an apology for French colonialism.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.220
He's saying, despite the fact

22:17.220 --> 22:19.500
that the French colonial empire is breaking down,

22:19.500 --> 22:21.140
despite the fact that we have considerable move

22:21.140 --> 22:23.860
against colonialism and that there's a considerable racist

22:23.860 --> 22:27.060
element and imperialist element in French political life,

22:27.060 --> 22:28.460
in fact, there's no problem at all.

22:28.460 --> 22:29.420
What us worry?

22:29.420 --> 22:34.260
Look, look at the happy, content, loyal, docile Negro soldier.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.820
That's why he's saluting the tricolor there,

22:35.820 --> 22:38.620
and that's what that message is really all about.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.020
And he says, that's really exact,

22:40.020 --> 22:41.820
in other words, he thinks all the artifacts

22:41.820 --> 22:42.940
of modern culture are like that,

22:42.940 --> 22:44.100
and we are all under influence

22:44.100 --> 22:46.140
by a sort of disguised coercion.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.180
It's a deep argument.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.420
Let me make a different analogy

22:48.420 --> 22:49.380
and make it a little more sensible

22:49.380 --> 22:51.020
and bring it home in contemporary America.

22:51.020 --> 22:51.860
Rambo.

22:52.900 --> 22:53.740
What is Rambo?

22:53.740 --> 22:56.740
Well, on one level, it's a series of dots on a movie screen.

22:56.940 --> 23:01.020
And what it shows is Sylvester Stallone killing 500 people,

23:01.020 --> 23:03.100
being the toughest guy around and being invincible.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.580
He's something like the modern Achilles.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.820
Now, that's the first level.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.660
That's the obvious surface meaning.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.700
What's the second level, the mythological meaning?

23:11.700 --> 23:13.420
The mythological meaning is that America

23:13.420 --> 23:14.540
didn't lose the Vietnam War.

23:14.540 --> 23:15.540
We won the Vietnam War.

23:15.540 --> 23:16.700
It was a strategic retreat,

23:16.700 --> 23:18.660
and we're still strategically retreating from it

23:18.660 --> 23:20.140
by constructing works of art,

23:20.140 --> 23:21.900
which say it wasn't really a problem.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.580
One American could kill 500 of anybody.

23:23.580 --> 23:24.660
We're the toughest people in the world.

23:24.660 --> 23:25.500
We never die.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.340
We never bleed.

23:26.340 --> 23:27.180
We never worry.

23:27.180 --> 23:28.500
We always get the job done.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.660
In other words, the myth of American invincibility

23:30.660 --> 23:32.460
is built into the Rambo movies.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.260
I mean, it's impossible to miss.

23:34.260 --> 23:38.140
It obviously has ideological mythic content to it.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.380
Now, there may turn out to be,

23:39.380 --> 23:41.660
as I'm pretty sure there will turn out to be,

23:41.660 --> 23:44.300
a plurality, perhaps an infinite plurality,

23:44.300 --> 23:46.100
of possible mythic readings.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.500
Remember, once the text becomes completely open,

23:48.500 --> 23:50.700
that means you can do whatever you want with it,

23:50.700 --> 23:53.500
and you can treat it and read it as being whatever you like

23:53.500 --> 23:56.260
because there is no authority behind it.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.340
So Bart, in some ways, gives with one hand

23:58.340 --> 24:00.420
and takes away with the other, right?

24:00.420 --> 24:02.180
Offers us one reading, but then points out

24:02.180 --> 24:03.340
that this reading is not closed,

24:03.340 --> 24:06.380
that there are an infinite number of other possible readings.

24:06.380 --> 24:07.860
We might be tempted to say that

24:07.860 --> 24:10.100
semiotics is what I would call an open system,

24:10.100 --> 24:11.460
rather than a closed system.

24:11.460 --> 24:12.340
In that respect, it's like

24:12.340 --> 24:15.340
vikingshtini and language games, right?

24:15.340 --> 24:17.260
And that means that there are an infinite number

24:17.260 --> 24:19.340
of overlapping games that don't necessarily

24:19.340 --> 24:20.660
conflict with each other.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.420
Consider the proposition, for example,

24:22.420 --> 24:25.660
that we do a Marxist analysis

24:25.660 --> 24:27.300
of the American Civil War, and we find out

24:27.300 --> 24:29.020
that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves

24:29.020 --> 24:30.740
because of his feelings about authority

24:30.740 --> 24:31.860
towards his father or something,

24:31.860 --> 24:33.540
or we do a Freudian analysis.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.260
We also might want to do a Marxist analysis,

24:35.260 --> 24:36.820
saying that the reason Lincoln freed the slaves

24:36.820 --> 24:39.500
is because he was the agent of advanced capitalism.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.500
The point that is made by Bart is that

24:42.500 --> 24:44.260
semiotics tells us that these systems

24:44.260 --> 24:47.980
are not mutually exclusive, that what you're doing

24:47.980 --> 24:49.620
is just describing the same thing

24:49.620 --> 24:52.540
under the aegis of two different semiotic systems.

24:52.540 --> 24:54.540
In other words, psychoanalysis does not refute

24:54.540 --> 24:56.300
the Marxist interpretation of history.

24:56.300 --> 24:59.220
The Marxist interpretation does not refute psychoanalysis.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.860
They are two incommensurate

25:00.860 --> 25:03.580
and mutually exclusive semiotic systems.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.940
And there is an infinite possible proliferation

25:05.940 --> 25:08.300
of semiotic systems, so we get an infinitude

25:08.300 --> 25:11.460
of criticism and an infinitude of interpretation, right?

25:11.460 --> 25:14.940
In some ways, you might say that Bart's project

25:14.940 --> 25:17.180
is the inverse of that of Godomer.

25:17.180 --> 25:20.180
Godomer says we should strive for clarity of interpretation,

25:20.180 --> 25:23.460
strive to appropriate and renew our connection

25:23.460 --> 25:27.380
to a cultural tradition, because it's a necessity for us,

25:27.380 --> 25:29.060
but also what we should strive for

25:29.060 --> 25:31.100
is the clarity of our interpretation,

25:31.100 --> 25:32.900
transparency of interpretation.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.380
Bart goes exactly the opposite way.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.740
He says there is no clarity of interpretation.

25:36.740 --> 25:39.340
That's one of the most dangerous myths of all.

25:39.340 --> 25:42.340
In fact, once you think that you have clarified

25:42.340 --> 25:44.700
to the one final and only interpretation,

25:44.700 --> 25:47.380
that is the most ideological kind of self-delusion,

25:47.380 --> 25:48.700
self-deception.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.620
So what he's done then with the semiotic breakthrough

25:51.620 --> 25:53.940
is undermine the presuppositions of Marxist

25:53.940 --> 25:56.020
and structuralist culture critique.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.380
Remember that structuralism thinks

25:57.380 --> 25:59.060
that it's discerning the ultimate algebra

25:59.060 --> 26:01.060
inside whatever it investigates.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.180
And Marxism believes that it is truly

26:03.180 --> 26:06.100
unmasking bourgeois ideology to get to the reality

26:06.100 --> 26:08.740
of class conflict and exploitation.

26:08.740 --> 26:12.100
Bart's point is that none of these activities are real,

26:12.100 --> 26:14.060
they're just substituting one myth for another.

26:14.060 --> 26:15.300
You can't get beyond it.

26:15.780 --> 26:20.780
All right, now, let's look at the way he handles myth

26:23.900 --> 26:25.380
and what he does with semiotics

26:25.380 --> 26:27.980
in this final essay, Myth Today.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.980
He calls myth the theft of language

26:29.980 --> 26:32.260
because it depoliticizes language.

26:32.260 --> 26:35.460
You don't see, or at least initially on first observation,

26:35.460 --> 26:38.100
one does not notice that Rambo is an apology

26:38.100 --> 26:39.700
for American interventionism.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.060
It's an apology for American foreign policy,

26:42.060 --> 26:44.460
which has been for the most part a failure,

26:44.460 --> 26:46.420
at least with regard to Vietnam.

26:46.420 --> 26:49.820
Well, his point is that what we want to move to

26:49.820 --> 26:52.220
is politicized speech, where it is obvious

26:52.220 --> 26:55.100
that there is some agenda behind that sort of a construction.

26:55.100 --> 26:58.060
And once we repoliticize it, earlier in this career,

26:58.060 --> 27:00.460
he thought that we could get to the real substantial truth.

27:00.460 --> 27:04.260
Later on, what it turns out is that this mythic

27:04.260 --> 27:06.500
demythologizing is, in fact,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.140
the construction of a left-wing myth.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.460
In fact, the demythologizer turns out

27:12.460 --> 27:14.420
to be the remythologizer.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.940
And that means that the critic is, in fact, the poet.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.300
He's a creative artist.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.260
And the critic relates to the work of art,

27:20.260 --> 27:22.380
the way the artist relates to nature,

27:22.380 --> 27:24.700
in the sense that, think about Plato's example

27:24.700 --> 27:28.020
from the Fidris, Plato's example from the public,

27:28.020 --> 27:29.820
where he says, an artist looks at a bed

27:29.820 --> 27:31.860
and draws a picture of it.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.180
And then a poet will look at that

27:34.180 --> 27:35.500
and take it a little bit further.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.780
We have three levels of reality.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.260
We have the ultimate bed in the sky,

27:38.260 --> 27:39.980
form of the bed, we have the bed down here,

27:39.980 --> 27:42.260
and then we have the artistic reconstruction of it.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.060
Well, Bart wants to add a new level to that.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.420
We have the critical reconstruction of the artist's text.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.540
It can be a painting, it can be a literary work,

27:48.540 --> 27:50.820
it could be anything, but he is just as free

27:50.820 --> 27:51.980
in how he interprets it.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.860
So now we have a new domain for the artist to work in.

27:54.860 --> 27:56.340
Previously, artists had been describing

27:56.340 --> 27:58.700
the physical world, the social world.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.620
Well, now it is possible for a new sort of critical art

28:01.620 --> 28:03.980
to choose as its domain the world

28:03.980 --> 28:05.900
of artistic creation itself.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.620
It's a sort of, the criticism then becomes a meta art.

28:09.620 --> 28:14.060
And then we get the completely free play of the text.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.540
Now, here's the idea behind this.

28:16.540 --> 28:18.860
What he is looking to do is undermine

28:18.860 --> 28:21.060
the authority of the author.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.900
He describes this as the death of the author.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.220
The author has been abolished.

28:24.220 --> 28:26.540
And the reason why he wants to abolish the author

28:26.540 --> 28:29.380
and abolish authority is because that's what gives

28:29.380 --> 28:31.500
the critic completely free play

28:31.500 --> 28:33.460
within the domain of the text.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.260
If, for example, a critic offers a reading

28:35.260 --> 28:40.020
of a poem or a play and the author happens to be around

28:40.020 --> 28:42.540
and he says to the critic, well, that's not what I meant.

28:42.540 --> 28:44.020
Bart and that sort of critic,

28:44.020 --> 28:45.740
this sort of post-structuralist critic,

28:45.740 --> 28:48.380
this semiotic critic will say, so what?

28:48.380 --> 28:49.780
The text is completely free.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.340
What you think it means has nothing to do

28:51.340 --> 28:53.540
with what it means as far as I'm concerned.

28:53.540 --> 28:55.620
And there's no way you can legislate this for me.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.300
The mere historical contingent fact

28:58.300 --> 29:01.060
that you didn't mean that is just not my problem.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.900
I got the text and that's all that matters.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.780
So we eliminate intentionality and authority from the text.

29:05.780 --> 29:07.980
We impose whatever we want on it.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.860
You might want to say that what he's done is liberate

29:10.860 --> 29:12.580
the connection between the signifier

29:12.580 --> 29:14.260
and the thing signified.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.620
He says you could have it signify whatever you want.

29:17.620 --> 29:19.780
You take a text, you take a sign,

29:19.780 --> 29:21.980
and whatever signification you want to attach to it,

29:21.980 --> 29:23.580
that's perfectly satisfactory.

29:23.580 --> 29:26.260
Do not be constrained by any externalities.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.460
Retreat back into your own aesthetic judgment,

29:28.460 --> 29:29.740
to your own aesthetic experience,

29:29.740 --> 29:31.740
and the world is completely yours.

29:31.740 --> 29:35.140
It's completely the domain of pleasure and your own freedom.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.740
Now, what Bart says is something like this,

29:38.740 --> 29:40.580
or the conclusion he ultimately comes to,

29:40.580 --> 29:43.260
is that every limitation on human freedom

29:43.260 --> 29:44.500
is ultimately a myth.

29:45.980 --> 29:48.660
And in fact, clarity, which apparently

29:48.660 --> 29:52.060
makes memesis possible, is one of the most dangerous myths,

29:52.060 --> 29:56.060
because in fact, signs, discourse, communication

29:56.060 --> 29:58.740
is neither clear nor obscure.

29:58.740 --> 30:00.780
Do not create a myth of obscurity either.

30:00.780 --> 30:02.580
That's not going to work, right?

30:02.580 --> 30:04.220
So he doesn't want to go either way.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.940
He says you can't generalize about it.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.860
He doesn't have any satisfactory resolution.

30:07.860 --> 30:10.060
He's caught between a rock and a hard place.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.380
Towards the end of his essay on myth today,

30:13.380 --> 30:16.540
he goes to great length to try and convince us

30:16.540 --> 30:19.260
that right wing politics is more essentially

30:19.260 --> 30:22.580
and closely caught up with myths than left wing politics.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.220
But of course, it's so evidently done in bad faith.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.180
He's so evidently trying to soft pedal

30:27.180 --> 30:29.460
the mythic element of left wing politics

30:29.460 --> 30:31.060
that when you step back and look at it,

30:31.060 --> 30:33.660
what's clearly going on here is the ironic,

30:33.660 --> 30:36.620
critical construction of a new meta myth,

30:36.620 --> 30:39.020
which supports the projects he happens to like.

30:39.020 --> 30:42.780
He has decided to read the domain of mythology

30:42.780 --> 30:45.500
as if it particularly pertained to people

30:45.500 --> 30:48.460
and tendencies that he disapproves of.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.780
Of course, when you go back and read between the lines,

30:50.780 --> 30:53.780
what he is is trashing the entire proposition

30:53.780 --> 30:56.020
that we can demythologize the world.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.740
There is no substantial reality.

30:57.740 --> 30:59.860
He's retreated back into subjectivity.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.420
Can you see why I call this a sort of Cartesian aesthetics?

31:02.420 --> 31:03.660
It's me, me, me.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.100
But instead of trying to find out,

31:05.100 --> 31:07.020
say, the mathematical structure of the world,

31:07.020 --> 31:09.500
he's trying to find out how can I maximize

31:09.500 --> 31:12.420
my feelings of pleasure with regard to the text?

31:12.420 --> 31:14.100
He says this in so many words,

31:14.100 --> 31:16.540
or he comes pretty close to saying it in so many words,

31:16.540 --> 31:19.620
the second to last page of mythology's myth today.

31:19.620 --> 31:22.940
He says, even here in these mythologies,

31:22.940 --> 31:25.380
I have used trickery, finding it painful,

31:25.380 --> 31:28.260
constantly to work on the evaporation of reality.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.220
I have started to make it excessively dense

31:30.220 --> 31:32.860
and to discover in it a surprising compactness

31:32.860 --> 31:35.020
which I savored with delight.

31:35.020 --> 31:38.180
So the justification for this critical activity

31:38.180 --> 31:40.220
is not the fact that it truly represents the world

31:40.220 --> 31:42.220
because you can't truly represent the world.

31:42.220 --> 31:43.660
The justification for it is that

31:43.660 --> 31:45.860
he really savors it with delight.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.340
In other words, this is the triumph

31:47.340 --> 31:49.980
of the pleasure principle over the reality principle.

31:51.180 --> 31:54.100
We can choose two ways to go in this domain

31:54.100 --> 31:58.620
of post-modern, post-structuralist weightlessness.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.660
We can move towards the will to power,

32:00.660 --> 32:02.700
or we can move towards the will to pleasure.

32:02.700 --> 32:04.820
Foucault chooses the first road.

32:04.820 --> 32:06.300
He moves towards the will to power

32:06.300 --> 32:08.100
and towards political activity.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.220
Bart moves away from political power towards pleasure

32:11.220 --> 32:12.740
and in moving towards pleasure,

32:12.740 --> 32:16.060
he withdraws into a sort of aesthetic quietism

32:16.060 --> 32:18.420
in which you could have political activity

32:18.420 --> 32:21.060
as a sort of hobby, but you can't quite take it

32:21.060 --> 32:24.540
with the grim and determined seriousness that Bart does.

32:24.540 --> 32:26.620
He's involved too much in absorbing

32:26.620 --> 32:28.100
the pleasures of the text.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.380
He's become an intellectual aesthetic, all right?

32:31.380 --> 32:33.260
And pleasure is the only justification

32:33.260 --> 32:34.780
for any intellectual activity

32:34.780 --> 32:37.060
because it can't mimic the world.

32:37.060 --> 32:40.700
So all of human life is potentially

32:40.700 --> 32:44.380
the domain of freedom, creativity, which is to say art.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.460
And the transformation of life into art

32:46.460 --> 32:47.700
is one of the most powerful

32:47.700 --> 32:50.420
and worthwhile readings of Nietzsche.

32:50.420 --> 32:53.260
You can see how this is all homage to Nietzsche in a way.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.420
And the idea that there's no distinction

32:55.420 --> 32:57.020
between appearance and reality,

32:57.020 --> 33:00.020
that ultimately all we have is an infinite series of masks

33:00.020 --> 33:01.660
and an infinite series of illusions,

33:01.660 --> 33:04.060
what could be more Nietzschean and perspectival?

33:04.060 --> 33:05.420
What could be more ironic,

33:05.420 --> 33:08.620
and at the same time, gratify one's will to power?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.740
Particularly if the will to power has been transformed

33:10.740 --> 33:13.620
into me, me, me, simple internality,

33:13.620 --> 33:15.820
the will to power becomes the will to pleasure.

33:16.540 --> 33:21.540
It's worth comparing Bart's work

33:22.940 --> 33:24.780
to the work of some of the other structuralists

33:24.780 --> 33:29.260
or Marxists to see the uniqueness of his sort of position,

33:29.260 --> 33:30.900
and also to see how, in some respects,

33:30.900 --> 33:33.900
it all simultaneously expresses a general collective tendency

33:33.900 --> 33:37.180
in particularly French intellectual high culture.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.220
One of his contemporaries, Altausser,

33:39.220 --> 33:41.740
tried to unify Marxism and structuralism.

33:41.740 --> 33:43.140
And that, in some ways, is the last

33:43.140 --> 33:44.620
of the modernist paradigms.

33:44.660 --> 33:46.460
We get these giant deterministic systems,

33:46.460 --> 33:49.380
and then try and show that they both operate simultaneously

33:49.380 --> 33:52.180
and are both part of some larger meta-system.

33:52.180 --> 33:55.860
Well, Bart knew Altausser and his reaction to this

33:55.860 --> 33:57.180
was saying, look, this is the worst thing

33:57.180 --> 33:58.420
you can possibly do.

33:58.420 --> 34:00.580
The reason we are giving up structuralism,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.380
the reason we are giving up Marxism,

34:02.380 --> 34:04.740
is because these large deterministic systems,

34:04.740 --> 34:06.580
first of all, inhibit, and as a matter of fact,

34:06.580 --> 34:09.340
prohibit human freedom, right?

34:09.340 --> 34:10.620
Freedom turns out to be an illusion.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.780
You get these giant deterministic systems,

34:12.820 --> 34:15.820
and in addition to that, they all entail

34:15.820 --> 34:19.460
totalizing discourses, huge meta-narratives,

34:19.460 --> 34:22.940
big picture stories which no one believes in anymore.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.140
No one takes seriously, or at least Bart says,

34:25.140 --> 34:26.780
that the people who are on the cutting edge

34:26.780 --> 34:28.980
of high culture at the time that he is writing

34:28.980 --> 34:31.140
can no longer take seriously the idea

34:31.140 --> 34:34.500
that everything has a secret algebra hidden inside it,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.020
and it's the job of structuralists

34:36.020 --> 34:38.460
to find the secret algebra hidden in mathematics,

34:38.460 --> 34:41.500
hidden in crystals, hidden in biological life forms,

34:42.500 --> 34:43.700
hidden in literary constructs,

34:43.700 --> 34:45.860
and also hidden in anthropology.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.740
He says, no, there's no secret algebra

34:47.740 --> 34:48.660
hidden in everything.

34:48.660 --> 34:50.500
That's a myth that you people made up

34:50.500 --> 34:52.780
so that you could legitimize structuralist discourse.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.780
He says, the party's over for that.

34:54.780 --> 34:56.540
We got so good at being critical.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.940
We got so good at being negative and negating.

34:58.940 --> 35:01.400
We negated the sort of structures

35:01.400 --> 35:03.860
which made this criticism and negation possible.

35:03.860 --> 35:07.260
In some respects, I think it was one of the artists

35:07.260 --> 35:10.060
involved in the data movement who constructed a machine

35:10.060 --> 35:13.380
that the first time you plugged it in, it destroyed itself.

35:13.380 --> 35:16.380
Well, that is very much this conception of culture.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.740
You plug the machine in, it criticizes everything around it,

35:18.740 --> 35:20.140
and then when it gets kind of antsy,

35:20.140 --> 35:22.820
it starts to criticize itself in that process of destruction

35:22.820 --> 35:25.260
that Nietzschean philosophizing with a hammer

35:25.260 --> 35:27.660
becomes a sort of intellectual vandalism.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.300
And nothing is left except the ego,

35:30.300 --> 35:32.660
but there isn't even a complete self

35:32.660 --> 35:36.500
because when we break down the structures of communication,

35:36.500 --> 35:37.900
the structures of knowledge,

35:37.900 --> 35:40.540
and the structures of linguistic interaction

35:40.540 --> 35:44.340
which give us some real hold to the external world,

35:44.340 --> 35:47.180
it ultimately means that we're moving in the direction of solipsism.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.660
Remember why I call this Cartesian aesthetics?

35:49.660 --> 35:51.580
And that means that it's just me and my world

35:51.580 --> 35:54.300
and whatever I might happen to wish to do with it.

35:54.300 --> 35:57.980
The advantage of this is it allows us completely free play

35:57.980 --> 35:59.740
within the domain of our experience

35:59.740 --> 36:02.260
and within the domain of our mental activity.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.220
The disadvantage of it is that it is a hopeless attempt

36:05.220 --> 36:07.180
to avoid the external world.

36:07.180 --> 36:09.180
And the problem is that the external world is still there

36:09.180 --> 36:10.500
whether you like it or not,

36:10.500 --> 36:13.820
as Dr. Johnson said, I refuted thus, there it is.

36:13.820 --> 36:16.740
Bart thinks that this is another ideological construct

36:16.740 --> 36:19.580
and that the external world is socially constructed,

36:19.580 --> 36:20.780
linguistically constructed,

36:20.780 --> 36:24.500
and we could simply unconstruct it if it gets in our way.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.660
It's amazing the degree of egoism and wishful thinking

36:27.660 --> 36:29.420
that you need to engage in

36:29.420 --> 36:32.020
before you can argue a project like this.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.580
It takes one set of presuppositions and radicalizes them,

36:35.580 --> 36:37.780
take them as far as you can possibly go.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.660
The problem is that the snake ultimately ends up

36:39.660 --> 36:43.420
eating its own tail and the whole project disappears.

36:43.420 --> 36:47.780
This is what we get when we get towards the end of Bart's life,

36:47.780 --> 36:49.220
the last seven or eight years.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.180
His work becomes intensely personal

36:51.180 --> 36:54.500
and it's not clear at some times whether he's writing a novel

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
or whether he's writing a piece of literary criticism

36:56.500 --> 36:57.980
or whether he's writing a series of essays

36:57.980 --> 36:59.660
or whether he's writing one essay

36:59.660 --> 37:02.620
or whether he's writing a book formally like that of Nietzsche

37:02.620 --> 37:03.620
or say the Gay Science,

37:03.660 --> 37:05.260
where it's just a series of vignettes

37:05.260 --> 37:07.380
that don't really hold together.

37:07.380 --> 37:11.060
He completely gives up on the idea of structure or form.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.820
It all begins to break down

37:12.820 --> 37:14.860
and this breakdown of literary structure,

37:14.860 --> 37:18.820
this breakdown of communicative form,

37:18.820 --> 37:21.740
is analogous to the breakdown of external reality.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.740
And when we lose that direct mooring to the external world,

37:26.860 --> 37:29.060
what happens is is that the self begins

37:29.060 --> 37:32.700
to become contingent and dubious and fragmentary.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.740
May I suggest that as Wittgenstein pointed out,

37:34.740 --> 37:37.420
the self, like language, is socially constructed

37:37.420 --> 37:39.500
and that when we try and remove ourselves

37:39.500 --> 37:41.460
from the external world,

37:41.460 --> 37:45.860
the result is that we end up talking to ourselves.

37:45.860 --> 37:48.500
Now, I'm not certain that that's a problem for Bart.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.700
I think that he finds this a sort of, how can I put it?

37:53.340 --> 37:56.900
A sort of transcendence,

37:56.900 --> 37:59.820
a sort of way of getting beyond the mere contingency,

37:59.820 --> 38:01.900
the mere limitations of human life

38:01.940 --> 38:05.300
towards some new external other realm.

38:05.300 --> 38:08.100
In a way, I'd almost be tempted to say

38:08.100 --> 38:10.060
that he's reinventing metaphysics

38:10.060 --> 38:11.820
and instead of putting it somewhere else

38:11.820 --> 38:12.820
outside of space and time,

38:12.820 --> 38:15.220
he's putting it within the domain of his own consciousness

38:15.220 --> 38:17.700
and then he's shooing away the rest of the world,

38:17.700 --> 38:18.940
saying, I'll allow you to exist

38:18.940 --> 38:20.420
if I decide to invent you linguistically,

38:20.420 --> 38:23.500
but else wise, do not interfere with my activity.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.220
I wish to be totally free.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.660
So if Shakespeare were to come to him

38:26.660 --> 38:28.980
and say, I think you're misinterpreting one of my plays,

38:28.980 --> 38:30.300
he would say, well, what does your opinion

38:30.300 --> 38:31.420
have to do with my freedom?

38:31.420 --> 38:33.140
Get away from my face.

38:33.140 --> 38:36.860
I have totally free play and what that amounts to

38:36.860 --> 38:40.540
is the idea that Bart is a sort of anti-deadless.

38:40.540 --> 38:42.940
If you know the deadless myth from Greek mythology,

38:42.940 --> 38:45.660
he's the one who found the way out of the labyrinth.

38:45.660 --> 38:48.980
Bart's reply is, labyrinth, what labyrinth?

38:48.980 --> 38:50.220
I live here.

38:50.220 --> 38:51.340
We're not trying to get out.

38:51.340 --> 38:52.380
There is no out.

38:52.380 --> 38:53.580
This is it.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.820
You happen to be locked in your subjectivity

38:55.820 --> 38:58.860
and the domain of your universe ends with your fingertips

38:58.860 --> 39:02.740
and the idea that there is a way out of this problem

39:02.740 --> 39:05.020
that will allow us to find the way the world really is

39:05.020 --> 39:07.060
as opposed to the way the world is

39:07.060 --> 39:09.060
within the domain of our semiotic system

39:09.060 --> 39:13.580
is just the hopeless platonic dream of metaphysics

39:13.580 --> 39:15.020
from the time of the ancient Greeks

39:15.020 --> 39:18.220
to the time of the moderns, up to, say, Levy Strauss.

39:18.220 --> 39:20.500
So what he's saying is, this is it.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.660
I live here.

39:21.660 --> 39:25.020
Get used to the absolute contingency of subjectivity

39:25.020 --> 39:28.620
and get used to replacing all your other standards,

39:28.620 --> 39:31.940
things like logical coherence or correspondence

39:31.940 --> 39:35.140
to the external world, move away from all that reality

39:35.140 --> 39:37.020
principle stuff just towards pleasure

39:37.020 --> 39:39.180
because that's the only thing that could ever justify

39:39.180 --> 39:40.740
any of your intellectual activity

39:40.740 --> 39:42.140
and even that doesn't justify it.

39:42.140 --> 39:44.580
There is no justification for intellectual activity.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.820
What could we gesture at besides our own semiotic system?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.060
And we're locked into that.

39:49.060 --> 39:52.620
Semiotic systems are incommensurable and untranslatable.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.900
And because they're incommensurable and untranslatable,

39:54.900 --> 39:57.260
there's no necessarily conflict between Freudianism

39:57.260 --> 39:58.140
and Marxism.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.300
It's just there's no privileged position

40:00.300 --> 40:02.220
from which we can decide that Freudianism,

40:02.220 --> 40:04.660
as opposed to Marxism, is the true semiotic system

40:04.660 --> 40:06.540
which discloses ultimate reality.

40:06.540 --> 40:08.220
There's just no such thing.

40:08.220 --> 40:11.980
There's an infinite number of perspectives, right?

40:11.980 --> 40:15.260
And that means that we break down into a world

40:15.260 --> 40:18.500
in which we're all profoundly lonely

40:18.500 --> 40:21.780
and we have whole societies

40:21.780 --> 40:23.900
composed of atomized individuals

40:23.900 --> 40:27.140
speaking their own language, living in their own world.

40:27.140 --> 40:29.940
Can you see how this is going to tend to liberate

40:29.940 --> 40:32.540
the centripetal forces of the mind

40:32.540 --> 40:36.140
and keep us from having any of those centrifugal forces

40:36.140 --> 40:39.860
which hold language and society and culture together?

40:39.860 --> 40:44.380
And can you see then why this is a negative critique

40:44.380 --> 40:47.460
which finds certain tactical uses in asserting

40:47.460 --> 40:50.020
that demythologizing is at least possible

40:50.020 --> 40:51.660
or at least occasionally useful

40:51.660 --> 40:54.020
in advancing left-wing politics?

40:54.020 --> 40:57.420
What we have here then is the artist or critic

40:57.420 --> 40:59.420
as political dilettante.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.180
In other words, Bart likes to pursue politics once in a while

41:02.180 --> 41:03.620
because he finds it pleasurable.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.260
And the sort of politics he likes to pursue

41:05.260 --> 41:08.340
is the politics which increases and extends his own pleasure.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.860
And the reason why he does it,

41:09.860 --> 41:11.460
well, at the fundamental level,

41:11.460 --> 41:12.660
it's because he finds it pleasurable.

41:12.660 --> 41:14.900
Pleasure is the only thing that one can refer to.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.500
But for tactical reasons,

41:16.500 --> 41:18.420
it may be useful not to suggest that.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.300
It may be worthwhile to write a book

41:20.300 --> 41:22.700
suggesting that left-wing myths

41:22.740 --> 41:24.140
are very different from right-wing myths

41:24.140 --> 41:26.220
and they're not nearly so mythological somehow.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.220
And what he's doing is just creating a meta myth,

41:28.220 --> 41:29.740
a new myth.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.660
And that means that we have a new order of poetry

41:32.660 --> 41:34.420
called literary criticism.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.820
We have a new order of critic

41:35.820 --> 41:37.780
who is now the ultimate poet

41:37.780 --> 41:40.980
because where the poets had to accept contingency

41:40.980 --> 41:42.700
and had to accept the simple determination

41:42.700 --> 41:43.940
of the external world,

41:43.940 --> 41:46.300
the critic is not bound by nature.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.540
The critic is trying to undermine nature.

41:48.540 --> 41:52.540
The critic flees from nature into the realm of the text.

41:52.580 --> 41:55.820
And that's why I think it's correct to describe Bart

41:55.820 --> 41:57.380
as anti-deadless,

41:57.380 --> 41:59.420
the guy who says stop asking the question

41:59.420 --> 42:00.900
of how to get out of the labyrinth.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.740
Stop asking the question of how to find substantial reality

42:03.740 --> 42:06.020
independent of your semiotic mythologizing.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.860
In fact, it's masks all the way down.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.340
And for that reason,

42:10.340 --> 42:12.900
he adopts a sort of ironic stance

42:12.900 --> 42:14.980
because what is there left for the critic to do?

42:14.980 --> 42:17.900
Certainly he can't communicate any reality

42:17.900 --> 42:19.540
about a text to anybody else

42:19.540 --> 42:21.140
because it won't be any more real

42:21.140 --> 42:22.420
than whatever they already believe

42:22.420 --> 42:24.100
and whatever they already think.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.820
The only thing he can do is indulge himself,

42:26.820 --> 42:28.860
is gratify his desire for pleasure

42:28.860 --> 42:31.660
by increasing the domain of his freedom

42:31.660 --> 42:34.420
so that it covers all communicative behavior.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.940
So it covers the whole set of signs.

42:36.940 --> 42:39.340
Nature, for example, is one of our signs

42:39.340 --> 42:42.260
for external coercion, the externality of things.

42:42.260 --> 42:45.420
Well, we can treat that as a myth as well.

42:45.420 --> 42:48.220
The whole world then becomes a human domain

42:48.220 --> 42:50.660
constructed by human beings in society

42:50.660 --> 42:53.020
and constructed by human beings in language.

42:53.020 --> 42:57.180
It is Cartesianism raised to a social collective level

42:57.180 --> 43:00.420
based not upon physics but upon aesthetics.

43:00.420 --> 43:02.540
For some reasons that I think are clear,

43:02.540 --> 43:03.900
Descartes such a great thinker,

43:03.900 --> 43:05.580
French culture has never been able to get out

43:05.580 --> 43:07.340
from under the shadow of Descartes.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.300
They all have a problem with either accepting

43:09.300 --> 43:11.740
their own selfhood or demonstrating the reality

43:11.740 --> 43:12.980
of the external world.

43:12.980 --> 43:15.100
It easily slips off into solitism

43:15.100 --> 43:17.100
if you start your philosophical investigations

43:17.100 --> 43:18.140
from the inside.

43:18.140 --> 43:20.640
It's gonna be so hard to make that jump to outside stuff.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.540
It may be there, but then again, it may not.

43:23.540 --> 43:26.900
Summing up then, let's think about what this amounts to.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.380
First of all, it's very clear that the demystifier,

43:30.380 --> 43:32.620
in this case, Bart, is also a remystifier,

43:32.620 --> 43:34.980
that the critic is an artist.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.380
This is a position of extreme solitude,

43:37.380 --> 43:40.520
a sort of epicurean withdrawal into the safety

43:40.520 --> 43:43.540
and sanctity and security of the soul.

43:43.540 --> 43:46.500
And the result is that we have an ironic metamith.

43:46.540 --> 43:50.100
He intends to communicate to us the fact

43:50.100 --> 43:51.900
that there's really nothing to communicate

43:51.900 --> 43:54.060
about these texts, except the fact

43:54.060 --> 43:55.260
that they are totally free and open

43:55.260 --> 43:57.260
and that there's no authority which you can refer to

43:57.260 --> 44:00.140
as coercing or limiting your interpretation.

44:00.140 --> 44:02.060
What I would say goes on here then,

44:02.060 --> 44:05.420
is that in constructing this Cartesian aesthetics,

44:05.420 --> 44:07.940
Bart makes readers little gods

44:07.940 --> 44:11.580
and gives them omnipotence over an infinite domain

44:11.580 --> 44:13.540
called the literary text.
