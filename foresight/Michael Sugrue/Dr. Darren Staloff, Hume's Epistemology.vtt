00:00.000 --> 00:23.900
Music

00:23.900 --> 00:33.300
David Hume is, in many ways, one of the most important, and I would urge, attractive figures

00:33.300 --> 00:43.100
in the Western philosophical tradition, a man of great wit, affability, charm.

00:43.100 --> 00:50.620
Hume was, by all who knew him, regarded as a admirable person, a pleasant person, a man

00:50.620 --> 00:55.580
who had very few arguments in his life, was very difficult to ever race his temper, he

00:55.580 --> 01:01.140
only once became angry, apparently, and that was against Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had

01:01.140 --> 01:04.140
stated his house and accused Hume of stealing his ideas.

01:04.140 --> 01:09.820
If any of you have read Rousseau and read Hume, you know that's a sign of Rousseau's

01:09.820 --> 01:12.100
paranoid insanity.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.540
Hume and Rousseau could not be more entirely apart in their views.

01:16.940 --> 01:24.580
Nonetheless, given this about Hume, he was, in his own lifetime, a remarkably obscure

01:24.580 --> 01:31.100
philosophical figure, and this was largely the result of, one, the very skeptical nature

01:31.100 --> 01:39.180
of his conclusions, he was thought to be very dreary and uninspiring, and the rather technical

01:39.180 --> 01:43.900
precision of his arguments, he was a very difficult writer, he didn't inspire people.

01:44.660 --> 01:51.380
I will argue that Hume has an inspirational side, but it's very much in keeping with

01:51.380 --> 01:55.660
his character, it's very dry, it's very a dour sort of inspiration.

01:55.660 --> 02:01.260
In fact, as a way of illustrating the way people misconceive Hume, when I first read

02:01.260 --> 02:05.940
Hume in college, I immediately assumed, because he's an incredibly powerful and accurate

02:05.940 --> 02:11.860
analytic thinker, that I had a mental picture of the fellow as a very thin, wiry, school

02:11.940 --> 02:17.780
marmish professor, very, very accurate and precise, in fact, the very picture of Immanuel

02:17.780 --> 02:26.540
Kant, I was much surprised to learn that, in fact, he was a large, robust, rotund Scotsman

02:26.540 --> 02:33.820
with a heavy, heavy brogue, who could always be counted on for a good joke, a pint of ale

02:33.820 --> 02:38.380
and a leg of mutton, he was very much a laughing philosopher.

02:38.380 --> 02:43.620
In many ways, is one of the most challenging figures in the philosophic tradition up to

02:43.620 --> 02:45.460
this point.

02:45.460 --> 02:50.220
The only one I could compare him to in this regard is Spinoza, you remember that Spinoza

02:50.220 --> 02:58.260
was challenging in that he was the first complete rejecter of the Judeo-Christian ethic, completely

02:58.260 --> 03:03.620
rejected the notion of the immortality of the soul, of freedom of the will, and we will

03:03.620 --> 03:10.340
find Hume shares those beliefs, also his skeptical Judeo-Christian tradition.

03:10.340 --> 03:17.700
In a way, he's far more damaging and challenging than Spinoza, whereas Spinoza is disgusted

03:17.700 --> 03:24.780
with that tradition and finds it a name, Hume, as is his want, is amused by it, he thinks

03:24.780 --> 03:29.540
it's absolutely hilarious that there are people who go to church, he thinks it's wonderful,

03:29.540 --> 03:33.800
he thinks it's the absolute quote, these knees that people believe that somehow they're

03:33.800 --> 03:38.060
not animals, and he thinks this is just part of the good sport of life, that there are

03:38.060 --> 03:41.820
people out there who really believe such absurd things, and he does not want to dissuade them

03:41.820 --> 03:50.620
in any sense, he rather wants to laugh with his small group of esoteric insiders, as it

03:50.620 --> 03:52.100
were.

03:52.100 --> 03:59.260
Hume's historical significance is that he brought to full fruition the empiricist epistemology

03:59.260 --> 04:05.100
and a phenomenology that really begins with Hobbes, matures with Locke, as we saw, is developed

04:05.100 --> 04:08.780
by Barclay, Hume in a certain way brings it to a close.

04:08.780 --> 04:14.740
He takes it to its logical extremes, to its point of logical conclusion, and sort of ties

04:14.740 --> 04:18.740
it up with a very nice bow.

04:18.740 --> 04:26.140
Although he never made much great fame in his lifetime, afterwards he has become one

04:26.140 --> 04:28.620
of the most important philosophers in the tradition.

04:28.620 --> 04:33.900
He had a profound effect on a certain Prussian philosopher by the name of Immanuel Kant,

04:33.900 --> 04:39.500
who claims, I read David Hume, he awoke me from my dogmatic slumbers.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.620
Kant claimed that Hume was, and I think one could say in defense of Kant, that Kant was

04:44.620 --> 04:48.340
the only one who understood Hume in the 18th century with the possible exception of Adam

04:48.340 --> 04:49.340
Smith.

04:49.340 --> 04:54.940
He was the only one who realized that this incredibly dry, dull, boring Scotsman is in

04:55.020 --> 05:00.780
fact a wild man and is in fact on to the deepest critique of the philosophical tradition we

05:00.780 --> 05:03.060
have found yet.

05:03.060 --> 05:09.620
Since then, Hume has become a source of inspiration for utilitarian ethics in the 19th century.

05:09.620 --> 05:14.620
We'll see the logical positivist movement of the 19th century, figures like Karnath,

05:14.620 --> 05:19.580
Schick, Ayer, Wittgenstein, all claim that their ancestry runs to David Hume.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.940
He's become an incredibly important thinker after his death.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.940
I would urge he was strongly ahead of his time.

05:25.940 --> 05:30.540
Okay, enough sort of background on Hume.

05:30.540 --> 05:35.940
Let's then begin with his empiricist phenomenology.

05:35.940 --> 05:42.620
Hume, like Barkley and Locke before him, recognized that all of our mental representations can

05:42.620 --> 05:45.740
be divided into two classes.

05:45.740 --> 05:51.180
On the one hand are impressions, and on the other hand are ideas.

05:51.180 --> 06:00.420
Now, Hume is aware that, in fact, beyond aware, Hume's perhaps biggest project as a philosopher

06:00.420 --> 06:03.260
is the avoidance of dogmatism.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.380
And so he's aware that it would be dogmatic to say that our impressions are the result

06:06.380 --> 06:07.980
of sense-statem.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.860
He wants to suggest that that's provisionally the case, and that's what we seem to believe

06:11.860 --> 06:12.860
in common sense.

06:12.860 --> 06:16.540
And Hume, by the way, is a great partisan of common sense.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.700
Presumably then let us say that our impressions are the results of sense-statem, but actually

06:20.700 --> 06:26.540
the way we distinguish between those and our ideas, copies of impressions, is by their

06:26.540 --> 06:27.540
vivacity.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.380
Again, by that phenomenological property.

06:30.380 --> 06:36.860
Your visual representation of me, when you look at me, is far more powerful and profound

06:36.860 --> 06:40.140
and sharp than is, say, your recollection of what I looked like.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.540
There's far more detail in the first class.

06:42.540 --> 06:47.780
So that's the first class of our mental representations, impressions, distinguished

06:47.780 --> 06:49.220
by their greater vivacity.

06:49.220 --> 06:55.140
The second class are ideas or thoughts, and these are distinguished by their relative

06:55.140 --> 06:57.540
lack of force and internal clarity.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.540
Presumably, there are copies of impressions.

07:00.540 --> 07:06.500
Again, your notion of your mental representation of me when you close your eyes is a copy of

07:06.500 --> 07:10.740
your actual sense-datum of me, presumably.

07:10.740 --> 07:15.260
And in fact, there's another mark to suggest that one is the copy of the other, the process

07:15.260 --> 07:17.500
of temporal sequence.

07:17.500 --> 07:21.780
You never have an idea of what I look like or image of me before you've actually seen

07:21.780 --> 07:22.780
me.

07:22.780 --> 07:29.580
If anything, your ideas follow your impressions, and that temporal sequence is a mark of copying

07:29.580 --> 07:31.580
or causality.

07:31.580 --> 07:38.460
Okay, now, Hume argued, or claimed, rather, I should say, on the basis of an introspective

07:38.460 --> 07:43.460
and scientific observation, that there were only three principles with which the mind

07:43.460 --> 07:49.620
associated the various ideas, not impressions, but ideas that it entertains.

07:49.620 --> 07:53.820
And again, I want to be clear about something about Hume.

07:53.820 --> 07:58.100
Hume is not arguing for any foundational view of the human mind.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.980
He claimed to be the Newton of the moral sciences.

08:00.980 --> 08:05.140
He was going to establish his philosophy on the basis of scientific observation.

08:05.140 --> 08:10.580
He says, from his introspective scientific observation of his own cognitive states, there

08:10.580 --> 08:16.860
are only three principles that associate the various ideas or images we have in the show

08:16.860 --> 08:22.380
between our ears.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.580
And the first of those is, of course, resemblance.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.580
Right?

08:25.580 --> 08:32.420
We say that the representation you have of me now strongly resembles the representation

08:32.420 --> 08:37.860
you had of me when I was giving perchance to my Markley lecture.

08:37.860 --> 08:43.860
And certain strength of resemblance leads one to posit identity, right?

08:43.860 --> 08:48.140
But similarly, short of identity, we may say, there is a stronger resemblance between my

08:48.140 --> 08:53.500
appearance and some other member of the audience's appearance than either of our appearance towards,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.260
say, this lectern.

08:55.260 --> 09:00.460
And therefore, we see how we form elementary set theory and elementary sorts of kinds.

09:00.460 --> 09:05.500
There's a stronger, again, resemblance between the idea of me and any of you than between

09:05.500 --> 09:08.860
myself and the lectern.

09:08.860 --> 09:11.420
That's the first principle of association.

09:11.420 --> 09:16.380
The second is contiguity, right?

09:16.380 --> 09:22.900
All of our ideas can be related in terms of their spatial relationships or temporal relationships.

09:22.900 --> 09:28.860
So I am, from my perspective, to the right of the lectern presently and behind it.

09:28.860 --> 09:33.020
Now I'm to the left of the lectern and behind it, again, from my perspective.

09:33.380 --> 09:37.700
Similarly, the sentences I am pronouncing now follow the sentences I pronounced, say,

09:37.700 --> 09:38.860
some one minute ago.

09:38.860 --> 09:44.700
So all of those representations fit into, as it were, spatial configuration and temporal

09:44.700 --> 09:45.700
configuration.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.940
That's the other principle, contiguity.

09:49.940 --> 09:54.260
Now we get to the third and far and away, the most important.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.540
And that has caused an effect, right?

09:57.540 --> 10:00.540
You see me release the watch.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.340
You see the effect of it falling.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.500
You attribute a causal agency.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
Okay.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.220
Now, we have all the principles of association.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.900
Let's now talk about our knowledge.

10:14.900 --> 10:19.660
And again, that can be broken down into one of two classes.

10:19.660 --> 10:26.220
The first class deals with the relations between ideas in a purely formal sense.

10:26.220 --> 10:32.460
A human such knowledge is either intuitively certain or, if not, it is demonstrable.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.580
Okay.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.020
So what would be examples?

10:37.020 --> 10:44.980
The common examples are the propositions of mathematics, geometry, algebra, formula logic.

10:44.980 --> 10:51.180
Are all cases with the association where the truth of the sentences hinges on the relation

10:51.180 --> 10:55.460
between the ideas and that relationship is purely formal.

10:55.460 --> 11:03.420
In other words, a computer can formulate true mathematical or logical propositions.

11:03.420 --> 11:10.740
The key for Hume is that such propositions have absolutely no existential implications.

11:10.740 --> 11:14.540
We can accept all of Euclidean geometry as being true.

11:14.540 --> 11:18.580
Every proposition, provable in the Euclidean geometry, we can accept is true without there

11:18.580 --> 11:20.900
existing such a thing as a triangle.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.380
Similarly, we can accept all the propositions as logic as true without believing that there

11:26.380 --> 11:33.060
exists somewhere in the world a operator called the conditional or the disjunctive.

11:33.060 --> 11:39.140
So that's a key point that that first class of knowledge, the relation between ideas is

11:39.140 --> 11:42.060
purely formal and has no existential implications.

11:42.060 --> 11:46.300
It teaches us nothing about the world, it only teaches us, as it were, a very rigorous

11:46.300 --> 11:50.780
sort of vocabulary that we might be able to use in talking about the world.

11:51.660 --> 11:57.100
In and of itself has nothing to say about existence and things of the world.

11:57.100 --> 12:04.660
Things of the world are discussed in that second class of knowledge, which he calls

12:04.660 --> 12:07.180
matters of fact.

12:07.180 --> 12:12.220
Those propositions which concern existential statements are statements of fact.

12:12.220 --> 12:16.860
The first thing to note is that there is no logical basis for all of our knowledge of

12:16.860 --> 12:18.740
fact.

12:18.740 --> 12:19.940
And how do we know that?

12:19.940 --> 12:25.660
Because counterfactuals are all possible, which is to say, it is a fact that if I release

12:25.660 --> 12:27.980
this watch, it will fall.

12:27.980 --> 12:33.500
But it is entirely logically possible that if I release this watch, it would float up

12:33.500 --> 12:35.020
to heaven.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.940
It never has, right?

12:36.940 --> 12:41.340
I've never observed that myself, but there is nothing that logically constrains this

12:41.340 --> 12:47.140
watch to either fall down or not to simply remain sustained in the air.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.940
If I was the amazing Kresge or something, I could do such a trick.

12:49.940 --> 12:56.140
But this point is, since counterfactuals are all logically possible, right, then there

12:56.140 --> 13:00.460
is no logical basis for knowledge of matters of fact.

13:00.460 --> 13:05.700
Well, then that raises, for Hume, the critical epistemological question.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.860
How do we know matters of fact?

13:07.860 --> 13:12.500
Specifically, how do we know any matters of fact other than that which you are presently

13:12.500 --> 13:14.820
sensing, right?

13:14.820 --> 13:21.660
So you have good sensual evidence to believe that I am up here walking around.

13:21.660 --> 13:29.940
But how do you know, for example, that I really was here earlier talking about Barclay?

13:29.940 --> 13:30.940
How can you infer that?

13:30.940 --> 13:35.380
How do you know that if you leave this room, this podium will still be here?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.940
Oh, this lectern, I should say.

13:37.940 --> 13:43.700
And Hume says that the answer is the principle of cause and effect, right?

13:43.700 --> 13:50.020
You see my contiguity moving over from an earlier lecture to this one, and you assume

13:50.020 --> 13:53.900
that there's one agent who is causing all of these changes, similarly with the lectern.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.840
You assume that unless something comes in to move it, its inertial force will make it

13:58.840 --> 13:59.840
remain here.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.980
So the only way you can argue beyond your present sense datum is the fact that there

14:04.980 --> 14:09.780
is a world outside, that there are lights above you producing heat and light, is because

14:09.780 --> 14:12.100
of the principle of cause and effect.

14:12.100 --> 14:20.100
It's the fundamental glue, as it were, epistemological glue of the factual world, because it allows

14:20.100 --> 14:24.620
us to infer from sense to uncensed phenomena.

14:24.620 --> 14:30.260
Now cause and effect is not known what we might call a priori, or before the fact, or

14:30.260 --> 14:32.140
before experience.

14:32.140 --> 14:37.740
Rather, it only comes from the experience of constant conjunction.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.700
So again, back to our great experiment.

14:40.700 --> 14:45.340
You did not know before you ever saw someone release an object that it would fall.

14:45.340 --> 14:51.580
The only way you know that is that every time you've seen an object released, it falls.

14:51.580 --> 14:58.980
That constant conjunction, release, fall, release, fall, is the only evidence you have

14:58.980 --> 15:04.220
of that causal relation, and similarly it is with all the other causal relations.

15:04.220 --> 15:08.540
The only way you know that eating a cheeseburger will satisfy you when you're hungry, if in

15:08.540 --> 15:12.740
fact it does, is because that's happened in the past.

15:12.740 --> 15:16.700
It is entirely conceivable that you can eat a cheeseburger and be three times as hungry

15:16.700 --> 15:17.860
afterwards as before.

15:17.860 --> 15:22.620
It doesn't happen that way because of the nature of our constant conjunctions and experience,

15:22.620 --> 15:24.540
but all of our causal laws are just that.

15:24.540 --> 15:31.020
We see regularity, constant conjunction, and from that we infer a causal relation.

15:31.020 --> 15:35.820
Well, the implications for science, therefore, are very important.

15:35.820 --> 15:40.700
If science gives us causal explanations, all it does in a way to use the metaphor from

15:40.700 --> 15:46.140
the right stuff is it pushes back at the envelope of ignorance.

15:46.140 --> 15:53.900
So when we learn the causal law, what causes this watch to fall, well, I release it.

15:53.900 --> 15:57.540
What causes it to accelerate at the rate it does, the laws of gravity.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.900
What causes the laws of gravity beats me.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.900
We don't know yet.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.900
Perhaps we will someday.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.940
Perhaps Grand Unified Theory will supply the explanation, but all you do is you push

16:05.020 --> 16:08.380
back that envelope of ignorance one step further.

16:08.380 --> 16:13.140
That's an important empiricist and humane point, is that science never offers absolute

16:13.140 --> 16:14.300
truth.

16:14.300 --> 16:18.500
It's provisional truth, constantly subject to revision on the basis of new experience

16:18.500 --> 16:24.980
and new formulation.

16:24.980 --> 16:28.260
Back to our big epistemological fish we want to fry.

16:28.260 --> 16:33.140
Given that all our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, and that

16:33.140 --> 16:38.340
cause and effect is in turn based on experience, the experience of conscious and conjunctions,

16:38.340 --> 16:42.100
what warrants our belief and experience, right?

16:42.100 --> 16:46.060
Well, it can't be reason, can it, or logic.

16:46.060 --> 16:51.660
That can't warrant our belief and experience, for it's logically possible that the future

16:51.660 --> 16:53.900
won't resemble the past, right?

16:53.900 --> 16:59.340
It's entirely possible that in 15 minutes from now God will so change the universe that

16:59.340 --> 17:04.500
whenever you release a watch it will float up to heaven, or it will remain suspended.

17:04.500 --> 17:08.380
You have no logical evidence to suggest that that won't happen.

17:08.380 --> 17:13.260
All you have is your past experience, right, and your present experience.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.580
So clearly experience, which is the judgment that the future in fact will resemble the

17:17.580 --> 17:20.780
present, can't be based on reason.

17:20.780 --> 17:24.260
And by the way I should point out, you could also make that argument retrospectively, as

17:24.260 --> 17:25.780
Bertrand Russell does.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.980
How do we know the past is not different from the present?

17:29.980 --> 17:34.700
How do we in fact know that once upon a time the sun really didn't move around the earth

17:34.700 --> 17:38.860
and that the Bible didn't have it right and things have changed since then?

17:38.860 --> 17:43.620
And that's the puzzle that Cune feels is the critical epistemological puzzle that has to

17:43.620 --> 17:45.500
be solved.

17:45.500 --> 17:52.260
And clearly we do not have any recourse to logic or reason in answering this question.

17:53.260 --> 18:00.300
Well, you can't base experience on cause and effect for the obvious reason that cause

18:00.300 --> 18:02.940
and effect is based on experience, right?

18:02.940 --> 18:08.460
Our belief in causal laws is based on our experience of constant conjunction, so you

18:08.460 --> 18:14.740
can't use those causal laws then circularly to support the belief that the future will

18:14.740 --> 18:21.900
resemble the present or the past, because of course causal laws presuppose that resemblance.

18:21.900 --> 18:28.340
This Hume luxuriates in this riddle for a while because he has a very obvious answer

18:28.340 --> 18:34.340
and an answer which is going to offend all of the high-brow intellectuals of Europe.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.980
Why do we believe in cause and effect?

18:35.980 --> 18:40.420
It's a habit, it's a custom, no rational basis for it whatsoever.

18:40.420 --> 18:45.780
It's not reason that teaches us cause and effect, it's instinct.

18:45.780 --> 18:49.580
You can't dispense with believing in causal laws as you go about the world.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.020
When you get hungry or you're going to say, well, I'm not going to eat for three days,

18:52.020 --> 18:53.520
that will fill me up.

18:53.520 --> 19:00.020
It's habitual to believe that as cheeseburgers did me good before, they'll do me well again.

19:00.020 --> 19:06.620
So the point is there's something extra-rational which orients our behavior and understanding

19:06.620 --> 19:09.100
of the physical world.

19:09.100 --> 19:14.580
It is irrational to believe in experience that the future will resemble the present,

19:14.580 --> 19:18.380
but it's customary and it's in fact inescapable in practical life.

19:18.380 --> 19:22.700
And sense knows better than philosophic insight.

19:22.700 --> 19:28.180
So experience then is warranted by a sort of natural instinct instead of a rational proof.

19:28.180 --> 19:34.060
How can we in fact argue that pervasively?

19:34.060 --> 19:41.620
The first thing he points out is, notice simpletons, children, animals all follow causal laws,

19:41.620 --> 19:42.620
don't they?

19:42.620 --> 19:43.620
Right?

19:43.740 --> 19:50.620
You've all heard the experiment of Pavlov's dog, but can children, simpletons, and animals

19:50.620 --> 19:52.540
do logical proofs?

19:52.540 --> 19:59.100
They are all able to observe causal laws and clearly can't rationally demonstrate anything.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.380
All right?

20:00.380 --> 20:04.740
So the implication is it must be some sort of instinctual response.

20:04.740 --> 20:09.900
Okay, if all of our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, right?

20:09.900 --> 20:17.060
And all matters of cause and effect is based on experience, what is the origin of the roughly

20:17.060 --> 20:23.740
interchangeable metaphysical doctrines of power, force, and necessary connection?

20:23.740 --> 20:28.860
Well, he points out, first of all, there's no logical doctrine of necessary connections

20:28.860 --> 20:33.740
in the world because as we've seen before, logical proofs have no existential implications.

20:33.740 --> 20:34.740
Right?

20:34.740 --> 20:39.300
So if we want to argue that there is force in the world, we can't do so on a logical

20:39.300 --> 20:40.460
basis.

20:40.460 --> 20:45.740
Also, force, necessary connection, can't arise from sense.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.660
I mean, what color is a necessary connection?

20:48.660 --> 20:50.220
What flavor is it?

20:50.220 --> 20:52.940
When do you actually experience a necessary connection?

20:52.940 --> 20:57.660
And he's careful to point out some of the errors that in fact later thinkers will think

20:57.660 --> 20:59.980
are profound proofs of it.

20:59.980 --> 21:05.100
Tolstoy made a lot out of it, he said, you want to show, you want me to show you force?

21:05.100 --> 21:06.100
Look.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.100
Right?

21:07.260 --> 21:11.100
And it's up, force, and he says, no, no, no.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.620
That's in fact the experience of constant conjunction.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.540
Every time you desire to lift your arm, it's gone up.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.540
You want to do the proof?

21:17.540 --> 21:19.100
Want me to prove it to you?

21:19.100 --> 21:22.380
We'll see if we can't give you palsy somehow.

21:22.380 --> 21:26.660
And you'll sit there for the next three hours and try and lift your arm and it won't go

21:26.660 --> 21:27.660
up.

21:27.660 --> 21:28.660
Where'd the force go?

21:28.660 --> 21:30.220
Where'd the necessary connection go?

21:30.220 --> 21:31.220
Must have disappeared.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.220
Maybe God intervened.

21:32.220 --> 21:36.460
So he points out that in fact all of your sense of physical force in controlling your

21:36.460 --> 21:40.580
bodily actions are entirely on the basis of the constant conjunction you've had between

21:40.580 --> 21:44.060
your will and the movement of your body.

21:44.060 --> 21:47.500
And there are times when you'll be in deliriums or sick when you won't be able to move them

21:47.500 --> 21:50.260
and you'll try and you'll fail.

21:50.260 --> 21:55.060
Okay, so then Hugh answers this question finally.

21:55.060 --> 21:59.540
Necessary connection, force, energy, all those metaphysical doctrines, they're just powerful

21:59.540 --> 22:01.300
psychological conditions.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.580
You've seen constant conjunctions which are so constant and so sure that your mind just

22:05.580 --> 22:09.620
leaves the next step and says, well, it's necessary, can't be avoided, but it's just

22:09.620 --> 22:13.580
a psychological phenomena.

22:13.580 --> 22:18.340
In fact, since all ideas have their origin and sense, if there's no sensual basis for

22:18.340 --> 22:24.700
an idea, we can say as a fact that there is no, that the notion itself is a chimera,

22:24.700 --> 22:28.900
right, is a myth, is a fantasy.

22:28.900 --> 22:33.500
And here is where we turn of course to Barclay's, Hugh's discussion of Barclay.

22:33.860 --> 22:38.620
All right, Barclay has said, well, when do we experience matter, the most sensual experience

22:38.620 --> 22:44.860
of matter, and Hugh in his wonderful sense of what says, well, of course you're right.

22:44.860 --> 22:48.700
As a brilliant criticism by Barclay, we never do experience matter.

22:48.700 --> 22:54.220
Now, what color was a mind again, and what flavor is your mind?

22:54.220 --> 22:55.500
What does it taste like?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.860
We never experienced a mind either.

22:57.860 --> 23:01.700
Well, in that case, if you want to get rid of matter, fine, but we'll throw a mind out

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
with it too.

23:02.740 --> 23:06.580
And then all that there'll be in our universe is one damn thing after another, right?

23:06.580 --> 23:11.460
We just have one representation after another, no mind to hold them, no matter to project

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
them.

23:12.460 --> 23:18.300
And Hugh, of course, is happy with that answer, because his point is that our belief in matter

23:18.300 --> 23:25.740
and our belief in mind isn't a result of metaphysical speculation, it's life, right?

23:25.740 --> 23:29.500
It's a common sense intuition, and common sense is more than functional for getting

23:29.500 --> 23:31.740
us through the world.

23:31.740 --> 23:40.580
Okay, then Hugh moves on to the discussion of freedom or liberty and necessity.

23:40.580 --> 23:44.900
And again, Hugh, the peacemaker, argues quite controversially, you know, no one's ever really

23:44.900 --> 23:46.340
disagreed about this.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.340
People think they disagreed, but they didn't.

23:49.340 --> 23:54.780
The more you think about it, all reasonable people know that necessity and causation,

23:54.780 --> 23:59.260
which are the essence of determinism, are simply the experience of constant conjunctions

23:59.260 --> 24:02.420
and the belief that the future will resemble the past.

24:02.420 --> 24:06.580
And that's natural to all animals, or all higher animals, right?

24:06.580 --> 24:09.340
And if you've got that, you're happy with determinism.

24:09.340 --> 24:13.540
The other side, liberty, is simply the absence of external restraint.

24:13.540 --> 24:19.220
No one's tying you down, you are free to stand up and leave at any moment.

24:19.220 --> 24:24.020
Liberty then has nothing to do with some abstruse doctrine of a free and uncaused will, and it's

24:24.020 --> 24:26.980
perfectly consistent with the causally-determined universe.

24:26.980 --> 24:33.140
So we have liberty, hopefully, if we have libertarian governments, and we have determinism, and

24:33.140 --> 24:37.380
that certainly all of our actions follow causal laws.

24:37.380 --> 24:44.100
In fact, he says, if our actions had no causal laws, right, if our actions were not a result

24:44.100 --> 24:49.660
or caused by our character, then we would have no basis for moral evaluation, for punishment

24:49.660 --> 24:50.660
or blame.

24:50.860 --> 24:57.660
And consider, if I was, at this moment, to pull out a gun and shoot someone in this audience,

24:57.660 --> 25:02.500
Hume says, you must believe that that was caused by the nature of my character.

25:02.500 --> 25:08.260
If you don't, you think that was a truly free act, that is to say uncaused, then it is spontaneous.

25:08.260 --> 25:11.500
There's no reason for you to believe that I would ever do that again, since nothing

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
caused me to do it.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.620
I did it once, maybe I won't do it again.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.500
So then why in heaven's name would you bother to punish me?

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Right?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.780
You certainly won't deter me from doing it again, I'm not caused to do it, you just

25:21.780 --> 25:25.700
point out to me, we wish you wouldn't do that, and then we cart the body off and I go on

25:25.700 --> 25:26.700
with my lecture.

25:26.700 --> 25:32.300
Hume says, of course it's not that way, if I pulled out a gun you would infer from that

25:32.300 --> 25:37.780
that I'm some sort of psychopathic maniac, and that it's on the basis of that causal

25:37.780 --> 25:43.940
connection between psychopathic maniacism and shooting members of an audience that you

25:43.940 --> 25:46.740
are going to grab a pair of handcuffs and drag me out of here.

25:47.220 --> 25:50.340
And if you didn't believe there was that causal relation, then punishment would only be an

25:50.340 --> 25:53.420
act of bizarre vengeance.

25:53.420 --> 25:59.860
So we obviously believe in that sort of causal law in action, and in fact it's demonstrated

25:59.860 --> 26:02.460
in our interactions with our friends.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.420
Francis, we know what our friends are going to do, if I put my hand out he's going to

26:06.420 --> 26:10.180
grab it and shake it, if I ask him how he is he's not going to spit in my eye, I know

26:10.180 --> 26:15.260
it fell nice enough, he's going to give me a stock answer, fine, how are you?

26:15.260 --> 26:22.500
There's no surprises there, and Hume of course has a wonderful little joke, he says, everyone

26:22.500 --> 26:27.700
believes in causal determinacy and behavior and practice, it's only in theory they don't.

26:27.700 --> 26:32.100
Go by, well he talks about Sharon Cross, but let's say Times Square in New York City.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.140
So to anyone, have you ever noticed that people don't go by Times Square, take out their wallet

26:36.140 --> 26:40.140
and stick it in the middle of the ground, and walk away and say, I'll come back for

26:40.140 --> 26:42.180
that in an hour?

26:42.180 --> 26:45.700
For some reason or other they seem to think that people will be costly determined to pick

26:45.700 --> 26:50.220
it up and take the funny green paper out, and Hume says the fact that no one does that

26:50.220 --> 26:55.700
proves that everyone believes in causal determinacy, and that if you put your wallet in the middle

26:55.700 --> 27:00.020
of Times Square and came back for it an hour later, you wouldn't find it, and we all feel

27:00.020 --> 27:05.180
fairly certain of that.

27:05.180 --> 27:11.300
Now Hume now turns to, in his discussion of the inquiry concerning human understanding,

27:12.300 --> 27:16.900
for what I would call sort of payback, Hume was a remarkable prodigy in his youth, wrote

27:16.900 --> 27:24.260
a fantastic book at I think the age of 24, called The Treatise Concerning Human Nature,

27:24.260 --> 27:29.940
and applied for a position teaching pneumatic philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,

27:29.940 --> 27:38.940
and was blackballed by the Scottish Calvinist clergy because of his agnosticism.

27:38.940 --> 27:44.620
I think that profoundly affected Hume's beliefs ever since and his motivations in philosophy,

27:44.620 --> 27:49.540
but he certainly realized that the best way of getting back was not to denounce or scream

27:49.540 --> 27:56.540
or be angry, but to laugh, to joke, and that raises his discussion of miracles. He says,

27:56.540 --> 28:02.620
let's first define what do we mean by a miracle? A miracle is simply by definition a violation

28:02.620 --> 28:07.900
of the rules of nature, of the laws of nature, which are established through the sum of human

28:07.940 --> 28:13.220
experience, through the sum of our observed constant conjunctions. So miracles are that

28:13.220 --> 28:17.740
which there is no rational basis to believe in. That's the definition of a miracle, something

28:17.740 --> 28:19.700
which is incredibly irrational to believe in.

28:19.700 --> 28:24.580
He says, well, notice something. Have you ever noticed how there are very few miracles

28:24.580 --> 28:31.580
that occur in Times Square? Very few miracles occur in the White House or in NASA labs.

28:32.580 --> 28:39.580
Most miracles seem to occur among very primitive peoples and in very barbaric situations. We

28:40.380 --> 28:46.880
have our Lady of Guadalupe, but we don't seem to have our Lady of Cambridge. It's one thing

28:46.880 --> 28:53.880
to make you sort of suspicious about miracles to begin with. Then he goes on to, however,

28:54.540 --> 29:01.540
say something, which raises the relationship between something called exoterica and esoterica.

29:02.020 --> 29:07.340
It's one of the forms of free thinking and lightened humor. There is, however, a deep

29:07.340 --> 29:12.900
philosophic point to that. There's a deep philosophic point to the laughter itself. What is the

29:12.900 --> 29:19.900
only thing you can't laugh at? The sacred. Everything else can be laughed at. In effect

29:20.580 --> 29:27.260
then, by laughing at everything, humans desacralizing everything. Everything is worthy of laughter.

29:27.260 --> 29:33.260
Everything is a jest. And that, he thinks, is a means of human liberation.

29:33.260 --> 29:38.180
Okay. I've gone through skepticism. I should point out one of his interesting arguments

29:38.180 --> 29:43.300
about religion that comes up. He has a mock dialogue in the text with a Epicurean who

29:43.300 --> 29:47.100
says, well, actually, morality has nothing to do with religion. We could all be atheists

29:47.100 --> 29:50.900
and we would still be just as moral as we were before. There's no logical basis from

29:50.900 --> 29:56.380
which you can go to a belief in a God, to moral behavior. And Hume says, I think quite

29:56.420 --> 30:03.420
wisely, sir, I would acknowledge you to be a just reasoner, but not a good citizen. You

30:03.460 --> 30:08.700
say that because there is no logical reason or argument from the belief in God to moral

30:08.700 --> 30:15.200
behavior, that in fact no one actually makes that leap from belief in God to moral behavior.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.620
But of course, most people aren't very good reasoners. There are a lot of people who do

30:19.620 --> 30:24.640
believe in God and it restrains them from the most hideous acts. And therefore, I would

30:24.680 --> 30:28.800
account you a very bad citizen for speaking that argument publicly. And that, I think,

30:28.800 --> 30:32.280
is Hume's considered view. He does not believe in God. He doesn't believe in religion. He

30:32.280 --> 30:36.840
thinks it's absolutely laughable, but he would be extremely upset if anyone were attempt

30:36.840 --> 30:41.560
to argue against it publicly. Right. If there are people who would go out there and commit

30:41.560 --> 30:45.360
hideous crimes if they didn't believe in God, best to keep those sheep in line and stop

30:45.360 --> 30:50.120
them from becoming wolves. And it's very much again that exoteric, esoteric notion. There's

30:50.160 --> 30:55.760
a small circle of people who are mature enough and responsible enough to realize that even

30:55.760 --> 31:00.400
if God does not exist, they still have moral duties and responsibilities. For those who

31:00.400 --> 31:03.840
do not realize that it's simple, the best thing is to keep your mouth shut and not tell

31:03.840 --> 31:10.840
them anything. All right. We're left, however, with a certain amount of skepticism from Hume.

31:12.520 --> 31:17.760
And Hume is quite direct about skepticism. He says, if we take the Cartesian problematic

31:17.800 --> 31:22.520
seriously and doubt our faculties, there is no way to think your way out of a paper bag.

31:22.520 --> 31:27.800
If you doubt your faculties, there's no solution to skepticism. And in fact, skepticism is

31:27.800 --> 31:32.800
not ever logically refutable. It is entirely logical, logically possible that each and every

31:32.800 --> 31:36.440
one of you are the only thing in existence in the universe. And everything else is just

31:36.440 --> 31:43.440
a dream or delusion. Well, how then do you refute skepticism? And this assumes brilliant

31:43.440 --> 31:50.440
answer. You certainly don't do it philosophically. How do you do it? You get hungry. You may

31:51.360 --> 31:55.120
think you're the only thing in the universe, but when you get hungry, you will go out for

31:55.120 --> 32:00.920
a cheeseburger and a Coke. Practical life is the solution to skepticism. It has no practical

32:00.920 --> 32:07.240
consequences. Why would anyone ever believe in such a doctrine? So skepticism is refuted

32:07.240 --> 32:12.920
by common life, and that's the Humean Scottish School of Common Sense. You want to know how

32:12.920 --> 32:17.160
to answer these questions, not through abstract reason, through life. What's the point of

32:17.160 --> 32:20.760
believing you're the only one in the world? It's awfully lonely. Wouldn't it be better

32:20.760 --> 32:25.320
off to, wouldn't we all be better off to believe we're each other there? Isn't it practically

32:25.320 --> 32:29.600
more fulfilling and hence the importance of practical life?

32:29.600 --> 32:36.600
Okay. Well, if that extreme skepticism then is simply a joke, and Hume does in fact think

32:37.360 --> 32:44.360
it is. He has a wonderful little passage where he says that our skeptic, who doubts his own

32:44.720 --> 32:50.000
existence, is like a dreamer. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join

32:50.000 --> 32:54.760
in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement

32:54.760 --> 33:00.280
and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind a most

33:00.280 --> 33:05.240
act and reason and believe, though they are not able by their most diligent inquiry to

33:05.240 --> 33:09.640
satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections

33:09.640 --> 33:15.040
which may be raised against them. What's important about that passage is he's saying,

33:15.040 --> 33:20.760
skepticism, right, is irrefutable except for practical life, at which point you realize

33:20.760 --> 33:27.280
that all skepticism is just a joke. It's just a sort of a very dry sense of humor.

33:27.280 --> 33:32.520
What have we read so far in this book? It is filled with skepticism. What kind of a book

33:32.560 --> 33:38.600
is this? This is a joke book, Hume is saying. There's nothing serious in this book. Read

33:38.600 --> 33:42.120
this and laugh. That's what you should get out of philosophy. It's a lot of fun. It's

33:42.120 --> 33:49.120
like playing chess. Nothing hangs on it. What hangs on life? Good mutton, good ale, good

33:49.240 --> 33:55.760
fellowship, good humor. That's what's important in life. This, if I've amused you for 30

33:55.760 --> 33:59.080
minutes, wonderful. You've gotten more than enough out of philosophy. That's all you could

33:59.120 --> 34:02.880
get out of it. But then he does get serious. He says there, however, there is a lesson

34:02.880 --> 34:09.880
to be drawn. Not from an extreme skepticism, but from a moderate skepticism. And this comes

34:11.120 --> 34:15.080
back to his own personal history. And this is where I think Hume's ultimately most liberating

34:15.080 --> 34:22.080
project and one of the reasons why he still speaks to us today. He tells us that the great

34:22.540 --> 34:29.540
majority of mankind have a tendency to be rather certain of their opinions. They tend

34:36.120 --> 34:40.360
to believe that what they believe is absolutely certain and true. What other people believe

34:40.360 --> 34:47.120
is insane and evil. And yet we can't even know, we can't even show any logical basis

34:47.280 --> 34:54.280
for our belief in cause and effect. So then what do we call that nature of belief? Dogmatism.

34:54.280 --> 34:58.680
And that is the Humean project. What do you do with skepticism? When you find some dogmatic

34:58.680 --> 35:03.360
thinker who tells you, well, the world is really mind and matter, or someone else says,

35:03.360 --> 35:08.360
no, it isn't, it's just matter. You sit them down and you give them a wee, small tincture

35:08.360 --> 35:13.560
of fear. A wee, small tincture of skepticism. And from that, hopefully they'll learn a little

35:13.680 --> 35:19.960
bit about, quote, hubris. Before they blackball someone from a university, because he doesn't

35:19.960 --> 35:24.240
believe in the right version of Calvinism, he pointed out to him how impossible it is

35:24.240 --> 35:29.080
to demonstrate Calvinism in the first place. And maybe they'll be a little more open-minded.

35:29.080 --> 35:33.480
I think this is a topic which is very germane, not only for our culture and society, but

35:33.480 --> 35:39.980
for our high culture today as well, and academy. I think it's important for us to realize that

35:39.980 --> 35:45.580
Hume is right. The point of skepticism is to teach us to be a little bit less dogmatic,

35:45.580 --> 35:49.900
to realize that even if I think A and you think B, that doesn't mean that you're stupid

35:49.900 --> 35:55.460
or I'm evil. We may just have equally tenable views, or I may think minus slightly more

35:55.460 --> 35:59.180
tenable, but it doesn't make you wrong or stupid because you disagree. There's plenty

35:59.180 --> 36:03.620
of room for disagreement short of logical demonstration. And Hume's point is that the

36:03.620 --> 36:08.100
vast bulk of what's important to us is short of logical demonstration, therefore the ultimate

36:08.500 --> 36:14.300
virtue that we must have is toleration, is to learn to be open-minded, especially with

36:14.300 --> 36:21.300
people we disagree with, to overcome our tendency towards dogmatism. And I don't think it's

36:24.660 --> 36:31.660
coincidental that Hume speaks of those he thinks are worst in the dogmatism. And he

36:32.540 --> 36:39.540
says, if any of the learned, if we're speaking of university professors, if any of the learned

36:42.300 --> 36:48.200
be inclined from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tainture of

36:48.200 --> 36:54.260
parentism, skepticism, might abate their pride by showing them that the few advantages which

36:54.260 --> 36:59.100
they may have attained over their fellows are but inconsiderable if compared with the

36:59.100 --> 37:04.760
universal perplexity and confusion which is inherent in human nature. In general, there

37:04.760 --> 37:11.680
is a degree of doubt and caution and monesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision

37:11.680 --> 37:18.680
ought forever to accompany a just reason. And I can't help feeling that that is in

37:19.020 --> 37:23.820
fact the ultimately most fruitful project of the Enlightenment, and Hume represents

37:23.820 --> 37:28.320
it, the critique of dogmatism, which he associated with rationalism. He associated with the

37:28.340 --> 37:35.340
continental tradition, is the critique of the tendency to pound the desk. And certainly

37:36.060 --> 37:39.620
we've seen that, and we'll see it in subsequent thinkers, philosophers who tells everyone

37:39.620 --> 37:45.300
before me was an idiot. All the people who disagree with me are swine. And Hume's

37:45.300 --> 37:52.300
deep point is that nowhere is that more prevalent than among people with PhDs. They are probably

37:52.440 --> 37:59.040
the most dogmatic people on the planet. And Hume, I think, is actually angry. His view

37:59.040 --> 38:05.160
is of all the people in the world, they are the least excusable for that. For if they

38:05.160 --> 38:09.820
could think their way out of a paper bag, they would realize they can't be sure about

38:09.820 --> 38:14.820
almost any of their beliefs except for mathematics and logic. Aside from that, everything is

38:14.820 --> 38:19.760
provisional. Then how dare they, and I think what he's really concerned about is not just

38:19.820 --> 38:26.020
blackballing young professors, as we found happened during the McCarthy period, but also

38:26.020 --> 38:31.820
something worse, perhaps the pedagogical equivalent of eating one's young, telling

38:31.820 --> 38:36.380
your students that, well, this is the truth, I'm teaching you now. I know you'll read

38:36.380 --> 38:40.380
other books, but they're wrong. My opinions, those are the important ones, and I can prove

38:40.380 --> 38:46.620
it all. And that's what Hume distains. The life of the mind, the life of education, should

38:46.640 --> 38:52.480
be cheerful, should be happy, should be open-minded, should be playful, there's nothing very serious

38:52.480 --> 38:56.920
going on here, there's nothing crucial worth killing one another over, or denouncing one

38:56.920 --> 39:01.480
another over. We should enjoy ourselves, it should be light, it should be open-minded,

39:01.480 --> 39:08.480
it should be just and moderate. I think from this you will get a sense that for all of

39:09.480 --> 39:16.480
his agnosticism, Hume is in his own way, perhaps the most vocal expression of Jobian secularism.

39:19.480 --> 39:26.480
He in a way does have that Augustinian strain of humility and of piety, and yet he's completely

39:27.480 --> 39:33.080
secular. I think that's what's intriguing about that tradition, which very much diffuses

39:33.080 --> 39:40.080
in the Anglo-American world, is once it becomes secularized, that sort of metaphysical posture

39:40.240 --> 39:45.480
has a certain charm and endearing value to it. It is the first time, it is only from

39:45.480 --> 39:51.880
that perspective that tolerance, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion, can actually be

39:51.880 --> 39:58.080
seen as a virtue. I should point out that Hume dies in 1776, the year of the American

39:58.080 --> 40:04.440
Revolution. America does enact freedom of belief, freedom of speech, but not as a positive

40:04.440 --> 40:09.440
good. I mean, most Americans had done it because they had no choice. There were too many sects

40:09.440 --> 40:14.760
in North America to maintain an orthodoxy, and so it was a marriage of convenience, they

40:14.760 --> 40:20.320
were forced to allow freedom of belief. In fact, it didn't always obtain everywhere.

40:20.320 --> 40:25.380
Massachusetts retained an established church until the 1830s, as did Connecticut, as did

40:25.380 --> 40:30.620
several colonies. It was only with Hume that he begins to say that's not a necessary evil

40:30.620 --> 40:35.340
at all, that's the essence of the good life. There's nothing so serious in those churches

40:35.340 --> 40:40.820
that can't be laughed at occasionally, and there's nothing so serious about my own work

40:40.820 --> 40:46.220
that can't be laughed at, and in fact should be laughed at. If you want to know really

40:46.220 --> 40:53.220
moral insight about the world, it's not philosophy texts. Maybe it's history, Hume became an historian,

40:53.460 --> 40:56.980
that's one of the other reasons I know he's such a wise man. He realized what was really

40:56.980 --> 41:03.820
important. Finally, I want to offer one more reason I think that this Humean liberation,

41:03.820 --> 41:08.860
critique of dogmatism and rationalism is so valuable for us, and it's because it's something

41:08.860 --> 41:15.060
philosophers call reflexive. It can be used upon itself. Hume ends his work with a bit

41:15.060 --> 41:22.060
of spleen at the rationalist and scholastic tradition that he felt was oppressive. He

41:22.860 --> 41:27.620
says, once we know that the only sort of knowledge you can have, that's certain, demonstratively

41:27.620 --> 41:34.620
certain, is logic and mathematics, or matters of fact evidence based on experience, when

41:36.460 --> 41:41.900
we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our

41:41.900 --> 41:47.460
hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us ask, does it contain

41:47.540 --> 41:54.540
any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental

41:54.540 --> 42:01.040
reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Committed to bend to the flames, for

42:01.040 --> 42:08.040
it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. How would we reflectively apply Hume to Hume?

42:09.620 --> 42:14.300
We would point out, Dave, there's more to religion than that. Religion gives people

42:14.740 --> 42:21.740
spiritual solace. If people need what William James called moral holidays or cosmological

42:21.780 --> 42:28.780
holidays, why deny them? As long as they're not dogmatic, why should you be dogmatic?

42:28.780 --> 42:34.660
And I think that is ultimately when that Humean ethos hits the United States in the late 19th

42:34.660 --> 42:40.100
century and gets its ultimate clarification on William James, that is exactly where it

42:41.020 --> 42:46.100
Hume has turned against himself to say, look, you too must be tolerant of people who believe

42:46.100 --> 42:51.420
in religion and in Christianity. It has its value for those people, and you must be open-minded.
