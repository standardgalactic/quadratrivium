1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,900
Music

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:33,300
David Hume is, in many ways, one of the most important, and I would urge, attractive figures

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:43,100
in the Western philosophical tradition, a man of great wit, affability, charm.

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,620
Hume was, by all who knew him, regarded as a admirable person, a pleasant person, a man

5
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,580
who had very few arguments in his life, was very difficult to ever race his temper, he

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,140
only once became angry, apparently, and that was against Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had

7
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,140
stated his house and accused Hume of stealing his ideas.

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,820
If any of you have read Rousseau and read Hume, you know that's a sign of Rousseau's

9
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,100
paranoid insanity.

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,540
Hume and Rousseau could not be more entirely apart in their views.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:24,580
Nonetheless, given this about Hume, he was, in his own lifetime, a remarkably obscure

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:31,100
philosophical figure, and this was largely the result of, one, the very skeptical nature

13
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:39,180
of his conclusions, he was thought to be very dreary and uninspiring, and the rather technical

14
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,900
precision of his arguments, he was a very difficult writer, he didn't inspire people.

15
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,380
I will argue that Hume has an inspirational side, but it's very much in keeping with

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,660
his character, it's very dry, it's very a dour sort of inspiration.

17
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,260
In fact, as a way of illustrating the way people misconceive Hume, when I first read

18
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,940
Hume in college, I immediately assumed, because he's an incredibly powerful and accurate

19
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,860
analytic thinker, that I had a mental picture of the fellow as a very thin, wiry, school

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,780
marmish professor, very, very accurate and precise, in fact, the very picture of Immanuel

21
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:26,540
Kant, I was much surprised to learn that, in fact, he was a large, robust, rotund Scotsman

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,820
with a heavy, heavy brogue, who could always be counted on for a good joke, a pint of ale

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,380
and a leg of mutton, he was very much a laughing philosopher.

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,620
In many ways, is one of the most challenging figures in the philosophic tradition up to

25
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,460
this point.

26
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,220
The only one I could compare him to in this regard is Spinoza, you remember that Spinoza

27
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,260
was challenging in that he was the first complete rejecter of the Judeo-Christian ethic, completely

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,620
rejected the notion of the immortality of the soul, of freedom of the will, and we will

29
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,340
find Hume shares those beliefs, also his skeptical Judeo-Christian tradition.

30
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,700
In a way, he's far more damaging and challenging than Spinoza, whereas Spinoza is disgusted

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,780
with that tradition and finds it a name, Hume, as is his want, is amused by it, he thinks

32
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,540
it's absolutely hilarious that there are people who go to church, he thinks it's wonderful,

33
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,800
he thinks it's the absolute quote, these knees that people believe that somehow they're

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,060
not animals, and he thinks this is just part of the good sport of life, that there are

35
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,820
people out there who really believe such absurd things, and he does not want to dissuade them

36
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:50,620
in any sense, he rather wants to laugh with his small group of esoteric insiders, as it

37
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,100
were.

38
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,260
Hume's historical significance is that he brought to full fruition the empiricist epistemology

39
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,100
and a phenomenology that really begins with Hobbes, matures with Locke, as we saw, is developed

40
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,780
by Barclay, Hume in a certain way brings it to a close.

41
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,740
He takes it to its logical extremes, to its point of logical conclusion, and sort of ties

42
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,740
it up with a very nice bow.

43
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:26,140
Although he never made much great fame in his lifetime, afterwards he has become one

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,620
of the most important philosophers in the tradition.

45
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,900
He had a profound effect on a certain Prussian philosopher by the name of Immanuel Kant,

46
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,500
who claims, I read David Hume, he awoke me from my dogmatic slumbers.

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,620
Kant claimed that Hume was, and I think one could say in defense of Kant, that Kant was

48
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,340
the only one who understood Hume in the 18th century with the possible exception of Adam

49
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Smith.

50
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,940
He was the only one who realized that this incredibly dry, dull, boring Scotsman is in

51
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,780
fact a wild man and is in fact on to the deepest critique of the philosophical tradition we

52
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,060
have found yet.

53
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,620
Since then, Hume has become a source of inspiration for utilitarian ethics in the 19th century.

54
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,620
We'll see the logical positivist movement of the 19th century, figures like Karnath,

55
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,580
Schick, Ayer, Wittgenstein, all claim that their ancestry runs to David Hume.

56
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,940
He's become an incredibly important thinker after his death.

57
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,940
I would urge he was strongly ahead of his time.

58
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,540
Okay, enough sort of background on Hume.

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,940
Let's then begin with his empiricist phenomenology.

60
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,620
Hume, like Barkley and Locke before him, recognized that all of our mental representations can

61
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,740
be divided into two classes.

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,180
On the one hand are impressions, and on the other hand are ideas.

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:00,420
Now, Hume is aware that, in fact, beyond aware, Hume's perhaps biggest project as a philosopher

64
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,260
is the avoidance of dogmatism.

65
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,380
And so he's aware that it would be dogmatic to say that our impressions are the result

66
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,980
of sense-statem.

67
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,860
He wants to suggest that that's provisionally the case, and that's what we seem to believe

68
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
in common sense.

69
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,540
And Hume, by the way, is a great partisan of common sense.

70
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,700
Presumably then let us say that our impressions are the results of sense-statem, but actually

71
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,540
the way we distinguish between those and our ideas, copies of impressions, is by their

72
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,540
vivacity.

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,380
Again, by that phenomenological property.

74
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,860
Your visual representation of me, when you look at me, is far more powerful and profound

75
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,140
and sharp than is, say, your recollection of what I looked like.

76
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,540
There's far more detail in the first class.

77
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,780
So that's the first class of our mental representations, impressions, distinguished

78
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,220
by their greater vivacity.

79
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,140
The second class are ideas or thoughts, and these are distinguished by their relative

80
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,540
lack of force and internal clarity.

81
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Presumably, there are copies of impressions.

82
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,500
Again, your notion of your mental representation of me when you close your eyes is a copy of

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,740
your actual sense-datum of me, presumably.

84
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,260
And in fact, there's another mark to suggest that one is the copy of the other, the process

85
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,500
of temporal sequence.

86
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,780
You never have an idea of what I look like or image of me before you've actually seen

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
me.

88
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,580
If anything, your ideas follow your impressions, and that temporal sequence is a mark of copying

89
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,580
or causality.

90
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,460
Okay, now, Hume argued, or claimed, rather, I should say, on the basis of an introspective

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,460
and scientific observation, that there were only three principles with which the mind

92
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,620
associated the various ideas, not impressions, but ideas that it entertains.

93
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,820
And again, I want to be clear about something about Hume.

94
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,100
Hume is not arguing for any foundational view of the human mind.

95
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,980
He claimed to be the Newton of the moral sciences.

96
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,140
He was going to establish his philosophy on the basis of scientific observation.

97
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,580
He says, from his introspective scientific observation of his own cognitive states, there

98
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,860
are only three principles that associate the various ideas or images we have in the show

99
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,380
between our ears.

100
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,580
And the first of those is, of course, resemblance.

101
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Right?

102
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,420
We say that the representation you have of me now strongly resembles the representation

103
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,860
you had of me when I was giving perchance to my Markley lecture.

104
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,860
And certain strength of resemblance leads one to posit identity, right?

105
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,140
But similarly, short of identity, we may say, there is a stronger resemblance between my

106
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,500
appearance and some other member of the audience's appearance than either of our appearance towards,

107
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,260
say, this lectern.

108
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,460
And therefore, we see how we form elementary set theory and elementary sorts of kinds.

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,500
There's a stronger, again, resemblance between the idea of me and any of you than between

110
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,860
myself and the lectern.

111
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,420
That's the first principle of association.

112
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,380
The second is contiguity, right?

113
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,900
All of our ideas can be related in terms of their spatial relationships or temporal relationships.

114
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,860
So I am, from my perspective, to the right of the lectern presently and behind it.

115
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,020
Now I'm to the left of the lectern and behind it, again, from my perspective.

116
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,700
Similarly, the sentences I am pronouncing now follow the sentences I pronounced, say,

117
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,860
some one minute ago.

118
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,700
So all of those representations fit into, as it were, spatial configuration and temporal

119
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
configuration.

120
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,940
That's the other principle, contiguity.

121
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,260
Now we get to the third and far and away, the most important.

122
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,540
And that has caused an effect, right?

123
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,540
You see me release the watch.

124
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,340
You see the effect of it falling.

125
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,500
You attribute a causal agency.

126
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Okay.

127
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,220
Now, we have all the principles of association.

128
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,900
Let's now talk about our knowledge.

129
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,660
And again, that can be broken down into one of two classes.

130
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,220
The first class deals with the relations between ideas in a purely formal sense.

131
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,460
A human such knowledge is either intuitively certain or, if not, it is demonstrable.

132
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,580
Okay.

133
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,020
So what would be examples?

134
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:44,980
The common examples are the propositions of mathematics, geometry, algebra, formula logic.

135
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,180
Are all cases with the association where the truth of the sentences hinges on the relation

136
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,460
between the ideas and that relationship is purely formal.

137
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:03,420
In other words, a computer can formulate true mathematical or logical propositions.

138
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:10,740
The key for Hume is that such propositions have absolutely no existential implications.

139
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,540
We can accept all of Euclidean geometry as being true.

140
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,580
Every proposition, provable in the Euclidean geometry, we can accept is true without there

141
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,900
existing such a thing as a triangle.

142
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,380
Similarly, we can accept all the propositions as logic as true without believing that there

143
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:33,060
exists somewhere in the world a operator called the conditional or the disjunctive.

144
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,140
So that's a key point that that first class of knowledge, the relation between ideas is

145
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,060
purely formal and has no existential implications.

146
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,300
It teaches us nothing about the world, it only teaches us, as it were, a very rigorous

147
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,780
sort of vocabulary that we might be able to use in talking about the world.

148
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,100
In and of itself has nothing to say about existence and things of the world.

149
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:04,660
Things of the world are discussed in that second class of knowledge, which he calls

150
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,180
matters of fact.

151
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,220
Those propositions which concern existential statements are statements of fact.

152
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,860
The first thing to note is that there is no logical basis for all of our knowledge of

153
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,740
fact.

154
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,940
And how do we know that?

155
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,660
Because counterfactuals are all possible, which is to say, it is a fact that if I release

156
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,980
this watch, it will fall.

157
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,500
But it is entirely logically possible that if I release this watch, it would float up

158
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,020
to heaven.

159
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,940
It never has, right?

160
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,340
I've never observed that myself, but there is nothing that logically constrains this

161
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,140
watch to either fall down or not to simply remain sustained in the air.

162
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,940
If I was the amazing Kresge or something, I could do such a trick.

163
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:56,140
But this point is, since counterfactuals are all logically possible, right, then there

164
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,460
is no logical basis for knowledge of matters of fact.

165
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,700
Well, then that raises, for Hume, the critical epistemological question.

166
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,860
How do we know matters of fact?

167
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,500
Specifically, how do we know any matters of fact other than that which you are presently

168
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,820
sensing, right?

169
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,660
So you have good sensual evidence to believe that I am up here walking around.

170
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:29,940
But how do you know, for example, that I really was here earlier talking about Barclay?

171
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
How can you infer that?

172
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,380
How do you know that if you leave this room, this podium will still be here?

173
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,940
Oh, this lectern, I should say.

174
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,700
And Hume says that the answer is the principle of cause and effect, right?

175
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,020
You see my contiguity moving over from an earlier lecture to this one, and you assume

176
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,900
that there's one agent who is causing all of these changes, similarly with the lectern.

177
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,840
You assume that unless something comes in to move it, its inertial force will make it

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
remain here.

179
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,980
So the only way you can argue beyond your present sense datum is the fact that there

180
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,780
is a world outside, that there are lights above you producing heat and light, is because

181
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,100
of the principle of cause and effect.

182
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,100
It's the fundamental glue, as it were, epistemological glue of the factual world, because it allows

183
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,620
us to infer from sense to uncensed phenomena.

184
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,260
Now cause and effect is not known what we might call a priori, or before the fact, or

185
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,140
before experience.

186
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,740
Rather, it only comes from the experience of constant conjunction.

187
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,700
So again, back to our great experiment.

188
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,340
You did not know before you ever saw someone release an object that it would fall.

189
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,580
The only way you know that is that every time you've seen an object released, it falls.

190
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,980
That constant conjunction, release, fall, release, fall, is the only evidence you have

191
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,220
of that causal relation, and similarly it is with all the other causal relations.

192
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,540
The only way you know that eating a cheeseburger will satisfy you when you're hungry, if in

193
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,740
fact it does, is because that's happened in the past.

194
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,700
It is entirely conceivable that you can eat a cheeseburger and be three times as hungry

195
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,860
afterwards as before.

196
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,620
It doesn't happen that way because of the nature of our constant conjunctions and experience,

197
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,540
but all of our causal laws are just that.

198
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,020
We see regularity, constant conjunction, and from that we infer a causal relation.

199
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,820
Well, the implications for science, therefore, are very important.

200
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,700
If science gives us causal explanations, all it does in a way to use the metaphor from

201
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,140
the right stuff is it pushes back at the envelope of ignorance.

202
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,900
So when we learn the causal law, what causes this watch to fall, well, I release it.

203
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,540
What causes it to accelerate at the rate it does, the laws of gravity.

204
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,900
What causes the laws of gravity beats me.

205
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
We don't know yet.

206
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Perhaps we will someday.

207
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,940
Perhaps Grand Unified Theory will supply the explanation, but all you do is you push

208
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,380
back that envelope of ignorance one step further.

209
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,140
That's an important empiricist and humane point, is that science never offers absolute

210
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,300
truth.

211
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,500
It's provisional truth, constantly subject to revision on the basis of new experience

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:24,980
and new formulation.

213
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,260
Back to our big epistemological fish we want to fry.

214
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,140
Given that all our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, and that

215
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,340
cause and effect is in turn based on experience, the experience of conscious and conjunctions,

216
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,100
what warrants our belief and experience, right?

217
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,060
Well, it can't be reason, can it, or logic.

218
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,660
That can't warrant our belief and experience, for it's logically possible that the future

219
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,900
won't resemble the past, right?

220
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,340
It's entirely possible that in 15 minutes from now God will so change the universe that

221
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,500
whenever you release a watch it will float up to heaven, or it will remain suspended.

222
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,380
You have no logical evidence to suggest that that won't happen.

223
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,260
All you have is your past experience, right, and your present experience.

224
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,580
So clearly experience, which is the judgment that the future in fact will resemble the

225
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,780
present, can't be based on reason.

226
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,260
And by the way I should point out, you could also make that argument retrospectively, as

227
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,780
Bertrand Russell does.

228
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,980
How do we know the past is not different from the present?

229
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,700
How do we in fact know that once upon a time the sun really didn't move around the earth

230
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,860
and that the Bible didn't have it right and things have changed since then?

231
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,620
And that's the puzzle that Cune feels is the critical epistemological puzzle that has to

232
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,500
be solved.

233
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,260
And clearly we do not have any recourse to logic or reason in answering this question.

234
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,300
Well, you can't base experience on cause and effect for the obvious reason that cause

235
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,940
and effect is based on experience, right?

236
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,460
Our belief in causal laws is based on our experience of constant conjunction, so you

237
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,740
can't use those causal laws then circularly to support the belief that the future will

238
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,900
resemble the present or the past, because of course causal laws presuppose that resemblance.

239
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,340
This Hume luxuriates in this riddle for a while because he has a very obvious answer

240
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,340
and an answer which is going to offend all of the high-brow intellectuals of Europe.

241
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,980
Why do we believe in cause and effect?

242
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,420
It's a habit, it's a custom, no rational basis for it whatsoever.

243
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,780
It's not reason that teaches us cause and effect, it's instinct.

244
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,580
You can't dispense with believing in causal laws as you go about the world.

245
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,020
When you get hungry or you're going to say, well, I'm not going to eat for three days,

246
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,520
that will fill me up.

247
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,020
It's habitual to believe that as cheeseburgers did me good before, they'll do me well again.

248
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,620
So the point is there's something extra-rational which orients our behavior and understanding

249
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,100
of the physical world.

250
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,580
It is irrational to believe in experience that the future will resemble the present,

251
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,380
but it's customary and it's in fact inescapable in practical life.

252
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,700
And sense knows better than philosophic insight.

253
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,180
So experience then is warranted by a sort of natural instinct instead of a rational proof.

254
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:34,060
How can we in fact argue that pervasively?

255
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:41,620
The first thing he points out is, notice simpletons, children, animals all follow causal laws,

256
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
don't they?

257
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Right?

258
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,620
You've all heard the experiment of Pavlov's dog, but can children, simpletons, and animals

259
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,540
do logical proofs?

260
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,100
They are all able to observe causal laws and clearly can't rationally demonstrate anything.

261
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,380
All right?

262
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,740
So the implication is it must be some sort of instinctual response.

263
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,900
Okay, if all of our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, right?

264
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:17,060
And all matters of cause and effect is based on experience, what is the origin of the roughly

265
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,740
interchangeable metaphysical doctrines of power, force, and necessary connection?

266
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,860
Well, he points out, first of all, there's no logical doctrine of necessary connections

267
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,740
in the world because as we've seen before, logical proofs have no existential implications.

268
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Right?

269
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,300
So if we want to argue that there is force in the world, we can't do so on a logical

270
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
basis.

271
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,740
Also, force, necessary connection, can't arise from sense.

272
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,660
I mean, what color is a necessary connection?

273
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,220
What flavor is it?

274
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,940
When do you actually experience a necessary connection?

275
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,660
And he's careful to point out some of the errors that in fact later thinkers will think

276
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,980
are profound proofs of it.

277
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,100
Tolstoy made a lot out of it, he said, you want to show, you want me to show you force?

278
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Look.

279
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Right?

280
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,100
And it's up, force, and he says, no, no, no.

281
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,620
That's in fact the experience of constant conjunction.

282
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,540
Every time you desire to lift your arm, it's gone up.

283
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
You want to do the proof?

284
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,100
Want me to prove it to you?

285
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,380
We'll see if we can't give you palsy somehow.

286
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,660
And you'll sit there for the next three hours and try and lift your arm and it won't go

287
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
up.

288
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Where'd the force go?

289
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,220
Where'd the necessary connection go?

290
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Must have disappeared.

291
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Maybe God intervened.

292
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,460
So he points out that in fact all of your sense of physical force in controlling your

293
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,580
bodily actions are entirely on the basis of the constant conjunction you've had between

294
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,060
your will and the movement of your body.

295
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,500
And there are times when you'll be in deliriums or sick when you won't be able to move them

296
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,260
and you'll try and you'll fail.

297
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,060
Okay, so then Hugh answers this question finally.

298
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,540
Necessary connection, force, energy, all those metaphysical doctrines, they're just powerful

299
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,300
psychological conditions.

300
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,580
You've seen constant conjunctions which are so constant and so sure that your mind just

301
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,620
leaves the next step and says, well, it's necessary, can't be avoided, but it's just

302
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,580
a psychological phenomena.

303
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,340
In fact, since all ideas have their origin and sense, if there's no sensual basis for

304
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,700
an idea, we can say as a fact that there is no, that the notion itself is a chimera,

305
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,900
right, is a myth, is a fantasy.

306
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,500
And here is where we turn of course to Barclay's, Hugh's discussion of Barclay.

307
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,620
All right, Barclay has said, well, when do we experience matter, the most sensual experience

308
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,860
of matter, and Hugh in his wonderful sense of what says, well, of course you're right.

309
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,700
As a brilliant criticism by Barclay, we never do experience matter.

310
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,220
Now, what color was a mind again, and what flavor is your mind?

311
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,500
What does it taste like?

312
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,860
We never experienced a mind either.

313
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,700
Well, in that case, if you want to get rid of matter, fine, but we'll throw a mind out

314
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
with it too.

315
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,580
And then all that there'll be in our universe is one damn thing after another, right?

316
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,460
We just have one representation after another, no mind to hold them, no matter to project

317
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
them.

318
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,300
And Hugh, of course, is happy with that answer, because his point is that our belief in matter

319
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:25,740
and our belief in mind isn't a result of metaphysical speculation, it's life, right?

320
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,500
It's a common sense intuition, and common sense is more than functional for getting

321
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,740
us through the world.

322
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:40,580
Okay, then Hugh moves on to the discussion of freedom or liberty and necessity.

323
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,900
And again, Hugh, the peacemaker, argues quite controversially, you know, no one's ever really

324
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,340
disagreed about this.

325
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,340
People think they disagreed, but they didn't.

326
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,780
The more you think about it, all reasonable people know that necessity and causation,

327
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,260
which are the essence of determinism, are simply the experience of constant conjunctions

328
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,420
and the belief that the future will resemble the past.

329
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,580
And that's natural to all animals, or all higher animals, right?

330
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,340
And if you've got that, you're happy with determinism.

331
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,540
The other side, liberty, is simply the absence of external restraint.

332
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:19,220
No one's tying you down, you are free to stand up and leave at any moment.

333
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,020
Liberty then has nothing to do with some abstruse doctrine of a free and uncaused will, and it's

334
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,980
perfectly consistent with the causally-determined universe.

335
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,140
So we have liberty, hopefully, if we have libertarian governments, and we have determinism, and

336
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,380
that certainly all of our actions follow causal laws.

337
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:44,100
In fact, he says, if our actions had no causal laws, right, if our actions were not a result

338
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,660
or caused by our character, then we would have no basis for moral evaluation, for punishment

339
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
or blame.

340
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,660
And consider, if I was, at this moment, to pull out a gun and shoot someone in this audience,

341
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,500
Hume says, you must believe that that was caused by the nature of my character.

342
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,260
If you don't, you think that was a truly free act, that is to say uncaused, then it is spontaneous.

343
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,500
There's no reason for you to believe that I would ever do that again, since nothing

344
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
caused me to do it.

345
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,620
I did it once, maybe I won't do it again.

346
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,500
So then why in heaven's name would you bother to punish me?

347
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Right?

348
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,780
You certainly won't deter me from doing it again, I'm not caused to do it, you just

349
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,700
point out to me, we wish you wouldn't do that, and then we cart the body off and I go on

350
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
with my lecture.

351
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,300
Hume says, of course it's not that way, if I pulled out a gun you would infer from that

352
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,780
that I'm some sort of psychopathic maniac, and that it's on the basis of that causal

353
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,940
connection between psychopathic maniacism and shooting members of an audience that you

354
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,740
are going to grab a pair of handcuffs and drag me out of here.

355
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,340
And if you didn't believe there was that causal relation, then punishment would only be an

356
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,420
act of bizarre vengeance.

357
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,860
So we obviously believe in that sort of causal law in action, and in fact it's demonstrated

358
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,460
in our interactions with our friends.

359
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,420
Francis, we know what our friends are going to do, if I put my hand out he's going to

360
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,180
grab it and shake it, if I ask him how he is he's not going to spit in my eye, I know

361
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,260
it fell nice enough, he's going to give me a stock answer, fine, how are you?

362
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:22,500
There's no surprises there, and Hume of course has a wonderful little joke, he says, everyone

363
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,700
believes in causal determinacy and behavior and practice, it's only in theory they don't.

364
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,100
Go by, well he talks about Sharon Cross, but let's say Times Square in New York City.

365
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,140
So to anyone, have you ever noticed that people don't go by Times Square, take out their wallet

366
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,140
and stick it in the middle of the ground, and walk away and say, I'll come back for

367
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,180
that in an hour?

368
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,700
For some reason or other they seem to think that people will be costly determined to pick

369
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,220
it up and take the funny green paper out, and Hume says the fact that no one does that

370
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,700
proves that everyone believes in causal determinacy, and that if you put your wallet in the middle

371
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,020
of Times Square and came back for it an hour later, you wouldn't find it, and we all feel

372
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,180
fairly certain of that.

373
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:11,300
Now Hume now turns to, in his discussion of the inquiry concerning human understanding,

374
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,900
for what I would call sort of payback, Hume was a remarkable prodigy in his youth, wrote

375
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:24,260
a fantastic book at I think the age of 24, called The Treatise Concerning Human Nature,

376
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,940
and applied for a position teaching pneumatic philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,

377
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:38,940
and was blackballed by the Scottish Calvinist clergy because of his agnosticism.

378
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,620
I think that profoundly affected Hume's beliefs ever since and his motivations in philosophy,

379
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,540
but he certainly realized that the best way of getting back was not to denounce or scream

380
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:56,540
or be angry, but to laugh, to joke, and that raises his discussion of miracles. He says,

381
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,620
let's first define what do we mean by a miracle? A miracle is simply by definition a violation

382
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,900
of the rules of nature, of the laws of nature, which are established through the sum of human

383
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,220
experience, through the sum of our observed constant conjunctions. So miracles are that

384
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,740
which there is no rational basis to believe in. That's the definition of a miracle, something

385
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,700
which is incredibly irrational to believe in.

386
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,580
He says, well, notice something. Have you ever noticed how there are very few miracles

387
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:31,580
that occur in Times Square? Very few miracles occur in the White House or in NASA labs.

388
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Most miracles seem to occur among very primitive peoples and in very barbaric situations. We

389
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,880
have our Lady of Guadalupe, but we don't seem to have our Lady of Cambridge. It's one thing

390
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,880
to make you sort of suspicious about miracles to begin with. Then he goes on to, however,

391
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:01,540
say something, which raises the relationship between something called exoterica and esoterica.

392
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,340
It's one of the forms of free thinking and lightened humor. There is, however, a deep

393
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,900
philosophic point to that. There's a deep philosophic point to the laughter itself. What is the

394
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:19,900
only thing you can't laugh at? The sacred. Everything else can be laughed at. In effect

395
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:27,260
then, by laughing at everything, humans desacralizing everything. Everything is worthy of laughter.

396
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Everything is a jest. And that, he thinks, is a means of human liberation.

397
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,180
Okay. I've gone through skepticism. I should point out one of his interesting arguments

398
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,300
about religion that comes up. He has a mock dialogue in the text with a Epicurean who

399
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,100
says, well, actually, morality has nothing to do with religion. We could all be atheists

400
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,900
and we would still be just as moral as we were before. There's no logical basis from

401
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,380
which you can go to a belief in a God, to moral behavior. And Hume says, I think quite

402
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:03,420
wisely, sir, I would acknowledge you to be a just reasoner, but not a good citizen. You

403
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,700
say that because there is no logical reason or argument from the belief in God to moral

404
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,200
behavior, that in fact no one actually makes that leap from belief in God to moral behavior.

405
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,620
But of course, most people aren't very good reasoners. There are a lot of people who do

406
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,640
believe in God and it restrains them from the most hideous acts. And therefore, I would

407
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,800
account you a very bad citizen for speaking that argument publicly. And that, I think,

408
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,280
is Hume's considered view. He does not believe in God. He doesn't believe in religion. He

409
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,840
thinks it's absolutely laughable, but he would be extremely upset if anyone were attempt

410
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,560
to argue against it publicly. Right. If there are people who would go out there and commit

411
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,360
hideous crimes if they didn't believe in God, best to keep those sheep in line and stop

412
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,120
them from becoming wolves. And it's very much again that exoteric, esoteric notion. There's

413
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,760
a small circle of people who are mature enough and responsible enough to realize that even

414
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,400
if God does not exist, they still have moral duties and responsibilities. For those who

415
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,840
do not realize that it's simple, the best thing is to keep your mouth shut and not tell

416
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,840
them anything. All right. We're left, however, with a certain amount of skepticism from Hume.

417
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,760
And Hume is quite direct about skepticism. He says, if we take the Cartesian problematic

418
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,520
seriously and doubt our faculties, there is no way to think your way out of a paper bag.

419
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,800
If you doubt your faculties, there's no solution to skepticism. And in fact, skepticism is

420
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,800
not ever logically refutable. It is entirely logical, logically possible that each and every

421
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,440
one of you are the only thing in existence in the universe. And everything else is just

422
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,440
a dream or delusion. Well, how then do you refute skepticism? And this assumes brilliant

423
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,440
answer. You certainly don't do it philosophically. How do you do it? You get hungry. You may

424
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
think you're the only thing in the universe, but when you get hungry, you will go out for

425
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,920
a cheeseburger and a Coke. Practical life is the solution to skepticism. It has no practical

426
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,240
consequences. Why would anyone ever believe in such a doctrine? So skepticism is refuted

427
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,920
by common life, and that's the Humean Scottish School of Common Sense. You want to know how

428
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,160
to answer these questions, not through abstract reason, through life. What's the point of

429
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,760
believing you're the only one in the world? It's awfully lonely. Wouldn't it be better

430
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,320
off to, wouldn't we all be better off to believe we're each other there? Isn't it practically

431
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,600
more fulfilling and hence the importance of practical life?

432
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Okay. Well, if that extreme skepticism then is simply a joke, and Hume does in fact think

433
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,360
it is. He has a wonderful little passage where he says that our skeptic, who doubts his own

434
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,000
existence, is like a dreamer. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join

435
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,760
in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement

436
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,280
and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind a most

437
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,240
act and reason and believe, though they are not able by their most diligent inquiry to

438
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,640
satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections

439
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,040
which may be raised against them. What's important about that passage is he's saying,

440
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,760
skepticism, right, is irrefutable except for practical life, at which point you realize

441
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,280
that all skepticism is just a joke. It's just a sort of a very dry sense of humor.

442
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,520
What have we read so far in this book? It is filled with skepticism. What kind of a book

443
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,600
is this? This is a joke book, Hume is saying. There's nothing serious in this book. Read

444
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,120
this and laugh. That's what you should get out of philosophy. It's a lot of fun. It's

445
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,120
like playing chess. Nothing hangs on it. What hangs on life? Good mutton, good ale, good

446
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,760
fellowship, good humor. That's what's important in life. This, if I've amused you for 30

447
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,080
minutes, wonderful. You've gotten more than enough out of philosophy. That's all you could

448
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,880
get out of it. But then he does get serious. He says there, however, there is a lesson

449
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,880
to be drawn. Not from an extreme skepticism, but from a moderate skepticism. And this comes

450
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,080
back to his own personal history. And this is where I think Hume's ultimately most liberating

451
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:22,080
project and one of the reasons why he still speaks to us today. He tells us that the great

452
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:29,540
majority of mankind have a tendency to be rather certain of their opinions. They tend

453
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,360
to believe that what they believe is absolutely certain and true. What other people believe

454
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:47,120
is insane and evil. And yet we can't even know, we can't even show any logical basis

455
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,280
for our belief in cause and effect. So then what do we call that nature of belief? Dogmatism.

456
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,680
And that is the Humean project. What do you do with skepticism? When you find some dogmatic

457
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,360
thinker who tells you, well, the world is really mind and matter, or someone else says,

458
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,360
no, it isn't, it's just matter. You sit them down and you give them a wee, small tincture

459
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,560
of fear. A wee, small tincture of skepticism. And from that, hopefully they'll learn a little

460
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,960
bit about, quote, hubris. Before they blackball someone from a university, because he doesn't

461
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,240
believe in the right version of Calvinism, he pointed out to him how impossible it is

462
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,080
to demonstrate Calvinism in the first place. And maybe they'll be a little more open-minded.

463
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,480
I think this is a topic which is very germane, not only for our culture and society, but

464
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,980
for our high culture today as well, and academy. I think it's important for us to realize that

465
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,580
Hume is right. The point of skepticism is to teach us to be a little bit less dogmatic,

466
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,900
to realize that even if I think A and you think B, that doesn't mean that you're stupid

467
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,460
or I'm evil. We may just have equally tenable views, or I may think minus slightly more

468
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,180
tenable, but it doesn't make you wrong or stupid because you disagree. There's plenty

469
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,620
of room for disagreement short of logical demonstration. And Hume's point is that the

470
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,100
vast bulk of what's important to us is short of logical demonstration, therefore the ultimate

471
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,300
virtue that we must have is toleration, is to learn to be open-minded, especially with

472
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,300
people we disagree with, to overcome our tendency towards dogmatism. And I don't think it's

473
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,660
coincidental that Hume speaks of those he thinks are worst in the dogmatism. And he

474
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:39,540
says, if any of the learned, if we're speaking of university professors, if any of the learned

475
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,200
be inclined from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tainture of

476
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,260
parentism, skepticism, might abate their pride by showing them that the few advantages which

477
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,100
they may have attained over their fellows are but inconsiderable if compared with the

478
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,760
universal perplexity and confusion which is inherent in human nature. In general, there

479
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,680
is a degree of doubt and caution and monesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision

480
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,680
ought forever to accompany a just reason. And I can't help feeling that that is in

481
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,820
fact the ultimately most fruitful project of the Enlightenment, and Hume represents

482
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,320
it, the critique of dogmatism, which he associated with rationalism. He associated with the

483
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:35,340
continental tradition, is the critique of the tendency to pound the desk. And certainly

484
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,620
we've seen that, and we'll see it in subsequent thinkers, philosophers who tells everyone

485
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:45,300
before me was an idiot. All the people who disagree with me are swine. And Hume's

486
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,300
deep point is that nowhere is that more prevalent than among people with PhDs. They are probably

487
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:59,040
the most dogmatic people on the planet. And Hume, I think, is actually angry. His view

488
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,160
is of all the people in the world, they are the least excusable for that. For if they

489
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,820
could think their way out of a paper bag, they would realize they can't be sure about

490
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,820
almost any of their beliefs except for mathematics and logic. Aside from that, everything is

491
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,760
provisional. Then how dare they, and I think what he's really concerned about is not just

492
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,020
blackballing young professors, as we found happened during the McCarthy period, but also

493
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,820
something worse, perhaps the pedagogical equivalent of eating one's young, telling

494
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,380
your students that, well, this is the truth, I'm teaching you now. I know you'll read

495
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,380
other books, but they're wrong. My opinions, those are the important ones, and I can prove

496
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,620
it all. And that's what Hume distains. The life of the mind, the life of education, should

497
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,480
be cheerful, should be happy, should be open-minded, should be playful, there's nothing very serious

498
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,920
going on here, there's nothing crucial worth killing one another over, or denouncing one

499
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,480
another over. We should enjoy ourselves, it should be light, it should be open-minded,

500
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,480
it should be just and moderate. I think from this you will get a sense that for all of

501
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,480
his agnosticism, Hume is in his own way, perhaps the most vocal expression of Jobian secularism.

502
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,480
He in a way does have that Augustinian strain of humility and of piety, and yet he's completely

503
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,080
secular. I think that's what's intriguing about that tradition, which very much diffuses

504
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:40,080
in the Anglo-American world, is once it becomes secularized, that sort of metaphysical posture

505
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,480
has a certain charm and endearing value to it. It is the first time, it is only from

506
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,880
that perspective that tolerance, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion, can actually be

507
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,080
seen as a virtue. I should point out that Hume dies in 1776, the year of the American

508
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,440
Revolution. America does enact freedom of belief, freedom of speech, but not as a positive

509
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,440
good. I mean, most Americans had done it because they had no choice. There were too many sects

510
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,760
in North America to maintain an orthodoxy, and so it was a marriage of convenience, they

511
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,320
were forced to allow freedom of belief. In fact, it didn't always obtain everywhere.

512
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,380
Massachusetts retained an established church until the 1830s, as did Connecticut, as did

513
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,620
several colonies. It was only with Hume that he begins to say that's not a necessary evil

514
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,340
at all, that's the essence of the good life. There's nothing so serious in those churches

515
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,820
that can't be laughed at occasionally, and there's nothing so serious about my own work

516
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,220
that can't be laughed at, and in fact should be laughed at. If you want to know really

517
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:53,220
moral insight about the world, it's not philosophy texts. Maybe it's history, Hume became an historian,

518
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,980
that's one of the other reasons I know he's such a wise man. He realized what was really

519
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:03,820
important. Finally, I want to offer one more reason I think that this Humean liberation,

520
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,860
critique of dogmatism and rationalism is so valuable for us, and it's because it's something

521
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:15,060
philosophers call reflexive. It can be used upon itself. Hume ends his work with a bit

522
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:22,060
of spleen at the rationalist and scholastic tradition that he felt was oppressive. He

523
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,620
says, once we know that the only sort of knowledge you can have, that's certain, demonstratively

524
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:34,620
certain, is logic and mathematics, or matters of fact evidence based on experience, when

525
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,900
we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our

526
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,460
hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us ask, does it contain

527
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:54,540
any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental

528
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:01,040
reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Committed to bend to the flames, for

529
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:08,040
it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. How would we reflectively apply Hume to Hume?

530
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,300
We would point out, Dave, there's more to religion than that. Religion gives people

531
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:21,740
spiritual solace. If people need what William James called moral holidays or cosmological

532
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:28,780
holidays, why deny them? As long as they're not dogmatic, why should you be dogmatic?

533
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,660
And I think that is ultimately when that Humean ethos hits the United States in the late 19th

534
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:40,100
century and gets its ultimate clarification on William James, that is exactly where it

535
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,100
Hume has turned against himself to say, look, you too must be tolerant of people who believe

536
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,420
in religion and in Christianity. It has its value for those people, and you must be open-minded.
