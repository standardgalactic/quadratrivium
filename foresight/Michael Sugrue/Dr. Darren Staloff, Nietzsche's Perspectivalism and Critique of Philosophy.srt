1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,680
The

2
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,680
text that I'm going to be discussing today, Nietzsche's Gay Science, was by his own admission

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:44,680
his most personal book, a text that more fully than any other revealed his self-created persona.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:54,400
And I say self-created persona advisedly. Nietzsche was in personality, nothing like the

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,720
character you would have gotten from the previous lecture, which quite aptly describes

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,840
genealogy of morals beyond good and evil. And from that you get a sense of a sort of

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:14,840
philosophic Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actual Nietzsche was an incredible nerd, an extremely

8
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,720
sickly frail philology professor, prodigious in his youthful scholarship, but his self-created

9
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
persona that most accurately described the way he liked to think of himself was actually

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,160
less like Arnold Schwarzenegger than Oscar Wilde. He was very much a dandy, a very dapper

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,200
dresser, playful, had a very good sense of humor, at least in his writings. And I want

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,720
to try whenever possible to give you a sense of that side of him, because that's what

13
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,840
he tries to communicate in Gay Science. For example, it's a work that's comprised of

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,200
a series of aphorisms, poems, riddles, jokes, songs, none of which are more than a few

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,040
paragraphs long. The form of the work is Nietzsche's attempt to overcome what he considered

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,480
the dreary, systematic nature of traditional philosophy, which he felt was hampered with

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,320
a sort of ponderous, heavy-handed seriousness as if we were getting deep and getting to

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:25,120
the bottom of things. Rather than be systematic, Nietzsche endeavors to be edifying, playful,

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,920
to offer wisdom rather than a lie called truth. And as we'll see, Nietzsche argued that given

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,040
the philosophical conception of truth, there could be no such thing. The text is, I would

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,840
urge, a wonderfully beautiful piece of prose. In fact, it's one of the very few pleasurable

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
reads in all of German philosophy. Not to say that German philosophy is not rewarding,

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,880
I mean reading Kant, reading Hegel is intensely rewarding, but it is also very much like having

24
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,560
your teeth drilled without anesthetics. And Nietzsche was critically aware of this and

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,640
was in fact revolted by it. So my presentation, well as I've mentioned, whenever possible,

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,560
I attempt to capture this quality of playfulness, good-hearted mischievousness, and what I would

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,880
call a certain happy-go-lucky skepticism. Now, I must confess, in spite of his best efforts,

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,240
Nietzsche was, unfortunately, a systematic thinker. Therefore, I'm afraid, before I

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,840
can actually delve into the text, and what I plan to do is actually read you passages

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,880
and explicate them, I have to present one of his central doctrines that I believe informs

31
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,200
and underlies everything he writes. And this is a doctrine that's known as perspectivalism,

32
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,520
alternately called perspectivism. In brief, the doctrine holds that all of our concepts,

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,520
our language, our culture represent perspectives which we impose on experience. We put a mask

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,840
as it were over the realm of experience to create a, quote, world. And since Nietzsche

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,840
is systematic in all of his theories and theorems and to relate, I can draw on the last lecture

36
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,040
to give you an example of this. Take morality. Is morality an absolute reflection of the

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,920
truth? Or is morality, as Nietzsche says, perspectival? In other words, consider the

38
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,520
master morality that Professor Sugru has so aptly described. It is a morality of not

39
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,320
of what one does, but what one is. From a certain perspective, it has an intuitive sense. The

40
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,800
good man is a man who's good for something, and one can easily picture the situation.

41
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
You're going off into battle with spears and swords against people with spears and swords,

42
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,640
and you have a choice. You can have on your side either, well, Lawrence Taylor, or you

43
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,640
can have on your side Mahatma Gandhi. He says, well, this was the master sense of morality.

44
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,720
One of them is good. Lawrence Taylor. Why? Because he's good for something. When you're

45
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,200
in the middle of a battle, you'd rather have Lawrence Taylor by your side. Mahatma Gandhi

46
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,560
is bad because he's useless. He can't do anything for us. In the middle of a battle,

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,520
he's going to sit down and start, you know, eating rice or something like that. Perfectly

48
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,560
useless. So that's one perspective. And then there's the slave perspective, right, that

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,640
Lawrence Taylor is in fact a bad man because he's violent. He's contemptuous of those

50
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,320
beneath him, and Mahatma Gandhi was a good man because he had universal love. And Nietzsche

51
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
says, well, which of these are really true? Neither. There isn't a real truth to this.

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,760
There's just those perspectives, and you choose the perspective which works best for you.

53
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Now, this is not a complete innovation. That such perspectives are imposed rather than quote

54
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,000
red off of nature. Kant pointed out, right, with his discussion of the Copernican Revolution

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,960
and conceptual schemes. A lot of what we quote, call the world actually arises from our own

56
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,960
a priori categories. Now, Hegel had historicized that. He said, you know, it really doesn't

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,040
come from our a priori categories of mind because we find different conceptual schemes

58
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:26,040
in different parts of the world, and we find conceptual schemes evolve over time. Nonetheless,

59
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,680
philosophers after Hegel, and certainly before, held that what makes a perspective true is

60
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,680
that it in some sense corresponds to the way the world is, right? And we might accept Hegel

61
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,640
by saying, well, each of our following perspectives comes closer and closer to an accurate correspondence

62
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,440
of the world. And this is a doctrine called realism, the notion that the world is just

63
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,420
like the picture represented of it by the beliefs we hold or by our language or common

64
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,420
sense. Nature felt this was a piece of pre-Darwinian nonsense, literally a philosophic antique

65
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,040
piece. Nature says, what if we take Darwin seriously? What possibly can make a perspective

66
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,840
believable except the fact, not that it corresponds to reality, but rather that it empowers us

67
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,720
and allows us to cope with reality more effectively. So the key to evaluating belief as good or

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,120
bad is not whether it corresponds to reality, which is a vacuous notion because we never

69
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,120
quite get in touch with reality, but rather whether it fulfills our will to power, right?

70
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,080
Whether it allows us to control nature, to control ourselves, to control our environment,

71
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,080
including other humans. So in short, realism for Nietzsche is dogmatic and unjustifiable.

72
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,640
For the world in itself is nothing like the way we describe it. Now I want to urge that

73
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,640
perspectivalism runs in two disparate directions, one external and one internal. Externally

74
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,920
it takes the form of scientific realism, which is the belief that science accurately

75
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,160
depicts the way the world is. But Nietzsche disagrees, he says science is just another

76
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,200
perspective. It's certainly the perspective he believes in, hence gay science, but not

77
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,840
because it corresponds to the world, but because it's an extremely useful thing to believe.

78
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Right? It actually helps us control nature. Reality itself is actually just chaos and

79
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,040
flux. Nietzsche does occasionally, I must confess, fall into metaphysics. His metaphysics

80
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,000
are thoroughly Heracletian, which is to say they are the metaphysics we found in Heraclitus,

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the Presocratic philosopher. Persons for Nietzsche are nothing other than a series of

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,240
drives and instincts. And this is a really Darwinian conception, right? What describes

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,400
a human is the particular conjury of drives and instincts, and Nietzsche sums that up

84
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,880
with the phrase will to power. So all of nature, not just humans, are various wills to power.

85
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,000
All the animals are wills to power, trying to dominate their environment, replicate their

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,800
genetic code as much as they possibly can, and eat other things lower in the food chain.

87
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,880
That's the notion of will to power. So science in common sense are just masks that we throw

88
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,880
on reality so that we can cope with it, so that we can manipulate it. Now Nietzsche accepts

89
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,360
the correspondence theory of truth as the only tenable theory of truth, and it is for

90
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,280
that reason he says there is no truth, right? Because there is no fixed, final, parsed reality

91
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,840
for it to correspond to. So don't be upset when we find out that everything is a lie,

92
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,680
that there is no truth. It doesn't mean that there's nothing to believe in. It simply means

93
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,520
that there is nothing to correspond to our beliefs, that our beliefs simply interact

94
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,520
with the world causally, rather than correspondentially, that they give us a handle on the world.

95
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,840
And as I've suggested, therefore grounds for belief have nothing to do with truth, but

96
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:21,340
rather are all about power over nature and ourselves. Now, perspectivalism also cuts

97
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,340
internally. It undermines something which we might call the internal realism of the self.

98
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,780
Now we're all aware at some point in our lives, we wear masks, right? We present a persona.

99
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,500
When you meet your boss, and he looks like an old bald, who knows what, you don't say

100
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,100
hi, old bald, who know what, rather you smile and say, oh you look so good, I love that

101
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,300
tie, that's really charming. And we wear these masks when we deal with our children and they

102
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,060
do something silly which is dangerous, we don't laugh and say that's silly, we take

103
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,860
a stern face and say, why not not do that? And we put these masks on, we all do this

104
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,980
all the time. Nonetheless, we have this belief that if we could ever take those masks off,

105
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,980
we would find our real self, the real Professor Staloff as it were. Nietzsche finds this view

106
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,140
embarrassingly dogmatic and stupid. There is no real self, any more than a real world.

107
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,820
That's an incredibly dogmatic myth. We create ourselves. We create ourselves by putting

108
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,340
on masks, masks that we build, perhaps on the basis of models of others, but perhaps on

109
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,700
our own. And in fact, that's the distinction he draws about mask wearing. Some people are

110
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,700
more than satisfied to wear the masks that their culture presupposes. For Nietzsche,

111
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:51,140
that's dangerous, at least for him. He says that sort of a person has no terror of being

112
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,140
a copy, a replica, one just like any other cut out of a cookie cutter mold. The interesting

113
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,100
person is like an artist who self-consciously and artistically creates his own masks. He

114
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,300
may not even do it in his personal life. He may do it through his works. And that is

115
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,980
exactly what Nietzsche's works represent for him, his own self-created persona, his

116
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,100
own self-projected mask. Now, I want to very briefly to say that there are some would-be

117
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,580
friends of Nietzsche who've claimed that he was not a perspectivalist because that would

118
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,020
be a stupid view. I mean, if it's all just perspective, then one perspective is as good

119
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:41,020
as another. Well, Nietzsche has a great line. He says, I wish such disciples on my enemies.

120
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:49,020
He says, that's a cloven-minded thought, the inference limps. And the reason it limps

121
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,700
is because such friends assume that the only thing which could count as truth, as grounds

122
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,300
for belief, is correspondence. When Nietzsche says, not at all. There's plenty of reasons

123
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,380
to decide that physics is more true, say, than the belief that I have wings and can

124
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,140
fly off this podium. In fact, the best example of that would be that if I tried it, I'd break

125
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,660
my leg. He says, so that's the grounds for belief. Perspectivalism isn't undermined

126
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,340
by the critique of relativism. Simply because none of the beliefs are absolutely true doesn't

127
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:28,340
mean we can't choose between them, which fulfill our purposes better.

128
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,500
Perspectivalism does mean, however, that our views of things are interpretations, not

129
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,540
correspondence readings. And nowhere is this more true than in reading texts. Every reading

130
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:52,860
of a text is an interpretation of it. And in no text is this more obvious than in Nietzsche's,

131
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,420
which are disparate, often contradictory, confusing. So what I'm going to offer is an

132
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,060
interpretation of the gay science, which will take the form of looking at particular passages

133
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:11,100
which I find edifying and explicating them. I'll try, of course, because I'm not quite

134
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,020
Nietzsche, to cover all the important topics. But whether I do or not is in no way significant.

135
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,420
Whether I cover two or two hundred aphorisms is important. What is important is that I

136
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,420
try and give you a sense of the style, of the flavor of this text.

137
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,740
Alright, so that brings us to the beginning of the text. What is gay science, after all?

138
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,740
The illusion, I believe, was to the gay sebert of the Provence troubadours, which were chivalric

139
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,780
knights who created the first love songs and love poems and were destroyed during the middle

140
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,940
of a papal crusade, because obviously they weren't very good Christians, they believed

141
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,620
in adultery. And the point for Nietzsche, and other thinkers since him, I mean Joseph

142
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,780
Campbell has thought the same view, is that these were the first people who created individuals,

143
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,180
who said, I will stand against authority, and if the church tells me what I'm doing

144
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,180
is a sin, well, so much for the church. I will fulfill my own path. And I think that's

145
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,380
a fair sense of part of what gay science is about, the creating of individuals, the cherishing

146
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:27,380
of individuality as opposed to commonality, universality. Nietzsche, however, in his preface

147
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:36,060
to the work, refers to his gay science as the result of a convalescence. He says, gay

148
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,540
science, that signifies the Saturnalia of a spirit who has patiently resisted a terrible

149
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:50,540
long pressure, patiently, severely, coldly without submitting, but also without hope.

150
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,900
And it was now all at once attacked by hope, the hope for health, and the intoxication

151
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,140
of convalescence. Is it any wonder that in the process much that is unreasonable and foolish

152
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,780
comes to light, much playful tenderness that is lavished even on problems that have a prickly

153
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,820
hide and are not made to be caressed and enticed? This whole book is nothing but a bit of merry

154
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,660
making after long privation and powerlessness, the rejoicing of strength that is returning

155
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,180
of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Well, what is this sickness

156
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,740
or as he calls it, nausea that he's getting better from? The nausea, he says, is the result

157
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,420
of having an over-large dose of a very unhealthy European diet called Romanticism, which fills

158
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:46,220
us with great aspirations. Problem with such a conviction is, it only lasts as long as

159
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,700
you're scientifically illiterate. If you read Darwin, you realize that there's no purpose

160
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:58,700
behind our existence. We are, in fact, simply the agents of the big actor behind history,

161
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Mr. DNA, right, who's a sort of viral infection that's infected the planet and where it's

162
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,220
laid a strategy for dominating that infection. But in a sense, don't worry, it'll die off

163
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,220
eventually. So Nietzsche says that's the sort of thing which can induce Veltschmer's

164
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,500
world weariness, a sense of anxiety and dread over it all. And Nietzsche went through this

165
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,260
intense depression, life is meaningless, there's no purpose, there's no goal, and then he

166
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:36,260
got better. And as he gets better, he takes on a new perspective. He's no longer serious

167
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,400
and somber, what he would call, oh, too, German. Now, he's pricklish, he's gay. Let me be

168
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,160
clear, gay at the time did not have the connotation of homosexuality that it does today. But Walter

169
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Kaufman has quite persuasively, I think, argued that it's no coincidence that homosexuals

170
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,720
would have reached for the same term that Nietzsche used to describe his science, because

171
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,760
it suggests a sort of studied superficiality, a sense of the beauty of mere appearance,

172
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,080
a refusal to take serious things seriously, rather take them trivially, and take trivial

173
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,080
things seriously, which some of you may recognize as the dictum of Oscar Wilde. So this text

174
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,440
is, in a sense, then, at least for Nietzsche, a study of his psychological experience of

175
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,360
world weariness and its philosophical results. And Nietzsche makes an important point. He

176
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,200
says, this is not just me, I'm aware of it. I'm a philosophical psychologist. But every

177
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,320
philosopher, if he really is an interpretation of the body, in a sense, every philosopher

178
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,960
feels some sort of psychological tension or pull and need for meaning or purpose. And in

179
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,760
fact, he says, most of them are misinterpretations of the body. They're a tendency to read one's

180
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,760
psychic organic needs into nature. Given that, Nietzsche says, I will not do that. I will

181
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,920
not treat my own projections as a serious, profound, deep thing that underlies the world.

182
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Rather than being profound and deep, we should be, as he says, like the Greeks. Oh, those

183
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Greeks, they knew how to live. What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface,

184
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,680
the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, and the whole

185
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Olympus of appearance. Those Greeks were superficial, out of profundity. And this is, and is not

186
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,600
this precisely what we are again coming back to. We dare devils of the spirit who have

187
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought and looked down from up

188
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,840
there. We have looked down from there. Are we not precisely in this respect Greeks, adores

189
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,480
of forms, of tones of words, and therefore, artists? And I think that celebration is the

190
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,600
realization that, you know, there are some serious questions that might be raised, which

191
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
it's just indecent for any gentleman to raise. And he tells a story of, you know, there's

192
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,600
this anecdote about this woman who, this young girl who once asked her mother, is God everywhere?

193
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,600
She said, of course, God is everywhere. And the child said, well, that's, I think that's

194
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,600
thoroughly indecent. God follows me into the bathroom. I mean, is God aware, is God there

195
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,600
when I'm picking my nose? Oh, that's, that's horrible. And Nietzsche says, well, there

196
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,040
may be something to that. A wise man knows what are the fair questions and what sort

197
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:49,040
of questions not to ask. Okay, now we turn to the body of the text itself. Nietzsche

198
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,360
added a sort of introduction, which he called joke, cunning, and revenge, which will turn

199
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,560
out to be the strategies of gay science. And the book introduces all of the major themes

200
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:08,560
that will be discussed in the text. The very first of these little poems is called invitation,

201
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,640
and it is exactly that. It's an invitation to the text. Take a chance and try my affair.

202
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,120
It will grow on you, I swear. Soon it will taste good to you if by then you should want

203
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,120
more. All the things I've done before will inspire things quite new. And the point Nietzsche

204
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,120
is making is if you follow this book and begin to think dangerous thoughts, you won't follow

205
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,360
me. You will create your own. And I think he wonderfully expresses this in his ninth

206
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,360
little poem called My Roses. Yes, my joy wants to amuse. Every joy wants to amuse. Would

207
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,560
you like to pick my roses? You must stoop and stick your noses between thorns and rocky

208
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,460
views and not be afraid of bruises. For my joy enjoys good teases. For my joy enjoys

209
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,960
good roses. Would you like to pick my roses? All of the aphorisms in this book are Nietzsche's

210
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,760
roses. He's beckoning us and saying, look, you're going to find some thorny issues here,

211
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,760
some pricklish issues here. But that is the nature of his joy, of his happiness, of his

212
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,760
happy-go-lucky mischievousness. In his fifth little poem, he introduces his, what I would

213
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,240
call, meta-ethical critique, which is not his ethical doctrine, but his doctrine about

214
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,000
the way we should feel towards ethics. What troubled Nietzsche was how particular parts

215
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,560
of our culture, particularly of our philosophical culture, are claimed to trump the others.

216
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,360
Our moral duties come first. And Nietzsche said, well, morality is fine, of course. But

217
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,840
is it all of life? Must we learn how to morally eat our food? Must we learn what are the morally

218
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,840
correct ways to fold our napkins? Why should our virtues be grave? We like ours nimble-footed.

219
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Even like Homer's verse, they have to come and go. Sometimes virtue and morality should

220
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,680
leave us in peace for a while so we can do something else, like be creative, do art,

221
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,680
do science. Morality is not the measure of all things. And I think perhaps his most wonderful

222
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,240
expression of this is in the text itself, I'm jumping out of place, I know, called dealing

223
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,240
with virtues. In dealing with a virtue, too, one can lack dignity and fawn. And clearly

224
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I think the figure he's responding to here is Kant. Oh yes, we must do our duties. Don't

225
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,880
you think that's rather bad form, Kant? Don't you think it's rather bad form to constantly

226
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,800
fawn before your duties, like they were a sort of surrogate god? It shows a real lack of

227
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,800
taste. Well, he also introduces himself as a problem in the text. He says, in a wonderful

228
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,080
passage called Request, the minds of others I know well, but who I am, I cannot tell.

229
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,760
My eye is much too close to me, I am not what I saw and see. It would be quite a benefit.

230
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,720
If only I could sometimes sit farther away, but my foes are too distant, close friends

231
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,720
still too far, between my friends and me the middle would do my wish, you guess my riddle.

232
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,760
I need you to make a deep point. If there is no real self in there, but only masks, perspectives,

233
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm a little too close to my own mask to see who I really am. That's your job, the reader

234
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
and my job, the reader, the expositor, to try and figure out Nietzsche and come back to

235
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,200
him and tell him who he is. But, of course, this has a sort of selfish side to it too,

236
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,480
which Nietzsche is quite aware of, as in for your consideration. Double pain is easier

237
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,480
to bear than single pain. Do you accept my dare? Try and think my, quote, dangerous thoughts.

238
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Okay, and then finally one last theme in this introduction, and we can turn to the rest

239
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,760
of the body of the text, and that is his, what I would call, tasteful critique of Christianity.

240
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:25,820
He says, in a wonderful little poem called, Chusy Taste, if it depended on my choice,

241
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,980
I think it might be great to have a place in paradise, better yet, outside the gate.

242
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
And Nietzsche is making a very deep point here. He's saying, look, stop being pious

243
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,100
for a minute and be honest with me. What do you think goes on in heaven? Everyone sits

244
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,940
in beatific vision, genuflecting towards the deity. What a particularly boring person he

245
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,780
must be. Would you really want to spend time there? All the interesting people are in hell.

246
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,900
Well, they may well be suffering, of course. We don't want to be in hell. We might want

247
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,060
to look at paradise to see that wonderful splendor, but it's beneath the dignity of a

248
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,420
gentleman to waste his time in heaven, and that's Chusy Taste. He doesn't want to be

249
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:14,420
part of that, shall we call it, herd? Nietzsche always does. One more passage about his Chusy

250
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Taste, and then we can leave it behind, and that is his statement against Christianity,

251
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,960
which again is not only sharp and invective, but actually extremely accurate. Against Christianity,

252
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,060
what is now decisive against Christianity is our taste, no longer our reason. That may

253
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,300
seem absurd at first, but go to a college campus and listen to, especially an elite one, and

254
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,540
listen to the young rail against the stupidities of religion, and you'll notice something.

255
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,740
They haven't a good argument among them. Any sophisticated theologian will persistently

256
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,980
best them in argument, and Nietzsche's point is, but the young won't be convinced. It's

257
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,980
not reasons that turn them against Christianity anymore. It's taste. How thoroughly musty

258
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,980
and brown to believe in that sort of heavy-handed, baroque sort of belief. The youth have developed

259
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:15,780
a higher form of taste, which clearly shows that it's too stolid, too, as it were, beef-headed.

260
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,060
As he says, mystical explanations are thought to be profound. The truth is, they're not

261
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:31,060
even superficial. Nietzsche is saying, look, stop looking at religion from the scales of

262
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:38,300
piety, and look at it literally, and it's thoroughly absurd. Okay. We now turn to Book

263
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:46,100
One, which I would argue constitutes a species of shock therapy. Nietzsche is, in a certain

264
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,620
way, trying to preach what I would call tough love. We've all been brought up in a culture

265
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:01,740
which has brainwashed us into thinking like, it wants us to think, thinking like members

266
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,780
of a herd. And the only way to break us free from that and liberate us is to shock us,

267
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:13,300
is to scare us, is to show us the absurdity of these views in a most harsh fashion. So

268
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,620
he begins with his very first aphorism, the teachers of the purpose of existence. He says,

269
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,260
whether I contemplate men with benevolence or with an evil eye, I always find them concerned

270
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,380
with a single task, all of them and every one of them in particular, to do what is good

271
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:35,220
for the preservation of the species. Not from any feeling of love, but merely because nothing

272
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,300
in them is older, stronger, more inexorable, and unconquerable than this instinct, because

273
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,820
this instinct constitutes the essence of our species, our herd. And this is extremely

274
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,980
Darwinian point he's making, that if you're kind to other people, and if you try to help

275
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,060
the species, it's not because you've thought about it, if you have sentences that describe

276
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,020
why you do it, you added those lies later. You do it because you're genetically programmed

277
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:09,020
to do that. That's how Mr. DNA uses us to replicate ourselves. He goes on to say, if

278
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:16,860
you think about it, hatred, mischievousness, evil, are all indispensable for the life of

279
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,300
the species? They bring out characteristics, noble characteristics in us, perhaps virtuous

280
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,260
and kind characteristics, which would otherwise go rotten if they weren't occasionally evil

281
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:33,760
people and bad things. In fact, if we look at it scientifically, we can prove that it

282
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,760
has, in fact, preserved the species so far. But Nietzsche's fear is that we may have reached

283
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:47,080
the point where we can no longer even think bad thoughts, even think our way outside of

284
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:54,080
the herd. For if one could, one could then respond not with a sort of vitriolic anger,

285
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,000
but with laughter, as he says, to laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in order

286
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
to laugh out of the whole truth, to do that, even the best so far lacks sufficient genius.

287
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,240
Even laughter may yet have a future. I mean, when the proposition, the species is everything,

288
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,600
one is always none, has become part of humanity, and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility

289
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,940
has become accessible to all at all times, perhaps laughter will then have formed an

290
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,260
alliance with wisdom. Perhaps only gay science will then be left. And Nietzsche's referring

291
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,340
to what he thinks is an extremely dangerous development in the late nineteenth century,

292
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,300
which is the growth of humanitarianism, of kindness and gentleness. He's not against

293
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:45,300
those things in and of themselves, but they're totalitarian. They insist that everything

294
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:52,100
devolve around them. And he says, you know, there's this weird fruit that's grown on the

295
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,060
tree of the human species in the last few hundred years called the individual, which

296
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,300
doesn't follow the herd. But of course, if we can all become liberals and socialists,

297
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,300
we can stamp that out. It's a sort of happy-go-lucky totalitarianism.

298
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,620
And then he turns to the real issue, what are the meaning of teachers of the purpose

299
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,660
of existence? Heroes who show up on the stage and tell us, life means this, you must go

300
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,820
out and do your duty, you must save humanity, you must be kind to the poor and the oppressed.

301
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,060
There's something profound about the meaning of life. And he says, well, they actually

302
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:36,100
have a place. They actually have a function. Right? What they do is tell us there's something

303
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,620
in life that can't be laughed at. There's something serious beneath life, behind life,

304
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:46,380
underneath life. Beware, do not laugh. And he says, well, of course, ultimately all

305
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,780
of these systems get exposed to reason, and the result is always laughter and comedy because

306
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,580
they're all absurd and ridiculous, none of them are provable. But nonetheless, there's

307
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,580
something new that's come out of this. Humans are the only animals that have, how to say,

308
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:11,100
grown a new need, a need for a purpose. We feel the need to have a reason to go on living.

309
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,740
And he says, this is fascinating. Dogs don't do that. Has your dog ever come up to you

310
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,700
and say, it's a dog's life, alpoh three times a day. I'm just going to go ahead and do

311
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,020
it all. No, I mean, every animal does how to go on, but we have this other need. And

312
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,180
the reason is, because teachers of the purpose of existence offer us cultural narcotics.

313
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,460
They somatize us. They make us, as it were, stoned and happy so that we cannot look at

314
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,540
the suffering that is most of life. And Nietzsche's point then of tough love is, that's the way

315
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,740
you break the addiction. I point out to you that it is all absurd.

316
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,420
Then he turns to the problem of intellectual conscience. I keep having the same experience

317
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,300
and keep resisting it every time. I don't want to believe, although it's palpable, that

318
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,300
the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to

319
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,020
me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as lonely in the most densely

320
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:11,500
populated cities as if you were in a desert. Everyone goes right on weighing things in

321
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,140
their scales of good and bad and right and evil. When anyone who cares to take a close

322
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,380
look at that finds that it's absurd, that evil has an indispensable place in the evolution

323
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,180
of the human species. It creates the sort of stormy conditions which make a tree grow

324
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:32,540
strong and firm. And he says, I can't help feeling that deep down inside every single

325
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,460
person has at least the desire for an intellectual conscience. And he says, this is my type of

326
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,660
injustice, which leads directly to the next aphorism. We were going to find that Nietzsche

327
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,020
is actually a profoundly fair person. This aphorism is called noble and common. And he

328
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,900
says there's a certain confusion. You find that there are people called, quote, normal,

329
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,860
or noble, who are incredibly unreasonable. They somehow throw their life on the rocks

330
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:05,580
of art, or science, or philosophy, squandering their lives for some higher ideal. He says

331
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,380
the common person looks at that. And the first thing they think is, how's he getting over?

332
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,380
Right? How's he going to turn that into money? I know that's what he's doing. He's going

333
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,500
to turn it into money. Everyone does it, turns it into money. And then after a certain point,

334
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,620
when he realizes this guy's not making any money, he says, well, he's an idiot. He's

335
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,180
a dope. And he says, and that's the injustice of the common person. He can't imagine someone

336
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,700
who doesn't have his own straightforward proclivities. He says, on the other hand, there is the noble

337
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:36,180
person who aspires to higher things. But he too is unjust, because he turns to the common

338
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:41,020
person and says, well, you too have these aspirations. Why is history so stupid? People

339
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:47,900
live subveno lives. And Nietzsche says, that is the injustice of the noble. They assume

340
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,700
that everyone is just like them. And so they don't judge them by the proper standards.

341
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,980
So when you find common people and say, why don't you aspire to higher things? He just

342
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,900
says, that's an unfair criticism. They're not capable of that. You must judge them by

343
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:06,140
their own standards, by their own rationality. And in fact, he says the ultimate noble mindedness

344
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:12,580
is for those who are noble to want to be the exception and not the rule. For the bulk of

345
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,140
humanity must be sympathetically understood as common. And that's not a bad thing. That's

346
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,540
just the way they are. They're not to be rebuked for that any more than the noble are for being

347
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:36,340
profound. Finally, I want to turn to, in this shock treatment, his fifth aphorism, unconditional

348
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:43,900
duties. All those who feel the need, feel they need the strongest words and sounds, the most

349
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:49,020
eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective at all, such as revolutionary

350
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,300
politicians, socialists, preachers of repentance, with or without Christianity, all of whom

351
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,780
cannot tolerate semi-success, talk of duties and always of duties that are supposed to

352
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,500
be unconditional. And this clearly is a jive, it can't. This point is, oh yes, we have some

353
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,060
moral conviction I want to give you, which I can't prove to you. So all I do is I dress

354
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,660
it up in big words, oh, it's an unconditional duty. It's a categorical imperative. It's the

355
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,740
purpose of human existence. It says, well, you find that because there are certain people,

356
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:27,740
like, say, Kant, who are too noble, perhaps from their birth, perhaps from an experience

357
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,260
of their education, to be willing to serve as the function of a political party or to

358
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,540
be someone's personal servant. But they still feel the need to be a function of something.

359
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:46,460
So they come up with these pompous principles, unconditional duties. And as he states, refined

360
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:52,060
servility clings to the categorical imperative and is the mortal enemy of those who wish

361
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:58,980
to deprive duty of its unconditional character. That is what decency demands of them and not

362
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,740
only decency. And I think this is a deep point. He's not being an anti-moralist. He's saying,

363
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,180
look, morality has its place. But why can't you tolerate semi-success? Why can't you tolerate

364
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,580
saying, you know, kindness is better than cruelty? Not because I'm certain about it, but it

365
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,820
seems that way to me. He says, no problem with that. But no, you have to say, no, I

366
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:29,020
can prove to you that kindness is better than cruelty. He says, well, that's pathological.

367
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,260
I now want to turn to the discussion of the doctrine of feeling of power, one of the most

368
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,820
misunderstood doctrines in all of Nietzsche's writings. As we know, he believes that we're

369
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,540
all full of a will to power. And many people believe that means that he favored inflection

370
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:50,500
of cruelty and suffering. Nietzsche points out, no, no, no, no. Look, inflicting suffering

371
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,860
and cruelty on people is a form of showing your will to power. But it's the will to power

372
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:01,380
of a weak man. How much more easy is it to make someone suffer than to benefit them?

373
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,820
In other words, if you want to see who's the real megalomaniac, the one who's really full

374
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,700
of power, look at someone who's kind. What are they showing? I'm so overflowing with

375
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:17,420
life and power that I have some extra I can give you. And you'll be beholden to me. That

376
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,060
is the real warrior ideal of Nietzsche, not a cruel man, but a kind man. And a kind man

377
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,700
is kind for pathological reasons, because it fulfills his feeling of empowerment to

378
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:36,300
help people. That is, as he would say, a profound sense of empowerment. But he points out, never

379
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,820
will such a man be kind out of pity. Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those

380
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,660
who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests. Rather, he'll be kind out

381
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:54,060
of a sense of overflowing greatness. Another issue which Nietzsche has been incredibly

382
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,060
misunderstood about, because he's dialectical and he does say some ugly things on the subject,

383
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,340
is women. But as we'll find out, Nietzsche is a dialectical thinker. He sees two sides

384
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,180
of every issue. For all of his misogyny, he has this wonderful little passage called

385
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:12,340
Diverse Disatisfaction, which he says, you know, the weak and feminine type. What they

386
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,860
do when they see a problem or suffering is they make it more beautiful, more profound.

387
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,580
Whereas the masculine and strong type, it makes things better. It actually improves them.

388
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,380
Right, and here we see a little, sounds like it's going to be a great piece of misogyny.

389
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:37,700
But Nietzsche responds by saying, if this type, the feminine, had not been superabundant

390
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,100
in Europe since the Middle Ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant change might

391
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,220
never have come into existence. China, for example, is a country in which large-scale

392
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,260
dissatisfaction and the capacity for change have become extinct centuries ago, and the

393
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,420
socialists would like to bring that to Europe. But fortunately, Nietzsche is not masculine.

394
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,820
Nietzsche is feminine. Don't make it better. That just makes us stupid like a herd. The

395
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,620
feminine is the superior. We should make it beautiful. We should make it profound. That's

396
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:24,660
what enables change and dynamism in life. Okay, finally, I want to turn to the last

397
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,700
part of book one, from which we'll go right to the end of the text after that, called

398
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:34,060
The Craving for Suffering, which is a wonderfully liberating text for anyone who spent much

399
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:42,100
time on a college campus, where you will be surrounded by students who protest injustice

400
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,220
and suffering and cruelty in the world. And Nietzsche is not against protesting suffering

401
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,540
and cruelty. He thinks that's barbaric. He doesn't want barbarians. But he wants to be

402
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:59,980
honest about why they do it. He says, what you really find is, what young people want

403
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,060
is suffering to come to them in the form of a big dragon. There's evil thing out there

404
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,980
that's objective, so that they can dress up in armor and be heroes in chivalrous nights

405
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,620
and go kill the dragon. So they need suffering. They want suffering, and more and more suffering

406
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,780
and suffering with others. Let's save the whales. Let's save the amoebas. Let's save

407
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,940
the plankton. Oh, yes. And he says, and the reason is, of course, because they're bored

408
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,660
with themselves, as well as they should be. They don't have the ability to create their

409
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,380
own authentic suffering and then transcend it with art. So they look to paint suffering

410
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:45,100
on the wall like a big dragon. And he says, they do not know what to do with themselves

411
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,740
and therefore paint the distress of others on the wall. They always need others and continually

412
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:57,580
other others. Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall.

413
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,940
Why must we be obsessed with suffering? It's not going to go out of the world. The Buddha

414
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,860
was right. Life is suffering. So why dwell on it, young people? Think of the joys of

415
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:15,300
life. Paint your happiness on the wall. Okay, finally now, I wish to take you to the end

416
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:22,980
of the text. To two important, I think extremely important, aphorisms, one number 340, the

417
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:30,260
dying Socrates, in which he quite rightly points out that when Socrates is about to take hemlock,

418
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,740
he says, oh, Crito, one of the students, I owe Asclepius a rooster. Asclepius is the

419
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:42,580
god of medicine. And the rooster is obviously a sacrifice to him. And Nietzsche says, what

420
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:50,780
does this really mean? You give Asclepius a rooster when he's cured of disease. What's

421
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:58,620
the disease Nietzsche is being cured of? Life. Nietzsche experienced life as, excuse me,

422
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,180
Socrates experienced life as a weight. And he says, and this is a terrifying thought.

423
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,140
Because Nietzsche, Socrates, the good soldier who always wore a chipper and stoical domain

424
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,420
on his face in his last dying breath with a sort of vicious vengeance said, really life

425
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,860
is a disease and I've been cured at last. So he says, therefore we must overcome the

426
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,060
Greeks. Now that's a very perspectival point. You needn't read it that way. You could read

427
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:30,980
it as saying, I've overcome the fear of death, therefore give Asclepius a rooster. But it

428
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,340
is, in its own way, a perfect example of perspectivalism. I now want to turn to the last and most

429
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:45,380
important aphorism called the greatest weight. The greatest weight is Nietzsche's doctrine

430
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,780
of eternal return, eternal recurrence, which is, I think originally a Hindu notion, which

431
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,940
is that we have cyclical time. Everything that happens will happen again. Ten thousand

432
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,820
years from now, we'll all be sitting here all over again and I'll be saying the same

433
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:06,660
words to you. And as we know, what, when the Hindus thought of that as any sane man would,

434
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,780
not the first thing that occurred to them is what a nightmare. Ninety percent of my

435
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,620
life quit fantasizing. Ninety percent of each of our lives is embarrassment, humiliation

436
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:20,860
and stupidity. Who wants to relive their bedwetting? Right? Who wants to relive all the wrong answers

437
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,660
they gave in high school algebra? And all the times they got laughed at. And all the

438
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,780
times they said stupid, dopey things and felt bad about it later. Most of your life is embarrassing

439
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,580
and banal. So the Hindus said, well we want to get off the life death wheel of karma. We

440
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,820
want to achieve nirvana, which is basically cosmic death. We don't want to be reborn.

441
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,460
And Nietzsche said that that was one of the biggest dangers facing Europe at the time.

442
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,020
And it got a wonderful expression in Schopenhauer's work, who said, we will all have real freedom

443
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,540
when all of humanity gets together on one day and drinks Jim Jane Jones Kool-Aid, Kimitz

444
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,820
Collective Suicide. He really thought this was liberation. And it was considered a very

445
00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,020
profound thought. And Nietzsche responds by saying, no, eternal return is an excellent

446
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,380
test of whether you have the possibility of being a quote, ubermensch, which is not a

447
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,260
superman, which is not a tyrant, which is an overman, which is the next stage of man,

448
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,940
the man who can see the truth of perspectivalism, the truth of groundlessness, the truth of

449
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,980
purposelessness, the truth of the fact that he might have to live this whole stupid life

450
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,140
over again and still say, yes, I'll take it anyways. Life is not a problem for me. It's

451
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:29,340
full of delightful possibilities. I can self create myself an art. I can overcome myself

452
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:36,780
an art. In fact, it is art that makes perspectival truth bearable by making it beautiful. So

453
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,340
eternal return then becomes a litmus test. If, if when you think to yourself, do I have

454
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,540
to live my life all over again exactly as I have, if you can say yes to that and say

455
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,100
with all its stupidity, with all my bedwetting, with all my wrong answers, I want it all over

456
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,300
again just as it is. Nietzsche says, then you are a philosophic soul. You've overcome

457
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,340
that narcotic need for a purpose to your life, and you are the next stage of human

458
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,540
cultural development. And let me be clear about one thing before I finish here. Very

459
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:18,540
often that is depicted as a sort of Aryan blonde beast in our old Schwarzenegger type.

460
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,260
Nietzsche thought, you can never go back to that. That's just barbarism. The higher

461
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:29,340
formed, the ubermensch would in fact be like Nietzsche, a very sensitive soul who for all

462
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:35,740
his quote anti-Semitism was really an anti-anti-Semite. He had the very obnoxious habit of saying

463
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,740
things like, you know, because by the way I should point out that Germany was intensely

464
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,460
anti-Semitic at this point in something called Christian anti-Semitism. So what he would

465
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,740
do is point that and say, you know, the Old Testament is actually a great book. The sick

466
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,060
part is the New Testament. To read the Old Testament, it's better than Homer. People kill,

467
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:59,060
they rape, they murder. Those were real men. It's the Nazarene that's distorted. And one

468
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,700
last point on that subject. He said the only people more despicable than the Christians

469
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:10,140
are of course the Germans who were afflicted with, he called it racial scabies of the heart,

470
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:16,140
who said, have you ever noticed a German musician? The moment he creates something beautiful,

471
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:22,020
he blushes, right? He has to always have his opera surrounded, and he is clearly referring

472
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,840
to Wagner, his ex-friend, has to have his opera surrounded with great, huge sets and

473
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,860
theories. He says, no, no, no, look at the Italian operas. Those are people who know

474
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,020
how to live. Those are Ubermench. Why? Because they'd be just as happy to have their, their

475
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,500
sopranos go up there and go, la, la, la, la, la, for three hours without a single word

476
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,300
in it. Because they're not trying to be profound, they're trying to be beautiful. They don't

477
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,940
feel uncomfortable when they say something nice, or when they say something beautiful,

478
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:52,140
a beautiful phrase. So only a German does that. And his perfect contrast is Beethoven

479
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:58,020
and Goethe. One day they were walking together supposedly, and along came a member of the

480
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,620
royal family, and Beethoven locked arms with Goethe and said, we shall walk through, and

481
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:08,020
they'll have to give way. And Goethe broke his arm. He said, what a barbarian, please

482
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:15,040
not a man for you. That is the Ubermench. Not some sadistic tyrant, but a cultivated,

483
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,900
refined, refined person who sees laughter in everything, and joyfulness in the truth,

484
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:26,660
who doesn't need a spiritual narcotic to get through life, who is compassionate out of

485
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:33,660
strength, not out of weakness and pity, and who judges the weak not as inferior, but as

486
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,860
common by their own standard, not by his.

487
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:44,860
Okay, I've given you a taste of Nietzsche. I think the only better way to cash in this

488
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,380
lecture is to turn to the text yourselves, and I think you'll find it richly rewarding.
