1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,320
You famously said that mushrooms can help humanity to save the world.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,760
Can you elaborate on that?

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:24,440
Well, I think those of us who've journeyed with a high dose of psilocybin, so I'm only

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,520
speaking to a subset of the audience here.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:35,520
But those of us who've done these journeys, a very common theme is we realize that we're

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,760
a species that has an obligation to help save the planet, the biodiversity, the ecosystems

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,260
and nature.

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,160
Nature is calling out to us to open up our eyes to our responsibility as Earth citizens

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,160
to be responsible in protecting the commons.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,240
And unfortunately, because of capitalism, religion, you know, all sorts of other factors,

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,640
our vision has become so narrowed for just self-indulgence, self-profiteering.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:19,320
And the understanding of sharing for the commons has unfortunately retreated in the priorities

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,680
of many human activities.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,120
You know, I do believe in the principles of capitalism insofar that individuals should

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,520
be rewarded for their extraordinary efforts.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,160
So you have to be incentivized.

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,880
But once you are incentivized and you do get ahead, you have a very, I think a very strong

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,400
obligation to help others who are in need, because I think the lessons of evolution is

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,000
not the survival of the fittest, but the sharing of surplus beyond your own needs to help your

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,520
neighbors and help others who are less advantaged.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,440
So the message that I'm getting from self-sabotten mushrooms is the important role that humans

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,000
play today in being able to provide for the health of the ecosystem for everyone.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,760
The common phrase is that a rising tide raises all boats.

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,080
But it's much more sophisticated than that.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,240
We have an ethical responsibility.

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,000
We are here now because of evolutionary smart choices over millions of years.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,840
But we're at a time critical moment that if we don't make smarter choices now, then

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,720
species extinction for humans is very plausible.

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,400
Now some people might say, no, that's not possible.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
Look at the evolutionary record.

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,720
More than 99% of the species that have existed on this planet are extinct.

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,960
Extinction is a natural consequence of evolution for those organisms who are not able to adapt

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
to change.

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,160
The fact that we are contaminating the ecosystem that gives us life is destroying our descendants'

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
future.

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,040
And so I feel a very strong obligation to our descendants, calling back in time, saying

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,960
we are at our pivotal moment to make a decisions that affect our future for literally thousands

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,280
of years going forward.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,160
So now, from a practical point of view, OK, most people would accept that logically.

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,920
But what does this mean?

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,080
Our research with psilocybin and psilocybin analogs shows that it profoundly stimulates

42
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,080
neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurogeneration, neuroregeneration.

43
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,480
Those are four separate forms of neuron enhancement.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
And we can see this now very clearly in vitro.

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
We are involved in microdosing.

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,480
We published in Nature Scientific Reports two articles on microdosing, the latest June

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,400
30th, 2022.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,160
And it's extraordinary how many people are microdosing.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:16,480
And this app that we co-develop called microdose.me, people self-report their behaviors, how often

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,000
they use psilocybin, what do they stack it with, what's their motivation, what's their

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,200
income, what's their race, what's their sexual preference.

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,840
So it's a very interesting population study.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,120
And the reason why the peer reviewers at Nature were so excited about our manuscript as our

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
data set is very large.

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,240
The first paper, November 28th, 2021, had a survey of more than 8,000 people.

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
More than 4,100 were non-microdosers.

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,160
That was a shock to us.

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Non-microdosers were motivated to sign up at microdose.me.

59
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,520
I think because they wanted to get a baseline, citizen scientists want to go, okay, before

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,560
I start microdosing, I want to see what my baseline level is.

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,200
And then you microdose without contrast.

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,000
So we had about 4,100 non-microdosers, a little over 4,000 microdosers.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Predominantly in North America, microdosing is with psilocybin.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,560
Here in Europe is more common with LSD.

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:29,440
So in our microdosing study, over 55% of the people microdosing with psilocybin stack it.

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
What stacking means is that you have an admixture.

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,440
You add something else to the psilocybin.

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,240
And a variety of substances are added, chocolate.

69
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,320
I hypothesized a formula stacking psilocybin mushrooms with niacin, nicotinic acid, the

70
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,320
flushing form, and lion's mane.

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,840
And I proposed this stack because psilocybin is a vasoconstrictor, niacin is a vasodilator.

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,820
Also when you take the flushing form of niacin, your nerve endings get excited.

73
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,320
So I thought with neuropathies, oftentimes present themselves as deadening of the extremities,

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,440
the fingertips and the toes.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,640
And so when you have neurodegeneration and neuropathies, you have vasoconstriction, blood

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,800
vessels choke off, nerves die.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,520
So I thought with vasodilation with niacin, it could deliver the benefits of psilocybin

78
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,360
to the endpoints of the peripheral nervous system.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,420
So then lion's mane, it's been well studied that lion's mane regenerates myelin on the

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,920
axons of nerves.

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,520
These are the conductive sheath.

82
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,240
So I bundled these together for the hypothesis that these would have an entourage effect

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,680
of stimulation for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases.

84
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,320
Now it's not just diseases, it's age.

85
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,960
New news to everyone.

86
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
We get older.

87
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,320
As we get older, unfortunately our nervous system declines in its health.

88
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,680
So there was a metric in microdose.me, and when we surveyed these thousands of people,

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,360
there was a statistic that jumped out.

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,000
Now it did not jump out with young people, you know, 20 to 55 year olds in that range,

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,240
but 55 plus year olds, there was a startling result that caught our researchers by surprise.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,840
And when they did the analysis, there was a finger tapping test.

93
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,680
How quickly can you tap the first two fingers in 10 seconds?

94
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,400
So when you're young, you can do it really fast, when you get older, you do it slower.

95
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:52,440
This is a test that is used for charting neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's patients, dementia, Parkinson's,

96
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
traumatic brain injury.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,280
This is a common test.

98
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Many people listening to this have taken the tap test.

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:06,880
So the startling result was with psilocybin in any form, by itself with psilocybin mushrooms,

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,480
psilocybin with chocolate, psilocybin with anything else, nothing statistically increased

101
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,320
the frequency of tapping in 55 plus year olds, but one formulation, and that was called

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,600
the Stamets Stock.

103
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Psilocybin, niacin, lion's mane increased the tapping frequency of approximately 49 taps

104
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,760
to 68 taps in 30 days relatively quickly, with a p value of significance of p equals

105
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,320
0.004.

106
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,400
That means one chance in 250 that it's just random noise.

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,160
So there appears to be a quote, unquote, cause and effect.

108
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,600
When we saw that result, then I thought, well, what's the mechanisms of action, the modes

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,680
of action, neurologically what's happening?

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,000
So we started diving deep into the literature of the proteins that code for neurofactors,

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,200
including BDNF, which is brain derived neurotropic factors.

112
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,800
This is basically how brain neurons then are stimulated into regrowth, and we found

113
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,720
something shocking, absolutely bizarre.

114
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,640
Now people can see my talk, I encourage that you do that, but here's an example.

115
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:27,560
At micro dosing levels, psilocybin by itself stimulated none of these nerve growth factors.

116
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,680
Niacin by itself didn't stimulate any, and lion's mane did not stimulate any, zero plus

117
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,920
zero plus zero equals zero.

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, that's called the cumulative additive effect.

119
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,400
When we put these three together, it excited these proteins that then resulted in the stimulation

120
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,680
of nerve growth factors in BDNF.

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,160
So in this case, zero plus zero plus zero equals, for instance, 20.

122
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:03,120
So that synergy of the three components created something truly unexpected and surprising.

123
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,080
Now if you're a neurologist and a researcher, and you dose these nerve cells, for instance,

124
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,720
or these proteins with psilocybin at a micro dosing level, oh, no activity.

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,920
Moving on, because you think, oh, it has no activity.

126
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,720
I believe that niacin is a catalyst for nerve growth factors, stimulating the neurogenic

127
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,640
benefits of psilocybin.

128
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,760
This is also important because there's 11 clinical studies that are using niacin opposite

129
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
psilocybin.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,320
So psilocybin over here, niacin is there a quote unquote placebo.

131
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,200
So there are actually 180 degrees in opposition to my idea, not purposely, they're looking

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
for an active placebo.

133
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,600
I am teaching opposite of that.

134
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
I always like to go to the path not traveled.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm a contrarian by nature.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm an inventor and an innovator.

137
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
I think about this, I've been doing this, my first book on psilocybin came out 44 years

138
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
ago.

139
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,240
I've placed numerous species in the genus psilocybe.

140
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,120
I am immersed in this knowledge.

141
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,840
And when you study a subject as long as I have, you begin to question authority, question

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,840
conventional thinking, and that's been a story of my life actually, but I respect conventional

143
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
thinking.

144
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,960
I think it's an important foundation, but it always has to be adaptable to change and

145
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,480
creativity.

146
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,280
And so my contribution I think is showing that micro dosing with psilocybin works when

147
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,240
you can catalyze it with something like niacin and lion's mane that amplifies the potential

148
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,800
benefit where psilocybin by itself at low concentrations may not.

149
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,560
So that's where we're excited about micro dose.me.

150
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,200
We have clinical trials now planned and these observational studies can help inform clinicians

151
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,000
on how to design very good clinical trials.

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,440
So we do not know whether this is going to be clinically relevant or not.

153
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,040
That is yet to be proven, but we have three pillars of evidence now.

154
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,280
We have the TAP test.

155
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,640
What can explain that?

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,960
It's not expectancy, the placebo is not appropriate, so I just challenge any listener.

157
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,120
What can result in the increase in psychomotor skills compared to psilocybin by itself or

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,720
non micro dosers?

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,680
The only explanation that's feasible in my imagination, those of many neurologists I've

160
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,200
talked about is neurogenesis.

161
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,840
There's an increase in the neurological health of the patients or the individuals taking

162
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,920
these substances.

163
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,880
So that's one pillar of evidence.

164
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,600
The second pillar is these map kinases.

165
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,720
These are proteins when the substances dock with them, stimulate BDNF and NGF, brain derived

166
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,560
neurotropic factors and nerve growth factors.

167
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,600
I showed in my talk four or five examples of zero activity of the components stuck together

168
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
of massive activity.

169
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,640
In fact, we have more than 50 examples of this where there's no activity and massive

170
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,480
activity and we have hundreds of examples of synergy where one plus one plus one doesn't

171
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,800
equal three, but one plus one plus one equals 16.

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,040
So it's the entourage effect of amplification.

173
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,720
So we have that pillar of evidence.

174
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,680
The third pillar of evidence, which I didn't have time to show, is in vitro with brain

175
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,560
nerve cells growing.

176
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,560
We can actually dose those nerve cells with this combination of psilocybin, lion's mane

177
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,000
and nicotinic acid and we can see the proliferation of the nerves growing beyond baseline of any

178
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,960
one of those other components.

179
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,520
So those three pillars of evidence are a strong argument for creating clinical studies to

180
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
test this.

181
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,060
Now, keep this in mind and I didn't get a chance to explain this during my talk.

182
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,720
Think about all the confounders in this observational study.

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,840
Where are people buying their psilocybin?

184
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Underground market.

185
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,920
How was the potency of each one, each sample?

186
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,640
The majority, I think 78% of the people are taking a third of a gram to a tenth of a gram

187
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,520
of slosophy cubensis, golden tops dried.

188
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,320
So you have the variability of the dosage, you have the variability of the sources and

189
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,160
how much psilocybin is needed.

190
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,720
You have variability in the amount of niacin they're taking, you have variability in the

191
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,080
amount of lion's mane they're taking.

192
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,120
Now these three confounders logically would dilute significance.

193
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,520
The fact that we have such high significance for the TAP test suggests to me that the results

194
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,800
are understated compared to optimization.

195
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,720
If we can optimize each of those components, then the significance value should logically

196
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
increase.

197
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,720
So the fact that we have such a signal from the noise is truly, I think, an eye-opener.

198
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,280
And so my best supporters, by the way, many of you are skeptics, my best supporters have

199
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
been skeptics.

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,120
So I like to be taken to the mat, but I would advise all skeptics to be a little bit more

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,760
circumspect because I'm saying people say microdosing doesn't work.

202
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,040
Every study of microdosing doesn't follow the practices of microdosers in the real

203
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,200
world.

204
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,160
People are taking it for 30, 60 days, they're taking it three to five times a week and they're

205
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,160
doing sub-intoxication levels.

206
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,400
We report out of Brazil, you know, they're taking a half a gram.

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,720
They report 70% of the people could guess what the low dose was.

208
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
Well, that's unblinded.

209
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,960
We have 70% of the people knowing that they got the low dose.

210
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,000
By definition, a microdose is a sub-intoxication, but it's not sub-effect.

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,080
When you do microdosing, for instance, colors are a little bit more livelier, you're in a

212
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,400
better mood.

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
You're more compassionate.

214
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,440
Frankly, you're nicer.

215
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
So but it's not intoxication.

216
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,280
It's not like you slammed a beer or smoked a joint or something like that and you have

217
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,840
this change in your state of consciousness.

218
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,800
You have a heightened state of awareness and a heightened state of empathy and cordiality.

219
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
And this is why I believe that psilocybin makes nicer people.

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,400
And the meta studies that have come out showing that psilocybin is associated with a reduction

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
in crime, violence.

222
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,880
The only psychedelic associated with a reduction in opioid use disorder, and it's well known

223
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,760
that LSD and psilocybin use would reduce alcoholics use of alcohol.

224
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,120
Now there is a very good clinical study proving that.

225
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,400
So these observational studies do set the stage for clinical studies.

226
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,520
And think of this as paradigm shifting.

227
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,760
This is why psilocybin microdosing is available for the commons, it's affordable, it should

228
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,600
be available for the commons.

229
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
And if you go into a doctor's office, for instance, you go into a doctor's office to

230
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,640
get your blood pressure, very well established.

231
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,320
Just the act of going into the doctor's office elevates your blood pressure.

232
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,680
Well, that's expectancy, in this case negative.

233
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,920
You go to a doctor's office because you have an infection.

234
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Your expectancy as a doctor is going to give you a medicine that's going to help your infection.

235
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,040
So real world effects of medicines are enhanced by the expectancy of you going to an expert

236
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:41,120
and the act of you trying to take charge of your health by doing something about it.

237
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,080
So the overlaying and coefficient enhancement of expectancy to a real medicine is part of

238
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,520
the medicine's potency and the therapeutic benefit of that.

239
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,160
So when I see these people trying to draw lines between expectancy and real world medical

240
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,520
effects, you know, this is not a black and white situation, it's on a spectrum.

241
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:12,560
Moreover, when you take psilocybin at a high dose to say 30 to 50 milligrams of psilocybin,

242
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,080
the half life of psilocybin is two to three hours.

243
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,400
So by the next day, you're in a microdose.

244
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,800
So why I like microdosing, an increasing narrative is a macro dose, therapeutically, followed

245
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,040
by microdosing, is that you can re-stimulate the neurological pathways that now you've

246
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,720
created for a new view of reality, of your PTSD's resolution.

247
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,000
The Johns Hopkins study found that 14 months later the very active re-remembering was therapeutically

248
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
beneficial.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,640
Well, re-remembering is rekindling the neurological pathways that led to that memory and you have

250
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
a re-experiencing of it.

251
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,480
Microdosing also rekindles those pathways, not only for your memory of the experience,

252
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,600
but I believe from the activity, neurogenically, of visiting and reliving those pathways to

253
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,360
become more resonantly dominant and becomes now your new, you know, neurological system

254
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,880
for dealing with the world.

255
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,800
So this is a really exciting area of research.

256
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,080
I'm so honored to be a shepherd of this knowledge.

257
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,000
I really, really believe that this is generational knowledge.

258
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
We're all thought leaders.

259
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,640
The ecosystem here, the body intellect of knowledge at this conference, I think is really hopeful.

260
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
And at the same time, we have to be very careful about marginalization.

261
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
And marginalization is making these therapies too expensive.

262
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:45,720
You know, when you think about the root causes of so much of our crime, which much of it

263
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:54,280
is racist, much of it is the rich versus the poor, the people who have access to medical

264
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,000
system support versus those who do not, that's economic.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,920
So it's important if we want to help heal society and to reduce crime, that the universality

266
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,840
of access of these medicines are made available.

267
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,320
Microdosing allows that.

268
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,280
So what's your vision of the future of psychedelics?

269
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,920
How do you see this failed in like 10 years?

270
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,880
I would see microdosing being a new tropic vitamin, be closely associated and proven

271
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,480
with a massive reduction in crime, saving governments and saving victims, saving families,

272
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,800
you know, hardship, money.

273
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,400
I mean, what government official here is opposed to the reduction of crime?

274
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,480
Hopefully there's none, right?

275
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,000
I would hope there's none.

276
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,840
There is one they should dose on psilocybin, they would change their mind.

277
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:57,840
So I would see the future that, you know, throughout society, people would recognize

278
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,800
that the use of psilocybin, macrodosing for PTSD and all these other traumatic mental

279
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,320
health challenges, but so much of us are healthy mentally.

280
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,480
And moreover, microdosing, I think, can prevent crime, prevent PTSD.

281
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,800
It's one thing to treat the illness after the fact, but it's a much greater benefit

282
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,240
to prevent that illness from even occurring in the first place.

283
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,240
If you are a person who, unfortunately, there is generational abuse, I've seen it, even

284
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,640
within my own family, children who are abused tend to grow up to be adults that abuse.

285
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
This is just a known fact.

286
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,200
If you can resolve your issues and not become a perpetrator to pass on this generational

287
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,240
violence behavior, then you can prevent victims in the future.

288
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,240
So I see psilocybin and microdosing as preventing PTSD, preventing criminal behavior.

289
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,560
And I'm moreover, not only do I think psilocybin makes nicer people, but I believe psilocybin

290
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,560
makes smarter, more intelligent people, especially as they age.

291
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,200
Do you think that you became smarter and nicer because you used psilocybin?

292
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
That's a very self-serving question.

293
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,120
You're asking my ego if I thought I'm smarter because they use psilocybin.

294
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,240
Of course I think I'm smarter.

295
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,080
But then I have to say, well, wait, is that delusional?

296
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,680
I mean, this is where you're asking kind of the impossible-to-answer question without

297
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,720
showing bias.

298
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,480
And speaking of bias, we're all biased.

299
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
We're all biased.

300
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
We all have egos.

301
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
We all have interests.

302
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Show me a person who's not biased.

303
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,440
Even professors at universities, if they do not publish, they will not get tenure.

304
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,800
And they can put on their slides they have no conflicts of interest.

305
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,120
Yeah, they do.

306
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,800
Every single professor here who said they have no conflicts of interest are hypocritical.

307
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,320
They have to publish in order to have tenure.

308
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,480
So every person studying the subject has an internal bias because they have an interest

309
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,080
in the subject.

310
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,580
They're motivated.

311
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,880
They want to do studies.

312
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,040
They know if the studies get published, then their position of employment within the university

313
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,720
is better than that, which they would not.

314
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,000
So people should be a little more circumspect.

315
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,720
Take a step back.

316
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,120
If you are a human, you have bias.

317
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,280
You have bias for food when you're hungry, bias for medicines, bias for your friends,

318
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,360
bias for people you want to associate with, bias comes with a human condition.

319
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:46,240
The question becomes, is that bias such that it is not beneficial for the general population

320
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,760
or is it idiosyncratically specific to certain individual and personality types?

321
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
Now you can dial this down now.

322
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,280
This is something that probably will be disambiguated better in the future when we have more targeted

323
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,880
individual therapies customized.

324
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:09,600
But right now, throughout a general population, we're seeing that the effects are beneficial

325
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,160
with very strong signals right now from the noise and the chaos of the general population,

326
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,960
both with healthy normals and with individuals with mental health challenges.

327
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
We all have mental health challenges.

328
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,640
We're all in a spectrum.

329
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Right now, don't you have a little voice in your head thinking about your next question?

330
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,680
Did you wake up and go, oh, when I was eight years old, I really wish I hadn't taken that

331
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,600
toy away from my friend and was so mean to him?

332
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,640
I mean, we're all self-reflecting.

333
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
We're all self-diagnosing.

334
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,240
It's just when your self-diagnostic tools are not adequate to treat the condition that

335
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,160
it's important you seek an expert's health.

336
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,600
So we're all involved in the spectrum, macro-dosing, the micro-dosing is a spectrum.

337
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
People should be much more careful in saying that micro-dosing doesn't work.

338
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,320
And I just wish people would be a little bit more careful in their languaging because

339
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,800
I think this is a spectrum.

340
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,240
You mentioned that your first book was published in 1978.

341
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
That was the year when I was born.

342
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,880
So you have been waiting a lot to this time when it seems that it becomes real, right?

343
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,120
So how do you feel about this new psychedelic renaissance and do you think there is a risk

344
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,240
of a new backlash after this?

345
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, there's always a danger in renaissance.

346
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
Having by definition, it's a revolution against the conventional wisdom.

347
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,520
What is really different now than in 1978, when I published my first book, is the absence

348
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,720
of paranoia.

349
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,400
That's a stressor.

350
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,680
That causes anxiety.

351
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:59,520
With us early adopters, and even with indigenous people, when the Christians and the Catholics

352
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,760
came to Mesoamerica and they brought their diseases and their advanced weapons and their

353
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:16,360
sailing ships, that domination and suppression of indigenous wisdom and religion caused a

354
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,200
mass amount of course anxiety and harm.

355
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:28,160
And so societal pressures against us early adopters and people who are thought leaders

356
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,480
really carrying the torch forward of indigenous people all over the world.

357
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,600
We are not now under the same pressure from society to be as paranoid as we were back

358
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,320
then.

359
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:49,080
You do not know, and most people listening do not know, the state of heightened paranoia

360
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,920
and concern and anxiety that the government any minute could break down your doors and

361
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
arrest you.

362
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,600
And to me, the use of psilocybin and psychedelics is a civil right.

363
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,360
It's a freedom of consciousness right.

364
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,600
No government in the world has a right to your freedom of consciousness.

365
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,960
That is your born right.

366
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:22,240
And yet you espouse these rights and it challenges laws and religion and other people who are

367
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,040
in positions of power, they feel threatened by individual freedoms.

368
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,240
So to me, this is a civil right issue fundamentally.

369
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,520
You have a freedom of right to your own consciousness.

370
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,840
If you can improve it, then you have the right to make that choice.

371
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,360
No government should take that choice away from you.

372
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,640
Thank you very much.

373
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,160
Is there anything you would like to add or did I ask everything?

374
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,200
I would add one more thing.

375
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,040
What's very different about psilocybin mushrooms than peyote, for instance, and the peyote

376
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,560
way is something that I think should remain with indigenous people, the yaki and other

377
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,120
related, you know, first nations, especially in North America.

378
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:16,280
That plant is fragile, it takes a long time to grow, sustainability doesn't look likely

379
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:24,840
in the near term and over harvesting jeopardizes indigenous knowledge and indigenous practices.

380
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Peyote is very different than psilocybin mushrooms.

381
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:34,560
There's 116 known species of psilocybin mushrooms that grow around the world, from the North

382
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,440
Pole to the South Pole, you know, and those margins.

383
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:48,840
And in each or many of those ecosystems, indigenous people from Mesoamerica, from Ireland, from

384
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Germany, in Japan, psilocybin mushrooms are known as laughing mushrooms.

385
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,600
That's been a name that's been around for hundreds of years.

386
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:05,560
So every group who's lived in close associated with the ecosystem is likely to have a history

387
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,440
of contact with psilocybin mushrooms.

388
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,160
So Maria Sabina, the great Mazatec shaman, mycologist, she was a mycologist, it gives

389
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:20,720
a huge amount of credit, she introduced psilocybin zapatachorum to the West.

390
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,600
90% of the people using psilocybin mushrooms are using psilocybin cubensis, a mushroom

391
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,520
that Maria Sabina did not use.

392
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,680
And it grows in the tropics, from Florida, or subtropics, Florida, Guatemala, grows in

393
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,480
Thailand, it grows in Australia, it grows throughout Africa, the moisture reasons of Africa.

394
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:51,160
So when you understand that psilocybin mushrooms are not only more biodiverse than peyote, but

395
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,000
you can grow them sustainably.

396
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,080
It checks all the boxes in terms of not being cultural appropriation, having universality

397
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,280
of use across many cultures growing in many different regions of the world.

398
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:13,760
So I think this is a bridge between cultures and continents and throughout centuries.

399
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,560
There is a narrative new to me, but it came out out of British Columbia years ago, and

400
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:28,440
it's one of the elders of an indigenous clan in Canada was challenged by one of the parents.

401
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,400
Why should we send our indigenous children to be educated by Westerners, by the European

402
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,440
educational system?

403
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,120
And this elder who I think was very wise, he says, because we need two eyes to see, two

404
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
eyes seen.

405
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,240
We need the western eye of science.

406
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,880
We need indigenous wisdom for making sure that science respects nature and generational

407
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,440
knowledge.

408
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,480
So we went to a first indigenous conference and a good friend of ours who is a leader

409
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
in this movement.

410
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
She's indigenous.

411
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,960
She's actually half Irish, half Native American, and one of her elders stood up and she goes,

412
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
I love two-eyed seeing.

413
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,520
And she said, I'm not taking away my iPhone for my 12-year-old daughter.

414
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,680
That would create chaos in my life.

415
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,680
But I think this is an example where with two eyes we can see better.

416
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,280
We need to respect indigenous wisdom.

417
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,440
All wisdom is built upon by experience.

418
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,720
Everment contributes to the growing body and elective knowledge.

419
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,800
This is what this conference is about, and I think we have to always walk forward with

420
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,240
two eyes seen.

421
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,480
One of the characters in the new Star Trek Discovery was modeled after you, and in this

422
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,360
show there is the Mycelian network that helps people to travel through space and time.

423
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Do you believe that one time this will be a reality?

424
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah, this Star Trek series discovery, the ten or so writers called me up and said we're

425
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,680
in the dungeon, we're running Star Trek, give us some ideas, and I told them to turn

426
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
on their tape recorder.

427
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm a Star Trek fan, and I just gave them about an hour and a half, two hours of just

428
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,920
stream of consciousness talking about the Mycelian network and how networks are self-creating

429
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,160
in the Mycelian network, the neurological network, the computer internet network, the

430
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,440
organization of dark matter and dark energy and space, all are built upon this same sort

431
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,800
of structure that allows ease elasticity, that has many end points of contact, that can

432
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,280
constantly experiment with successes, and if there is a success, the information backchannels

433
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,960
and by definition it grows, and so I talked about then entering into hyperspace, into

434
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,640
the microverse, into the multiverse using psilocybin, and one of the messages many of

435
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:10,760
us get is the universality of being, that we exist within one giant consciousness, and

436
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:18,680
being able to understand that can allow us to be able to cross into different dimensions

437
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,080
without using the envelope of our bodies as a limiting factor.

438
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:32,120
So to answer your question, yes, I do believe that these are portables for us to enter into

439
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,800
the multiverse.

440
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:45,640
The very words that I'm using are constricted because I don't have the vocabulary to articulate

441
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,600
what that may mean, but I think that vocabulary now is being built.

442
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Every single person journeying on psilocybin is contributing to that vocabulary, so I think

443
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,800
it is time for humans to ascend into a new species, it is time critical that we do so,

444
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,360
we have a moral, ethical, and evolutionary responsibility.

445
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:16,040
We've been handed this responsibility, it is ours to lose, and we're at an adjunction.

446
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,920
We make the decision to live or the decision to die, it is literally that binary.

447
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,840
And I think most of us want to choose the path that brings more babies and smiles on

448
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,040
people's faces and more camaraderie and more enrichness of culture and ideas.

449
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:45,080
I've always thought that wealth is not money, it's not materialism, it's the optionality

450
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,360
of having freedom of choices.

451
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,760
The more freedoms of choices you have, the wealthier you are because you have alternatives.

452
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,920
Restricting those restricts again your civil rights and your rights as a species to continue

453
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,520
to evolve.
