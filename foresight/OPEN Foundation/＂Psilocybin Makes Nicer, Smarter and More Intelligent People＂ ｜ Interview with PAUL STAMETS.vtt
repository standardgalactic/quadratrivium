00:00.000 --> 00:11.320
You famously said that mushrooms can help humanity to save the world.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.760
Can you elaborate on that?

00:14.760 --> 00:24.440
Well, I think those of us who've journeyed with a high dose of psilocybin, so I'm only

00:24.440 --> 00:27.520
speaking to a subset of the audience here.

00:27.520 --> 00:35.520
But those of us who've done these journeys, a very common theme is we realize that we're

00:35.520 --> 00:41.760
a species that has an obligation to help save the planet, the biodiversity, the ecosystems

00:41.760 --> 00:43.260
and nature.

00:43.260 --> 00:50.160
Nature is calling out to us to open up our eyes to our responsibility as Earth citizens

00:50.160 --> 00:55.160
to be responsible in protecting the commons.

00:55.160 --> 01:02.240
And unfortunately, because of capitalism, religion, you know, all sorts of other factors,

01:02.240 --> 01:10.640
our vision has become so narrowed for just self-indulgence, self-profiteering.

01:10.640 --> 01:19.320
And the understanding of sharing for the commons has unfortunately retreated in the priorities

01:19.320 --> 01:22.680
of many human activities.

01:22.680 --> 01:30.120
You know, I do believe in the principles of capitalism insofar that individuals should

01:30.120 --> 01:34.520
be rewarded for their extraordinary efforts.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.160
So you have to be incentivized.

01:37.160 --> 01:43.880
But once you are incentivized and you do get ahead, you have a very, I think a very strong

01:43.880 --> 01:49.400
obligation to help others who are in need, because I think the lessons of evolution is

01:49.400 --> 01:56.000
not the survival of the fittest, but the sharing of surplus beyond your own needs to help your

01:56.000 --> 02:00.520
neighbors and help others who are less advantaged.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.440
So the message that I'm getting from self-sabotten mushrooms is the important role that humans

02:05.440 --> 02:14.000
play today in being able to provide for the health of the ecosystem for everyone.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.760
The common phrase is that a rising tide raises all boats.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.080
But it's much more sophisticated than that.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.240
We have an ethical responsibility.

02:24.240 --> 02:31.000
We are here now because of evolutionary smart choices over millions of years.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.840
But we're at a time critical moment that if we don't make smarter choices now, then

02:37.840 --> 02:41.720
species extinction for humans is very plausible.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.400
Now some people might say, no, that's not possible.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.640
Look at the evolutionary record.

02:46.640 --> 02:52.720
More than 99% of the species that have existed on this planet are extinct.

02:52.720 --> 02:58.960
Extinction is a natural consequence of evolution for those organisms who are not able to adapt

02:58.960 --> 03:00.360
to change.

03:00.360 --> 03:08.160
The fact that we are contaminating the ecosystem that gives us life is destroying our descendants'

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
future.

03:09.160 --> 03:15.040
And so I feel a very strong obligation to our descendants, calling back in time, saying

03:15.040 --> 03:22.960
we are at our pivotal moment to make a decisions that affect our future for literally thousands

03:22.960 --> 03:25.280
of years going forward.

03:25.280 --> 03:32.160
So now, from a practical point of view, OK, most people would accept that logically.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.920
But what does this mean?

03:33.920 --> 03:40.080
Our research with psilocybin and psilocybin analogs shows that it profoundly stimulates

03:40.080 --> 03:45.080
neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurogeneration, neuroregeneration.

03:45.080 --> 03:50.480
Those are four separate forms of neuron enhancement.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.920
And we can see this now very clearly in vitro.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.680
We are involved in microdosing.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.480
We published in Nature Scientific Reports two articles on microdosing, the latest June

04:01.480 --> 04:04.400
30th, 2022.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.160
And it's extraordinary how many people are microdosing.

04:07.160 --> 04:16.480
And this app that we co-develop called microdose.me, people self-report their behaviors, how often

04:16.480 --> 04:23.000
they use psilocybin, what do they stack it with, what's their motivation, what's their

04:23.000 --> 04:26.200
income, what's their race, what's their sexual preference.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.840
So it's a very interesting population study.

04:29.840 --> 04:35.120
And the reason why the peer reviewers at Nature were so excited about our manuscript as our

04:35.120 --> 04:37.120
data set is very large.

04:37.120 --> 04:46.240
The first paper, November 28th, 2021, had a survey of more than 8,000 people.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.960
More than 4,100 were non-microdosers.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.160
That was a shock to us.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.320
Non-microdosers were motivated to sign up at microdose.me.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.520
I think because they wanted to get a baseline, citizen scientists want to go, okay, before

05:00.520 --> 05:04.560
I start microdosing, I want to see what my baseline level is.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.200
And then you microdose without contrast.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.000
So we had about 4,100 non-microdosers, a little over 4,000 microdosers.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
Predominantly in North America, microdosing is with psilocybin.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.560
Here in Europe is more common with LSD.

05:20.560 --> 05:29.440
So in our microdosing study, over 55% of the people microdosing with psilocybin stack it.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.560
What stacking means is that you have an admixture.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.440
You add something else to the psilocybin.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.240
And a variety of substances are added, chocolate.

05:40.240 --> 05:47.320
I hypothesized a formula stacking psilocybin mushrooms with niacin, nicotinic acid, the

05:47.320 --> 05:50.320
flushing form, and lion's mane.

05:50.320 --> 05:57.840
And I proposed this stack because psilocybin is a vasoconstrictor, niacin is a vasodilator.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.820
Also when you take the flushing form of niacin, your nerve endings get excited.

06:02.820 --> 06:08.320
So I thought with neuropathies, oftentimes present themselves as deadening of the extremities,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.440
the fingertips and the toes.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.640
And so when you have neurodegeneration and neuropathies, you have vasoconstriction, blood

06:15.640 --> 06:18.800
vessels choke off, nerves die.

06:18.800 --> 06:26.520
So I thought with vasodilation with niacin, it could deliver the benefits of psilocybin

06:26.520 --> 06:29.360
to the endpoints of the peripheral nervous system.

06:29.360 --> 06:37.420
So then lion's mane, it's been well studied that lion's mane regenerates myelin on the

06:37.420 --> 06:38.920
axons of nerves.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.520
These are the conductive sheath.

06:41.520 --> 06:47.240
So I bundled these together for the hypothesis that these would have an entourage effect

06:47.240 --> 06:53.680
of stimulation for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.320
Now it's not just diseases, it's age.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.960
New news to everyone.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.960
We get older.

06:59.960 --> 07:05.320
As we get older, unfortunately our nervous system declines in its health.

07:05.320 --> 07:12.680
So there was a metric in microdose.me, and when we surveyed these thousands of people,

07:12.680 --> 07:15.360
there was a statistic that jumped out.

07:15.360 --> 07:21.000
Now it did not jump out with young people, you know, 20 to 55 year olds in that range,

07:21.000 --> 07:29.240
but 55 plus year olds, there was a startling result that caught our researchers by surprise.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.840
And when they did the analysis, there was a finger tapping test.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.680
How quickly can you tap the first two fingers in 10 seconds?

07:38.680 --> 07:43.400
So when you're young, you can do it really fast, when you get older, you do it slower.

07:43.400 --> 07:52.440
This is a test that is used for charting neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's patients, dementia, Parkinson's,

07:52.440 --> 07:54.120
traumatic brain injury.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.280
This is a common test.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.760
Many people listening to this have taken the tap test.

07:58.760 --> 08:06.880
So the startling result was with psilocybin in any form, by itself with psilocybin mushrooms,

08:06.880 --> 08:11.480
psilocybin with chocolate, psilocybin with anything else, nothing statistically increased

08:11.480 --> 08:17.320
the frequency of tapping in 55 plus year olds, but one formulation, and that was called

08:17.320 --> 08:18.600
the Stamets Stock.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.720
Psilocybin, niacin, lion's mane increased the tapping frequency of approximately 49 taps

08:24.720 --> 08:31.760
to 68 taps in 30 days relatively quickly, with a p value of significance of p equals

08:31.760 --> 08:33.320
0.004.

08:33.320 --> 08:38.400
That means one chance in 250 that it's just random noise.

08:38.400 --> 08:43.160
So there appears to be a quote, unquote, cause and effect.

08:43.160 --> 08:48.600
When we saw that result, then I thought, well, what's the mechanisms of action, the modes

08:48.600 --> 08:52.680
of action, neurologically what's happening?

08:52.680 --> 09:00.000
So we started diving deep into the literature of the proteins that code for neurofactors,

09:00.000 --> 09:05.200
including BDNF, which is brain derived neurotropic factors.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.800
This is basically how brain neurons then are stimulated into regrowth, and we found

09:09.800 --> 09:12.720
something shocking, absolutely bizarre.

09:12.720 --> 09:18.640
Now people can see my talk, I encourage that you do that, but here's an example.

09:18.640 --> 09:27.560
At micro dosing levels, psilocybin by itself stimulated none of these nerve growth factors.

09:27.560 --> 09:34.680
Niacin by itself didn't stimulate any, and lion's mane did not stimulate any, zero plus

09:34.680 --> 09:36.920
zero plus zero equals zero.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.600
Well, that's called the cumulative additive effect.

09:40.600 --> 09:48.400
When we put these three together, it excited these proteins that then resulted in the stimulation

09:48.400 --> 09:50.680
of nerve growth factors in BDNF.

09:50.680 --> 09:55.160
So in this case, zero plus zero plus zero equals, for instance, 20.

09:55.160 --> 10:03.120
So that synergy of the three components created something truly unexpected and surprising.

10:03.120 --> 10:10.080
Now if you're a neurologist and a researcher, and you dose these nerve cells, for instance,

10:10.080 --> 10:16.720
or these proteins with psilocybin at a micro dosing level, oh, no activity.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.920
Moving on, because you think, oh, it has no activity.

10:19.920 --> 10:25.720
I believe that niacin is a catalyst for nerve growth factors, stimulating the neurogenic

10:25.720 --> 10:27.640
benefits of psilocybin.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.760
This is also important because there's 11 clinical studies that are using niacin opposite

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
psilocybin.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.320
So psilocybin over here, niacin is there a quote unquote placebo.

10:37.320 --> 10:44.200
So there are actually 180 degrees in opposition to my idea, not purposely, they're looking

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
for an active placebo.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.600
I am teaching opposite of that.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.000
I always like to go to the path not traveled.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm a contrarian by nature.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.720
I'm an inventor and an innovator.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.600
I think about this, I've been doing this, my first book on psilocybin came out 44 years

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
ago.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.240
I've placed numerous species in the genus psilocybe.

11:05.240 --> 11:09.120
I am immersed in this knowledge.

11:09.120 --> 11:15.840
And when you study a subject as long as I have, you begin to question authority, question

11:15.840 --> 11:20.840
conventional thinking, and that's been a story of my life actually, but I respect conventional

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
thinking.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.960
I think it's an important foundation, but it always has to be adaptable to change and

11:25.960 --> 11:27.480
creativity.

11:27.480 --> 11:34.280
And so my contribution I think is showing that micro dosing with psilocybin works when

11:34.280 --> 11:40.240
you can catalyze it with something like niacin and lion's mane that amplifies the potential

11:40.240 --> 11:45.800
benefit where psilocybin by itself at low concentrations may not.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.560
So that's where we're excited about micro dose.me.

11:48.560 --> 11:55.200
We have clinical trials now planned and these observational studies can help inform clinicians

11:55.200 --> 11:59.000
on how to design very good clinical trials.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.440
So we do not know whether this is going to be clinically relevant or not.

12:03.440 --> 12:08.040
That is yet to be proven, but we have three pillars of evidence now.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.280
We have the TAP test.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.640
What can explain that?

12:11.640 --> 12:19.960
It's not expectancy, the placebo is not appropriate, so I just challenge any listener.

12:19.960 --> 12:24.120
What can result in the increase in psychomotor skills compared to psilocybin by itself or

12:24.120 --> 12:26.720
non micro dosers?

12:26.720 --> 12:32.680
The only explanation that's feasible in my imagination, those of many neurologists I've

12:32.680 --> 12:35.200
talked about is neurogenesis.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.840
There's an increase in the neurological health of the patients or the individuals taking

12:39.840 --> 12:40.920
these substances.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.880
So that's one pillar of evidence.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.600
The second pillar is these map kinases.

12:45.600 --> 12:51.720
These are proteins when the substances dock with them, stimulate BDNF and NGF, brain derived

12:51.720 --> 12:57.560
neurotropic factors and nerve growth factors.

12:57.560 --> 13:04.600
I showed in my talk four or five examples of zero activity of the components stuck together

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
of massive activity.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.640
In fact, we have more than 50 examples of this where there's no activity and massive

13:10.640 --> 13:17.480
activity and we have hundreds of examples of synergy where one plus one plus one doesn't

13:17.480 --> 13:21.800
equal three, but one plus one plus one equals 16.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.040
So it's the entourage effect of amplification.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.720
So we have that pillar of evidence.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.680
The third pillar of evidence, which I didn't have time to show, is in vitro with brain

13:31.680 --> 13:33.560
nerve cells growing.

13:33.560 --> 13:39.560
We can actually dose those nerve cells with this combination of psilocybin, lion's mane

13:39.560 --> 13:46.000
and nicotinic acid and we can see the proliferation of the nerves growing beyond baseline of any

13:46.000 --> 13:47.960
one of those other components.

13:47.960 --> 13:54.520
So those three pillars of evidence are a strong argument for creating clinical studies to

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
test this.

13:55.520 --> 14:00.060
Now, keep this in mind and I didn't get a chance to explain this during my talk.

14:00.060 --> 14:03.720
Think about all the confounders in this observational study.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.840
Where are people buying their psilocybin?

14:05.840 --> 14:06.840
Underground market.

14:06.840 --> 14:10.920
How was the potency of each one, each sample?

14:10.920 --> 14:16.640
The majority, I think 78% of the people are taking a third of a gram to a tenth of a gram

14:16.640 --> 14:20.520
of slosophy cubensis, golden tops dried.

14:20.520 --> 14:25.320
So you have the variability of the dosage, you have the variability of the sources and

14:25.320 --> 14:27.160
how much psilocybin is needed.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.720
You have variability in the amount of niacin they're taking, you have variability in the

14:30.720 --> 14:33.080
amount of lion's mane they're taking.

14:33.080 --> 14:38.120
Now these three confounders logically would dilute significance.

14:38.120 --> 14:43.520
The fact that we have such high significance for the TAP test suggests to me that the results

14:43.520 --> 14:46.800
are understated compared to optimization.

14:46.800 --> 14:52.720
If we can optimize each of those components, then the significance value should logically

14:52.720 --> 14:54.120
increase.

14:54.120 --> 15:00.720
So the fact that we have such a signal from the noise is truly, I think, an eye-opener.

15:00.720 --> 15:07.280
And so my best supporters, by the way, many of you are skeptics, my best supporters have

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
been skeptics.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.120
So I like to be taken to the mat, but I would advise all skeptics to be a little bit more

15:13.120 --> 15:16.760
circumspect because I'm saying people say microdosing doesn't work.

15:16.760 --> 15:21.040
Every study of microdosing doesn't follow the practices of microdosers in the real

15:21.040 --> 15:22.200
world.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.160
People are taking it for 30, 60 days, they're taking it three to five times a week and they're

15:26.160 --> 15:29.160
doing sub-intoxication levels.

15:29.160 --> 15:33.400
We report out of Brazil, you know, they're taking a half a gram.

15:33.400 --> 15:38.720
They report 70% of the people could guess what the low dose was.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.320
Well, that's unblinded.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.960
We have 70% of the people knowing that they got the low dose.

15:44.960 --> 15:51.000
By definition, a microdose is a sub-intoxication, but it's not sub-effect.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.080
When you do microdosing, for instance, colors are a little bit more livelier, you're in a

15:58.080 --> 16:00.400
better mood.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.800
You're more compassionate.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.440
Frankly, you're nicer.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.000
So but it's not intoxication.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.280
It's not like you slammed a beer or smoked a joint or something like that and you have

16:12.280 --> 16:15.840
this change in your state of consciousness.

16:15.840 --> 16:22.800
You have a heightened state of awareness and a heightened state of empathy and cordiality.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.320
And this is why I believe that psilocybin makes nicer people.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.400
And the meta studies that have come out showing that psilocybin is associated with a reduction

16:30.400 --> 16:33.280
in crime, violence.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.880
The only psychedelic associated with a reduction in opioid use disorder, and it's well known

16:37.880 --> 16:43.760
that LSD and psilocybin use would reduce alcoholics use of alcohol.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.120
Now there is a very good clinical study proving that.

16:47.120 --> 16:52.400
So these observational studies do set the stage for clinical studies.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.520
And think of this as paradigm shifting.

16:55.520 --> 17:00.760
This is why psilocybin microdosing is available for the commons, it's affordable, it should

17:00.760 --> 17:03.600
be available for the commons.

17:03.600 --> 17:08.400
And if you go into a doctor's office, for instance, you go into a doctor's office to

17:08.400 --> 17:11.640
get your blood pressure, very well established.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.320
Just the act of going into the doctor's office elevates your blood pressure.

17:15.320 --> 17:19.680
Well, that's expectancy, in this case negative.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.920
You go to a doctor's office because you have an infection.

17:22.920 --> 17:27.680
Your expectancy as a doctor is going to give you a medicine that's going to help your infection.

17:27.680 --> 17:35.040
So real world effects of medicines are enhanced by the expectancy of you going to an expert

17:35.040 --> 17:41.120
and the act of you trying to take charge of your health by doing something about it.

17:41.120 --> 17:48.080
So the overlaying and coefficient enhancement of expectancy to a real medicine is part of

17:48.080 --> 17:52.520
the medicine's potency and the therapeutic benefit of that.

17:52.520 --> 17:57.160
So when I see these people trying to draw lines between expectancy and real world medical

17:57.160 --> 18:02.520
effects, you know, this is not a black and white situation, it's on a spectrum.

18:02.520 --> 18:12.560
Moreover, when you take psilocybin at a high dose to say 30 to 50 milligrams of psilocybin,

18:12.560 --> 18:16.080
the half life of psilocybin is two to three hours.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.400
So by the next day, you're in a microdose.

18:19.400 --> 18:24.800
So why I like microdosing, an increasing narrative is a macro dose, therapeutically, followed

18:24.800 --> 18:31.040
by microdosing, is that you can re-stimulate the neurological pathways that now you've

18:31.040 --> 18:36.720
created for a new view of reality, of your PTSD's resolution.

18:36.720 --> 18:43.000
The Johns Hopkins study found that 14 months later the very active re-remembering was therapeutically

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
beneficial.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.640
Well, re-remembering is rekindling the neurological pathways that led to that memory and you have

18:48.640 --> 18:50.880
a re-experiencing of it.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.480
Microdosing also rekindles those pathways, not only for your memory of the experience,

18:55.480 --> 19:01.600
but I believe from the activity, neurogenically, of visiting and reliving those pathways to

19:01.600 --> 19:07.360
become more resonantly dominant and becomes now your new, you know, neurological system

19:07.360 --> 19:09.880
for dealing with the world.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.800
So this is a really exciting area of research.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.080
I'm so honored to be a shepherd of this knowledge.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.000
I really, really believe that this is generational knowledge.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.080
We're all thought leaders.

19:21.080 --> 19:28.640
The ecosystem here, the body intellect of knowledge at this conference, I think is really hopeful.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.880
And at the same time, we have to be very careful about marginalization.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.480
And marginalization is making these therapies too expensive.

19:36.480 --> 19:45.720
You know, when you think about the root causes of so much of our crime, which much of it

19:45.720 --> 19:54.280
is racist, much of it is the rich versus the poor, the people who have access to medical

19:54.280 --> 19:59.000
system support versus those who do not, that's economic.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.920
So it's important if we want to help heal society and to reduce crime, that the universality

20:06.920 --> 20:10.840
of access of these medicines are made available.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.320
Microdosing allows that.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.280
So what's your vision of the future of psychedelics?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.920
How do you see this failed in like 10 years?

20:17.920 --> 20:22.880
I would see microdosing being a new tropic vitamin, be closely associated and proven

20:22.880 --> 20:30.480
with a massive reduction in crime, saving governments and saving victims, saving families,

20:30.480 --> 20:33.800
you know, hardship, money.

20:33.800 --> 20:38.400
I mean, what government official here is opposed to the reduction of crime?

20:38.400 --> 20:41.480
Hopefully there's none, right?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.000
I would hope there's none.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.840
There is one they should dose on psilocybin, they would change their mind.

20:47.840 --> 20:57.840
So I would see the future that, you know, throughout society, people would recognize

20:57.840 --> 21:03.800
that the use of psilocybin, macrodosing for PTSD and all these other traumatic mental

21:03.800 --> 21:10.320
health challenges, but so much of us are healthy mentally.

21:10.320 --> 21:16.480
And moreover, microdosing, I think, can prevent crime, prevent PTSD.

21:16.480 --> 21:21.800
It's one thing to treat the illness after the fact, but it's a much greater benefit

21:21.800 --> 21:26.240
to prevent that illness from even occurring in the first place.

21:26.240 --> 21:32.240
If you are a person who, unfortunately, there is generational abuse, I've seen it, even

21:32.240 --> 21:38.640
within my own family, children who are abused tend to grow up to be adults that abuse.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.720
This is just a known fact.

21:40.720 --> 21:47.200
If you can resolve your issues and not become a perpetrator to pass on this generational

21:47.200 --> 21:52.240
violence behavior, then you can prevent victims in the future.

21:52.240 --> 22:00.240
So I see psilocybin and microdosing as preventing PTSD, preventing criminal behavior.

22:00.240 --> 22:05.560
And I'm moreover, not only do I think psilocybin makes nicer people, but I believe psilocybin

22:05.560 --> 22:10.560
makes smarter, more intelligent people, especially as they age.

22:10.560 --> 22:15.200
Do you think that you became smarter and nicer because you used psilocybin?

22:15.200 --> 22:18.080
That's a very self-serving question.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.120
You're asking my ego if I thought I'm smarter because they use psilocybin.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.240
Of course I think I'm smarter.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.080
But then I have to say, well, wait, is that delusional?

22:27.080 --> 22:32.680
I mean, this is where you're asking kind of the impossible-to-answer question without

22:32.680 --> 22:34.720
showing bias.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.480
And speaking of bias, we're all biased.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.480
We're all biased.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.480
We all have egos.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.120
We all have interests.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.800
Show me a person who's not biased.

22:42.800 --> 22:48.440
Even professors at universities, if they do not publish, they will not get tenure.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.800
And they can put on their slides they have no conflicts of interest.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.120
Yeah, they do.

22:54.120 --> 22:59.800
Every single professor here who said they have no conflicts of interest are hypocritical.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.320
They have to publish in order to have tenure.

23:02.320 --> 23:07.480
So every person studying the subject has an internal bias because they have an interest

23:07.480 --> 23:09.080
in the subject.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.580
They're motivated.

23:10.580 --> 23:11.880
They want to do studies.

23:11.880 --> 23:17.040
They know if the studies get published, then their position of employment within the university

23:17.040 --> 23:19.720
is better than that, which they would not.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.000
So people should be a little more circumspect.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.720
Take a step back.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.120
If you are a human, you have bias.

23:28.120 --> 23:32.280
You have bias for food when you're hungry, bias for medicines, bias for your friends,

23:32.280 --> 23:37.360
bias for people you want to associate with, bias comes with a human condition.

23:37.360 --> 23:46.240
The question becomes, is that bias such that it is not beneficial for the general population

23:46.240 --> 23:51.760
or is it idiosyncratically specific to certain individual and personality types?

23:51.760 --> 23:54.000
Now you can dial this down now.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.280
This is something that probably will be disambiguated better in the future when we have more targeted

23:59.280 --> 24:01.880
individual therapies customized.

24:01.880 --> 24:09.600
But right now, throughout a general population, we're seeing that the effects are beneficial

24:09.600 --> 24:16.160
with very strong signals right now from the noise and the chaos of the general population,

24:16.160 --> 24:20.960
both with healthy normals and with individuals with mental health challenges.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.120
We all have mental health challenges.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.640
We're all in a spectrum.

24:25.640 --> 24:30.240
Right now, don't you have a little voice in your head thinking about your next question?

24:30.240 --> 24:34.680
Did you wake up and go, oh, when I was eight years old, I really wish I hadn't taken that

24:34.680 --> 24:37.600
toy away from my friend and was so mean to him?

24:37.600 --> 24:39.640
I mean, we're all self-reflecting.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.640
We're all self-diagnosing.

24:41.640 --> 24:47.240
It's just when your self-diagnostic tools are not adequate to treat the condition that

24:47.240 --> 24:50.160
it's important you seek an expert's health.

24:50.160 --> 24:55.600
So we're all involved in the spectrum, macro-dosing, the micro-dosing is a spectrum.

24:55.600 --> 25:00.000
People should be much more careful in saying that micro-dosing doesn't work.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.320
And I just wish people would be a little bit more careful in their languaging because

25:06.320 --> 25:08.800
I think this is a spectrum.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.240
You mentioned that your first book was published in 1978.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.200
That was the year when I was born.

25:15.200 --> 25:21.880
So you have been waiting a lot to this time when it seems that it becomes real, right?

25:21.880 --> 25:26.120
So how do you feel about this new psychedelic renaissance and do you think there is a risk

25:26.120 --> 25:28.240
of a new backlash after this?

25:28.880 --> 25:32.000
Well, there's always a danger in renaissance.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.120
Having by definition, it's a revolution against the conventional wisdom.

25:37.120 --> 25:44.520
What is really different now than in 1978, when I published my first book, is the absence

25:44.520 --> 25:46.720
of paranoia.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.400
That's a stressor.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.680
That causes anxiety.

25:50.680 --> 25:59.520
With us early adopters, and even with indigenous people, when the Christians and the Catholics

25:59.520 --> 26:05.760
came to Mesoamerica and they brought their diseases and their advanced weapons and their

26:05.760 --> 26:16.360
sailing ships, that domination and suppression of indigenous wisdom and religion caused a

26:16.360 --> 26:20.200
mass amount of course anxiety and harm.

26:20.200 --> 26:28.160
And so societal pressures against us early adopters and people who are thought leaders

26:28.160 --> 26:33.480
really carrying the torch forward of indigenous people all over the world.

26:33.480 --> 26:39.600
We are not now under the same pressure from society to be as paranoid as we were back

26:39.600 --> 26:41.320
then.

26:41.320 --> 26:49.080
You do not know, and most people listening do not know, the state of heightened paranoia

26:49.080 --> 26:54.920
and concern and anxiety that the government any minute could break down your doors and

26:54.920 --> 26:55.920
arrest you.

26:55.920 --> 27:02.600
And to me, the use of psilocybin and psychedelics is a civil right.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.360
It's a freedom of consciousness right.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.600
No government in the world has a right to your freedom of consciousness.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.960
That is your born right.

27:11.960 --> 27:22.240
And yet you espouse these rights and it challenges laws and religion and other people who are

27:22.240 --> 27:27.040
in positions of power, they feel threatened by individual freedoms.

27:27.040 --> 27:31.240
So to me, this is a civil right issue fundamentally.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.520
You have a freedom of right to your own consciousness.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.840
If you can improve it, then you have the right to make that choice.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.360
No government should take that choice away from you.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.640
Thank you very much.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.160
Is there anything you would like to add or did I ask everything?

27:46.160 --> 27:49.200
I would add one more thing.

27:49.200 --> 27:54.040
What's very different about psilocybin mushrooms than peyote, for instance, and the peyote

27:54.040 --> 28:00.560
way is something that I think should remain with indigenous people, the yaki and other

28:00.560 --> 28:07.120
related, you know, first nations, especially in North America.

28:07.120 --> 28:16.280
That plant is fragile, it takes a long time to grow, sustainability doesn't look likely

28:16.280 --> 28:24.840
in the near term and over harvesting jeopardizes indigenous knowledge and indigenous practices.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.840
Peyote is very different than psilocybin mushrooms.

28:26.840 --> 28:34.560
There's 116 known species of psilocybin mushrooms that grow around the world, from the North

28:34.560 --> 28:39.440
Pole to the South Pole, you know, and those margins.

28:39.440 --> 28:48.840
And in each or many of those ecosystems, indigenous people from Mesoamerica, from Ireland, from

28:48.840 --> 28:54.400
Germany, in Japan, psilocybin mushrooms are known as laughing mushrooms.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.600
That's been a name that's been around for hundreds of years.

28:57.600 --> 29:05.560
So every group who's lived in close associated with the ecosystem is likely to have a history

29:05.560 --> 29:08.440
of contact with psilocybin mushrooms.

29:08.440 --> 29:14.160
So Maria Sabina, the great Mazatec shaman, mycologist, she was a mycologist, it gives

29:14.160 --> 29:20.720
a huge amount of credit, she introduced psilocybin zapatachorum to the West.

29:20.720 --> 29:26.600
90% of the people using psilocybin mushrooms are using psilocybin cubensis, a mushroom

29:26.600 --> 29:29.520
that Maria Sabina did not use.

29:29.520 --> 29:34.680
And it grows in the tropics, from Florida, or subtropics, Florida, Guatemala, grows in

29:34.680 --> 29:42.480
Thailand, it grows in Australia, it grows throughout Africa, the moisture reasons of Africa.

29:42.480 --> 29:51.160
So when you understand that psilocybin mushrooms are not only more biodiverse than peyote, but

29:51.160 --> 29:53.000
you can grow them sustainably.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.080
It checks all the boxes in terms of not being cultural appropriation, having universality

30:01.080 --> 30:06.280
of use across many cultures growing in many different regions of the world.

30:06.280 --> 30:13.760
So I think this is a bridge between cultures and continents and throughout centuries.

30:13.760 --> 30:20.560
There is a narrative new to me, but it came out out of British Columbia years ago, and

30:20.560 --> 30:28.440
it's one of the elders of an indigenous clan in Canada was challenged by one of the parents.

30:28.440 --> 30:36.400
Why should we send our indigenous children to be educated by Westerners, by the European

30:36.400 --> 30:38.440
educational system?

30:38.440 --> 30:44.120
And this elder who I think was very wise, he says, because we need two eyes to see, two

30:44.200 --> 30:46.200
eyes seen.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.240
We need the western eye of science.

30:49.240 --> 30:55.880
We need indigenous wisdom for making sure that science respects nature and generational

30:55.880 --> 30:57.440
knowledge.

30:57.440 --> 31:03.480
So we went to a first indigenous conference and a good friend of ours who is a leader

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
in this movement.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
She's indigenous.

31:05.480 --> 31:12.960
She's actually half Irish, half Native American, and one of her elders stood up and she goes,

31:12.960 --> 31:15.440
I love two-eyed seeing.

31:15.440 --> 31:19.520
And she said, I'm not taking away my iPhone for my 12-year-old daughter.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.680
That would create chaos in my life.

31:22.680 --> 31:28.680
But I think this is an example where with two eyes we can see better.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.280
We need to respect indigenous wisdom.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.440
All wisdom is built upon by experience.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.720
Everment contributes to the growing body and elective knowledge.

31:38.760 --> 31:43.800
This is what this conference is about, and I think we have to always walk forward with

31:43.800 --> 31:46.240
two eyes seen.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.480
One of the characters in the new Star Trek Discovery was modeled after you, and in this

31:51.480 --> 31:57.360
show there is the Mycelian network that helps people to travel through space and time.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.200
Do you believe that one time this will be a reality?

32:01.200 --> 32:07.120
Yeah, this Star Trek series discovery, the ten or so writers called me up and said we're

32:07.120 --> 32:11.680
in the dungeon, we're running Star Trek, give us some ideas, and I told them to turn

32:11.680 --> 32:12.680
on their tape recorder.

32:12.680 --> 32:17.680
I'm a Star Trek fan, and I just gave them about an hour and a half, two hours of just

32:17.680 --> 32:24.920
stream of consciousness talking about the Mycelian network and how networks are self-creating

32:24.920 --> 32:30.160
in the Mycelian network, the neurological network, the computer internet network, the

32:30.160 --> 32:37.440
organization of dark matter and dark energy and space, all are built upon this same sort

32:37.440 --> 32:44.800
of structure that allows ease elasticity, that has many end points of contact, that can

32:44.800 --> 32:50.280
constantly experiment with successes, and if there is a success, the information backchannels

32:50.280 --> 32:55.960
and by definition it grows, and so I talked about then entering into hyperspace, into

32:55.960 --> 33:02.640
the microverse, into the multiverse using psilocybin, and one of the messages many of

33:02.640 --> 33:10.760
us get is the universality of being, that we exist within one giant consciousness, and

33:10.760 --> 33:18.680
being able to understand that can allow us to be able to cross into different dimensions

33:18.680 --> 33:23.080
without using the envelope of our bodies as a limiting factor.

33:23.080 --> 33:32.120
So to answer your question, yes, I do believe that these are portables for us to enter into

33:32.120 --> 33:35.800
the multiverse.

33:35.800 --> 33:45.640
The very words that I'm using are constricted because I don't have the vocabulary to articulate

33:45.640 --> 33:50.600
what that may mean, but I think that vocabulary now is being built.

33:50.600 --> 33:57.480
Every single person journeying on psilocybin is contributing to that vocabulary, so I think

33:57.480 --> 34:03.800
it is time for humans to ascend into a new species, it is time critical that we do so,

34:03.800 --> 34:08.360
we have a moral, ethical, and evolutionary responsibility.

34:08.360 --> 34:16.040
We've been handed this responsibility, it is ours to lose, and we're at an adjunction.

34:16.040 --> 34:23.920
We make the decision to live or the decision to die, it is literally that binary.

34:23.920 --> 34:30.840
And I think most of us want to choose the path that brings more babies and smiles on

34:30.840 --> 34:37.040
people's faces and more camaraderie and more enrichness of culture and ideas.

34:37.040 --> 34:45.080
I've always thought that wealth is not money, it's not materialism, it's the optionality

34:45.080 --> 34:47.360
of having freedom of choices.

34:47.360 --> 34:53.760
The more freedoms of choices you have, the wealthier you are because you have alternatives.

34:53.760 --> 34:59.920
Restricting those restricts again your civil rights and your rights as a species to continue

34:59.920 --> 35:00.520
to evolve.
