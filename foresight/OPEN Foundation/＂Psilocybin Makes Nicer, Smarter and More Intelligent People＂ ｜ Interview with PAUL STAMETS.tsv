0	11320	You famously said that mushrooms can help humanity to save the world.
11320	14760	Can you elaborate on that?
14760	24440	Well, I think those of us who've journeyed with a high dose of psilocybin, so I'm only
24440	27520	speaking to a subset of the audience here.
27520	35520	But those of us who've done these journeys, a very common theme is we realize that we're
35520	41760	a species that has an obligation to help save the planet, the biodiversity, the ecosystems
41760	43260	and nature.
43260	50160	Nature is calling out to us to open up our eyes to our responsibility as Earth citizens
50160	55160	to be responsible in protecting the commons.
55160	62240	And unfortunately, because of capitalism, religion, you know, all sorts of other factors,
62240	70640	our vision has become so narrowed for just self-indulgence, self-profiteering.
70640	79320	And the understanding of sharing for the commons has unfortunately retreated in the priorities
79320	82680	of many human activities.
82680	90120	You know, I do believe in the principles of capitalism insofar that individuals should
90120	94520	be rewarded for their extraordinary efforts.
94520	97160	So you have to be incentivized.
97160	103880	But once you are incentivized and you do get ahead, you have a very, I think a very strong
103880	109400	obligation to help others who are in need, because I think the lessons of evolution is
109400	116000	not the survival of the fittest, but the sharing of surplus beyond your own needs to help your
116000	120520	neighbors and help others who are less advantaged.
120520	125440	So the message that I'm getting from self-sabotten mushrooms is the important role that humans
125440	134000	play today in being able to provide for the health of the ecosystem for everyone.
134000	138760	The common phrase is that a rising tide raises all boats.
138760	142080	But it's much more sophisticated than that.
142080	144240	We have an ethical responsibility.
144240	151000	We are here now because of evolutionary smart choices over millions of years.
151000	157840	But we're at a time critical moment that if we don't make smarter choices now, then
157840	161720	species extinction for humans is very plausible.
161720	164400	Now some people might say, no, that's not possible.
164400	166640	Look at the evolutionary record.
166640	172720	More than 99% of the species that have existed on this planet are extinct.
172720	178960	Extinction is a natural consequence of evolution for those organisms who are not able to adapt
178960	180360	to change.
180360	188160	The fact that we are contaminating the ecosystem that gives us life is destroying our descendants'
188160	189160	future.
189160	195040	And so I feel a very strong obligation to our descendants, calling back in time, saying
195040	202960	we are at our pivotal moment to make a decisions that affect our future for literally thousands
202960	205280	of years going forward.
205280	212160	So now, from a practical point of view, OK, most people would accept that logically.
212160	213920	But what does this mean?
213920	220080	Our research with psilocybin and psilocybin analogs shows that it profoundly stimulates
220080	225080	neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurogeneration, neuroregeneration.
225080	230480	Those are four separate forms of neuron enhancement.
230480	233920	And we can see this now very clearly in vitro.
233920	235680	We are involved in microdosing.
235680	241480	We published in Nature Scientific Reports two articles on microdosing, the latest June
241480	244400	30th, 2022.
244400	247160	And it's extraordinary how many people are microdosing.
247160	256480	And this app that we co-develop called microdose.me, people self-report their behaviors, how often
256480	263000	they use psilocybin, what do they stack it with, what's their motivation, what's their
263000	266200	income, what's their race, what's their sexual preference.
266200	269840	So it's a very interesting population study.
269840	275120	And the reason why the peer reviewers at Nature were so excited about our manuscript as our
275120	277120	data set is very large.
277120	286240	The first paper, November 28th, 2021, had a survey of more than 8,000 people.
286240	289960	More than 4,100 were non-microdosers.
289960	292160	That was a shock to us.
292160	296320	Non-microdosers were motivated to sign up at microdose.me.
296320	300520	I think because they wanted to get a baseline, citizen scientists want to go, okay, before
300520	304560	I start microdosing, I want to see what my baseline level is.
304560	307200	And then you microdose without contrast.
307200	312000	So we had about 4,100 non-microdosers, a little over 4,000 microdosers.
312000	317000	Predominantly in North America, microdosing is with psilocybin.
317000	320560	Here in Europe is more common with LSD.
320560	329440	So in our microdosing study, over 55% of the people microdosing with psilocybin stack it.
329440	332560	What stacking means is that you have an admixture.
332560	336440	You add something else to the psilocybin.
336440	340240	And a variety of substances are added, chocolate.
340240	347320	I hypothesized a formula stacking psilocybin mushrooms with niacin, nicotinic acid, the
347320	350320	flushing form, and lion's mane.
350320	357840	And I proposed this stack because psilocybin is a vasoconstrictor, niacin is a vasodilator.
357840	362820	Also when you take the flushing form of niacin, your nerve endings get excited.
362820	368320	So I thought with neuropathies, oftentimes present themselves as deadening of the extremities,
368320	370440	the fingertips and the toes.
370440	375640	And so when you have neurodegeneration and neuropathies, you have vasoconstriction, blood
375640	378800	vessels choke off, nerves die.
378800	386520	So I thought with vasodilation with niacin, it could deliver the benefits of psilocybin
386520	389360	to the endpoints of the peripheral nervous system.
389360	397420	So then lion's mane, it's been well studied that lion's mane regenerates myelin on the
397420	398920	axons of nerves.
398920	401520	These are the conductive sheath.
401520	407240	So I bundled these together for the hypothesis that these would have an entourage effect
407240	413680	of stimulation for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases.
413680	417320	Now it's not just diseases, it's age.
417320	418960	New news to everyone.
418960	419960	We get older.
419960	425320	As we get older, unfortunately our nervous system declines in its health.
425320	432680	So there was a metric in microdose.me, and when we surveyed these thousands of people,
432680	435360	there was a statistic that jumped out.
435360	441000	Now it did not jump out with young people, you know, 20 to 55 year olds in that range,
441000	449240	but 55 plus year olds, there was a startling result that caught our researchers by surprise.
449240	453840	And when they did the analysis, there was a finger tapping test.
453840	458680	How quickly can you tap the first two fingers in 10 seconds?
458680	463400	So when you're young, you can do it really fast, when you get older, you do it slower.
463400	472440	This is a test that is used for charting neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's patients, dementia, Parkinson's,
472440	474120	traumatic brain injury.
474120	475280	This is a common test.
475280	478760	Many people listening to this have taken the tap test.
478760	486880	So the startling result was with psilocybin in any form, by itself with psilocybin mushrooms,
486880	491480	psilocybin with chocolate, psilocybin with anything else, nothing statistically increased
491480	497320	the frequency of tapping in 55 plus year olds, but one formulation, and that was called
497320	498600	the Stamets Stock.
498600	504720	Psilocybin, niacin, lion's mane increased the tapping frequency of approximately 49 taps
504720	511760	to 68 taps in 30 days relatively quickly, with a p value of significance of p equals
511760	513320	0.004.
513320	518400	That means one chance in 250 that it's just random noise.
518400	523160	So there appears to be a quote, unquote, cause and effect.
523160	528600	When we saw that result, then I thought, well, what's the mechanisms of action, the modes
528600	532680	of action, neurologically what's happening?
532680	540000	So we started diving deep into the literature of the proteins that code for neurofactors,
540000	545200	including BDNF, which is brain derived neurotropic factors.
545200	549800	This is basically how brain neurons then are stimulated into regrowth, and we found
549800	552720	something shocking, absolutely bizarre.
552720	558640	Now people can see my talk, I encourage that you do that, but here's an example.
558640	567560	At micro dosing levels, psilocybin by itself stimulated none of these nerve growth factors.
567560	574680	Niacin by itself didn't stimulate any, and lion's mane did not stimulate any, zero plus
574680	576920	zero plus zero equals zero.
576920	580600	Well, that's called the cumulative additive effect.
580600	588400	When we put these three together, it excited these proteins that then resulted in the stimulation
588400	590680	of nerve growth factors in BDNF.
590680	595160	So in this case, zero plus zero plus zero equals, for instance, 20.
595160	603120	So that synergy of the three components created something truly unexpected and surprising.
603120	610080	Now if you're a neurologist and a researcher, and you dose these nerve cells, for instance,
610080	616720	or these proteins with psilocybin at a micro dosing level, oh, no activity.
616720	619920	Moving on, because you think, oh, it has no activity.
619920	625720	I believe that niacin is a catalyst for nerve growth factors, stimulating the neurogenic
625720	627640	benefits of psilocybin.
627640	631760	This is also important because there's 11 clinical studies that are using niacin opposite
631760	632760	psilocybin.
633000	637320	So psilocybin over here, niacin is there a quote unquote placebo.
637320	644200	So there are actually 180 degrees in opposition to my idea, not purposely, they're looking
644200	646200	for an active placebo.
646200	649600	I am teaching opposite of that.
649600	652000	I always like to go to the path not traveled.
652000	654000	I'm a contrarian by nature.
654000	656720	I'm an inventor and an innovator.
656720	661600	I think about this, I've been doing this, my first book on psilocybin came out 44 years
661600	662600	ago.
662600	665240	I've placed numerous species in the genus psilocybe.
665240	669120	I am immersed in this knowledge.
669120	675840	And when you study a subject as long as I have, you begin to question authority, question
675840	680840	conventional thinking, and that's been a story of my life actually, but I respect conventional
680840	681840	thinking.
681840	685960	I think it's an important foundation, but it always has to be adaptable to change and
685960	687480	creativity.
687480	694280	And so my contribution I think is showing that micro dosing with psilocybin works when
694280	700240	you can catalyze it with something like niacin and lion's mane that amplifies the potential
700240	705800	benefit where psilocybin by itself at low concentrations may not.
705800	708560	So that's where we're excited about micro dose.me.
708560	715200	We have clinical trials now planned and these observational studies can help inform clinicians
715200	719000	on how to design very good clinical trials.
719000	723440	So we do not know whether this is going to be clinically relevant or not.
723440	728040	That is yet to be proven, but we have three pillars of evidence now.
728040	730280	We have the TAP test.
730280	731640	What can explain that?
731640	739960	It's not expectancy, the placebo is not appropriate, so I just challenge any listener.
739960	744120	What can result in the increase in psychomotor skills compared to psilocybin by itself or
744120	746720	non micro dosers?
746720	752680	The only explanation that's feasible in my imagination, those of many neurologists I've
752680	755200	talked about is neurogenesis.
755200	759840	There's an increase in the neurological health of the patients or the individuals taking
759840	760920	these substances.
760920	762880	So that's one pillar of evidence.
762880	765600	The second pillar is these map kinases.
765600	771720	These are proteins when the substances dock with them, stimulate BDNF and NGF, brain derived
771720	777560	neurotropic factors and nerve growth factors.
777560	784600	I showed in my talk four or five examples of zero activity of the components stuck together
784600	785600	of massive activity.
785600	790640	In fact, we have more than 50 examples of this where there's no activity and massive
790640	797480	activity and we have hundreds of examples of synergy where one plus one plus one doesn't
797480	801800	equal three, but one plus one plus one equals 16.
801800	805040	So it's the entourage effect of amplification.
805040	806720	So we have that pillar of evidence.
806720	811680	The third pillar of evidence, which I didn't have time to show, is in vitro with brain
811680	813560	nerve cells growing.
813560	819560	We can actually dose those nerve cells with this combination of psilocybin, lion's mane
819560	826000	and nicotinic acid and we can see the proliferation of the nerves growing beyond baseline of any
826000	827960	one of those other components.
827960	834520	So those three pillars of evidence are a strong argument for creating clinical studies to
834520	835520	test this.
835520	840060	Now, keep this in mind and I didn't get a chance to explain this during my talk.
840060	843720	Think about all the confounders in this observational study.
843720	845840	Where are people buying their psilocybin?
845840	846840	Underground market.
846840	850920	How was the potency of each one, each sample?
850920	856640	The majority, I think 78% of the people are taking a third of a gram to a tenth of a gram
856640	860520	of slosophy cubensis, golden tops dried.
860520	865320	So you have the variability of the dosage, you have the variability of the sources and
865320	867160	how much psilocybin is needed.
867160	870720	You have variability in the amount of niacin they're taking, you have variability in the
870720	873080	amount of lion's mane they're taking.
873080	878120	Now these three confounders logically would dilute significance.
878120	883520	The fact that we have such high significance for the TAP test suggests to me that the results
883520	886800	are understated compared to optimization.
886800	892720	If we can optimize each of those components, then the significance value should logically
892720	894120	increase.
894120	900720	So the fact that we have such a signal from the noise is truly, I think, an eye-opener.
900720	907280	And so my best supporters, by the way, many of you are skeptics, my best supporters have
907280	908280	been skeptics.
908280	913120	So I like to be taken to the mat, but I would advise all skeptics to be a little bit more
913120	916760	circumspect because I'm saying people say microdosing doesn't work.
916760	921040	Every study of microdosing doesn't follow the practices of microdosers in the real
921040	922200	world.
922200	926160	People are taking it for 30, 60 days, they're taking it three to five times a week and they're
926160	929160	doing sub-intoxication levels.
929160	933400	We report out of Brazil, you know, they're taking a half a gram.
933400	938720	They report 70% of the people could guess what the low dose was.
938720	940320	Well, that's unblinded.
940320	944960	We have 70% of the people knowing that they got the low dose.
944960	951000	By definition, a microdose is a sub-intoxication, but it's not sub-effect.
951000	958080	When you do microdosing, for instance, colors are a little bit more livelier, you're in a
958080	960400	better mood.
960400	961800	You're more compassionate.
962560	966440	Frankly, you're nicer.
966440	969000	So but it's not intoxication.
969000	972280	It's not like you slammed a beer or smoked a joint or something like that and you have
972280	975840	this change in your state of consciousness.
975840	982800	You have a heightened state of awareness and a heightened state of empathy and cordiality.
982800	986320	And this is why I believe that psilocybin makes nicer people.
986320	990400	And the meta studies that have come out showing that psilocybin is associated with a reduction
990400	993280	in crime, violence.
993280	997880	The only psychedelic associated with a reduction in opioid use disorder, and it's well known
997880	1003760	that LSD and psilocybin use would reduce alcoholics use of alcohol.
1003760	1007120	Now there is a very good clinical study proving that.
1007120	1012400	So these observational studies do set the stage for clinical studies.
1012400	1015520	And think of this as paradigm shifting.
1015520	1020760	This is why psilocybin microdosing is available for the commons, it's affordable, it should
1020760	1023600	be available for the commons.
1023600	1028400	And if you go into a doctor's office, for instance, you go into a doctor's office to
1028400	1031640	get your blood pressure, very well established.
1031640	1035320	Just the act of going into the doctor's office elevates your blood pressure.
1035320	1039680	Well, that's expectancy, in this case negative.
1039680	1042920	You go to a doctor's office because you have an infection.
1042920	1047680	Your expectancy as a doctor is going to give you a medicine that's going to help your infection.
1047680	1055040	So real world effects of medicines are enhanced by the expectancy of you going to an expert
1055040	1061120	and the act of you trying to take charge of your health by doing something about it.
1061120	1068080	So the overlaying and coefficient enhancement of expectancy to a real medicine is part of
1068080	1072520	the medicine's potency and the therapeutic benefit of that.
1072520	1077160	So when I see these people trying to draw lines between expectancy and real world medical
1077160	1082520	effects, you know, this is not a black and white situation, it's on a spectrum.
1082520	1092560	Moreover, when you take psilocybin at a high dose to say 30 to 50 milligrams of psilocybin,
1092560	1096080	the half life of psilocybin is two to three hours.
1096080	1099400	So by the next day, you're in a microdose.
1099400	1104800	So why I like microdosing, an increasing narrative is a macro dose, therapeutically, followed
1104800	1111040	by microdosing, is that you can re-stimulate the neurological pathways that now you've
1111040	1116720	created for a new view of reality, of your PTSD's resolution.
1116720	1123000	The Johns Hopkins study found that 14 months later the very active re-remembering was therapeutically
1123000	1124000	beneficial.
1124000	1128640	Well, re-remembering is rekindling the neurological pathways that led to that memory and you have
1128640	1130880	a re-experiencing of it.
1130880	1135480	Microdosing also rekindles those pathways, not only for your memory of the experience,
1135480	1141600	but I believe from the activity, neurogenically, of visiting and reliving those pathways to
1141600	1147360	become more resonantly dominant and becomes now your new, you know, neurological system
1147360	1149880	for dealing with the world.
1149880	1152800	So this is a really exciting area of research.
1152800	1157080	I'm so honored to be a shepherd of this knowledge.
1157080	1160000	I really, really believe that this is generational knowledge.
1160000	1161080	We're all thought leaders.
1161080	1168640	The ecosystem here, the body intellect of knowledge at this conference, I think is really hopeful.
1168640	1172880	And at the same time, we have to be very careful about marginalization.
1172880	1176480	And marginalization is making these therapies too expensive.
1176480	1185720	You know, when you think about the root causes of so much of our crime, which much of it
1185720	1194280	is racist, much of it is the rich versus the poor, the people who have access to medical
1194280	1199000	system support versus those who do not, that's economic.
1199000	1206920	So it's important if we want to help heal society and to reduce crime, that the universality
1206920	1210840	of access of these medicines are made available.
1210840	1212320	Microdosing allows that.
1212320	1215280	So what's your vision of the future of psychedelics?
1215280	1217920	How do you see this failed in like 10 years?
1217920	1222880	I would see microdosing being a new tropic vitamin, be closely associated and proven
1222880	1230480	with a massive reduction in crime, saving governments and saving victims, saving families,
1230480	1233800	you know, hardship, money.
1233800	1238400	I mean, what government official here is opposed to the reduction of crime?
1238400	1241480	Hopefully there's none, right?
1241480	1243000	I would hope there's none.
1243000	1247840	There is one they should dose on psilocybin, they would change their mind.
1247840	1257840	So I would see the future that, you know, throughout society, people would recognize
1257840	1263800	that the use of psilocybin, macrodosing for PTSD and all these other traumatic mental
1263800	1270320	health challenges, but so much of us are healthy mentally.
1270320	1276480	And moreover, microdosing, I think, can prevent crime, prevent PTSD.
1276480	1281800	It's one thing to treat the illness after the fact, but it's a much greater benefit
1281800	1286240	to prevent that illness from even occurring in the first place.
1286240	1292240	If you are a person who, unfortunately, there is generational abuse, I've seen it, even
1292240	1298640	within my own family, children who are abused tend to grow up to be adults that abuse.
1298640	1300720	This is just a known fact.
1300720	1307200	If you can resolve your issues and not become a perpetrator to pass on this generational
1307200	1312240	violence behavior, then you can prevent victims in the future.
1312240	1320240	So I see psilocybin and microdosing as preventing PTSD, preventing criminal behavior.
1320240	1325560	And I'm moreover, not only do I think psilocybin makes nicer people, but I believe psilocybin
1325560	1330560	makes smarter, more intelligent people, especially as they age.
1330560	1335200	Do you think that you became smarter and nicer because you used psilocybin?
1335200	1338080	That's a very self-serving question.
1338080	1342120	You're asking my ego if I thought I'm smarter because they use psilocybin.
1342120	1344240	Of course I think I'm smarter.
1344240	1347080	But then I have to say, well, wait, is that delusional?
1347080	1352680	I mean, this is where you're asking kind of the impossible-to-answer question without
1352680	1354720	showing bias.
1354720	1357480	And speaking of bias, we're all biased.
1357480	1358480	We're all biased.
1358480	1359480	We all have egos.
1359480	1361120	We all have interests.
1361120	1362800	Show me a person who's not biased.
1362800	1368440	Even professors at universities, if they do not publish, they will not get tenure.
1368440	1371800	And they can put on their slides they have no conflicts of interest.
1371800	1374120	Yeah, they do.
1374120	1379800	Every single professor here who said they have no conflicts of interest are hypocritical.
1379800	1382320	They have to publish in order to have tenure.
1382320	1387480	So every person studying the subject has an internal bias because they have an interest
1387480	1389080	in the subject.
1389080	1390580	They're motivated.
1390580	1391880	They want to do studies.
1391880	1397040	They know if the studies get published, then their position of employment within the university
1397040	1399720	is better than that, which they would not.
1399720	1403000	So people should be a little more circumspect.
1403000	1404720	Take a step back.
1404720	1408120	If you are a human, you have bias.
1408120	1412280	You have bias for food when you're hungry, bias for medicines, bias for your friends,
1412280	1417360	bias for people you want to associate with, bias comes with a human condition.
1417360	1426240	The question becomes, is that bias such that it is not beneficial for the general population
1426240	1431760	or is it idiosyncratically specific to certain individual and personality types?
1431760	1434000	Now you can dial this down now.
1434000	1439280	This is something that probably will be disambiguated better in the future when we have more targeted
1439280	1441880	individual therapies customized.
1441880	1449600	But right now, throughout a general population, we're seeing that the effects are beneficial
1449600	1456160	with very strong signals right now from the noise and the chaos of the general population,
1456160	1460960	both with healthy normals and with individuals with mental health challenges.
1460960	1463120	We all have mental health challenges.
1463120	1465640	We're all in a spectrum.
1465640	1470240	Right now, don't you have a little voice in your head thinking about your next question?
1470240	1474680	Did you wake up and go, oh, when I was eight years old, I really wish I hadn't taken that
1474680	1477600	toy away from my friend and was so mean to him?
1477600	1479640	I mean, we're all self-reflecting.
1479640	1481640	We're all self-diagnosing.
1481640	1487240	It's just when your self-diagnostic tools are not adequate to treat the condition that
1487240	1490160	it's important you seek an expert's health.
1490160	1495600	So we're all involved in the spectrum, macro-dosing, the micro-dosing is a spectrum.
1495600	1500000	People should be much more careful in saying that micro-dosing doesn't work.
1500000	1506320	And I just wish people would be a little bit more careful in their languaging because
1506320	1508800	I think this is a spectrum.
1508800	1512240	You mentioned that your first book was published in 1978.
1512240	1515200	That was the year when I was born.
1515200	1521880	So you have been waiting a lot to this time when it seems that it becomes real, right?
1521880	1526120	So how do you feel about this new psychedelic renaissance and do you think there is a risk
1526120	1528240	of a new backlash after this?
1528880	1532000	Well, there's always a danger in renaissance.
1532000	1537120	Having by definition, it's a revolution against the conventional wisdom.
1537120	1544520	What is really different now than in 1978, when I published my first book, is the absence
1544520	1546720	of paranoia.
1546720	1548400	That's a stressor.
1548400	1550680	That causes anxiety.
1550680	1559520	With us early adopters, and even with indigenous people, when the Christians and the Catholics
1559520	1565760	came to Mesoamerica and they brought their diseases and their advanced weapons and their
1565760	1576360	sailing ships, that domination and suppression of indigenous wisdom and religion caused a
1576360	1580200	mass amount of course anxiety and harm.
1580200	1588160	And so societal pressures against us early adopters and people who are thought leaders
1588160	1593480	really carrying the torch forward of indigenous people all over the world.
1593480	1599600	We are not now under the same pressure from society to be as paranoid as we were back
1599600	1601320	then.
1601320	1609080	You do not know, and most people listening do not know, the state of heightened paranoia
1609080	1614920	and concern and anxiety that the government any minute could break down your doors and
1614920	1615920	arrest you.
1615920	1622600	And to me, the use of psilocybin and psychedelics is a civil right.
1622600	1625360	It's a freedom of consciousness right.
1625360	1629600	No government in the world has a right to your freedom of consciousness.
1629600	1631960	That is your born right.
1631960	1642240	And yet you espouse these rights and it challenges laws and religion and other people who are
1642240	1647040	in positions of power, they feel threatened by individual freedoms.
1647040	1651240	So to me, this is a civil right issue fundamentally.
1651240	1653520	You have a freedom of right to your own consciousness.
1653520	1656840	If you can improve it, then you have the right to make that choice.
1656840	1660360	No government should take that choice away from you.
1660360	1662640	Thank you very much.
1662640	1666160	Is there anything you would like to add or did I ask everything?
1666160	1669200	I would add one more thing.
1669200	1674040	What's very different about psilocybin mushrooms than peyote, for instance, and the peyote
1674040	1680560	way is something that I think should remain with indigenous people, the yaki and other
1680560	1687120	related, you know, first nations, especially in North America.
1687120	1696280	That plant is fragile, it takes a long time to grow, sustainability doesn't look likely
1696280	1704840	in the near term and over harvesting jeopardizes indigenous knowledge and indigenous practices.
1704840	1706840	Peyote is very different than psilocybin mushrooms.
1706840	1714560	There's 116 known species of psilocybin mushrooms that grow around the world, from the North
1714560	1719440	Pole to the South Pole, you know, and those margins.
1719440	1728840	And in each or many of those ecosystems, indigenous people from Mesoamerica, from Ireland, from
1728840	1734400	Germany, in Japan, psilocybin mushrooms are known as laughing mushrooms.
1734400	1737600	That's been a name that's been around for hundreds of years.
1737600	1745560	So every group who's lived in close associated with the ecosystem is likely to have a history
1745560	1748440	of contact with psilocybin mushrooms.
1748440	1754160	So Maria Sabina, the great Mazatec shaman, mycologist, she was a mycologist, it gives
1754160	1760720	a huge amount of credit, she introduced psilocybin zapatachorum to the West.
1760720	1766600	90% of the people using psilocybin mushrooms are using psilocybin cubensis, a mushroom
1766600	1769520	that Maria Sabina did not use.
1769520	1774680	And it grows in the tropics, from Florida, or subtropics, Florida, Guatemala, grows in
1774680	1782480	Thailand, it grows in Australia, it grows throughout Africa, the moisture reasons of Africa.
1782480	1791160	So when you understand that psilocybin mushrooms are not only more biodiverse than peyote, but
1791160	1793000	you can grow them sustainably.
1794000	1801080	It checks all the boxes in terms of not being cultural appropriation, having universality
1801080	1806280	of use across many cultures growing in many different regions of the world.
1806280	1813760	So I think this is a bridge between cultures and continents and throughout centuries.
1813760	1820560	There is a narrative new to me, but it came out out of British Columbia years ago, and
1820560	1828440	it's one of the elders of an indigenous clan in Canada was challenged by one of the parents.
1828440	1836400	Why should we send our indigenous children to be educated by Westerners, by the European
1836400	1838440	educational system?
1838440	1844120	And this elder who I think was very wise, he says, because we need two eyes to see, two
1844200	1846200	eyes seen.
1846200	1849240	We need the western eye of science.
1849240	1855880	We need indigenous wisdom for making sure that science respects nature and generational
1855880	1857440	knowledge.
1857440	1863480	So we went to a first indigenous conference and a good friend of ours who is a leader
1863480	1864480	in this movement.
1864480	1865480	She's indigenous.
1865480	1872960	She's actually half Irish, half Native American, and one of her elders stood up and she goes,
1872960	1875440	I love two-eyed seeing.
1875440	1879520	And she said, I'm not taking away my iPhone for my 12-year-old daughter.
1879520	1882680	That would create chaos in my life.
1882680	1888680	But I think this is an example where with two eyes we can see better.
1888680	1891280	We need to respect indigenous wisdom.
1891280	1894440	All wisdom is built upon by experience.
1894440	1898720	Everment contributes to the growing body and elective knowledge.
1898760	1903800	This is what this conference is about, and I think we have to always walk forward with
1903800	1906240	two eyes seen.
1906240	1911480	One of the characters in the new Star Trek Discovery was modeled after you, and in this
1911480	1917360	show there is the Mycelian network that helps people to travel through space and time.
1917360	1921200	Do you believe that one time this will be a reality?
1921200	1927120	Yeah, this Star Trek series discovery, the ten or so writers called me up and said we're
1927120	1931680	in the dungeon, we're running Star Trek, give us some ideas, and I told them to turn
1931680	1932680	on their tape recorder.
1932680	1937680	I'm a Star Trek fan, and I just gave them about an hour and a half, two hours of just
1937680	1944920	stream of consciousness talking about the Mycelian network and how networks are self-creating
1944920	1950160	in the Mycelian network, the neurological network, the computer internet network, the
1950160	1957440	organization of dark matter and dark energy and space, all are built upon this same sort
1957440	1964800	of structure that allows ease elasticity, that has many end points of contact, that can
1964800	1970280	constantly experiment with successes, and if there is a success, the information backchannels
1970280	1975960	and by definition it grows, and so I talked about then entering into hyperspace, into
1975960	1982640	the microverse, into the multiverse using psilocybin, and one of the messages many of
1982640	1990760	us get is the universality of being, that we exist within one giant consciousness, and
1990760	1998680	being able to understand that can allow us to be able to cross into different dimensions
1998680	2003080	without using the envelope of our bodies as a limiting factor.
2003080	2012120	So to answer your question, yes, I do believe that these are portables for us to enter into
2012120	2015800	the multiverse.
2015800	2025640	The very words that I'm using are constricted because I don't have the vocabulary to articulate
2025640	2030600	what that may mean, but I think that vocabulary now is being built.
2030600	2037480	Every single person journeying on psilocybin is contributing to that vocabulary, so I think
2037480	2043800	it is time for humans to ascend into a new species, it is time critical that we do so,
2043800	2048360	we have a moral, ethical, and evolutionary responsibility.
2048360	2056040	We've been handed this responsibility, it is ours to lose, and we're at an adjunction.
2056040	2063920	We make the decision to live or the decision to die, it is literally that binary.
2063920	2070840	And I think most of us want to choose the path that brings more babies and smiles on
2070840	2077040	people's faces and more camaraderie and more enrichness of culture and ideas.
2077040	2085080	I've always thought that wealth is not money, it's not materialism, it's the optionality
2085080	2087360	of having freedom of choices.
2087360	2093760	The more freedoms of choices you have, the wealthier you are because you have alternatives.
2093760	2099920	Restricting those restricts again your civil rights and your rights as a species to continue
2099920	2100520	to evolve.
