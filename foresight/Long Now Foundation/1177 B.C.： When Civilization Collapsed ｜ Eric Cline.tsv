0	19080	Good evening. My name is Alexander Rose, I'm the director here at Long Now. And as you
19080	24200	know, at the beginning of most of these talks we do, it's called A Long Short, a short film
24200	31760	that in some way exemplifies long-term thinking. Tonight's comes from some members who are
31760	36480	here in the room. Where are you? Wave your hands, shout. There you are in the back of
36480	42680	the room. Thank you. And actually it's a good point to remind you all that actually finding
42680	47680	these long shorts is quite difficult. So if you have good candidates, please send them
47680	53440	into us or make some of your own like these guys did, which is a really great one. And
53440	58600	I think tonight's Long Short is interesting. I mean, we're definitely going to go vastly
58600	65240	further into the past than tonight's Long Short is. But part of civilization's fragility
65240	71120	comes both from its interconnectedness and that's also one of the things that really
71120	78560	makes civilization robust. So I think tonight's Long Short shows a little bit of each of that.
78560	78840	Enjoy.
204200	210240	Good evening. I'm Stuart Brand from the Long Now Foundation. As you know, the Long Now we define
210240	215840	as the next 10,000 years, which we're building a clock for in the last 10,000 years, which we're
215840	225280	still figuring out what happened. Part of the idea of all that is to sort of calibrate how we
225280	231360	think about time and history and eternity, which doesn't actually play into this at all forever is
231360	240560	not part of this story. But time has size. And we're pretty good at the minutes and hours and
240560	247160	the kind of stuff we saw in the film here. We're still figuring out decades, centuries, millennia.
250280	257360	So half the way back 5,000 years ago was the beginning of the Bronze Age, starting to get
257360	263360	bronze tools and weapons and the kind of society that can use those things. And that went on for
263360	274960	2,000 years. And then it ended much more suddenly than it began. And we have a speaker who knows
274960	289760	more about that than anybody or a client. Thank you so much for inviting me here. Thank you all for
289760	294960	coming. I'm presuming you're out there. It's hard for me to see. But what I would like to do tonight
294960	301920	in the next hour or so is to take you back, take you back between 4,000 and 3,000 years ago
302880	313360	to the time that is my favorite period in ancient history. Late Bronze Age, 1700 to 1200 BC. If I
313360	320800	could be reincarnated backwards, that's the period I would like to live in. I don't think I'd survive
320800	329520	for about more than 48 hours. But it would be a marvelous 48 hours. Now, this is the period when
329520	335840	we have what I would call the G8 of the ancient world. And I'm cheating a little bit because in
335840	342320	order to do that, I have to combine the Minoans and the Mycenaeans of Greece into one entity.
342320	348480	But we have them on the edge of the screen there. We also have the Hittites in purple up here in
348480	356880	Turkey. Matani is in red. Assyrians and Babylonians are in kind of a mustard yellow. And then
356880	363520	Egyptians are the orange going up the Nile and into Canaan. We also have Cypriots and other people
363520	368800	as well. Now, all of these people are interacting in the time period that we're going to talk about.
368800	375360	And I dare say that you actually know more about that time period already than you might suspect.
375360	381440	So for example, this is the time when Hatshepsut lives, the famous female pharaoh. How many people
381440	388400	have heard of her? Okay. Tupmosis III, one of the greatest military conquerors, lives at that time.
388400	394960	My boy, Amenhotep III. He is the guy I most wish I could meet in antiquity. Akhenaten,
394960	401040	the famous heretic pharaoh. I dare say you've heard of him. King Tut, that's the man that everybody
401040	407920	knows. Ramses II, Ramses III. This is the time period that we're talking about. And during these
407920	415520	centuries, everything flourished. It was, in fact, a time that was almost globalized if we can use
415520	421920	that word and put it, project it back into the past. But with that comes other things too, not
421920	428000	just trade, not just diplomacy, but things like wars. So for example, we've got the battle of Kadesh
428000	432800	between the Hittites and the Egyptians. We've got a little thing called the Trojan War.
433040	439120	You may have seen a movie that Brad Pitt was in. We also have things like the Exodus, which,
439120	446080	if it took place, will have taken place at about this time period. Now what we've got is a globalized
446080	452560	society in which everyone is interconnected. If you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon,
452560	459680	we've kind of got that here as well. This is a social network diagram that my wife Diane Klein
460240	466800	made. And you can see that pretty much everybody is interconnected in some way. If the Mycenaeans and
466800	471840	the Hittites aren't directly connected, they know somebody who can connect them. And in fact,
471840	478240	we've got writing from that time period, such as this. This is a typical Cuneiform tablet.
478240	483360	Looks like a bird has stepped an ink and walked across the page. There is an archive that dates
483360	491120	to about 1350 BC in which we found about 400 of these tablets and their letters to and fro,
491120	496480	to and from the kings of that time period, the king of the Hittites, king of Egyptians,
496480	502640	king of Babylon, king of Assyria, and also to the vassal kings, the ones that owed them allegiance.
503360	510000	And if you map them, you can see that we really are talking about a small world effect, which is
510000	515280	where, again, if you don't know the person, at least you know somebody in between. And usually,
515280	521120	there's no more than about three leaps that separate any particular person. So if you map these out,
521120	526720	as my wife did here, you can see with a couple of huge nodes with the king of Egypt and the king
526720	532160	of the Hittites and so on, that pretty much everybody is in contact with everyone else.
532160	538160	So I know that saying that that time period is globalized is a loaded term, and yet I think we
538240	544880	can use it. It was globalized for its time period. And that is from Italy on the west
545760	553520	to Afghanistan on the east. Everybody is in contact. They're trading. They are swapping
554160	560320	raw materials, gold, silver, copper, tin. They're also trading finished goods.
560960	568240	Now this is the Bronze Age, which starts in about 3000 BC. It's all going to come collapsing down
568240	575120	at about 1200 BC. So what I actually want to do tonight is to build this up, show you what they
575120	582960	were doing, what was there, and then collapse it all down by the time we're done. We don't know
582960	587120	why they collapsed, and that's part of the mystery, and that's part of what I will talk about. But
587200	593040	before I collapse it, let me build it up. So this is the Bronze Age. To make bronze, you need tin
593040	599600	and you need copper. By the way, if you don't have tin, you can also use arsenic. I don't recommend
599600	606080	that, but you won't live very long. But you can make arsenical copper, but tin is much better.
606080	612960	90% copper, 10% tin, and you'll get your bronze. Now the copper is not a problem. The copper is
612960	617760	going to come from Cyprus. In fact, that's where the name comes from, Kipros. It means copper.
618400	623440	The tin is a little bit more difficult. There's some tin, of course, up in Cornwall. There's some
623440	631040	in southeastern Turkey, but not enough. Most of the tin seems to be coming from an area off this
631040	637200	map. You can see the arrow going off. It is, in fact, an area in what is modern-day Afghanistan,
637200	643760	the Badakshan region. And in fact, not only tin comes from there. Anybody here have lapis lazuli
643760	652480	jewelry? Lapis also comes from that region. So what we've got is the need to get tin all the way
652480	659200	into the region of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Aegean. And this is going to involve trade routes. That
659200	664480	can be hundreds or even thousands of miles long. And in fact, we know that they are doing this.
664480	672400	There is a letter at Mari, which is in Syria on the river there. Not sure if Mari actually exists
672400	677760	anymore. ISIS has occupied it and is looting it. So we don't know if it's still there. But
677760	686880	there was a cache of letters found. And among them was an itinerary in which it describes
686880	693760	tin coming from Afghanistan to Mari in what is now Syria, then going on to Ugarit on the
693760	701440	northern coast of Syria, and then going from there over to Crete. And in fact, it says that at
701440	710320	Ugarit, which is right up there, that there is in fact a man from Crete, a Minoan, who can speak
710320	716560	the local language. He is the translator. So we know that they are sending tin all over there.
716560	720400	And in fact, a good friend of mine, Carol Bell, she's a British archaeologist,
721200	727920	she has said that their need for tin is basically the equivalent of our need for oil.
728480	733520	And that the search for tin would have occupied the king of Egypt and the king up in the Hittite
733520	740160	region in Turkey, just as the search for oil today occupies like a U.S. president. So if you can
740160	745360	think of that kind of a parallel, that's what we've got here. But as I say, they're not only
745440	752960	trading for raw materials, they're also trading finished goods. And in these Mari letters,
752960	758880	which actually date a little bit earlier than our period, they date to about 1800 BC. So just under
758880	767600	4,000 years ago, we have one text that describes a weapon that's being brought from Crete. It says,
767600	773200	one Kaftorian weapon. Kaftor is their name for Crete and the Minoans. The top and the base are
773200	778800	covered with gold. Its top is encrusted with lapis lazuli. So it would have looked something like
778800	784480	this, though this isn't it, because this is from the death pits of war dating to about 2500 BC.
784480	788640	But nevertheless, it's quite nice. And I wouldn't actually mind having one of these.
789840	794640	Not sure I'd be able to carry it, but I wouldn't mind. So this is one good example of what they're
794640	799840	sending back and forth. But my absolute favorite, and it shows that nothing has really changed,
800560	808000	is a text that talks about what must be sandals that says one pair of leather shoes in the Kaftorian
808000	813600	style. Now if anybody's been to Crete, you know that Kaftorian Star, their Minoan style, are either
813600	818800	sandals or boots. You can still get a nice pair of boots at Hanya. I suspect they're sandals,
818800	825040	but I'm not sure. But the text then says, which to the palace of Hammurabi, the king of Babylon,
825040	829120	and yes, that is the Hammurabi, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
830080	833920	Bach the limb carried them, but which were returned?
838400	844800	For the life of me, I can't figure out why they were returned. Were they too small? Were they two
845440	852400	last millennium? And in fact, I asked my students once to read through the whole law code. There's
852400	857920	about 272 laws. And I said, find me the law with the penalty for returning shoes.
858640	862480	And they came back and they said, there isn't one, we can't find it. I said, exactly, he got away
862480	867120	with it. But I still don't know, wouldn't you have kept them and at least re-gifted them?
868400	873760	So things have not changed all that much. So basically my point here is they are trading
873760	879600	finished goods and raw materials, and they are in fact going back and forth between the different
879600	887760	countries. We know, for example, that Hatshepsut sends an embassy down to Punt. We don't quite
887760	893040	know where Punt was, or at least we didn't know until recently. But on her mortuary temple,
893040	899280	she has descriptions and pictures of the ships that went. She even has pictures of the goods
899280	906320	that are brought back. And she even tells us in the lowest picture there that the queen is named
906320	911600	Eti. So we know all about this. The problem was, as I said, we didn't quite know where Punt was
911600	918240	until recently. And then someone did an analysis of some baboon mummies in the British Museum
918240	925280	and determined that they were most closely related to baboons in Eretria or Ethiopia. And that was
925280	930400	one of the possibilities for Punt. So that's probably where it was. Now she wasn't the first
930400	935440	person to send embassies there, and she's not the last, but that's what she is known for.
936000	943120	Other embassies, though, other trade missions may have gone over to the Aegean, to Greece.
943840	950400	Here is the tomb of Rekmere, and in here, Rekmere is the vizier, like the right-hand man,
950400	955680	to the pharaoh. We see people from Greece. These are Minoans or Mycenians, and they're bringing
955680	963200	typical Aegean goods to Egypt. Same thing here. In this tomb, again, you can see somebody is
963200	969760	carrying a bull's head. That's straight out of Canosos. So we know that Egypt and Greece are trading
969760	978320	already back at, well, about 1400, 1450 BC would be when this is taken place. And it continues.
979280	985920	This is Amenhotep III's mortuary temple. I wager that some of you have seen these. The Colossae
985920	991040	of Memnon, they're about 60 feet tall. And in fact, there were Greek and Roman tourists that
991040	998000	went to see these. They scratched their names. Kilroy was here, but in Greek. What you don't see
998000	1004160	is the missing mortuary temple that these were at the entrance to, because it was stolen by the
1004160	1009760	later pharaohs. Why go out and quarry more stone when you can just take this from a dead pharaoh
1009760	1017440	and make your own temple? So most of them are now gone. Now, much more interesting to my mind
1017440	1024080	than the big 60 foot tall ones are the smaller ones that were probably only about 10 feet tall.
1024080	1027920	You can't see these statues anymore. They're gone. You just see the feet here.
1028640	1034960	But in the 1960s, German archaeologists were excavating and they found five of these statue
1034960	1041360	baseless. They hypothesized there were 10. In fact, the new excavations that are there now have
1041360	1049680	revealed more than 40 of these statue baseless. On each of these bases are the names of foreign
1049680	1055200	powers, foreign countries. One mentions places that we know belong to the Hittites. Another one
1055200	1061040	mentions the Babylonians and the Assyrians. But this particular one is the one that caught my
1061040	1067840	interest, the Aegean list. It has names that had never appeared in Egypt before and would never
1067840	1076320	appear again for the most part. Because what you see on one side is two names over here,
1077200	1083440	which are the head names for the list, Keftiou and Tanaya. Keftiou is the Egyptian name for Crete,
1084560	1091040	just like they called it Kaftor up in Mesopotamia. In Egypt, they call it Keftiou. Tanaya is probably
1091040	1096560	mainland Greece. So we've got Crete and mainland Greece. And then on the other side and going
1096560	1105760	around the edge, we've got a series of 14 names that mention, again, places that had never been
1105760	1118560	written down in Egypt before. Amnesos, Vestos, Caedonia, Mycenae, Catozacro, Naphthion, Ilios,
1119200	1126400	Canosos, and Amnesos again, which is kind of interesting. Now, the very first time it was
1126400	1131680	deciphered when it was translated into English, Ken Kitchen, a rather preeminent British scholar,
1132560	1138160	published and he said, I'm rather hesitant to suggest this, but this looks uncomfortably like
1138160	1145840	Mycenae and Canosos. Well, uncomfortable enough, it was Mycenae and Canosos, and this list is
1145840	1152640	basically one of a kind. But if you go over to Greece and you look at the sites that are mentioned
1152640	1159520	on that statue base, you actually find objects with Amenhotep III's name on it, or his wife,
1159520	1165280	Queen T, they seem to have married for love. But here we've got a phion's plaque with Egyptian
1165280	1170800	hieroglyphs. And we've got on the right side, you can see Netra Nefer, Nehmet Ra, the good God,
1171360	1177200	and then the name of Amenhotep III. And at a number of the sites that are on the statue base,
1177200	1183520	we've got objects with his name on it. So for instance, at Canosos on Crete, here is a scarab
1183520	1190880	of Amenhotep III. So I think that this is not just boasting or bragging. I actually think it
1190880	1197680	might record an itinerary of the way to get from Egypt up to Greece and back again. And I would
1197760	1204880	suspect that maybe that's why Amnesos is on here twice. It's a round trip. So you're going from
1204880	1208720	Egypt, you get up to Crete and you stop, it's the first place, get off, everybody use the bathroom,
1208720	1213760	it's time for a coffee. And then you go, and you've known the Minoans for quite a while, the
1213760	1218400	Egyptians had known them already for a couple hundred years. But the Mycenaeans are new upstarts
1218400	1224320	at this time at about 1350 BC. So let's go up to mainland Greece and see what's going on up there.
1224320	1229120	Then we come back down to Crete and here we are at Amnesos again. Everybody use the bathroom,
1229120	1233920	it's going to be a long ride till we get back to Egypt, right? Sounds familiar. So I think that we
1233920	1238800	might actually have an itinerary here. I can't prove it, but I think it's a definite possibility.
1239520	1245600	One of the reasons why I say this is because we have the remains of actual ships that were going
1245600	1252640	around and around the Mediterranean at that time. This is the rather well-known Ulubarun shipwreck
1252640	1260480	which went down off the coast of Turkey in about 1300 BC. It's been excavated by George Bass and
1260480	1266960	Jamal Pulik of Texas A&M, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, and they found what you're looking
1266960	1272320	at here. You can see the stones going right down through the middle with the holes in them.
1272320	1280240	Those are anchors. There are 14 stone anchors on here. But the majority of the cargo, 300
1281200	1288000	copper ingots, which you see here. The copper is 99% pure and it comes from Cyprus. So this
1288000	1295120	particular ship is carrying, actually it's more than 300 ingots. You can carry them on your shoulder.
1295120	1302880	They each weigh about 60 pounds. It's got 10 tons of copper. It also has a ton of tin on this same
1302880	1309200	boat. So if you mix the copper and the tin, you're looking at an awful lot of bronze. In fact, George
1309200	1314960	Bass at one point estimated that there is enough raw material on board this one ship that you could
1314960	1321680	have outfitted an army of 300 soldiers with swords, shields, helmets, greaves, everything that you would
1321680	1328960	need to get a modern Bronze Age army back then. So when this ship went down, somebody lost a fortune
1328960	1335840	and I actually hoped they were insured. Now seriously, there was insurance back then. We
1335840	1341120	know it from the tech. So it's not out of the question that this was insured. So we've got
1341120	1346960	lots and lots of copper, lots and lots of tin. In fact, we have other things as well. The top
1346960	1352800	left hand column picture there. You actually have tin. You can see the round bun ingot there.
1353520	1360000	You've also got in the top right hand picture also round ingots. But this is raw glass,
1360800	1365680	colored with cobalt. And in fact, when the Corning Museum of Glass analyzed these,
1366240	1371760	it matched perfectly with glass from Mycenaean Greece and New Kingdom Egypt. So they're all
1371760	1377600	getting their glass from the same place. We've also got in the lower line there, all the way
1377600	1382800	down bottom on the left, terribenthe resin, which comes from the pistachio tree. You use it in making
1382880	1390080	perfume. In the middle, ivory of course, but not just from elephants, also from hippopotamus.
1391120	1395760	And it actually turns out that about 90% of the ivory in the late Bronze Age is from hippo,
1395760	1404080	not from elephants, which people found surprising. And then new unused pottery from Cyprus and Canaan,
1404080	1411440	Israel, Lebanon, Syria. So this is for me a microcosm of the international trade that was going on
1412160	1419040	at the time that this ship sunk in about 1300 BC. And in fact, if you plot this on a map, which
1419040	1424480	National Geographic did, by the way, if you're interested, it's December 1987. It's my favorite
1424480	1433440	issue ever. They on this map put the objects from the ship on the map as to where they came from.
1433440	1439280	They thought the ship was going around and round and round, hence the blue arrows. I'm actually
1439280	1444400	not so sure that they were doing that. I think it might be a gift from one king to another,
1444400	1449600	in which case it's going straight across. But it's not out of the question it was also on a
1449600	1455920	shopping expedition, because everything they needed would have been used by a Mycenaean palace.
1456640	1462320	So we need raw glass. We need more pistachio resin. We need some tin. We need some copper and
1462320	1467680	get some milk while you're out. But the ship never came back. So for me, this is, as I say,
1467680	1474640	a microcosm. But we've also got the writing. A text from Ugarit on the north coast of Syria
1474640	1479280	dates to about 40 years after this ship went down. It's called the Siniranu text,
1479280	1484720	because it mentions a merchant, a private merchant named Siniranu. It says,
1484720	1490640	from the present day, Ammestamru, the son of Nick Meppa, king of Ugarit, exempt Siniranu,
1490640	1495360	son of Siginu. By the way, I wanted to name our kids this. My wife refused for some reason.
1495920	1503120	At any rate, let's see, his grain, his beer, his olive oil to the palace, he shall not deliver.
1503120	1510560	His ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete. So we have a private merchant in about 1260 B.C.,
1510560	1519680	who is importing olive oil, beer, and grain, and he's exempt from taxes. I actually think this
1519680	1524800	might be the first corporate tax exemption in history, but can't be sure about that. So when
1524800	1529840	you combine the physical evidence from the shipwreck and the written evidence from the Siniranu
1529840	1536000	text, I think it's pretty clear that we've got international trade going on. So basically what
1536000	1542000	we've got, we've got a globalized society, and I do use that term warily, but interconnection,
1542640	1550720	merrily going along, 17th century, 16th, 15th, 14th, 13th, everybody's having fun being diplomatic
1550800	1556800	and trading, and there's reciprocity going on. And then into this, a little chaos was dropped,
1558320	1564560	and one by one, each of the civilizations winked out. Actually, they did it pretty fast. The only
1564560	1569840	one that was left standing was Egypt, and even they were so weakened that they were never the
1569840	1576880	same again. The New Kingdom is the high point. So just after 1200 B.C., we get what we call the
1576880	1582080	collapse or the calamity, and pretty much everything gets destroyed. Everything that
1582080	1587440	had been good, everything that had been ticking along merrily, suddenly goes out as if somebody
1587440	1594240	had just snapped their fingers. Now the question is, what caused it? And that's been one of history's
1594240	1599760	great mysteries. One thing we can say is that the magnitude of the collapse when it did take
1599760	1606080	place was enormous. I don't think anything comes close to it until the Roman Empire collapsed,
1606080	1612640	and that was 1500 years later. But as I say, the question of what caused it is a bit of a problem,
1612640	1618560	and that's where my book comes in. Rob Tempio of Princeton University Press asked me if I would
1618560	1624160	write a book about the collapse, and I said, sure, but I also want to write about what collapsed. So
1624160	1629040	the beginning and the end are about the collapse, and the middle is what I've just described to you,
1629040	1634160	what collapsed, telling the stories about that. Now I also realized that I'm not the first person
1634240	1639520	that's discussed the collapse of civilizations. There was a guy named Edward Gibbon who wrote a
1639520	1646320	little book about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Joseph Tainter in 1988 put out a book,
1646320	1653280	The Collapse of Societies of Complex Societies, which has been an absolute marvelous book for
1653280	1659120	all of us. And then of course, I imagine a number of you have read Jared Diamond's book on collapse.
1659120	1664400	The difference, though, is that when the Late Bronze Age collapsed, it was a multitude of
1664400	1670240	interconnected and intertwined civilizations that all went down at once. These books mostly are
1670240	1677760	talking about the decline of a single civilization at a time, Roman Empire, Maya, Mongols, Indus Valley.
1677760	1684320	We are rather unique here in the Late Bronze Age in that that is one of the few times when you
1684320	1690720	actually had interconnected civilizations much as we have today. So I actually think the parallels
1690720	1696720	between us today and them back then are much stronger than you might suppose, even though they
1696720	1703120	were 3,200 years ago. So anything that we can learn about their collapse, I think, is not just
1703120	1709840	idly studying ancient history, but may contain some lessons for us today. But the big problem is
1709840	1716080	trying to figure out why they collapsed. And what used to be the easy solution, everybody said, oh,
1716080	1723360	it was the Sea Peoples. Why not? Sure, Sea Peoples. Well, we actually know these from the Egyptians.
1723360	1730880	We know that they came through twice. 1207 BC and 1177 BC. And you can see right there,
1730880	1735360	that's where the title of the book comes from. But actually, it would be better to say the fifth
1735360	1741360	year of Monapta or the eighth year of Ramses III because the Egyptologists keep changing the
1741360	1748400	chronology. Everything is on a sliding scale. So in fact, when the book came out, a senior
1748400	1754560	colleague of mine up in New York sent me an email in which he said, nice job, congratulations. The
1754560	1761200	title should have been 1186. I sent him back a two word email.
1769120	1777120	And no, it's not what you think. My email to him simply said, it was. And in fact,
1777120	1783200	in the contract I signed, the title was originally 1186 BC. But in the years that I was doing the
1783200	1787360	research and the writing, the Egyptologists changed the chronology again. And so it became
1787360	1794000	1177. In the interval since the book has come out, they've changed the chronology again. And so
1794000	1800800	the next edition is going to have to be called 1188. Anyway, so for us, let's just say the
1800800	1807280	eighth year of Ramses III. Well, what happens here? He actually tells us in both pictures and
1807360	1814400	texts, and he shows us the naval battle and talks about the land battle. And he says, and I'll quote
1814400	1819920	here, the foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands. All that once the lands were removed
1819920	1827120	and scattered in the fray, no land could stand before their arms from Hattay, Koday, Karkamesh,
1827120	1833200	Artsua, and Alashia on. Now we know where those places are. Kati, those are the Hittites up in
1833200	1840000	Turkey. Koday and Karkamesh, that's where Turkey joins Syria. Artsua is on the western coast of
1840000	1845360	Turkey. Alashia, that's the ancient name for Cyprus. So we can see that these people are basically
1845360	1852640	coming across Greece to Turkey to Cyprus and then into Canaan because he continues a camp was set up
1852640	1860240	in one place in Amur. Amuru is by Ugarit on the north coast of Syria. They desolated its people.
1860320	1865120	Its land was like that which comes, never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt
1865120	1870480	while the flame was prepared before them. And then he gives us the names of the peoples because
1870480	1875360	there's not just one sea peoples. In fact, he doesn't call them the sea peoples. That's our name
1875360	1882640	for him. He gives us the actual groups, the Peleset, the Tejaker, the Shekilesh, the Denyan,
1882640	1889200	and the Weshash. And then he says that he defeated them. And we know this from his year 12, Papyrus
1889200	1894880	Harris says, I overthrew those who invaded from their lands. I slew the Denyan who are in their
1894880	1900640	aisles. The Tejaker and the Peleset were made ashes. The Shardana and the Weshash of the sea,
1900640	1906320	they were made as those that exist not. So you can see how we've got the name, the peoples of the
1906320	1912720	sea, but he actually gives us the names. In fact, when you combine this with the earlier invasion,
1912720	1919360	30 years previously, there's nine of these groups that all come in. So the big question that we've
1919360	1924720	got is who are these people? Where did they come from? And where did they go to? Now we know what
1924720	1931920	they look like because Ramses shows us them. These are pictures of captive sea peoples. In fact,
1931920	1936880	if you want to dress up at Halloween, it's quite easy to do it. But trying to find where they came
1936960	1942800	from is more and more difficult. So people have been playing, for example, linguistic games. So
1942800	1948480	Shardana, name me a place in the Mediterranean that has similar consonants where they could have
1948480	1955520	come from and give you a hint. Look in the western Mediterranean. Sardinia, people have suggested
1955520	1963120	that's where they came from. Same thing with Shekelesh, nearby Sicily, possibly. Tejaker,
1963120	1969520	maybe somewhere in Italy or Turkey. The Danians, some people have suggested that these are the
1969520	1975600	Danans, Homer's, Mycenaean, Greeks. Weshash, we're not quite sure about, maybe from Willowsoe. It's
1975600	1982000	only the Peleset that we think we know, the Philistines. And in fact, Jean-François Champollion,
1982000	1986640	the guy who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics, he had already suggested that the Peleset were the
1986640	1994720	Philistines way back in 1823 or so. Now, one of the problems we've got, though, is did they come
1994720	2000000	from there or did they go there afterward? Are they from Sardinia or is that where they fled
2000000	2005040	after they were defeated? And we don't know the answers. All I can tell you right now is that
2005040	2010560	no site has been excavated where we can definitively say that's where the Sea Peoples come from.
2010560	2016720	They are a mystery. We do know where some of them ended up. The Philistines, the Peleset,
2016720	2023200	they wind up in what is now Israel, Lebanon, Syria. And in fact, you can see from this
2023200	2028560	Philistine stirrup jar, it's what we would call degenerate Mycenaean. It looks like somebody
2028560	2035600	from Greece is still making their pots, their stirrup jars, but they're now using local clay
2035600	2041760	from Rhodes or Cyprus or even Canaan, ancient Israel. So it really looks like at least part
2041760	2047600	of the Mycenaeans had joined the Sea Peoples maybe after they lost. And in fact, I suspect
2047600	2053200	that that's why we've got the disparate groups. As these people swept over the lands, some of the
2053200	2059120	people they were vanquishing joined in. So what we see in Egypt is the end of the process, this
2059200	2065760	motley crew. But they're not Vikings. They're not raiders. We shouldn't be thinking like that.
2066480	2073840	Because in the pictures that Ramesses shows us, he shows us, and you can see on the left and also
2073840	2079680	the drawing on the right there, they're coming with their possessions. They're coming with ox carts.
2079680	2086800	They're coming with wives and children. This is a migration. This is a movement. Think 1930s
2086800	2093760	Dustball and everybody moving from Oklahoma to California. That's what this is. It's a migration.
2093760	2100880	It's not just Viking raids. So then the question is, well, what caused that? And for the longest
2100880	2107360	time, there was a very simple, logical, linear explanation that there was a drought. And that
2107360	2113520	drought led to famine. And that led to the movement of the Sea Peoples. That led to havoc and the
2113520	2119040	cutting of the trade routes. And that led to collapse. And it's a nice, easily told bedtime
2119040	2125520	story, or perhaps not bedtime. But the problem is, it's too logical. It's too messy. Nothing
2125520	2132240	is that logical. I think it's too simple. So what really happened? Well, that was what I
2132240	2139200	wanted to investigate. If everything was gone, what caused it? Why did everything collapse?
2139280	2144480	So suddenly. So the Sea Peoples were usually blamed for it. But I actually think
2144480	2149920	they were as much the victims as they were the oppressors. I think they've been given a bad name.
2149920	2155440	They got bad press. Yes, they were there. Yes, they did some damage. But I think they actually
2155440	2161840	had a little bit of problem themselves. So what else could have caused it? Well, drought has been
2161840	2169120	suggested. Famines been suggested. Invaders have been suggested. Earthquakes have been suggested.
2169120	2176160	So if we have to pick and choose one of them, I respectfully decline. I would choose them all.
2176960	2181760	I think there's a perfect storm. I think they all happened. Let me present the evidence to you
2181760	2189680	rather quickly and then see what you think. Drought is not a recent suggestion. In fact,
2189680	2195600	Rhys Carpenter, who was a professor at Bryn Mawr, suggested this in the 1960s. He said that the
2195600	2201840	Mycenaeans had declined and gone downhill very quickly because of drought. But he didn't have
2201840	2208400	proof for it. He didn't have any hard data. And so people gradually forgot that he had suggested
2208400	2215920	this. But we now have that data. We've got it in the last five years. Connie Juski, a French
2216800	2221840	professor, has been going with his team to a number of different places. And they went here
2221840	2230000	to the north coast of Syria, a place called Gibala. And they took course from dried up
2230000	2235680	lagoons and lakes. And then they looked at the pollen that was in there. And they decided,
2235680	2243200	they could see, that the plants had changed. And there was what they call a 300-year dry event.
2243200	2249280	In other words, a drought. And the pollen shows that there were drier climatic changes
2249280	2255920	back then from about the 12th century or the 13th century, right about our time period,
2255920	2262560	just after 1200, all the way down to the 9th century. So 300 years. So North Syria looks like
2262560	2269040	it had a drought. They went over to Cyprus, did the same thing at Hollis-Sultantechi.
2270000	2277840	Same thing. There is a drought there as well from 1200 to about 850 BC, judging from the pollen.
2278560	2284960	And then Brandon Drake pulled together a bunch of different data in a study that was published in
2284960	2289440	the Journal of Archaeological Science, including things like the temperature of the sea,
2290400	2297280	which dropped. And when you do that, you get less rain on the, in this case, the Mycenaean
2297280	2302880	or Greek mainland. And he said that took place about 1250 down to 1197 BC.
2303760	2310320	Now, Brandon's article was so good. I did something that I rarely do. I wanted to contact him
2310320	2316000	and give him my congratulations, a superb article. So I Googled him. All I knew was that it was
2316000	2321440	Brandon Drake from University of New Mexico. And Google came up and the very first thing it said was,
2321520	2329520	you are friends in Facebook. Really? So I sent an email to him and he's like, hey Eric,
2329520	2337200	how's it going? Haven't seen you since Megiddo in 2006. All right, we dug together. So you may
2337200	2344480	know people you don't even know you know. The power of the internet. The most recent of these
2344480	2349840	scientific tests has taken place with Daphne Langut, who you can see in the picture down there in
2349840	2355840	Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Litt, a German scientist. They also did the coring and the
2355840	2361760	pollen analysis this time from the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. And they showed that in Israel
2361760	2368240	too, there was a drought. It didn't last quite as long. It was from about 1250 down to 1100 BC.
2368240	2374160	But so we've now got that missing data that Reese Carpenter was looking for, that there was a dry
2374160	2383920	event, a drought that lasted from, well, at least 13 or 1200 BC down to, take your pick, 1150, 900,
2383920	2390400	somewhere in there. And it's in Israel, it's in Syria, it's in Cyprus, it's in Greece. So at least
2390400	2395120	the science is telling us that there is a drought. And of course the media went wild over this.
2395840	2400720	Right, New York Times, pollen study points to drought is culprit in Bronze Age mystery.
2401520	2406640	LA Times got into the act. Climate change may have caused demise of late Bronze Age civilizations.
2407840	2413200	Archaeology magazine and National Geographic didn't want to be left out. There's Nat Geo,
2413200	2418800	here's archaeology. New York Post got into it and they tossed in globalization for good measure.
2421040	2425760	How globalization and climate change destroyed ancient civilization. And then you may remember
2425760	2431760	that NASA funded study that turned out to be not so funded by NASA, that said that we were going
2431760	2437760	to collapse in just a couple of decades. And at that point I was a little fed up, so I put an op-ed
2437760	2447040	in the Huffington Post, the collapse of civilizations, it's complicated. Which it is. Now, with drought
2447040	2452720	you frequently get famine, but famine can be difficult to discern in the archaeological record
2452720	2458160	unless you find bodies and things like that. But that's where written texts come in. And in fact,
2458160	2465040	we've got archives at Ugarit which tell us that, in fact, that's what's going on. Here is a letter
2465040	2469120	from the house of Ortenu. He's another one of those private merchants like
2469120	2477920	Senorano only a hundred or more years later. He has a outlying office in the city of Imar in
2478000	2484800	land Syria and he gets word back. There is famine in our house. We will all die of hunger. If you
2484800	2490560	do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from
2490560	2496320	your land. So I think you can agree with me that there's probably famine going on there. We've got
2496320	2502560	the written records. And we've even got this from the king of Ugarit. Another letter. Here with me
2502560	2508560	Plenty has become famine. I think this is incontrovertual evidence. Even the Hittite king,
2509200	2514240	do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands? It is a matter of life and death.
2514960	2519760	And in fact, we know from other records that the Egyptians who until recently had been mortal
2519760	2527440	enemies of the Hittites were sending grain ships up to help relieve the famine in the Hittite lands.
2527440	2534640	So we've got that going on, which we see the same sort of things today. Now, adding insult to
2534640	2541760	injury, though, do we have invaders? Well, yes, we do see people. So remember them, the Egyptian
2541760	2547680	records. But it can be tough sometimes to figure out who's causing your destruction. So it could
2547680	2553360	just as easily be internal rebellion. And in fact, we've got yet another letter from the king of
2553360	2559680	Ugarit, in this case being sent to the king of Cyprus. And he says, my father, now the ships of
2559680	2564560	the enemy have come. They've been setting fire to my cities and have done harm to the land.
2565120	2570160	Doesn't my father know that all of my infantry and chariots are stationed in Hathi? So they're
2570160	2575360	up in the Hittite lands in Turkey. And then he says, seven ships have been sighted. If any more
2575360	2580960	are coming, then please let me know. Now, the story that was told for decades was that this text
2580960	2587040	had been found in a kiln at Ugarit. It was being baked before it was shipped over to Cyprus,
2587040	2593680	so it wouldn't fall apart. But that the destroyers had shown back up, those ships had come again,
2593680	2598960	and that the kiln and the whole city had been destroyed before it could be sent. Makes a great
2598960	2606240	story. Again, too good to be true. Re-examination has now shown that it was not in a kiln. It was,
2606320	2612480	in fact, probably in a basket up on the second story, which fell and landed upside down. And in
2612480	2619280	that basket were this tablet and about 70 others. And as the basket disintegrated, it left a kiln
2619280	2625360	shaped lump with all these tablets. So in fact, we now think that it in fact was sent, and this
2625360	2632640	could actually be a copy that was left. So we don't actually know if it's from the last Sea
2632640	2639200	peoples or the previous one 30 years earlier. So it's not as much of a help as we thought. And yet,
2640160	2646400	it's definitely evidence for invaders. We've even got another letter. It's a private letter. It's one
2646400	2651760	of the last from Ugarit, which says, when your messenger arrived, the army was already humiliated
2651760	2656800	and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floor was burnt and the vineyards were also
2656800	2662480	destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it? May you know it? So somebody is coming in
2662480	2668960	and destroying this area. And in fact, Kaniyusky, the same guy that took the pollen samples,
2668960	2676800	when he was at Gibala in North Syria, he actually identified a destruction layer as sea peoples.
2676800	2682320	But this is a bit hasty. There's definitely a destruction layer, but it's not necessarily by
2682320	2687920	the Sea peoples. We don't actually know who did it. So this is a bit of a problem. And in fact,
2687920	2694560	I give you one example. Canaanite hotsore in the north of Israel definitely destroyed somewhere
2694560	2700720	around 1200 BC. We know this because we've got the archaeological evidence of the Late Bronze Age
2700720	2708320	palace that is completely torched. The mud bricks are, sorry, the mud bricks are burnt red and black.
2709040	2716240	A fire destroyed this. And in fact, the excavators, actually two excavators, Amnon Ben Tor and
2716240	2722160	Sharon Zerkerman who just recently passed away, they were directing the site. And Amnon Ben Tor
2722160	2727680	said, you know what? It's probably not Egyptians that did this destruction because there are
2727680	2733120	Egyptian statues that are in the destruction level and they're defaced. They have their arms hacked
2733120	2737840	off inside. So no Egyptian would have done that. So it can't be Egyptian. And same thing with the
2737920	2742960	Canaanites because there's also Canaanite statues in the destruction and they are also defaced.
2742960	2748560	So it's not Canaanites that are doing this. He says that leaves the Israelites and the Sea peoples
2748560	2753760	and this is too far inland for Sea peoples. And I would actually debate that. Sea peoples got
2753760	2759600	quite far inland, but he didn't want them. That left the Israelites, Joshua. And in fact,
2759600	2765280	Hotsores mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities that Joshua burned down. Well,
2765280	2771440	Sharon Zerkerman said, wait, not quite so fast. This is definitely burnt down. That's for sure.
2771440	2775680	But how do you know who did it? And he says, well, what do you mean? She says, well, if you look and
2775680	2782080	see what's destroyed, it's the palace and a couple of temples, but the actual domestic areas where
2782080	2786160	the people are living and working, they're untouched. They're not burnt. They're not destroyed.
2786720	2792480	She said, to me, that's the sign of an internal rebellion of the lower classes rising up against
2792480	2798240	the upper class when they don't have enough food or enough money or whatever. So she said,
2798240	2804000	it's an internal rebellion. And my point here is very simple. If the two co-directors can't decide
2804000	2809600	who destroyed their site, then how are we ever going to decide? All we know is that it is destroyed
2809600	2818080	by somebody or maybe by some thing because we can't rule out earthquakes. And in fact,
2819040	2826560	if you take a map of the sites that are destroyed in this collapse from about 1225 to 1175,
2826560	2832800	everything you see here with the red X is destroyed. And if you overlay it on top of a map
2832800	2838800	of earthquakes that have happened just in the last century, or a little bit more since about 1900,
2838800	2845440	you can see that most of the sites are actually in active seismic zones. In fact, we've got
2845520	2849600	a number of fault lines. You've got the North Anatolian fault line in light blue.
2849600	2854880	You've got another fault line in green. You've got an orange one coming up the Great Rift Valley.
2854880	2858960	So there are lots of fault lines and lots of earthquakes in this region.
2860240	2864960	And in fact, we have something that I find absolutely fascinating. This is the North
2864960	2872400	Anatolian fault line running across the top of Turkey. It has had what is called in modern terms
2872400	2880560	an earthquake sequence over the last 60 or more years. In fact, specifically about 1939 to 1999.
2880560	2884720	An earthquake sequence is when you have an earthquake and it doesn't release all the pressure,
2885840	2889440	there'll be another earthquake right next to it. We're nearby sometime in the future,
2889440	2894320	a week later, a year later, maybe a decade later. If that one doesn't release all the pressure,
2894320	2899520	you'll have another one and another one until the fault line unzips. This is stuff that Amos
2899520	2904880	Norit, Stanford studies. So earthquake sequence is what they call it when it happens in modern times.
2904880	2910560	But it happened in antiquity as well. They have a much cooler name for it. It's called an earthquake
2910560	2918560	storm. When you have this earthquake storm and it unzips over a period of 50 or 60 years,
2918560	2925440	it then takes about another 400 years to generate enough steam and start the whole process over
2925440	2931680	again. And it looks like if we look at some of the sites that are destroyed that there is a 50-year
2931680	2936880	earthquake storm right around our period. So I think that there are earthquakes taking place here.
2936880	2943280	So for instance, my sceni here on the land gate, you can see the Cyclopean masonry on the left side
2943280	2949280	and it's built on top of what looks like bedrock there. That's actually one side of a fault zone.
2950240	2954560	All the geoarchaeologists went there and just started laughing. They're like,
2954560	2960560	wait a minute, they built the major city on top of an active fault zone? Who would do that?
2964880	2968560	Yeah, the people from San Francisco just kind of shook their head.
2971200	2976640	And in fact, we've got victims that are obviously killed in an earthquake. Here is one young lady.
2976640	2981440	It's actually the same one in both pictures here. You can see the rock that's lying to the side of
2981440	2987840	her head in the, what is that, the right picture for you. That rock was actually embedded in her skull.
2987840	2992560	She had taken shelter in a doorway, which is usually the best place to do it, in the basement,
2992560	2999600	but the whole thing had collapsed and had killed her. So mycena, tirans, just three kilometers away,
2999600	3004720	same sort of thing. In this case, we've got a woman and a child killed by a collapsing
3004720	3009040	building at the same time period. If you go over to Troy with the Trojan War and all that,
3009040	3015280	Troy Six, you've got a wall that is not supposed to look like that, right? That one that's leaning.
3015280	3021040	Trust me, it wasn't built like the way originally. And even at Ugarit, this is a slightly earlier
3021040	3026960	one, but you see how that wall undulates. It's not supposed to do that. So there are earthquakes at
3026960	3032400	this time. So here, my point would be that if you see a site that's destroyed, it might not be who.
3032400	3038320	It might be what that destroyed it in this particular case. But if you do have a who,
3038320	3043680	then you've got the cutting of these international trade routes. And that is going on. And I bring
3043680	3050560	us back to one of our original slides here, where you've got this long trade route with the bronze
3050560	3057200	and the copper and the tin. And if imagine it had been cut at any point along that, and you
3057200	3062640	suddenly couldn't get your tin anymore, then how are you going to make your bronze? Now,
3062640	3067280	that's not going to bring your bronze age to a complete halt in and of itself. But if you add
3067360	3072480	that in to the great mix, then I think you can see you've got a problem. And in fact,
3072480	3077200	they were lucky that they were able to turn to iron to take over. And in fact, you know,
3077200	3083120	in the bronze age, there are already using iron. In King Tut's tomb, there's an iron dagger.
3083120	3088400	It's just that they're using bronze much more. And even in the iron age that takes over, they're
3088400	3094400	still using bronze, but not as much. So in this particular case, we see basically an innovation
3094480	3099280	taking over to fill a gap where they don't have bronze anymore, and they've got iron.
3100160	3106160	So in terms of what happened, well, it's still a mystery. But I think we can sum up
3106880	3112320	if I give you three points that I think you will agree with me, and there'll be no arguments,
3112320	3118320	we can then proceed from there. So first point, would you agree that we have a number of separate
3118320	3124000	civilizations that are flourishing between, say, the 15th and the 13th centuries? We've named
3124000	3129200	some of them, Mycenaeans, Minoans, Hittites, Egyptians, Canaanites, Cypriots. They're all
3129200	3134000	independent, but they are all interacting with each other, especially through trade routes.
3134560	3141680	Would you agree with me with that point? Okay, so we've got that. Second point, it's pretty clear
3141680	3146800	that many of the cities were destroyed and that the late Bronze Age pretty much came to an end
3146800	3153280	right around 1177 or soon thereafter. We all agreed with that. No argument there. Everything's
3153280	3160000	destroyed. Everything goes down. But point number three, there's no proof as to what or who has
3160000	3165440	actually caused this. All we know is that it did collapse. So we've got three main points that
3165440	3171600	everybody agrees on, and yet it in a way doesn't help us all that much. And in fact, people are
3171600	3178160	still even today going with that same linear progression. They still say, I heard it last
3178160	3183440	November. Drought, famine, cutting of the trade routes, movement, all that. I still say
3184160	3192560	that is too linear. It was much, much messier. So if you were to say to me, well, what is it?
3192560	3198080	Earthquakes, famine, drought, movement of peoples. I would say yes to all of the above. In fact,
3198080	3202960	the only thing that's missing is plague. There's no evidence for plague. And I actually do find
3202960	3207360	that surprising. I think there should be, but no evidence for that yet. But everything else,
3208080	3214400	absolutely, we've got the whole thing. The problem is I don't know that we can point to any one
3214400	3220720	single driver or stressor. Certainly climate change seems big, but is that the major stressor
3220720	3226400	or driver? Well, that can be argued because some of the others may have caused a problem as well.
3226400	3231680	And in fact, different parts of this region, ranging from, remember, we're going from Italy and
3231680	3237040	Greece all the way over to Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan, different problems may have
3237040	3242480	arisen in different places and they may have reacted differently. But the ending is the same.
3242480	3251120	They all end. They are depending on each other for both raw materials and finished products.
3251120	3257120	And therefore, when one went down, there is a domino effect. What happens to the Hittites affects
3257120	3262800	the Mycenians, which affects the Cypriots, which affects the Assyrians and so on. So anything that
3262800	3269760	gets destabilized in a system like this is ultimately going to affect everything. And in fact,
3269760	3275920	what we're looking at is a systems collapse. This isn't an explanation for it. It's just a name for
3275920	3280720	it. When you've got a systems collapse, and Colin Renfrew was talking about this already back in
3280720	3287520	about 1979, you have a collapse of the central administration. You've got the disappearance
3287600	3293440	of the traditional elite. You've got the collapse of the economy, if you've got a centralized
3293440	3300480	economy, and you have entire population shifts and decline. Now, this doesn't happen overnight.
3300480	3305520	Systems collapse, which we can see in a number of different places, takes about 100 years.
3307120	3316320	And in fact, I would say that 1177 is the wrong title for my book. Civilization did not collapse
3316320	3324240	in that year. That is just shorthand for the whole collapse. Just as we say that Rome fell in 476.
3324240	3328720	Even though we know it didn't, it took most of the 5th century, and even then you've still got the
3328720	3335760	Eastern Roman Empire continuing on. We still say Rome fell in 476. It's shorthand, if you will.
3335760	3342480	That's what 1177 is. It's a shorthand. Perhaps a better way to say it would be that the world in
3342480	3349600	1200 was very different from the world in 1100 and completely different in the year 1000.
3350400	3357440	But that doesn't really fit on a book cover. So, we're looking at something that takes about a
3357440	3363200	century, and when everything does fall, you get a dark age. And in fact, we've got that. We've got
3363200	3369200	the Greek dark ages that go for about 300 years. And in the systems collapse, you frequently get
3369200	3374560	myths about the golden age that came just before. So, think, for example, about Homer,
3374560	3379200	and a story about the Trojan War. It's a perfect example. So, what I would say that we're looking
3379200	3386880	at is indeed a systems collapse from that time period. So, what are the takeaways? What lessons
3386880	3394800	can we learn from this? Well, one of the questions we can ask is, are we facing a similar situation
3394880	3404000	today? Now, that might be, I mean, it's 3200 years, but let me ask you, is there climate change today?
3404720	3408480	Well, we could argue about that till the cows go home, but I think most people now would say yes.
3409760	3415200	Famines and droughts somewhere in the world? Absolutely. Earthquakes going on? Yes.
3416160	3421280	Rebellions? Sure. In fact, I think the only thing we're missing are the sea peoples.
3421680	3429040	And in fact, I'm not so sure we're missing the sea peoples, because there could be two different
3429040	3434240	groups that you can interpret as the sea peoples. It could either be ISIS, which is busy destroying
3434240	3438560	everything in the Near East. Our antiquity is going to be gone if we don't do something about it.
3438560	3445120	Or there could be the refugees that have fled from Syria and elsewhere that are now in Europe.
3445200	3451840	It depends if you see the sea peoples as victims or oppressors, or maybe both. So,
3451840	3456880	I actually think we do have the sea peoples today as well, just with a slightly different name.
3457680	3465040	And in fact, if we take a look at headlines from around the world, from say the last two or three
3465040	3472800	years, Greece's economy is tanked, right? That's been in the news. Internal rebellions have engulfed
3472800	3479360	Libya, Egypt, and Syria. Outsiders and foreign warriors are fanning our flames. Yes, not news.
3479360	3486720	It's on TV every night. Turkey's afraid it's going to be involved, as does Israel. Jordan is crowded
3486720	3493680	with refugees. Iran is bellicose and threatening, and Iraq is in turmoil, right? All of this ripped
3493680	3498640	from the headlines in the last couple of years. Well, what if we had newspapers from 1200 BC?
3499360	3504080	What would the headlines have read? Pretty much the same thing.
3507360	3516880	So, my question is, we are more technologically advanced. We are also more aware of our surroundings.
3517600	3525760	That is, the Hittites did not have SUVs. They did not cause climate change. But Mother Nature
3525840	3531600	did a pretty good job of it back then. I also think the Hittites were not aware of what was
3531600	3536400	happening. What was a drought? Why didn't it rain? I mean, you pray to the storm god, and if works,
3536400	3543600	or it doesn't work. We know what is happening. We know what's causing it, and we might know what
3543600	3550320	to do about it. The question is, will we do it? Now, I look backwards. That's my job as a historian.
3550320	3556400	It is the job of others, including in this audience, to look forward. So, I would simply say
3557360	3566240	that if a similar globalized society collapsed 3,200 years ago, might we not want to study it a
3566240	3572080	little bit to find out what we could learn and maybe stop ourselves from doing the same thing?
3572880	3575360	Food for thought. Thank you.
3586640	3588000	Thanks, Eric. Have a seat.
3588640	3604160	Say more about the dark age. 300 years of what? What was lost? I mean, you said you wanted to live in
3604160	3612800	the Golden Bronze Age. There are lots of apparently good things. But languages lost,
3612800	3617680	technologies lost, cities emptied. What does darkness mean in this case?
3617760	3624160	Darkness means totality. I mean, you ask what's lost. What isn't lost? They lose the art of writing.
3624160	3628880	The art of writing. Well, if you want to call it the art of writing, they forget how to write.
3628880	3634800	Now, remember that only 1% can read a right back then. So, when you take off that traditional
3634800	3639120	elite, including the Scrabble class, you're left with not many people who know to read and write.
3639120	3646080	So, Linear B goes away, which the Mycenaeans are using, and so on. So, they lose writing,
3646080	3651280	they lose the monumental architecture, they lose much of what we would call the hallmarks
3651280	3656720	of civilization. Now, they're going to get it back, but it's going to take a while. It takes a
3656720	3661600	different period of time depending on where you are. So, in Greece, for example, it takes about
3661600	3667680	two to 300 years to come back. But in other places, it takes them far less. For example,
3668480	3673920	remember, Egypt doesn't really collapse. It's just weakened. And Assyria and Babylon,
3674400	3679840	they bounce back in a couple of decades. And I think the secret there is they're all on major
3679840	3684640	rivers. You've got the Menile, you've got the Tigris and the Euphrates. So, even if you've got a
3684640	3691680	drought, I think they're less affected. But even they have dark ages. So, it's what happens.
3691680	3700240	So, was there a Renaissance where people sort of rediscovering stuff from before and there was
3700240	3706720	continuity or was there a completely new invention of these things? Both. There's both a Renaissance
3706720	3711040	and new inventions. But in fact, there is a period of Greek history that we call the Greek Renaissance.
3711600	3716800	And this is the period when you have Homer, Heciate, and then Sappho and the Greek poets. The
3716800	3721280	eighth century is when they're coming back up and rediscovering. But in the meantime, you've
3721280	3726480	got new things. For example, the Phoenicians have brought their alphabet. And so, when they're now
3726480	3731120	writing in the eighth and seventh centuries, they're using an alphabet, which is completely
3731120	3737040	different from what they had done with Linear B, which is basically pictograms. So, there's both
3737040	3742960	the Renaissance and new ideas. And one of the things that occurred to me is, you know, I hate to
3742960	3747520	kind of put it this way, but if you have an old growth forest, sometimes a forest fire is good.
3747520	3753360	It clears away the underbrush and lets new things grow. And that's kind of what happened here.
3753360	3759200	Because think about a what if. What if this hadn't collapsed? Would you have the Israelites
3759200	3764480	coming in? Would you have Moses and Monotheism? Would you, a couple centuries down the pike,
3764480	3770320	have Greece and democracy? I mean, it's all kinds. So, because this collapsed, we've got our world
3770320	3774640	today. So, one of these days, I want to write something about a what if. What if it hadn't
3774640	3784800	collapsed? What would we be doing? Smart dinosaurs. Right. Question from Chris Brousseau.
3784800	3789040	Please illustrate the scale of the cities, kingdoms, armies, and navies of the towns.
3789040	3793600	What was the population of Knossos and so on? What, how many people are we talking about?
3793600	3798720	It's very tough to estimate population. And it depends that you ask three different people,
3798720	3802880	you get three different answers. But they have a range, probably. Yeah, they've got a range. And
3802880	3807520	in fact, there's a new article out saying Knossos is three times larger than we ever thought it was
3807520	3810880	at this time period or actually in the Iron Age. So, new theory or new data?
3810880	3816000	New data that's just coming out. Yes. But the, the upshot is in terms of cities, I mean, we're
3816000	3820800	talking a couple thousand people. We're talking armies that are maybe a couple of hundred people.
3820800	3827440	They're not huge. There is in the Battle of Kadesh. Army of a couple hundred people. A couple
3827440	3834480	hundred people can do pretty devastating attacks. Not even a, you know. Yeah. Yeah. There is in the
3834480	3840160	Battle of Megiddo, for example, there are 900 chariots that are captured. That's a huge fighting
3840160	3845760	force. That actually is. That's a lot of tanks. Yeah. Armored cavalry. Armored cavalry for that
3845760	3852480	time period. We have another, a Hittite text that talks about a force in the region of Troy
3852480	3858640	in about 1500 BC. And it says, so and so landed with a hundred men. That was a lot.
3858640	3863280	So, we're not talking huge amounts. We're talking a couple thousand. I think if a city is 10 or
3863280	3871040	20,000, it's, it's big. It's huge. And what was in these cities that people would want? I mean,
3871040	3876640	I can see this sort of the, not invasion, but refugee approach. But some of these sound like
3876640	3882960	they were, you know, we're going to take down your city. And what was there that they would want?
3882960	3888640	Is this slave gold? I mean, what's there? Well, in a lot of these cases, what it seems is at the
3888640	3894320	end of the late Bronze Age, they're burning down the cities and then reoccupying them. So, remember,
3894320	3898560	this is a migration. They're actually looking for places to settle. And in fact, some of the
3898560	3905600	archaeological evidence is indicating that the assimilation, if you will, was much more peaceful.
3905600	3912400	The Canaanites and the Philistines, for example, Asafchus Orlando of Haifa, is, has got evidence
3912400	3918560	that these are actually maybe much more peaceful settling down. So, yes, there is some warfare,
3918560	3923760	yes, there is some destruction, but they're not, you know, pillaging and burning and moving on.
3924480	3929920	They are even at Gibala, where Kaniyuski was looking. There is a destruction and then there's
3929920	3935440	an immediate reoccupation. And in that case, there is this Philistine looking pottery, which is why
3935440	3940960	he thinks it's sea peoples. Had there been a long peace before all of this breakdown that
3941600	3946880	made these societies more vulnerable in some sense, more relaxed about things?
3946880	3953280	It's possible. That is quite possible. They are definitely, this is an era of prosperity,
3953280	3957760	I would say, from the 14th century on. So, growing prosperity. People are growing.
3957760	3962800	Generation to generation, better and better off. Exactly. And they may have been lulled into a sense
3962800	3969040	of false security. I was at a conference a year or two ago on climate change at this time period.
3969600	3976880	And one of the people there suggested that there was actually a time in the 14th century of more
3976880	3983920	rain and better times, and that perhaps they overextended themselves. And so, when the ending
3983920	3989600	came, it was all that more drastic. So, yes, they may have been, I wouldn't say lulled into
3989600	3995360	false security, but things were going really well in the 14th and 13th centuries. And in fact,
3995360	3999600	that's the thing about this collapse is everything is going really well until suddenly it's not.
4000400	4006320	It's not like things were going badly for a while. It's in Ugar, for example, the letters from the
4006320	4011360	merchants and the kings and all that. Everything is going great until suddenly the city is destroyed.
4011360	4015760	So, are these societies, do they have histories of themselves? Are they telling stories of their
4016000	4019760	own past? Or are they living in a kind of a rolling present?
4020400	4025840	Depends on the city. Ugar, for example, has, there's actually a cottage industry of
4025840	4030240	Ugaritic studies. They've got history. They've got king lists. They've got queen lists. They've
4030240	4036000	got epics. They've got, so we've got that. But from others, it's mute that we don't have anything.
4036000	4041520	So, it just depends where you are. Steve Levines, can you comment on the languages of the period?
4041520	4046160	Was there a lingua franca? So, they're doing all this trade. There's numbers and we have this
4046160	4050960	accounting. Is there something besides numbers that they all speak? Absolutely. Excellent question.
4050960	4055920	And yes, the lingua franca of that day is Akkadian, which the Amarna letters that I cited at the
4055920	4062880	beginning. If you were Hittite and you could read or write, you would know Hittite and Akkadian.
4062880	4068240	If you were Egyptian, you would know Egyptian and Akkadian. Even probably the Mycenaeans,
4068240	4072800	they would know linear B and Akkadian. If you are living in Assyria and Babylon,
4073440	4078560	you're home free because you're doing Akkadian anyway. Right, but that is the lingua franca and
4078560	4085120	we do see the diplomatic correspondence being written in it. Some of the Amarna letters are,
4085120	4089920	one of them is written or two of them are written in Hittite, but that's unusual. Most of them are
4089920	4094720	Akkadian. Everybody's got their own language and then there's one diplomatic language. So,
4094720	4100320	that in a sense was the Bronze Age lingua franca. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, well, well, like
4100320	4108960	English now. Some guy writing in the dark, I can't read his name. Bob Copac, it might look like.
4110960	4116320	When did the iron business start? That iron technology you mentioned briefly that it was
4116320	4124160	just getting going in Egypt suddenly. Where? And say a little bit about bronze technology versus
4124160	4134720	iron technology. Okay, this is a much debated point, but basically iron, once you are able to
4134720	4138480	master the smelting and all that, of course, iron is going to be much better than copper.
4139760	4147200	But copper is in some ways seems to be easier to manipulate. Now, that's not always true, but
4147200	4153840	there is a good reason why they are using bronze for almost 2000 years and that iron doesn't take
4153840	4160560	over until it really absolutely has to. The actual date for the invention of iron is a bit of a debate
4160560	4165360	and there's kind of an old wives tale that the Hittites invented it and had a monopoly.
4165360	4171520	And that's why they were able to capture most of the Middle East at one point. That turns out to
4171520	4176720	have been a mistranslation of one of the texts. And so, while the Hittites did know iron, so did
4176720	4182400	everybody else. But it's the type of thing where you're not going to actually do it until you have
4182400	4188800	to. And so, I would say, as I said, that this is something where if your supply of tin is cut off
4188800	4193200	and you can't make bronze anymore, you will turn to iron. Which turns out to be better anyway.
4193200	4200400	Which turns out to be better anyway. Exactly. Well, yeah, what is the sharpness of a bronze dagger
4200400	4206320	versus iron? Does it really matter how sharp it is? If it goes in you, it goes in you. All that.
4206320	4212800	But bronze doesn't hold an edge, presumably, as well. Bronze does not hold an edge as well.
4212800	4216560	I still would not want to get attacked by it. Fair enough. I promise not to.
4219680	4227040	Manual Manal Mehta, I think, asks, what could they have done in 1177 to prevent the collapse?
4227760	4231600	Good question. I've been wondering that myself. What could they have done to prevent the collapse?
4231680	4237200	Who would be the they in this? Who would be the they? Yes. Might be Egypt. In fact, I think
4237200	4244720	Egypt did prepare. If Ugarit is destroyed between 1190 and 1185, which we think,
4245600	4252560	and the Sea Peoples don't wind up in Egypt until 1177, that gives them a good seven to
4252560	4258480	10 to 15 years to figure it out. So I think Egypt was plenty prepared. In fact, there's some new
4258480	4264480	evidence, by a colleague of mine, that thinks the land battle, there's a land battle and a naval
4264480	4270160	battle. And she thinks the land battle was actually fought earlier up in Syria, and that it was kind
4270160	4275520	of an offensive defense. Go protect your country. And Egypt sort of reached up. And the Egyptians
4275520	4281120	went all the way up. And then later they fought the naval battle down below. So I do think that
4281120	4285280	they had some time to prepare. And I think that's probably why they were successful.
4286240	4292080	Others, you know, what can you do if you're if your supply of a crucial raw material is cut off?
4292080	4296400	It can be difficult. If you're hit by an earthquake, I don't know anything that can prepare you for
4296400	4302960	that. So I'm not so sure it was possible to have survived it. And this is one thing that
4304080	4309040	I would say if an earthquake hits, you can survive it. If a famine hits, you can survive it. I mean,
4309120	4315760	people will die, but you can survive it. A drought? Invaders? Yes. Somebody always survives. But what
4315760	4323520	if you have one, then two, then three, and then four? What if you have the perfect storm? That also
4323520	4328960	gets you a multiplier effect, right? Where everything is going to get worse and worse and worse. And I
4328960	4333440	think that's what we've got here. So I think if it had been just a famine, they could have survived
4333440	4337920	it. They've done that before. We know they had a famine back in the 14th century. They survived it.
4338560	4341680	We know there's invaders. They've survived it. But when you've got them all at once,
4342240	4346160	so there, how do you prepare for that? And I'm not sure that you can.
4347440	4353760	So you've got a sort of cascading effects. You've got a chaos leading to chaos. You mentioned four
4353760	4360640	things in your slide, the sort of loss of administrative center, the loss of kind of an
4360640	4367040	economic apparatus, the loss of the elites, and I forget what the other. Right. The population
4367040	4376320	declines and movements. So do the cities really empty out in these circumstances or what happens?
4376320	4380720	Some of them did. Some of them did. They're actually population movements. And in fact,
4380720	4385440	that's what Reese Carpenter was basing himself on. He didn't have the data about the pollen and
4385440	4391040	everything, but he did notice the population shifts. And he said one of the only reasons that could
4391520	4397440	caused it was drought and then the whole thing collapsed. So indeed. So people go away from
4397440	4402800	drought. That makes a lot of sense. They go away from chaos, but toward what? Right. Ironically,
4402800	4409440	however, one of the major suggestions is that if the Sea Peoples, the Shardana and the Shackalash
4409440	4414720	really did come from Sardinia and Sicily, which I do adhere to that. I don't think they went there
4414720	4420640	afterward. I think they came from there. The hypothesis is that there was an original drought
4420640	4425760	up in Europe or in Western Mediterranean that started them moving. In which case,
4425760	4431280	they had the worst rotten luck because they're moving from one drought into another drought
4431280	4436320	on the Eastern Mediterranean. And what do you do if you have a 300 year long drought? That's pretty
4436320	4444720	hard to survive. Famously. So Egypt goes into a steep decline. That's the way you describe it. Say
4444720	4448880	a little more about that. So even though they were prepared and they're the ones that survive,
4448960	4453680	what does survival mean under these circumstances? In this particular case, there is still upheaval
4453680	4461120	and turmoil and rebellions in Egypt. Everything is not hunky dory. They do survive. In fact,
4461120	4466480	Ramses III himself, the man who saved Egypt from the Sea Peoples. Was that how he was seen at the
4466480	4471680	time? Was the guy who... I would imagine. We don't actually have anything that says it. Well,
4471680	4479520	actually, he himself says that. I'm sure he said that. I'm the one. He was assassinated in a harem
4479520	4488640	conspiracy, which is kind of an interesting way to end your life. In fact, and it was... We know
4488640	4494160	about it because it was written. It's actually a fairly famous papyrus where it says that there
4494160	4500400	was an assassination plot and it names a minor queen who had just had a son. And there were
4500400	4505920	something like 40 accomplices in the harem and they're all put on trial and they're put to death,
4506480	4514080	but nobody knew whether it had succeeded. The actual report doesn't say. But Ramses III's
4514080	4521840	mummy was x-rayed in CAT scan not so long ago and his mummy has kind of a scarf around his neck.
4521840	4525760	And when they looked through it, they just now saw, this is the last couple of years,
4526320	4532560	a knife, an incision by a knife that went right in and just cut his throat, basically. He would
4532560	4537840	have died pretty much instantly. And so it looks like the assassination did in fact take place.
4537840	4544960	Now, in the same tomb, they also found a young man wrapped in a goat skin and not mummified,
4544960	4550960	which is what you do when somebody is... Well, you don't want them to survive into the afterlife.
4550960	4555200	And that mummy of the young man shows evidence of having been strangled to death.
4556000	4561840	So the hypothesis is that that is the young prince who was part of it and that he was then
4561840	4568400	buried with his father after the assassination took place. So even though you beat the sea peoples,
4568400	4574480	you might have trouble at home. Yeah, the most dangerous thing is a pharaoh's either your family
4574480	4585760	or your harem or both. Michael M asks, there are lots of mysteries. What one piece of information
4585760	4591600	would you as an archaeologist most like to find that would solve most of the questions you have?
4593040	4597040	What would I most like to find that would solve most of my questions? Or would you like somebody
4597040	4603840	else to find that you would be glad to read? Yes. Do both, actually. There's digs that you work on
4603920	4608160	and there's digs that other people work on. Absolutely. So, for example, at Megiddo, where I
4608160	4617280	was for the last 20 years, we know that the king of Megiddo, Biridia in 1350, is writing to Amenhotep
4617280	4623200	III. Or maybe that's where Megiddo is. Megiddo, sorry, is northern Israel, Jezreel Valley. In fact,
4623200	4629440	Megiddo is Armageddon. Har-Megiddo in Hebrew is the mound or mountain of Megiddo. Har-Megiddo,
4630080	4635360	Armageddon. The original rough breathing or H was lost to us over translation. So,
4635360	4640240	Megiddo is Armageddon. And that was kind of fun digging in Armageddon for 20 years. In fact,
4640240	4650240	our shirts at the back said, I survived Armageddon. Well, in about 1350, the king of Megiddo is writing
4650240	4656080	to the Egyptian pharaoh and we have six letters from him in that Amarna archive in Egypt. What we
4656080	4661680	don't have are the responses. They are somewhere at Megiddo. And that was actually why I joined the
4661680	4667680	project originally in 1994. I wanted to find that archive. In fact, I think I know where it is because
4667680	4674640	Chicago, who was there 1925 to 1939, they excavated half of the late Bronze Age palace. And the other
4674640	4679920	half is still there waiting to be excavated. And that's probably where the archive is. I was so
4679920	4684880	sure we were going to find it in 94. I brought my Akkadian textbooks. I was prepared to translate
4684880	4691360	them on the spot. Oh boy, yeah. We never found. Listen to this. Exactly. Look what he got in return.
4691360	4696480	So I would love to find the archive at Megiddo that I know is there. We just haven't found it.
4696480	4703360	So, but basically writing, writing, writing. At my other side of Calvary, which is a Canaanite palace
4703360	4708400	way up in the north of Israel. Think right on the Lebanese border. That's where we are. We've got a
4708400	4716080	Middle Bronze Age Canaanite palace. And in 2013 and 2015, we found the oldest and largest wine
4716080	4722640	seller from the ancient world. So we've got about 16,000 liters of wine. It's got an earthy taste now, but
4723760	4729200	no, it's all gone. We just have the jars, but organic residue analysis can tell you what was in
4729200	4734880	the jars. We don't have a scrap of writing. I would love to know if they were writing,
4734880	4739920	or were they writing too? Because they've got connections to Greece. So it's the missing tablets
4739920	4744960	that have me in a conundrum. That's in my wildest daydreams. That's what I would want to find.
4744960	4749600	Another couple of archives. You realize that if civilization collapses about 30 years from now,
4749600	4753120	there'll be no writing at all recording what the hell happened. It'll all be in the cloud.
4754800	4759040	We'll be out there, you know, analyzing corpses, trying to find out what they were sick with.
4759040	4764080	Absolutely. And that, for me, as an archaeologist, is a fascinating question. What are people going
4764160	4770400	to find from our civilization if and when we do collapse? And if there are any future archaeologists,
4770400	4775360	what are they going to think when they excavate, say, the Smithsonian Museum or the Washington
4775360	4782000	Zoo or all the Starbucks that are out there? Well, do a little taxonomy of collapse here. So
4782720	4790640	the one clearly that we in the West take most seriously was the collapse of the Roman Empire.
4791600	4798240	Compare and contrast what happened then with what happened 1500 years earlier, 1177.
4798240	4806320	Well, I think the collapse of the Late Bronze Age was at least as great as the collapse of the
4806320	4812880	Roman Empire in terms of what we lost. In terms of, I mean, the Babylonians and Assyrians are doing
4812880	4819200	complex mathematics and astronomy and medicine. We've got the text from them and from the Egyptians.
4819840	4824720	Right. All sorts of things that were lost. All that astronomy was lost. All that was gone.
4824720	4831120	Yeah. Now, it's later reincorporated. I mean, we've got the Neo-Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrians
4831120	4836160	who rise up in the first millennium and they continue. Like I said, for them, they only go down
4836160	4841680	for a couple of decades. So they are able to have the Renaissance right away. And so we've got
4842400	4848000	Neo-Babylonian astronomy, for example, is quite advanced. But in other cases, I mean,
4848000	4854400	it's so lost we don't even know what they had. The Mycenaeans, their language was only deciphered
4854400	4862640	in 1952 as an early version of Greek. One gets a sort of sense of trauma that happened in the West
4862640	4869120	after Rome went down. Do you think it was that kind of traumatic in the Mediterranean
4869120	4874400	when the Bronze Age went down? Yes, I think it was absolutely traumatic, especially for the survivors
4874400	4880320	that probably didn't know what hit them and really what to do about it. I mean, think if you've
4880320	4885920	got a complex society and everything's ticking away merrily and then into it, like I said, you
4885920	4892640	just drop a little chaos. You've got everything. It's like a fine race car where if you throw a rod
4892640	4897440	from your engine, suddenly you're driving a piece of junk. Same thing here. I think it had been
4897440	4902800	absolutely marvelous and wonderful and they were going places and suddenly it's a screeching halt
4902800	4911680	and everything stops. And then you've got, so these were monumental civilizations and so you've
4911680	4919200	got, you know, the thing that we saw in a sense after Rome and after the later demise or slowdown
4919200	4925680	of Egypt of people sort of camping out in the ruins of a former civilization. Yes, and we do have
4925680	4932320	that. We have squatters in most of these places. In fact, can also us with them thinking that now
4932320	4936880	in the Iron Age it's three times bigger. In the immediate aftermath, it probably was squatters.
4936880	4942480	In fact, Mycenae, for example, Agamemnon's Mycenae, there are squatters that continue. It doesn't
4942480	4949680	just go down. It continues on a trickle. Squatters show up how in archaeology. It's hard to tell
4949680	4955520	sometimes, but when they're living in what are obviously ruined buildings and yet they're still
4955600	4958880	living there, that's a pretty good indication.
4963280	4968160	See a little more about, you mentioned when we were talking before, you're working on a couple
4968160	4974400	of stories now, one being Megidae, one being archaeology of the future. We at Long Now Foundation
4974400	4977600	are very interested in archaeology of the future since we're trying to create some
4978320	4987280	with a 10,000 year clock. What have you got? What is you bear down on? What future archaeologists
4987280	4996160	will find? What stands out? Well, it's an interesting question. Actually, it comes from
4997200	5001920	The World Without Us, a book published a couple years ago. Yeah, he gave a talk here. Exactly.
5002480	5006080	Got me thinking about that. And they were a couple of specials on TV at the time.
5006640	5012240	So now, when I fly into a major city, I try and imagine what I would find as an archaeologist
5012240	5017200	in say 2,000 years. And of course, what would be left are the plastics and the things that are
5017200	5023840	non-biodegradable probably. But then I do come to the question of how you would interpret it.
5024480	5028480	Because in archaeology, for example, we've got a saying, of course it's tongue-in-cheek,
5028480	5032000	but if we don't understand something, then it's cultic or religious.
5032800	5039760	Or fertility, right? Or fertility? Or fertility, exactly. So, for example, I mean,
5039760	5043680	if you were excavating some of the Smithsonian museums, that's going to throw you for a loop.
5044560	5048800	What's the hope diamond doing next to an elephant doing next to a... But you know,
5048800	5054240	Nabonitis in the 6th century BC, he had a museum. I was going to say, there must be historic museums
5054240	5058080	that look like that, because everything cobbled together. And that through the archaeologists
5058080	5061600	for a loop when they're finding Sumerian stuff next to Babylonian stuff, they're going,
5061600	5066640	what's going on? They suddenly realized we're digging an ancient museum. So what if you have
5066640	5073040	something like that? Or what would be left, say, of the zoo, San Francisco Zoo, Washington Zoo?
5074320	5078720	If the animals got out and you just have empty cages, or if the animals don't get out and they're
5078720	5083680	still there, what are you going to do with that? And then, really, what are you going to do with
5083680	5088720	all the McDonald's and Starbucks that are on every corner? Are you going to interpret it religious?
5088720	5097680	You've got that green hair goddess. So I can think of it. We were talking earlier about Motel
5097680	5103600	of the Mysteries, which a wonderful book where they misinterpret a motel and they've got somebody
5103600	5108880	lying in the sacred chamber and they're on the sacred platform and they have the sacred communicator
5108880	5113200	looking at the altar. And you realize it's a TV with the remote and he's on the bed.
5113200	5117040	Right. And then he's shouting into the toilet, which is the... It makes it this great echoing sound.
5117360	5123200	Absolutely. And my favorite picture is where she is wearing toothbrushes dangling from her ears
5123200	5129200	and she's got the sanitize for your protection around her head and was wearing a toilet seat
5129200	5134480	and it's a deliberate recreation of Sophie Schleeman wearing Priam's treasure from Troy.
5135600	5139920	Absolutely marvelous. So what's the future of archaeology? I mean,
5140080	5144960	don't we run out of things to dig up after a while?
5148320	5153680	Fortunately, no. There is no shortage. No, there's so much past and there's so much stuff in so many
5153680	5159440	places we never run out. Right. We will not run out. There's no such thing as peak antique.
5162960	5168480	No. There will always be something. The question though on a serious note is,
5169120	5173120	how are we going to do archaeology? And that's one of the things I've been wrestling with.
5173920	5178240	There have been so many advances, for example, just in the last couple of decades. Now we're using
5179200	5184240	satellite imagery, right? Sarah Park Act, the space archaeologist, is finding stuff from space.
5184240	5188320	Some of you may have seen her on Colbert. And drawings that can go right over the
5188320	5194480	area. Absolutely. Light arc and see through the jungles. So I'm actually getting a bit
5194480	5199680	frustrated, to be honest, of digging blind, as I say, where we put a trench down and we're not
5199680	5205360	sure if we're going to hit something. So there are ways to look through electromagnetic and
5205360	5210080	resistivity and conductivity and things like that. But there's got to be something out there that
5210080	5216000	can actually tell us more what we're looking for. And I suspect it's there that somebody here in
5216000	5220480	Silicon Valley or whatever is already using it. And I just have to talk to the right person who
5220480	5228800	says basically, oh yeah, we got that. So what can we find, for instance, looking into a mound
5228800	5233360	like Megiddo, which has 20 cities, one on top of another? We don't do that anymore. We don't
5233360	5236880	stack our cities quite the way we used to do it. No, we do not stack our city, more is the pity.
5236880	5241120	Yeah. It's going to be a whole future archaeologist. The coastal cities may do that,
5241120	5246640	as the sea level rises. Perhaps. But no, but they did it. They stacked them. But I would love to be
5246640	5252480	able to, something that would tell me, yes, 20 feet down there is a plaster floor. It should be
5252480	5256960	able to be something that would detect the components of plaster. I would think. You don't just drill
5256960	5266320	on these things. No, you don't. So I think we had a major revolution with these new sensing
5266880	5272400	devices. But that was, for the most part, 30 years ago. I think it's time, it's ripe for a new
5272480	5277280	revolution. The question is, what's it going to be? Now, the people that were digging in the 60s
5277280	5283040	could never predict LIDAR or satellite images, at least not the archaeologists. Micro biome
5283040	5289360	analysis of, you know, what's in the wine jar. Exactly. The organic residue analysis. Absolutely.
5289360	5296080	So what's it going to be like 30 years from now? Well, that's one reason that we don't do 100%
5296080	5301920	excavation of a site. We leave part of the site knowing that the next generation is going to
5302000	5306880	either be better than us or have better equipment than us. I've always admired the
5306880	5312720	long-term thinking involved in that. Is it actually the case that people do go back and do another
5312720	5319200	trench? And so there is a sort of a return. Absolutely. The problem is that each time somebody
5319200	5323760	else comes, they take away a little bit more. So for instance, Heinrich Schlemann was at Troy
5323760	5327680	first, and he actually dug right through the layer that he was looking for and threw it out on his
5327680	5334080	back pile. If I had $50,000, I'd go dig through the back pile at Troy, because that's where all the
5334080	5338720	good stuff is because Schlemann threw it out. So the next person, Dortfeld, had to dig around the
5338720	5344560	edges. And then the next person after him, Blagen, had to dig around his edges. And it was only until
5344560	5350480	Manfred Korfmann got there in 1988 with new technology that he was able to figure out that
5350480	5356480	what we know of as Troy is just the citadel where the king and his retainers were. There is a lower
5356480	5362880	city in the plain below that expands the size of the city by 10 or 15 times. Oh boy. Yeah. So that
5362880	5368960	gets closer to the city we hear about in Homer. Exactly. So now it fits better. But in that
5368960	5374320	particular case, had Schlemann realized there was a lower city, I'm sure there'd be nothing there
5374320	5380960	for anybody else to ask. So there's two things being discovered here. One is more, well,
5380960	5386640	better tools to discover more stuff. Probably more archaeologists now alive than there have
5386640	5391600	ever been. I would think so, yes. And archaeology is now there's not only more of us, it's more
5391600	5398960	scientific than it ever was. It's more theory based as well. And it's more both inter and cross
5398960	5403840	disciplinary theory in terms of the theory of archaeology, a theory of what's being discovered.
5403840	5409120	Both. Okay. Both, I would say. We're trying to ask bigger questions. We're no longer digging
5409120	5412960	just to dig. We're not digging just get Oh, it's a city. Let's see what's there.
5413680	5419520	For example, at Cabri, our Canaanite Palace, we are our larger questions. We're trying to
5419520	5425440	investigate the rise of rulership. We're trying to look at the Canaanite economy and try and
5425440	5431280	compare palatial versus non palatial. So we're we've actually got bigger questions that the
5431280	5438960	digging can help us answer. This story continues. They'll keep finding more stuff. And what I
5438960	5444080	love is you keep finding new stories emerging from the stuff. Thank you for the stories tonight.
