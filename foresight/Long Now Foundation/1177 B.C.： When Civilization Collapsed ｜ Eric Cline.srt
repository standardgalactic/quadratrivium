00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,080
Good evening. My name is Alexander Rose, I'm the director here at Long Now. And as you

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,200
know, at the beginning of most of these talks we do, it's called A Long Short, a short film

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,760
that in some way exemplifies long-term thinking. Tonight's comes from some members who are

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,480
here in the room. Where are you? Wave your hands, shout. There you are in the back of

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,680
the room. Thank you. And actually it's a good point to remind you all that actually finding

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,680
these long shorts is quite difficult. So if you have good candidates, please send them

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,440
into us or make some of your own like these guys did, which is a really great one. And

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,600
I think tonight's Long Short is interesting. I mean, we're definitely going to go vastly

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,240
further into the past than tonight's Long Short is. But part of civilization's fragility

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,120
comes both from its interconnectedness and that's also one of the things that really

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,560
makes civilization robust. So I think tonight's Long Short shows a little bit of each of that.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,840
Enjoy.

13
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Good evening. I'm Stuart Brand from the Long Now Foundation. As you know, the Long Now we define

14
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,840
as the next 10,000 years, which we're building a clock for in the last 10,000 years, which we're

15
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,280
still figuring out what happened. Part of the idea of all that is to sort of calibrate how we

16
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,360
think about time and history and eternity, which doesn't actually play into this at all forever is

17
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:00,560
not part of this story. But time has size. And we're pretty good at the minutes and hours and

18
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,160
the kind of stuff we saw in the film here. We're still figuring out decades, centuries, millennia.

19
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,360
So half the way back 5,000 years ago was the beginning of the Bronze Age, starting to get

20
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,360
bronze tools and weapons and the kind of society that can use those things. And that went on for

21
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:34,960
2,000 years. And then it ended much more suddenly than it began. And we have a speaker who knows

22
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:49,760
more about that than anybody or a client. Thank you so much for inviting me here. Thank you all for

23
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,960
coming. I'm presuming you're out there. It's hard for me to see. But what I would like to do tonight

24
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,920
in the next hour or so is to take you back, take you back between 4,000 and 3,000 years ago

25
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:13,360
to the time that is my favorite period in ancient history. Late Bronze Age, 1700 to 1200 BC. If I

26
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,800
could be reincarnated backwards, that's the period I would like to live in. I don't think I'd survive

27
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,520
for about more than 48 hours. But it would be a marvelous 48 hours. Now, this is the period when

28
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,840
we have what I would call the G8 of the ancient world. And I'm cheating a little bit because in

29
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,320
order to do that, I have to combine the Minoans and the Mycenaeans of Greece into one entity.

30
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,480
But we have them on the edge of the screen there. We also have the Hittites in purple up here in

31
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:56,880
Turkey. Matani is in red. Assyrians and Babylonians are in kind of a mustard yellow. And then

32
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,520
Egyptians are the orange going up the Nile and into Canaan. We also have Cypriots and other people

33
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
as well. Now, all of these people are interacting in the time period that we're going to talk about.

34
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,360
And I dare say that you actually know more about that time period already than you might suspect.

35
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,440
So for example, this is the time when Hatshepsut lives, the famous female pharaoh. How many people

36
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,400
have heard of her? Okay. Tupmosis III, one of the greatest military conquerors, lives at that time.

37
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,960
My boy, Amenhotep III. He is the guy I most wish I could meet in antiquity. Akhenaten,

38
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,040
the famous heretic pharaoh. I dare say you've heard of him. King Tut, that's the man that everybody

39
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,920
knows. Ramses II, Ramses III. This is the time period that we're talking about. And during these

40
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:55,520
centuries, everything flourished. It was, in fact, a time that was almost globalized if we can use

41
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,920
that word and put it, project it back into the past. But with that comes other things too, not

42
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,000
just trade, not just diplomacy, but things like wars. So for example, we've got the battle of Kadesh

43
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,800
between the Hittites and the Egyptians. We've got a little thing called the Trojan War.

44
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,120
You may have seen a movie that Brad Pitt was in. We also have things like the Exodus, which,

45
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,080
if it took place, will have taken place at about this time period. Now what we've got is a globalized

46
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,560
society in which everyone is interconnected. If you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

47
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,680
we've kind of got that here as well. This is a social network diagram that my wife Diane Klein

48
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,800
made. And you can see that pretty much everybody is interconnected in some way. If the Mycenaeans and

49
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
the Hittites aren't directly connected, they know somebody who can connect them. And in fact,

50
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,240
we've got writing from that time period, such as this. This is a typical Cuneiform tablet.

51
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Looks like a bird has stepped an ink and walked across the page. There is an archive that dates

52
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,120
to about 1350 BC in which we found about 400 of these tablets and their letters to and fro,

53
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,480
to and from the kings of that time period, the king of the Hittites, king of Egyptians,

54
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,640
king of Babylon, king of Assyria, and also to the vassal kings, the ones that owed them allegiance.

55
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,000
And if you map them, you can see that we really are talking about a small world effect, which is

56
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,280
where, again, if you don't know the person, at least you know somebody in between. And usually,

57
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,120
there's no more than about three leaps that separate any particular person. So if you map these out,

58
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
as my wife did here, you can see with a couple of huge nodes with the king of Egypt and the king

59
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,160
of the Hittites and so on, that pretty much everybody is in contact with everyone else.

60
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,160
So I know that saying that that time period is globalized is a loaded term, and yet I think we

61
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,880
can use it. It was globalized for its time period. And that is from Italy on the west

62
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,520
to Afghanistan on the east. Everybody is in contact. They're trading. They are swapping

63
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,320
raw materials, gold, silver, copper, tin. They're also trading finished goods.

64
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Now this is the Bronze Age, which starts in about 3000 BC. It's all going to come collapsing down

65
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,120
at about 1200 BC. So what I actually want to do tonight is to build this up, show you what they

66
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,960
were doing, what was there, and then collapse it all down by the time we're done. We don't know

67
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,120
why they collapsed, and that's part of the mystery, and that's part of what I will talk about. But

68
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,040
before I collapse it, let me build it up. So this is the Bronze Age. To make bronze, you need tin

69
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,600
and you need copper. By the way, if you don't have tin, you can also use arsenic. I don't recommend

70
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,080
that, but you won't live very long. But you can make arsenical copper, but tin is much better.

71
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,960
90% copper, 10% tin, and you'll get your bronze. Now the copper is not a problem. The copper is

72
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,760
going to come from Cyprus. In fact, that's where the name comes from, Kipros. It means copper.

73
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,440
The tin is a little bit more difficult. There's some tin, of course, up in Cornwall. There's some

74
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,040
in southeastern Turkey, but not enough. Most of the tin seems to be coming from an area off this

75
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,200
map. You can see the arrow going off. It is, in fact, an area in what is modern-day Afghanistan,

76
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,760
the Badakshan region. And in fact, not only tin comes from there. Anybody here have lapis lazuli

77
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:52,480
jewelry? Lapis also comes from that region. So what we've got is the need to get tin all the way

78
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,200
into the region of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Aegean. And this is going to involve trade routes. That

79
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,480
can be hundreds or even thousands of miles long. And in fact, we know that they are doing this.

80
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:12,400
There is a letter at Mari, which is in Syria on the river there. Not sure if Mari actually exists

81
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,760
anymore. ISIS has occupied it and is looting it. So we don't know if it's still there. But

82
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:26,880
there was a cache of letters found. And among them was an itinerary in which it describes

83
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,760
tin coming from Afghanistan to Mari in what is now Syria, then going on to Ugarit on the

84
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,440
northern coast of Syria, and then going from there over to Crete. And in fact, it says that at

85
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Ugarit, which is right up there, that there is in fact a man from Crete, a Minoan, who can speak

86
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,560
the local language. He is the translator. So we know that they are sending tin all over there.

87
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
And in fact, a good friend of mine, Carol Bell, she's a British archaeologist,

88
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,920
she has said that their need for tin is basically the equivalent of our need for oil.

89
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
And that the search for tin would have occupied the king of Egypt and the king up in the Hittite

90
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,160
region in Turkey, just as the search for oil today occupies like a U.S. president. So if you can

91
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,360
think of that kind of a parallel, that's what we've got here. But as I say, they're not only

92
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,960
trading for raw materials, they're also trading finished goods. And in these Mari letters,

93
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,880
which actually date a little bit earlier than our period, they date to about 1800 BC. So just under

94
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:47,600
4,000 years ago, we have one text that describes a weapon that's being brought from Crete. It says,

95
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,200
one Kaftorian weapon. Kaftor is their name for Crete and the Minoans. The top and the base are

96
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,800
covered with gold. Its top is encrusted with lapis lazuli. So it would have looked something like

97
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,480
this, though this isn't it, because this is from the death pits of war dating to about 2500 BC.

98
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,640
But nevertheless, it's quite nice. And I wouldn't actually mind having one of these.

99
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Not sure I'd be able to carry it, but I wouldn't mind. So this is one good example of what they're

100
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,840
sending back and forth. But my absolute favorite, and it shows that nothing has really changed,

101
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:28,000
is a text that talks about what must be sandals that says one pair of leather shoes in the Kaftorian

102
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,600
style. Now if anybody's been to Crete, you know that Kaftorian Star, their Minoan style, are either

103
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,800
sandals or boots. You can still get a nice pair of boots at Hanya. I suspect they're sandals,

104
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,040
but I'm not sure. But the text then says, which to the palace of Hammurabi, the king of Babylon,

105
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,120
and yes, that is the Hammurabi, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,

106
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,920
Bach the limb carried them, but which were returned?

107
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,800
For the life of me, I can't figure out why they were returned. Were they too small? Were they two

108
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,400
last millennium? And in fact, I asked my students once to read through the whole law code. There's

109
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,920
about 272 laws. And I said, find me the law with the penalty for returning shoes.

110
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,480
And they came back and they said, there isn't one, we can't find it. I said, exactly, he got away

111
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
with it. But I still don't know, wouldn't you have kept them and at least re-gifted them?

112
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,760
So things have not changed all that much. So basically my point here is they are trading

113
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,600
finished goods and raw materials, and they are in fact going back and forth between the different

114
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,760
countries. We know, for example, that Hatshepsut sends an embassy down to Punt. We don't quite

115
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,040
know where Punt was, or at least we didn't know until recently. But on her mortuary temple,

116
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,280
she has descriptions and pictures of the ships that went. She even has pictures of the goods

117
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,320
that are brought back. And she even tells us in the lowest picture there that the queen is named

118
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Eti. So we know all about this. The problem was, as I said, we didn't quite know where Punt was

119
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,240
until recently. And then someone did an analysis of some baboon mummies in the British Museum

120
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,280
and determined that they were most closely related to baboons in Eretria or Ethiopia. And that was

121
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,400
one of the possibilities for Punt. So that's probably where it was. Now she wasn't the first

122
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,440
person to send embassies there, and she's not the last, but that's what she is known for.

123
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,120
Other embassies, though, other trade missions may have gone over to the Aegean, to Greece.

124
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,400
Here is the tomb of Rekmere, and in here, Rekmere is the vizier, like the right-hand man,

125
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,680
to the pharaoh. We see people from Greece. These are Minoans or Mycenians, and they're bringing

126
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:03,200
typical Aegean goods to Egypt. Same thing here. In this tomb, again, you can see somebody is

127
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,760
carrying a bull's head. That's straight out of Canosos. So we know that Egypt and Greece are trading

128
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:18,320
already back at, well, about 1400, 1450 BC would be when this is taken place. And it continues.

129
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,920
This is Amenhotep III's mortuary temple. I wager that some of you have seen these. The Colossae

130
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,040
of Memnon, they're about 60 feet tall. And in fact, there were Greek and Roman tourists that

131
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,000
went to see these. They scratched their names. Kilroy was here, but in Greek. What you don't see

132
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,160
is the missing mortuary temple that these were at the entrance to, because it was stolen by the

133
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,760
later pharaohs. Why go out and quarry more stone when you can just take this from a dead pharaoh

134
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,440
and make your own temple? So most of them are now gone. Now, much more interesting to my mind

135
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,080
than the big 60 foot tall ones are the smaller ones that were probably only about 10 feet tall.

136
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,920
You can't see these statues anymore. They're gone. You just see the feet here.

137
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,960
But in the 1960s, German archaeologists were excavating and they found five of these statue

138
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,360
baseless. They hypothesized there were 10. In fact, the new excavations that are there now have

139
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,680
revealed more than 40 of these statue baseless. On each of these bases are the names of foreign

140
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,200
powers, foreign countries. One mentions places that we know belong to the Hittites. Another one

141
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,040
mentions the Babylonians and the Assyrians. But this particular one is the one that caught my

142
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,840
interest, the Aegean list. It has names that had never appeared in Egypt before and would never

143
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:56,320
appear again for the most part. Because what you see on one side is two names over here,

144
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,440
which are the head names for the list, Keftiou and Tanaya. Keftiou is the Egyptian name for Crete,

145
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,040
just like they called it Kaftor up in Mesopotamia. In Egypt, they call it Keftiou. Tanaya is probably

146
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,560
mainland Greece. So we've got Crete and mainland Greece. And then on the other side and going

147
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:25,760
around the edge, we've got a series of 14 names that mention, again, places that had never been

148
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:38,560
written down in Egypt before. Amnesos, Vestos, Caedonia, Mycenae, Catozacro, Naphthion, Ilios,

149
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Canosos, and Amnesos again, which is kind of interesting. Now, the very first time it was

150
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,680
deciphered when it was translated into English, Ken Kitchen, a rather preeminent British scholar,

151
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,160
published and he said, I'm rather hesitant to suggest this, but this looks uncomfortably like

152
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,840
Mycenae and Canosos. Well, uncomfortable enough, it was Mycenae and Canosos, and this list is

153
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,640
basically one of a kind. But if you go over to Greece and you look at the sites that are mentioned

154
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,520
on that statue base, you actually find objects with Amenhotep III's name on it, or his wife,

155
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,280
Queen T, they seem to have married for love. But here we've got a phion's plaque with Egyptian

156
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,800
hieroglyphs. And we've got on the right side, you can see Netra Nefer, Nehmet Ra, the good God,

157
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,200
and then the name of Amenhotep III. And at a number of the sites that are on the statue base,

158
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,520
we've got objects with his name on it. So for instance, at Canosos on Crete, here is a scarab

159
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,880
of Amenhotep III. So I think that this is not just boasting or bragging. I actually think it

160
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,680
might record an itinerary of the way to get from Egypt up to Greece and back again. And I would

161
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,880
suspect that maybe that's why Amnesos is on here twice. It's a round trip. So you're going from

162
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,720
Egypt, you get up to Crete and you stop, it's the first place, get off, everybody use the bathroom,

163
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,760
it's time for a coffee. And then you go, and you've known the Minoans for quite a while, the

164
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,400
Egyptians had known them already for a couple hundred years. But the Mycenaeans are new upstarts

165
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,320
at this time at about 1350 BC. So let's go up to mainland Greece and see what's going on up there.

166
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,120
Then we come back down to Crete and here we are at Amnesos again. Everybody use the bathroom,

167
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,920
it's going to be a long ride till we get back to Egypt, right? Sounds familiar. So I think that we

168
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,800
might actually have an itinerary here. I can't prove it, but I think it's a definite possibility.

169
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,600
One of the reasons why I say this is because we have the remains of actual ships that were going

170
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,640
around and around the Mediterranean at that time. This is the rather well-known Ulubarun shipwreck

171
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,480
which went down off the coast of Turkey in about 1300 BC. It's been excavated by George Bass and

172
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,960
Jamal Pulik of Texas A&M, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, and they found what you're looking

173
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,320
at here. You can see the stones going right down through the middle with the holes in them.

174
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:20,240
Those are anchors. There are 14 stone anchors on here. But the majority of the cargo, 300

175
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,000
copper ingots, which you see here. The copper is 99% pure and it comes from Cyprus. So this

176
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,120
particular ship is carrying, actually it's more than 300 ingots. You can carry them on your shoulder.

177
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,880
They each weigh about 60 pounds. It's got 10 tons of copper. It also has a ton of tin on this same

178
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,200
boat. So if you mix the copper and the tin, you're looking at an awful lot of bronze. In fact, George

179
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,960
Bass at one point estimated that there is enough raw material on board this one ship that you could

180
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,680
have outfitted an army of 300 soldiers with swords, shields, helmets, greaves, everything that you would

181
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,960
need to get a modern Bronze Age army back then. So when this ship went down, somebody lost a fortune

182
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,840
and I actually hoped they were insured. Now seriously, there was insurance back then. We

183
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,120
know it from the tech. So it's not out of the question that this was insured. So we've got

184
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,960
lots and lots of copper, lots and lots of tin. In fact, we have other things as well. The top

185
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,800
left hand column picture there. You actually have tin. You can see the round bun ingot there.

186
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:40,000
You've also got in the top right hand picture also round ingots. But this is raw glass,

187
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,680
colored with cobalt. And in fact, when the Corning Museum of Glass analyzed these,

188
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,760
it matched perfectly with glass from Mycenaean Greece and New Kingdom Egypt. So they're all

189
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,600
getting their glass from the same place. We've also got in the lower line there, all the way

190
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,800
down bottom on the left, terribenthe resin, which comes from the pistachio tree. You use it in making

191
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,080
perfume. In the middle, ivory of course, but not just from elephants, also from hippopotamus.

192
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,760
And it actually turns out that about 90% of the ivory in the late Bronze Age is from hippo,

193
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:24,080
not from elephants, which people found surprising. And then new unused pottery from Cyprus and Canaan,

194
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,440
Israel, Lebanon, Syria. So this is for me a microcosm of the international trade that was going on

195
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,040
at the time that this ship sunk in about 1300 BC. And in fact, if you plot this on a map, which

196
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,480
National Geographic did, by the way, if you're interested, it's December 1987. It's my favorite

197
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:53,440
issue ever. They on this map put the objects from the ship on the map as to where they came from.

198
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,280
They thought the ship was going around and round and round, hence the blue arrows. I'm actually

199
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,400
not so sure that they were doing that. I think it might be a gift from one king to another,

200
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,600
in which case it's going straight across. But it's not out of the question it was also on a

201
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,920
shopping expedition, because everything they needed would have been used by a Mycenaean palace.

202
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,320
So we need raw glass. We need more pistachio resin. We need some tin. We need some copper and

203
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,680
get some milk while you're out. But the ship never came back. So for me, this is, as I say,

204
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,640
a microcosm. But we've also got the writing. A text from Ugarit on the north coast of Syria

205
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,280
dates to about 40 years after this ship went down. It's called the Siniranu text,

206
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,720
because it mentions a merchant, a private merchant named Siniranu. It says,

207
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,640
from the present day, Ammestamru, the son of Nick Meppa, king of Ugarit, exempt Siniranu,

208
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
son of Siginu. By the way, I wanted to name our kids this. My wife refused for some reason.

209
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,120
At any rate, let's see, his grain, his beer, his olive oil to the palace, he shall not deliver.

210
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,560
His ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete. So we have a private merchant in about 1260 B.C.,

211
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:19,680
who is importing olive oil, beer, and grain, and he's exempt from taxes. I actually think this

212
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,800
might be the first corporate tax exemption in history, but can't be sure about that. So when

213
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,840
you combine the physical evidence from the shipwreck and the written evidence from the Siniranu

214
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,000
text, I think it's pretty clear that we've got international trade going on. So basically what

215
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
we've got, we've got a globalized society, and I do use that term warily, but interconnection,

216
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,720
merrily going along, 17th century, 16th, 15th, 14th, 13th, everybody's having fun being diplomatic

217
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,800
and trading, and there's reciprocity going on. And then into this, a little chaos was dropped,

218
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,560
and one by one, each of the civilizations winked out. Actually, they did it pretty fast. The only

219
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,840
one that was left standing was Egypt, and even they were so weakened that they were never the

220
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,880
same again. The New Kingdom is the high point. So just after 1200 B.C., we get what we call the

221
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,080
collapse or the calamity, and pretty much everything gets destroyed. Everything that

222
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,440
had been good, everything that had been ticking along merrily, suddenly goes out as if somebody

223
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,240
had just snapped their fingers. Now the question is, what caused it? And that's been one of history's

224
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,760
great mysteries. One thing we can say is that the magnitude of the collapse when it did take

225
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,080
place was enormous. I don't think anything comes close to it until the Roman Empire collapsed,

226
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,640
and that was 1500 years later. But as I say, the question of what caused it is a bit of a problem,

227
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,560
and that's where my book comes in. Rob Tempio of Princeton University Press asked me if I would

228
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,160
write a book about the collapse, and I said, sure, but I also want to write about what collapsed. So

229
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,040
the beginning and the end are about the collapse, and the middle is what I've just described to you,

230
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,160
what collapsed, telling the stories about that. Now I also realized that I'm not the first person

231
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,520
that's discussed the collapse of civilizations. There was a guy named Edward Gibbon who wrote a

232
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,320
little book about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Joseph Tainter in 1988 put out a book,

233
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,280
The Collapse of Societies of Complex Societies, which has been an absolute marvelous book for

234
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,120
all of us. And then of course, I imagine a number of you have read Jared Diamond's book on collapse.

235
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,400
The difference, though, is that when the Late Bronze Age collapsed, it was a multitude of

236
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,240
interconnected and intertwined civilizations that all went down at once. These books mostly are

237
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,760
talking about the decline of a single civilization at a time, Roman Empire, Maya, Mongols, Indus Valley.

238
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,320
We are rather unique here in the Late Bronze Age in that that is one of the few times when you

239
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,720
actually had interconnected civilizations much as we have today. So I actually think the parallels

240
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,720
between us today and them back then are much stronger than you might suppose, even though they

241
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,120
were 3,200 years ago. So anything that we can learn about their collapse, I think, is not just

242
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,840
idly studying ancient history, but may contain some lessons for us today. But the big problem is

243
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,080
trying to figure out why they collapsed. And what used to be the easy solution, everybody said, oh,

244
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,360
it was the Sea Peoples. Why not? Sure, Sea Peoples. Well, we actually know these from the Egyptians.

245
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,880
We know that they came through twice. 1207 BC and 1177 BC. And you can see right there,

246
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,360
that's where the title of the book comes from. But actually, it would be better to say the fifth

247
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,360
year of Monapta or the eighth year of Ramses III because the Egyptologists keep changing the

248
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,400
chronology. Everything is on a sliding scale. So in fact, when the book came out, a senior

249
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,560
colleague of mine up in New York sent me an email in which he said, nice job, congratulations. The

250
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:21,200
title should have been 1186. I sent him back a two word email.

251
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:37,120
And no, it's not what you think. My email to him simply said, it was. And in fact,

252
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,200
in the contract I signed, the title was originally 1186 BC. But in the years that I was doing the

253
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
research and the writing, the Egyptologists changed the chronology again. And so it became

254
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,000
1177. In the interval since the book has come out, they've changed the chronology again. And so

255
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,800
the next edition is going to have to be called 1188. Anyway, so for us, let's just say the

256
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,280
eighth year of Ramses III. Well, what happens here? He actually tells us in both pictures and

257
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,400
texts, and he shows us the naval battle and talks about the land battle. And he says, and I'll quote

258
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,920
here, the foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands. All that once the lands were removed

259
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:27,120
and scattered in the fray, no land could stand before their arms from Hattay, Koday, Karkamesh,

260
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,200
Artsua, and Alashia on. Now we know where those places are. Kati, those are the Hittites up in

261
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,000
Turkey. Koday and Karkamesh, that's where Turkey joins Syria. Artsua is on the western coast of

262
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,360
Turkey. Alashia, that's the ancient name for Cyprus. So we can see that these people are basically

263
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,640
coming across Greece to Turkey to Cyprus and then into Canaan because he continues a camp was set up

264
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:00,240
in one place in Amur. Amuru is by Ugarit on the north coast of Syria. They desolated its people.

265
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,120
Its land was like that which comes, never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt

266
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,480
while the flame was prepared before them. And then he gives us the names of the peoples because

267
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,360
there's not just one sea peoples. In fact, he doesn't call them the sea peoples. That's our name

268
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,640
for him. He gives us the actual groups, the Peleset, the Tejaker, the Shekilesh, the Denyan,

269
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,200
and the Weshash. And then he says that he defeated them. And we know this from his year 12, Papyrus

270
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,880
Harris says, I overthrew those who invaded from their lands. I slew the Denyan who are in their

271
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,640
aisles. The Tejaker and the Peleset were made ashes. The Shardana and the Weshash of the sea,

272
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,320
they were made as those that exist not. So you can see how we've got the name, the peoples of the

273
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,720
sea, but he actually gives us the names. In fact, when you combine this with the earlier invasion,

274
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,360
30 years previously, there's nine of these groups that all come in. So the big question that we've

275
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,720
got is who are these people? Where did they come from? And where did they go to? Now we know what

276
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,920
they look like because Ramses shows us them. These are pictures of captive sea peoples. In fact,

277
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,880
if you want to dress up at Halloween, it's quite easy to do it. But trying to find where they came

278
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,800
from is more and more difficult. So people have been playing, for example, linguistic games. So

279
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,480
Shardana, name me a place in the Mediterranean that has similar consonants where they could have

280
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,520
come from and give you a hint. Look in the western Mediterranean. Sardinia, people have suggested

281
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:43,120
that's where they came from. Same thing with Shekelesh, nearby Sicily, possibly. Tejaker,

282
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,520
maybe somewhere in Italy or Turkey. The Danians, some people have suggested that these are the

283
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,600
Danans, Homer's, Mycenaean, Greeks. Weshash, we're not quite sure about, maybe from Willowsoe. It's

284
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,000
only the Peleset that we think we know, the Philistines. And in fact, Jean-François Champollion,

285
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
the guy who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics, he had already suggested that the Peleset were the

286
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,720
Philistines way back in 1823 or so. Now, one of the problems we've got, though, is did they come

287
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,000
from there or did they go there afterward? Are they from Sardinia or is that where they fled

288
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,040
after they were defeated? And we don't know the answers. All I can tell you right now is that

289
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,560
no site has been excavated where we can definitively say that's where the Sea Peoples come from.

290
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,720
They are a mystery. We do know where some of them ended up. The Philistines, the Peleset,

291
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,200
they wind up in what is now Israel, Lebanon, Syria. And in fact, you can see from this

292
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,560
Philistine stirrup jar, it's what we would call degenerate Mycenaean. It looks like somebody

293
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:55,600
from Greece is still making their pots, their stirrup jars, but they're now using local clay

294
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,760
from Rhodes or Cyprus or even Canaan, ancient Israel. So it really looks like at least part

295
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,600
of the Mycenaeans had joined the Sea Peoples maybe after they lost. And in fact, I suspect

296
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,200
that that's why we've got the disparate groups. As these people swept over the lands, some of the

297
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,120
people they were vanquishing joined in. So what we see in Egypt is the end of the process, this

298
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,760
motley crew. But they're not Vikings. They're not raiders. We shouldn't be thinking like that.

299
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,840
Because in the pictures that Ramesses shows us, he shows us, and you can see on the left and also

300
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,680
the drawing on the right there, they're coming with their possessions. They're coming with ox carts.

301
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:46,800
They're coming with wives and children. This is a migration. This is a movement. Think 1930s

302
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,760
Dustball and everybody moving from Oklahoma to California. That's what this is. It's a migration.

303
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,880
It's not just Viking raids. So then the question is, well, what caused that? And for the longest

304
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,360
time, there was a very simple, logical, linear explanation that there was a drought. And that

305
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,520
drought led to famine. And that led to the movement of the Sea Peoples. That led to havoc and the

306
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,040
cutting of the trade routes. And that led to collapse. And it's a nice, easily told bedtime

307
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,520
story, or perhaps not bedtime. But the problem is, it's too logical. It's too messy. Nothing

308
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,240
is that logical. I think it's too simple. So what really happened? Well, that was what I

309
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,200
wanted to investigate. If everything was gone, what caused it? Why did everything collapse?

310
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,480
So suddenly. So the Sea Peoples were usually blamed for it. But I actually think

311
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,920
they were as much the victims as they were the oppressors. I think they've been given a bad name.

312
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,440
They got bad press. Yes, they were there. Yes, they did some damage. But I think they actually

313
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,840
had a little bit of problem themselves. So what else could have caused it? Well, drought has been

314
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:09,120
suggested. Famines been suggested. Invaders have been suggested. Earthquakes have been suggested.

315
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:16,160
So if we have to pick and choose one of them, I respectfully decline. I would choose them all.

316
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,760
I think there's a perfect storm. I think they all happened. Let me present the evidence to you

317
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,680
rather quickly and then see what you think. Drought is not a recent suggestion. In fact,

318
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,600
Rhys Carpenter, who was a professor at Bryn Mawr, suggested this in the 1960s. He said that the

319
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,840
Mycenaeans had declined and gone downhill very quickly because of drought. But he didn't have

320
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,400
proof for it. He didn't have any hard data. And so people gradually forgot that he had suggested

321
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,920
this. But we now have that data. We've got it in the last five years. Connie Juski, a French

322
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,840
professor, has been going with his team to a number of different places. And they went here

323
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:10,000
to the north coast of Syria, a place called Gibala. And they took course from dried up

324
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,680
lagoons and lakes. And then they looked at the pollen that was in there. And they decided,

325
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,200
they could see, that the plants had changed. And there was what they call a 300-year dry event.

326
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,280
In other words, a drought. And the pollen shows that there were drier climatic changes

327
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,920
back then from about the 12th century or the 13th century, right about our time period,

328
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,560
just after 1200, all the way down to the 9th century. So 300 years. So North Syria looks like

329
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:49,040
it had a drought. They went over to Cyprus, did the same thing at Hollis-Sultantechi.

330
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,840
Same thing. There is a drought there as well from 1200 to about 850 BC, judging from the pollen.

331
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,960
And then Brandon Drake pulled together a bunch of different data in a study that was published in

332
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,440
the Journal of Archaeological Science, including things like the temperature of the sea,

333
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,280
which dropped. And when you do that, you get less rain on the, in this case, the Mycenaean

334
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,880
or Greek mainland. And he said that took place about 1250 down to 1197 BC.

335
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,320
Now, Brandon's article was so good. I did something that I rarely do. I wanted to contact him

336
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,000
and give him my congratulations, a superb article. So I Googled him. All I knew was that it was

337
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,440
Brandon Drake from University of New Mexico. And Google came up and the very first thing it said was,

338
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:49,520
you are friends in Facebook. Really? So I sent an email to him and he's like, hey Eric,

339
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,200
how's it going? Haven't seen you since Megiddo in 2006. All right, we dug together. So you may

340
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,480
know people you don't even know you know. The power of the internet. The most recent of these

341
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,840
scientific tests has taken place with Daphne Langut, who you can see in the picture down there in

342
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Litt, a German scientist. They also did the coring and the

343
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,760
pollen analysis this time from the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. And they showed that in Israel

344
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,240
too, there was a drought. It didn't last quite as long. It was from about 1250 down to 1100 BC.

345
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,160
But so we've now got that missing data that Reese Carpenter was looking for, that there was a dry

346
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:43,920
event, a drought that lasted from, well, at least 13 or 1200 BC down to, take your pick, 1150, 900,

347
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,400
somewhere in there. And it's in Israel, it's in Syria, it's in Cyprus, it's in Greece. So at least

348
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,120
the science is telling us that there is a drought. And of course the media went wild over this.

349
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,720
Right, New York Times, pollen study points to drought is culprit in Bronze Age mystery.

350
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,640
LA Times got into the act. Climate change may have caused demise of late Bronze Age civilizations.

351
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,200
Archaeology magazine and National Geographic didn't want to be left out. There's Nat Geo,

352
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,800
here's archaeology. New York Post got into it and they tossed in globalization for good measure.

353
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,760
How globalization and climate change destroyed ancient civilization. And then you may remember

354
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,760
that NASA funded study that turned out to be not so funded by NASA, that said that we were going

355
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,760
to collapse in just a couple of decades. And at that point I was a little fed up, so I put an op-ed

356
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:47,040
in the Huffington Post, the collapse of civilizations, it's complicated. Which it is. Now, with drought

357
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,720
you frequently get famine, but famine can be difficult to discern in the archaeological record

358
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,160
unless you find bodies and things like that. But that's where written texts come in. And in fact,

359
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,040
we've got archives at Ugarit which tell us that, in fact, that's what's going on. Here is a letter

360
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,120
from the house of Ortenu. He's another one of those private merchants like

361
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:17,920
Senorano only a hundred or more years later. He has a outlying office in the city of Imar in

362
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,800
land Syria and he gets word back. There is famine in our house. We will all die of hunger. If you

363
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,560
do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from

364
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,320
your land. So I think you can agree with me that there's probably famine going on there. We've got

365
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,560
the written records. And we've even got this from the king of Ugarit. Another letter. Here with me

366
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,560
Plenty has become famine. I think this is incontrovertual evidence. Even the Hittite king,

367
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,240
do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands? It is a matter of life and death.

368
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,760
And in fact, we know from other records that the Egyptians who until recently had been mortal

369
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,440
enemies of the Hittites were sending grain ships up to help relieve the famine in the Hittite lands.

370
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,640
So we've got that going on, which we see the same sort of things today. Now, adding insult to

371
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:21,760
injury, though, do we have invaders? Well, yes, we do see people. So remember them, the Egyptian

372
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,680
records. But it can be tough sometimes to figure out who's causing your destruction. So it could

373
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,360
just as easily be internal rebellion. And in fact, we've got yet another letter from the king of

374
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,680
Ugarit, in this case being sent to the king of Cyprus. And he says, my father, now the ships of

375
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,560
the enemy have come. They've been setting fire to my cities and have done harm to the land.

376
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,160
Doesn't my father know that all of my infantry and chariots are stationed in Hathi? So they're

377
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,360
up in the Hittite lands in Turkey. And then he says, seven ships have been sighted. If any more

378
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,960
are coming, then please let me know. Now, the story that was told for decades was that this text

379
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,040
had been found in a kiln at Ugarit. It was being baked before it was shipped over to Cyprus,

380
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,680
so it wouldn't fall apart. But that the destroyers had shown back up, those ships had come again,

381
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,960
and that the kiln and the whole city had been destroyed before it could be sent. Makes a great

382
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:26,240
story. Again, too good to be true. Re-examination has now shown that it was not in a kiln. It was,

383
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:32,480
in fact, probably in a basket up on the second story, which fell and landed upside down. And in

384
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,280
that basket were this tablet and about 70 others. And as the basket disintegrated, it left a kiln

385
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,360
shaped lump with all these tablets. So in fact, we now think that it in fact was sent, and this

386
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:52,640
could actually be a copy that was left. So we don't actually know if it's from the last Sea

387
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,200
peoples or the previous one 30 years earlier. So it's not as much of a help as we thought. And yet,

388
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,400
it's definitely evidence for invaders. We've even got another letter. It's a private letter. It's one

389
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,760
of the last from Ugarit, which says, when your messenger arrived, the army was already humiliated

390
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,800
and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floor was burnt and the vineyards were also

391
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,480
destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it? May you know it? So somebody is coming in

392
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,960
and destroying this area. And in fact, Kaniyusky, the same guy that took the pollen samples,

393
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,800
when he was at Gibala in North Syria, he actually identified a destruction layer as sea peoples.

394
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,320
But this is a bit hasty. There's definitely a destruction layer, but it's not necessarily by

395
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,920
the Sea peoples. We don't actually know who did it. So this is a bit of a problem. And in fact,

396
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,560
I give you one example. Canaanite hotsore in the north of Israel definitely destroyed somewhere

397
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,720
around 1200 BC. We know this because we've got the archaeological evidence of the Late Bronze Age

398
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:08,320
palace that is completely torched. The mud bricks are, sorry, the mud bricks are burnt red and black.

399
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:16,240
A fire destroyed this. And in fact, the excavators, actually two excavators, Amnon Ben Tor and

400
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,160
Sharon Zerkerman who just recently passed away, they were directing the site. And Amnon Ben Tor

401
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,680
said, you know what? It's probably not Egyptians that did this destruction because there are

402
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,120
Egyptian statues that are in the destruction level and they're defaced. They have their arms hacked

403
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,840
off inside. So no Egyptian would have done that. So it can't be Egyptian. And same thing with the

404
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,960
Canaanites because there's also Canaanite statues in the destruction and they are also defaced.

405
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,560
So it's not Canaanites that are doing this. He says that leaves the Israelites and the Sea peoples

406
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,760
and this is too far inland for Sea peoples. And I would actually debate that. Sea peoples got

407
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,600
quite far inland, but he didn't want them. That left the Israelites, Joshua. And in fact,

408
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,280
Hotsores mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities that Joshua burned down. Well,

409
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,440
Sharon Zerkerman said, wait, not quite so fast. This is definitely burnt down. That's for sure.

410
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,680
But how do you know who did it? And he says, well, what do you mean? She says, well, if you look and

411
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,080
see what's destroyed, it's the palace and a couple of temples, but the actual domestic areas where

412
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,160
the people are living and working, they're untouched. They're not burnt. They're not destroyed.

413
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,480
She said, to me, that's the sign of an internal rebellion of the lower classes rising up against

414
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,240
the upper class when they don't have enough food or enough money or whatever. So she said,

415
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,000
it's an internal rebellion. And my point here is very simple. If the two co-directors can't decide

416
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,600
who destroyed their site, then how are we ever going to decide? All we know is that it is destroyed

417
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:58,080
by somebody or maybe by some thing because we can't rule out earthquakes. And in fact,

418
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,560
if you take a map of the sites that are destroyed in this collapse from about 1225 to 1175,

419
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,800
everything you see here with the red X is destroyed. And if you overlay it on top of a map

420
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,800
of earthquakes that have happened just in the last century, or a little bit more since about 1900,

421
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,440
you can see that most of the sites are actually in active seismic zones. In fact, we've got

422
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,600
a number of fault lines. You've got the North Anatolian fault line in light blue.

423
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,880
You've got another fault line in green. You've got an orange one coming up the Great Rift Valley.

424
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,960
So there are lots of fault lines and lots of earthquakes in this region.

425
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,960
And in fact, we have something that I find absolutely fascinating. This is the North

426
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,400
Anatolian fault line running across the top of Turkey. It has had what is called in modern terms

427
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:00,560
an earthquake sequence over the last 60 or more years. In fact, specifically about 1939 to 1999.

428
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,720
An earthquake sequence is when you have an earthquake and it doesn't release all the pressure,

429
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,440
there'll be another earthquake right next to it. We're nearby sometime in the future,

430
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,320
a week later, a year later, maybe a decade later. If that one doesn't release all the pressure,

431
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,520
you'll have another one and another one until the fault line unzips. This is stuff that Amos

432
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,880
Norit, Stanford studies. So earthquake sequence is what they call it when it happens in modern times.

433
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,560
But it happened in antiquity as well. They have a much cooler name for it. It's called an earthquake

434
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:38,560
storm. When you have this earthquake storm and it unzips over a period of 50 or 60 years,

435
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:45,440
it then takes about another 400 years to generate enough steam and start the whole process over

436
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,680
again. And it looks like if we look at some of the sites that are destroyed that there is a 50-year

437
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,880
earthquake storm right around our period. So I think that there are earthquakes taking place here.

438
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,280
So for instance, my sceni here on the land gate, you can see the Cyclopean masonry on the left side

439
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,280
and it's built on top of what looks like bedrock there. That's actually one side of a fault zone.

440
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,560
All the geoarchaeologists went there and just started laughing. They're like,

441
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,560
wait a minute, they built the major city on top of an active fault zone? Who would do that?

442
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,560
Yeah, the people from San Francisco just kind of shook their head.

443
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,640
And in fact, we've got victims that are obviously killed in an earthquake. Here is one young lady.

444
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,440
It's actually the same one in both pictures here. You can see the rock that's lying to the side of

445
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,840
her head in the, what is that, the right picture for you. That rock was actually embedded in her skull.

446
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,560
She had taken shelter in a doorway, which is usually the best place to do it, in the basement,

447
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:59,600
but the whole thing had collapsed and had killed her. So mycena, tirans, just three kilometers away,

448
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,720
same sort of thing. In this case, we've got a woman and a child killed by a collapsing

449
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,040
building at the same time period. If you go over to Troy with the Trojan War and all that,

450
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,280
Troy Six, you've got a wall that is not supposed to look like that, right? That one that's leaning.

451
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,040
Trust me, it wasn't built like the way originally. And even at Ugarit, this is a slightly earlier

452
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,960
one, but you see how that wall undulates. It's not supposed to do that. So there are earthquakes at

453
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,400
this time. So here, my point would be that if you see a site that's destroyed, it might not be who.

454
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,320
It might be what that destroyed it in this particular case. But if you do have a who,

455
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,680
then you've got the cutting of these international trade routes. And that is going on. And I bring

456
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,560
us back to one of our original slides here, where you've got this long trade route with the bronze

457
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,200
and the copper and the tin. And if imagine it had been cut at any point along that, and you

458
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,640
suddenly couldn't get your tin anymore, then how are you going to make your bronze? Now,

459
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,280
that's not going to bring your bronze age to a complete halt in and of itself. But if you add

460
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,480
that in to the great mix, then I think you can see you've got a problem. And in fact,

461
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,200
they were lucky that they were able to turn to iron to take over. And in fact, you know,

462
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,120
in the bronze age, there are already using iron. In King Tut's tomb, there's an iron dagger.

463
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,400
It's just that they're using bronze much more. And even in the iron age that takes over, they're

464
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,400
still using bronze, but not as much. So in this particular case, we see basically an innovation

465
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,280
taking over to fill a gap where they don't have bronze anymore, and they've got iron.

466
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,160
So in terms of what happened, well, it's still a mystery. But I think we can sum up

467
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,320
if I give you three points that I think you will agree with me, and there'll be no arguments,

468
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,320
we can then proceed from there. So first point, would you agree that we have a number of separate

469
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,000
civilizations that are flourishing between, say, the 15th and the 13th centuries? We've named

470
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,200
some of them, Mycenaeans, Minoans, Hittites, Egyptians, Canaanites, Cypriots. They're all

471
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,000
independent, but they are all interacting with each other, especially through trade routes.

472
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,680
Would you agree with me with that point? Okay, so we've got that. Second point, it's pretty clear

473
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,800
that many of the cities were destroyed and that the late Bronze Age pretty much came to an end

474
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,280
right around 1177 or soon thereafter. We all agreed with that. No argument there. Everything's

475
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:40,000
destroyed. Everything goes down. But point number three, there's no proof as to what or who has

476
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,440
actually caused this. All we know is that it did collapse. So we've got three main points that

477
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,600
everybody agrees on, and yet it in a way doesn't help us all that much. And in fact, people are

478
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,160
still even today going with that same linear progression. They still say, I heard it last

479
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,440
November. Drought, famine, cutting of the trade routes, movement, all that. I still say

480
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:12,560
that is too linear. It was much, much messier. So if you were to say to me, well, what is it?

481
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,080
Earthquakes, famine, drought, movement of peoples. I would say yes to all of the above. In fact,

482
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,960
the only thing that's missing is plague. There's no evidence for plague. And I actually do find

483
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,360
that surprising. I think there should be, but no evidence for that yet. But everything else,

484
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:34,400
absolutely, we've got the whole thing. The problem is I don't know that we can point to any one

485
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,720
single driver or stressor. Certainly climate change seems big, but is that the major stressor

486
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,400
or driver? Well, that can be argued because some of the others may have caused a problem as well.

487
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,680
And in fact, different parts of this region, ranging from, remember, we're going from Italy and

488
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,040
Greece all the way over to Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan, different problems may have

489
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,480
arisen in different places and they may have reacted differently. But the ending is the same.

490
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:11,120
They all end. They are depending on each other for both raw materials and finished products.

491
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,120
And therefore, when one went down, there is a domino effect. What happens to the Hittites affects

492
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,800
the Mycenians, which affects the Cypriots, which affects the Assyrians and so on. So anything that

493
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,760
gets destabilized in a system like this is ultimately going to affect everything. And in fact,

494
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,920
what we're looking at is a systems collapse. This isn't an explanation for it. It's just a name for

495
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,720
it. When you've got a systems collapse, and Colin Renfrew was talking about this already back in

496
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:47,520
about 1979, you have a collapse of the central administration. You've got the disappearance

497
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:53,440
of the traditional elite. You've got the collapse of the economy, if you've got a centralized

498
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:00,480
economy, and you have entire population shifts and decline. Now, this doesn't happen overnight.

499
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,520
Systems collapse, which we can see in a number of different places, takes about 100 years.

500
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:16,320
And in fact, I would say that 1177 is the wrong title for my book. Civilization did not collapse

501
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:24,240
in that year. That is just shorthand for the whole collapse. Just as we say that Rome fell in 476.

502
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,720
Even though we know it didn't, it took most of the 5th century, and even then you've still got the

503
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,760
Eastern Roman Empire continuing on. We still say Rome fell in 476. It's shorthand, if you will.

504
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,480
That's what 1177 is. It's a shorthand. Perhaps a better way to say it would be that the world in

505
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,600
1200 was very different from the world in 1100 and completely different in the year 1000.

506
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,440
But that doesn't really fit on a book cover. So, we're looking at something that takes about a

507
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,200
century, and when everything does fall, you get a dark age. And in fact, we've got that. We've got

508
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,200
the Greek dark ages that go for about 300 years. And in the systems collapse, you frequently get

509
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,560
myths about the golden age that came just before. So, think, for example, about Homer,

510
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,200
and a story about the Trojan War. It's a perfect example. So, what I would say that we're looking

511
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:26,880
at is indeed a systems collapse from that time period. So, what are the takeaways? What lessons

512
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,800
can we learn from this? Well, one of the questions we can ask is, are we facing a similar situation

513
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:44,000
today? Now, that might be, I mean, it's 3200 years, but let me ask you, is there climate change today?

514
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,480
Well, we could argue about that till the cows go home, but I think most people now would say yes.

515
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,200
Famines and droughts somewhere in the world? Absolutely. Earthquakes going on? Yes.

516
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,280
Rebellions? Sure. In fact, I think the only thing we're missing are the sea peoples.

517
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:09,040
And in fact, I'm not so sure we're missing the sea peoples, because there could be two different

518
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,240
groups that you can interpret as the sea peoples. It could either be ISIS, which is busy destroying

519
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,560
everything in the Near East. Our antiquity is going to be gone if we don't do something about it.

520
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:25,120
Or there could be the refugees that have fled from Syria and elsewhere that are now in Europe.

521
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,840
It depends if you see the sea peoples as victims or oppressors, or maybe both. So,

522
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,880
I actually think we do have the sea peoples today as well, just with a slightly different name.

523
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:45,040
And in fact, if we take a look at headlines from around the world, from say the last two or three

524
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:52,800
years, Greece's economy is tanked, right? That's been in the news. Internal rebellions have engulfed

525
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,360
Libya, Egypt, and Syria. Outsiders and foreign warriors are fanning our flames. Yes, not news.

526
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:06,720
It's on TV every night. Turkey's afraid it's going to be involved, as does Israel. Jordan is crowded

527
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,680
with refugees. Iran is bellicose and threatening, and Iraq is in turmoil, right? All of this ripped

528
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,640
from the headlines in the last couple of years. Well, what if we had newspapers from 1200 BC?

529
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,080
What would the headlines have read? Pretty much the same thing.

530
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:36,880
So, my question is, we are more technologically advanced. We are also more aware of our surroundings.

531
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:45,760
That is, the Hittites did not have SUVs. They did not cause climate change. But Mother Nature

532
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,600
did a pretty good job of it back then. I also think the Hittites were not aware of what was

533
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,400
happening. What was a drought? Why didn't it rain? I mean, you pray to the storm god, and if works,

534
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:03,600
or it doesn't work. We know what is happening. We know what's causing it, and we might know what

535
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:10,320
to do about it. The question is, will we do it? Now, I look backwards. That's my job as a historian.

536
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,400
It is the job of others, including in this audience, to look forward. So, I would simply say

537
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:26,240
that if a similar globalized society collapsed 3,200 years ago, might we not want to study it a

538
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,080
little bit to find out what we could learn and maybe stop ourselves from doing the same thing?

539
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,360
Food for thought. Thank you.

540
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,000
Thanks, Eric. Have a seat.

541
00:59:48,640 --> 01:00:04,160
Say more about the dark age. 300 years of what? What was lost? I mean, you said you wanted to live in

542
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:12,800
the Golden Bronze Age. There are lots of apparently good things. But languages lost,

543
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:17,680
technologies lost, cities emptied. What does darkness mean in this case?

544
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,160
Darkness means totality. I mean, you ask what's lost. What isn't lost? They lose the art of writing.

545
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,880
The art of writing. Well, if you want to call it the art of writing, they forget how to write.

546
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,800
Now, remember that only 1% can read a right back then. So, when you take off that traditional

547
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,120
elite, including the Scrabble class, you're left with not many people who know to read and write.

548
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:46,080
So, Linear B goes away, which the Mycenaeans are using, and so on. So, they lose writing,

549
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,280
they lose the monumental architecture, they lose much of what we would call the hallmarks

550
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,720
of civilization. Now, they're going to get it back, but it's going to take a while. It takes a

551
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,600
different period of time depending on where you are. So, in Greece, for example, it takes about

552
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,680
two to 300 years to come back. But in other places, it takes them far less. For example,

553
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,920
remember, Egypt doesn't really collapse. It's just weakened. And Assyria and Babylon,

554
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,840
they bounce back in a couple of decades. And I think the secret there is they're all on major

555
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,640
rivers. You've got the Menile, you've got the Tigris and the Euphrates. So, even if you've got a

556
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:31,680
drought, I think they're less affected. But even they have dark ages. So, it's what happens.

557
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:40,240
So, was there a Renaissance where people sort of rediscovering stuff from before and there was

558
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:46,720
continuity or was there a completely new invention of these things? Both. There's both a Renaissance

559
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,040
and new inventions. But in fact, there is a period of Greek history that we call the Greek Renaissance.

560
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,800
And this is the period when you have Homer, Heciate, and then Sappho and the Greek poets. The

561
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,280
eighth century is when they're coming back up and rediscovering. But in the meantime, you've

562
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,480
got new things. For example, the Phoenicians have brought their alphabet. And so, when they're now

563
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,120
writing in the eighth and seventh centuries, they're using an alphabet, which is completely

564
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:17,040
different from what they had done with Linear B, which is basically pictograms. So, there's both

565
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,960
the Renaissance and new ideas. And one of the things that occurred to me is, you know, I hate to

566
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,520
kind of put it this way, but if you have an old growth forest, sometimes a forest fire is good.

567
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,360
It clears away the underbrush and lets new things grow. And that's kind of what happened here.

568
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,200
Because think about a what if. What if this hadn't collapsed? Would you have the Israelites

569
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,480
coming in? Would you have Moses and Monotheism? Would you, a couple centuries down the pike,

570
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,320
have Greece and democracy? I mean, it's all kinds. So, because this collapsed, we've got our world

571
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,640
today. So, one of these days, I want to write something about a what if. What if it hadn't

572
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:04,800
collapsed? What would we be doing? Smart dinosaurs. Right. Question from Chris Brousseau.

573
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,040
Please illustrate the scale of the cities, kingdoms, armies, and navies of the towns.

574
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,600
What was the population of Knossos and so on? What, how many people are we talking about?

575
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,720
It's very tough to estimate population. And it depends that you ask three different people,

576
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,880
you get three different answers. But they have a range, probably. Yeah, they've got a range. And

577
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,520
in fact, there's a new article out saying Knossos is three times larger than we ever thought it was

578
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,880
at this time period or actually in the Iron Age. So, new theory or new data?

579
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,000
New data that's just coming out. Yes. But the, the upshot is in terms of cities, I mean, we're

580
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,800
talking a couple thousand people. We're talking armies that are maybe a couple of hundred people.

581
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:47,440
They're not huge. There is in the Battle of Kadesh. Army of a couple hundred people. A couple

582
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:54,480
hundred people can do pretty devastating attacks. Not even a, you know. Yeah. Yeah. There is in the

583
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,160
Battle of Megiddo, for example, there are 900 chariots that are captured. That's a huge fighting

584
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:05,760
force. That actually is. That's a lot of tanks. Yeah. Armored cavalry. Armored cavalry for that

585
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:12,480
time period. We have another, a Hittite text that talks about a force in the region of Troy

586
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,640
in about 1500 BC. And it says, so and so landed with a hundred men. That was a lot.

587
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,280
So, we're not talking huge amounts. We're talking a couple thousand. I think if a city is 10 or

588
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:31,040
20,000, it's, it's big. It's huge. And what was in these cities that people would want? I mean,

589
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,640
I can see this sort of the, not invasion, but refugee approach. But some of these sound like

590
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:42,960
they were, you know, we're going to take down your city. And what was there that they would want?

591
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,640
Is this slave gold? I mean, what's there? Well, in a lot of these cases, what it seems is at the

592
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,320
end of the late Bronze Age, they're burning down the cities and then reoccupying them. So, remember,

593
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,560
this is a migration. They're actually looking for places to settle. And in fact, some of the

594
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:05,600
archaeological evidence is indicating that the assimilation, if you will, was much more peaceful.

595
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:12,400
The Canaanites and the Philistines, for example, Asafchus Orlando of Haifa, is, has got evidence

596
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,560
that these are actually maybe much more peaceful settling down. So, yes, there is some warfare,

597
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,760
yes, there is some destruction, but they're not, you know, pillaging and burning and moving on.

598
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,920
They are even at Gibala, where Kaniyuski was looking. There is a destruction and then there's

599
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:35,440
an immediate reoccupation. And in that case, there is this Philistine looking pottery, which is why

600
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,960
he thinks it's sea peoples. Had there been a long peace before all of this breakdown that

601
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,880
made these societies more vulnerable in some sense, more relaxed about things?

602
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,280
It's possible. That is quite possible. They are definitely, this is an era of prosperity,

603
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,760
I would say, from the 14th century on. So, growing prosperity. People are growing.

604
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,800
Generation to generation, better and better off. Exactly. And they may have been lulled into a sense

605
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:09,040
of false security. I was at a conference a year or two ago on climate change at this time period.

606
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:16,880
And one of the people there suggested that there was actually a time in the 14th century of more

607
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:23,920
rain and better times, and that perhaps they overextended themselves. And so, when the ending

608
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,600
came, it was all that more drastic. So, yes, they may have been, I wouldn't say lulled into

609
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,360
false security, but things were going really well in the 14th and 13th centuries. And in fact,

610
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,600
that's the thing about this collapse is everything is going really well until suddenly it's not.

611
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,320
It's not like things were going badly for a while. It's in Ugar, for example, the letters from the

612
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,360
merchants and the kings and all that. Everything is going great until suddenly the city is destroyed.

613
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,760
So, are these societies, do they have histories of themselves? Are they telling stories of their

614
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,760
own past? Or are they living in a kind of a rolling present?

615
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,840
Depends on the city. Ugar, for example, has, there's actually a cottage industry of

616
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,240
Ugaritic studies. They've got history. They've got king lists. They've got queen lists. They've

617
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:16,000
got epics. They've got, so we've got that. But from others, it's mute that we don't have anything.

618
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,520
So, it just depends where you are. Steve Levines, can you comment on the languages of the period?

619
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,160
Was there a lingua franca? So, they're doing all this trade. There's numbers and we have this

620
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,960
accounting. Is there something besides numbers that they all speak? Absolutely. Excellent question.

621
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,920
And yes, the lingua franca of that day is Akkadian, which the Amarna letters that I cited at the

622
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,880
beginning. If you were Hittite and you could read or write, you would know Hittite and Akkadian.

623
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,240
If you were Egyptian, you would know Egyptian and Akkadian. Even probably the Mycenaeans,

624
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,800
they would know linear B and Akkadian. If you are living in Assyria and Babylon,

625
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,560
you're home free because you're doing Akkadian anyway. Right, but that is the lingua franca and

626
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:05,120
we do see the diplomatic correspondence being written in it. Some of the Amarna letters are,

627
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,920
one of them is written or two of them are written in Hittite, but that's unusual. Most of them are

628
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,720
Akkadian. Everybody's got their own language and then there's one diplomatic language. So,

629
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,320
that in a sense was the Bronze Age lingua franca. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, well, well, like

630
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:28,960
English now. Some guy writing in the dark, I can't read his name. Bob Copac, it might look like.

631
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,320
When did the iron business start? That iron technology you mentioned briefly that it was

632
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:44,160
just getting going in Egypt suddenly. Where? And say a little bit about bronze technology versus

633
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:54,720
iron technology. Okay, this is a much debated point, but basically iron, once you are able to

634
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,480
master the smelting and all that, of course, iron is going to be much better than copper.

635
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:07,200
But copper is in some ways seems to be easier to manipulate. Now, that's not always true, but

636
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:13,840
there is a good reason why they are using bronze for almost 2000 years and that iron doesn't take

637
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:20,560
over until it really absolutely has to. The actual date for the invention of iron is a bit of a debate

638
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,360
and there's kind of an old wives tale that the Hittites invented it and had a monopoly.

639
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:31,520
And that's why they were able to capture most of the Middle East at one point. That turns out to

640
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,720
have been a mistranslation of one of the texts. And so, while the Hittites did know iron, so did

641
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,400
everybody else. But it's the type of thing where you're not going to actually do it until you have

642
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:48,800
to. And so, I would say, as I said, that this is something where if your supply of tin is cut off

643
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,200
and you can't make bronze anymore, you will turn to iron. Which turns out to be better anyway.

644
01:09:53,200 --> 01:10:00,400
Which turns out to be better anyway. Exactly. Well, yeah, what is the sharpness of a bronze dagger

645
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,320
versus iron? Does it really matter how sharp it is? If it goes in you, it goes in you. All that.

646
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,800
But bronze doesn't hold an edge, presumably, as well. Bronze does not hold an edge as well.

647
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,560
I still would not want to get attacked by it. Fair enough. I promise not to.

648
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:27,040
Manual Manal Mehta, I think, asks, what could they have done in 1177 to prevent the collapse?

649
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,600
Good question. I've been wondering that myself. What could they have done to prevent the collapse?

650
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,200
Who would be the they in this? Who would be the they? Yes. Might be Egypt. In fact, I think

651
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:44,720
Egypt did prepare. If Ugarit is destroyed between 1190 and 1185, which we think,

652
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:52,560
and the Sea Peoples don't wind up in Egypt until 1177, that gives them a good seven to

653
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,480
10 to 15 years to figure it out. So I think Egypt was plenty prepared. In fact, there's some new

654
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:04,480
evidence, by a colleague of mine, that thinks the land battle, there's a land battle and a naval

655
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,160
battle. And she thinks the land battle was actually fought earlier up in Syria, and that it was kind

656
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:15,520
of an offensive defense. Go protect your country. And Egypt sort of reached up. And the Egyptians

657
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,120
went all the way up. And then later they fought the naval battle down below. So I do think that

658
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,280
they had some time to prepare. And I think that's probably why they were successful.

659
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,080
Others, you know, what can you do if you're if your supply of a crucial raw material is cut off?

660
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,400
It can be difficult. If you're hit by an earthquake, I don't know anything that can prepare you for

661
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,960
that. So I'm not so sure it was possible to have survived it. And this is one thing that

662
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,040
I would say if an earthquake hits, you can survive it. If a famine hits, you can survive it. I mean,

663
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,760
people will die, but you can survive it. A drought? Invaders? Yes. Somebody always survives. But what

664
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:03,520
if you have one, then two, then three, and then four? What if you have the perfect storm? That also

665
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,960
gets you a multiplier effect, right? Where everything is going to get worse and worse and worse. And I

666
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,440
think that's what we've got here. So I think if it had been just a famine, they could have survived

667
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,920
it. They've done that before. We know they had a famine back in the 14th century. They survived it.

668
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,680
We know there's invaders. They've survived it. But when you've got them all at once,

669
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,160
so there, how do you prepare for that? And I'm not sure that you can.

670
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,760
So you've got a sort of cascading effects. You've got a chaos leading to chaos. You mentioned four

671
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:40,640
things in your slide, the sort of loss of administrative center, the loss of kind of an

672
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:47,040
economic apparatus, the loss of the elites, and I forget what the other. Right. The population

673
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:56,320
declines and movements. So do the cities really empty out in these circumstances or what happens?

674
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,720
Some of them did. Some of them did. They're actually population movements. And in fact,

675
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,440
that's what Reese Carpenter was basing himself on. He didn't have the data about the pollen and

676
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:11,040
everything, but he did notice the population shifts. And he said one of the only reasons that could

677
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,440
caused it was drought and then the whole thing collapsed. So indeed. So people go away from

678
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,800
drought. That makes a lot of sense. They go away from chaos, but toward what? Right. Ironically,

679
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:29,440
however, one of the major suggestions is that if the Sea Peoples, the Shardana and the Shackalash

680
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,720
really did come from Sardinia and Sicily, which I do adhere to that. I don't think they went there

681
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:40,640
afterward. I think they came from there. The hypothesis is that there was an original drought

682
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,760
up in Europe or in Western Mediterranean that started them moving. In which case,

683
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,280
they had the worst rotten luck because they're moving from one drought into another drought

684
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,320
on the Eastern Mediterranean. And what do you do if you have a 300 year long drought? That's pretty

685
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:04,720
hard to survive. Famously. So Egypt goes into a steep decline. That's the way you describe it. Say

686
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,880
a little more about that. So even though they were prepared and they're the ones that survive,

687
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,680
what does survival mean under these circumstances? In this particular case, there is still upheaval

688
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:21,120
and turmoil and rebellions in Egypt. Everything is not hunky dory. They do survive. In fact,

689
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,480
Ramses III himself, the man who saved Egypt from the Sea Peoples. Was that how he was seen at the

690
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,680
time? Was the guy who... I would imagine. We don't actually have anything that says it. Well,

691
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:39,520
actually, he himself says that. I'm sure he said that. I'm the one. He was assassinated in a harem

692
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:48,640
conspiracy, which is kind of an interesting way to end your life. In fact, and it was... We know

693
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:54,160
about it because it was written. It's actually a fairly famous papyrus where it says that there

694
01:14:54,160 --> 01:15:00,400
was an assassination plot and it names a minor queen who had just had a son. And there were

695
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,920
something like 40 accomplices in the harem and they're all put on trial and they're put to death,

696
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:14,080
but nobody knew whether it had succeeded. The actual report doesn't say. But Ramses III's

697
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:21,840
mummy was x-rayed in CAT scan not so long ago and his mummy has kind of a scarf around his neck.

698
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,760
And when they looked through it, they just now saw, this is the last couple of years,

699
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,560
a knife, an incision by a knife that went right in and just cut his throat, basically. He would

700
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,840
have died pretty much instantly. And so it looks like the assassination did in fact take place.

701
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:44,960
Now, in the same tomb, they also found a young man wrapped in a goat skin and not mummified,

702
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,960
which is what you do when somebody is... Well, you don't want them to survive into the afterlife.

703
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,200
And that mummy of the young man shows evidence of having been strangled to death.

704
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,840
So the hypothesis is that that is the young prince who was part of it and that he was then

705
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:08,400
buried with his father after the assassination took place. So even though you beat the sea peoples,

706
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:14,480
you might have trouble at home. Yeah, the most dangerous thing is a pharaoh's either your family

707
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:25,760
or your harem or both. Michael M asks, there are lots of mysteries. What one piece of information

708
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,600
would you as an archaeologist most like to find that would solve most of the questions you have?

709
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,040
What would I most like to find that would solve most of my questions? Or would you like somebody

710
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:43,840
else to find that you would be glad to read? Yes. Do both, actually. There's digs that you work on

711
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,160
and there's digs that other people work on. Absolutely. So, for example, at Megiddo, where I

712
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:57,280
was for the last 20 years, we know that the king of Megiddo, Biridia in 1350, is writing to Amenhotep

713
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:03,200
III. Or maybe that's where Megiddo is. Megiddo, sorry, is northern Israel, Jezreel Valley. In fact,

714
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,440
Megiddo is Armageddon. Har-Megiddo in Hebrew is the mound or mountain of Megiddo. Har-Megiddo,

715
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:15,360
Armageddon. The original rough breathing or H was lost to us over translation. So,

716
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,240
Megiddo is Armageddon. And that was kind of fun digging in Armageddon for 20 years. In fact,

717
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:30,240
our shirts at the back said, I survived Armageddon. Well, in about 1350, the king of Megiddo is writing

718
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,080
to the Egyptian pharaoh and we have six letters from him in that Amarna archive in Egypt. What we

719
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:41,680
don't have are the responses. They are somewhere at Megiddo. And that was actually why I joined the

720
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:47,680
project originally in 1994. I wanted to find that archive. In fact, I think I know where it is because

721
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:54,640
Chicago, who was there 1925 to 1939, they excavated half of the late Bronze Age palace. And the other

722
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,920
half is still there waiting to be excavated. And that's probably where the archive is. I was so

723
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,880
sure we were going to find it in 94. I brought my Akkadian textbooks. I was prepared to translate

724
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:11,360
them on the spot. Oh boy, yeah. We never found. Listen to this. Exactly. Look what he got in return.

725
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,480
So I would love to find the archive at Megiddo that I know is there. We just haven't found it.

726
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:23,360
So, but basically writing, writing, writing. At my other side of Calvary, which is a Canaanite palace

727
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,400
way up in the north of Israel. Think right on the Lebanese border. That's where we are. We've got a

728
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:36,080
Middle Bronze Age Canaanite palace. And in 2013 and 2015, we found the oldest and largest wine

729
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:42,640
seller from the ancient world. So we've got about 16,000 liters of wine. It's got an earthy taste now, but

730
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:49,200
no, it's all gone. We just have the jars, but organic residue analysis can tell you what was in

731
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:54,880
the jars. We don't have a scrap of writing. I would love to know if they were writing,

732
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,920
or were they writing too? Because they've got connections to Greece. So it's the missing tablets

733
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,960
that have me in a conundrum. That's in my wildest daydreams. That's what I would want to find.

734
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,600
Another couple of archives. You realize that if civilization collapses about 30 years from now,

735
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,120
there'll be no writing at all recording what the hell happened. It'll all be in the cloud.

736
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,040
We'll be out there, you know, analyzing corpses, trying to find out what they were sick with.

737
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,080
Absolutely. And that, for me, as an archaeologist, is a fascinating question. What are people going

738
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:30,400
to find from our civilization if and when we do collapse? And if there are any future archaeologists,

739
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,360
what are they going to think when they excavate, say, the Smithsonian Museum or the Washington

740
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:42,000
Zoo or all the Starbucks that are out there? Well, do a little taxonomy of collapse here. So

741
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:50,640
the one clearly that we in the West take most seriously was the collapse of the Roman Empire.

742
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,240
Compare and contrast what happened then with what happened 1500 years earlier, 1177.

743
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:06,320
Well, I think the collapse of the Late Bronze Age was at least as great as the collapse of the

744
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:12,880
Roman Empire in terms of what we lost. In terms of, I mean, the Babylonians and Assyrians are doing

745
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,200
complex mathematics and astronomy and medicine. We've got the text from them and from the Egyptians.

746
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,720
Right. All sorts of things that were lost. All that astronomy was lost. All that was gone.

747
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:31,120
Yeah. Now, it's later reincorporated. I mean, we've got the Neo-Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrians

748
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,160
who rise up in the first millennium and they continue. Like I said, for them, they only go down

749
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,680
for a couple of decades. So they are able to have the Renaissance right away. And so we've got

750
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,000
Neo-Babylonian astronomy, for example, is quite advanced. But in other cases, I mean,

751
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,400
it's so lost we don't even know what they had. The Mycenaeans, their language was only deciphered

752
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:02,640
in 1952 as an early version of Greek. One gets a sort of sense of trauma that happened in the West

753
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:09,120
after Rome went down. Do you think it was that kind of traumatic in the Mediterranean

754
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,400
when the Bronze Age went down? Yes, I think it was absolutely traumatic, especially for the survivors

755
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:20,320
that probably didn't know what hit them and really what to do about it. I mean, think if you've

756
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,920
got a complex society and everything's ticking away merrily and then into it, like I said, you

757
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:32,640
just drop a little chaos. You've got everything. It's like a fine race car where if you throw a rod

758
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,440
from your engine, suddenly you're driving a piece of junk. Same thing here. I think it had been

759
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,800
absolutely marvelous and wonderful and they were going places and suddenly it's a screeching halt

760
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:51,680
and everything stops. And then you've got, so these were monumental civilizations and so you've

761
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:59,200
got, you know, the thing that we saw in a sense after Rome and after the later demise or slowdown

762
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:05,680
of Egypt of people sort of camping out in the ruins of a former civilization. Yes, and we do have

763
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:12,320
that. We have squatters in most of these places. In fact, can also us with them thinking that now

764
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,880
in the Iron Age it's three times bigger. In the immediate aftermath, it probably was squatters.

765
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,480
In fact, Mycenae, for example, Agamemnon's Mycenae, there are squatters that continue. It doesn't

766
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:29,680
just go down. It continues on a trickle. Squatters show up how in archaeology. It's hard to tell

767
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:35,520
sometimes, but when they're living in what are obviously ruined buildings and yet they're still

768
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,880
living there, that's a pretty good indication.

769
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,160
See a little more about, you mentioned when we were talking before, you're working on a couple

770
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:54,400
of stories now, one being Megidae, one being archaeology of the future. We at Long Now Foundation

771
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,600
are very interested in archaeology of the future since we're trying to create some

772
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:07,280
with a 10,000 year clock. What have you got? What is you bear down on? What future archaeologists

773
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:16,160
will find? What stands out? Well, it's an interesting question. Actually, it comes from

774
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,920
The World Without Us, a book published a couple years ago. Yeah, he gave a talk here. Exactly.

775
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,080
Got me thinking about that. And they were a couple of specials on TV at the time.

776
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:32,240
So now, when I fly into a major city, I try and imagine what I would find as an archaeologist

777
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,200
in say 2,000 years. And of course, what would be left are the plastics and the things that are

778
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:43,840
non-biodegradable probably. But then I do come to the question of how you would interpret it.

779
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,480
Because in archaeology, for example, we've got a saying, of course it's tongue-in-cheek,

780
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,000
but if we don't understand something, then it's cultic or religious.

781
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:59,760
Or fertility, right? Or fertility? Or fertility, exactly. So, for example, I mean,

782
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,680
if you were excavating some of the Smithsonian museums, that's going to throw you for a loop.

783
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,800
What's the hope diamond doing next to an elephant doing next to a... But you know,

784
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:14,240
Nabonitis in the 6th century BC, he had a museum. I was going to say, there must be historic museums

785
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,080
that look like that, because everything cobbled together. And that through the archaeologists

786
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:21,600
for a loop when they're finding Sumerian stuff next to Babylonian stuff, they're going,

787
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,640
what's going on? They suddenly realized we're digging an ancient museum. So what if you have

788
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:33,040
something like that? Or what would be left, say, of the zoo, San Francisco Zoo, Washington Zoo?

789
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,720
If the animals got out and you just have empty cages, or if the animals don't get out and they're

790
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,680
still there, what are you going to do with that? And then, really, what are you going to do with

791
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,720
all the McDonald's and Starbucks that are on every corner? Are you going to interpret it religious?

792
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:57,680
You've got that green hair goddess. So I can think of it. We were talking earlier about Motel

793
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:03,600
of the Mysteries, which a wonderful book where they misinterpret a motel and they've got somebody

794
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,880
lying in the sacred chamber and they're on the sacred platform and they have the sacred communicator

795
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,200
looking at the altar. And you realize it's a TV with the remote and he's on the bed.

796
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,040
Right. And then he's shouting into the toilet, which is the... It makes it this great echoing sound.

797
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:23,200
Absolutely. And my favorite picture is where she is wearing toothbrushes dangling from her ears

798
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:29,200
and she's got the sanitize for your protection around her head and was wearing a toilet seat

799
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,480
and it's a deliberate recreation of Sophie Schleeman wearing Priam's treasure from Troy.

800
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,920
Absolutely marvelous. So what's the future of archaeology? I mean,

801
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,960
don't we run out of things to dig up after a while?

802
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,680
Fortunately, no. There is no shortage. No, there's so much past and there's so much stuff in so many

803
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,440
places we never run out. Right. We will not run out. There's no such thing as peak antique.

804
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:08,480
No. There will always be something. The question though on a serious note is,

805
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,120
how are we going to do archaeology? And that's one of the things I've been wrestling with.

806
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,240
There have been so many advances, for example, just in the last couple of decades. Now we're using

807
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,240
satellite imagery, right? Sarah Park Act, the space archaeologist, is finding stuff from space.

808
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,320
Some of you may have seen her on Colbert. And drawings that can go right over the

809
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:34,480
area. Absolutely. Light arc and see through the jungles. So I'm actually getting a bit

810
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:39,680
frustrated, to be honest, of digging blind, as I say, where we put a trench down and we're not

811
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:45,360
sure if we're going to hit something. So there are ways to look through electromagnetic and

812
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:50,080
resistivity and conductivity and things like that. But there's got to be something out there that

813
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:56,000
can actually tell us more what we're looking for. And I suspect it's there that somebody here in

814
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,480
Silicon Valley or whatever is already using it. And I just have to talk to the right person who

815
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:08,800
says basically, oh yeah, we got that. So what can we find, for instance, looking into a mound

816
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,360
like Megiddo, which has 20 cities, one on top of another? We don't do that anymore. We don't

817
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,880
stack our cities quite the way we used to do it. No, we do not stack our city, more is the pity.

818
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,120
Yeah. It's going to be a whole future archaeologist. The coastal cities may do that,

819
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:26,640
as the sea level rises. Perhaps. But no, but they did it. They stacked them. But I would love to be

820
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:32,480
able to, something that would tell me, yes, 20 feet down there is a plaster floor. It should be

821
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,960
able to be something that would detect the components of plaster. I would think. You don't just drill

822
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:46,320
on these things. No, you don't. So I think we had a major revolution with these new sensing

823
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,400
devices. But that was, for the most part, 30 years ago. I think it's time, it's ripe for a new

824
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:57,280
revolution. The question is, what's it going to be? Now, the people that were digging in the 60s

825
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:03,040
could never predict LIDAR or satellite images, at least not the archaeologists. Micro biome

826
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:09,360
analysis of, you know, what's in the wine jar. Exactly. The organic residue analysis. Absolutely.

827
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:16,080
So what's it going to be like 30 years from now? Well, that's one reason that we don't do 100%

828
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,920
excavation of a site. We leave part of the site knowing that the next generation is going to

829
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,880
either be better than us or have better equipment than us. I've always admired the

830
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,720
long-term thinking involved in that. Is it actually the case that people do go back and do another

831
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:39,200
trench? And so there is a sort of a return. Absolutely. The problem is that each time somebody

832
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,760
else comes, they take away a little bit more. So for instance, Heinrich Schlemann was at Troy

833
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,680
first, and he actually dug right through the layer that he was looking for and threw it out on his

834
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:54,080
back pile. If I had $50,000, I'd go dig through the back pile at Troy, because that's where all the

835
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:58,720
good stuff is because Schlemann threw it out. So the next person, Dortfeld, had to dig around the

836
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,560
edges. And then the next person after him, Blagen, had to dig around his edges. And it was only until

837
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:10,480
Manfred Korfmann got there in 1988 with new technology that he was able to figure out that

838
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:16,480
what we know of as Troy is just the citadel where the king and his retainers were. There is a lower

839
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:22,880
city in the plain below that expands the size of the city by 10 or 15 times. Oh boy. Yeah. So that

840
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,960
gets closer to the city we hear about in Homer. Exactly. So now it fits better. But in that

841
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,320
particular case, had Schlemann realized there was a lower city, I'm sure there'd be nothing there

842
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:40,960
for anybody else to ask. So there's two things being discovered here. One is more, well,

843
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,640
better tools to discover more stuff. Probably more archaeologists now alive than there have

844
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:51,600
ever been. I would think so, yes. And archaeology is now there's not only more of us, it's more

845
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:58,960
scientific than it ever was. It's more theory based as well. And it's more both inter and cross

846
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,840
disciplinary theory in terms of the theory of archaeology, a theory of what's being discovered.

847
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:09,120
Both. Okay. Both, I would say. We're trying to ask bigger questions. We're no longer digging

848
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,960
just to dig. We're not digging just get Oh, it's a city. Let's see what's there.

849
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:19,520
For example, at Cabri, our Canaanite Palace, we are our larger questions. We're trying to

850
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:25,440
investigate the rise of rulership. We're trying to look at the Canaanite economy and try and

851
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:31,280
compare palatial versus non palatial. So we're we've actually got bigger questions that the

852
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:38,960
digging can help us answer. This story continues. They'll keep finding more stuff. And what I

853
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:44,080
love is you keep finding new stories emerging from the stuff. Thank you for the stories tonight.
