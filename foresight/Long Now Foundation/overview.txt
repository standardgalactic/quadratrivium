Checking Long Now Foundation/1177 B.C.： When Civilization Collapsed ｜ Eric Cline.txt
1. The discussion revolves around the advancements in archaeological methods and tools, particularly since the 1960s. Back then, technology was less sophisticated, and excavations often involved complete destruction of sites to uncover their contents.

2. Today, archaeologists are more likely to leave parts of a site untouched, knowing that future generations or technological advancements may reveal more than what can be discerned at present. This long-term approach ensures that the full potential of a site is not exhausted by current excavations.

3. The story of Troy illustrates this point. Heinrich Schlemann's early excavations inadvertently destroyed important layers, which subsequent archaeologists had to work around. It wasn't until the 1980s, with new technology and methods, that a fuller understanding of Troy was achieved, revealing not only the citadel but also a larger lower city.

4. Modern archaeology is more scientific and interdisciplinary than ever before. Archaeologists are now asking larger questions about societies, economies, and political structures, such as the rise of rulership and comparisons between palatial and non-palatial communities.

5. The future of archaeology promises even greater discoveries as new tools and technologies continue to emerge. These advancements will likely enable archaeologists to detect and analyze materials in ways that are currently beyond our reach, such as identifying a plaster floor or the contents of ancient wine jars through organic residue analysis.

6. The narrative of discovery is ongoing, with each new finding adding to the tapestry of human history. The stories that emerge from these excavations enrich our understanding of the past and contribute to our knowledge of different cultures and societies.
