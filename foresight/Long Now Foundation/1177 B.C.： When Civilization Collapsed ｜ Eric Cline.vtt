00:00.000 --> 00:19.080
Good evening. My name is Alexander Rose, I'm the director here at Long Now. And as you

00:19.080 --> 00:24.200
know, at the beginning of most of these talks we do, it's called A Long Short, a short film

00:24.200 --> 00:31.760
that in some way exemplifies long-term thinking. Tonight's comes from some members who are

00:31.760 --> 00:36.480
here in the room. Where are you? Wave your hands, shout. There you are in the back of

00:36.480 --> 00:42.680
the room. Thank you. And actually it's a good point to remind you all that actually finding

00:42.680 --> 00:47.680
these long shorts is quite difficult. So if you have good candidates, please send them

00:47.680 --> 00:53.440
into us or make some of your own like these guys did, which is a really great one. And

00:53.440 --> 00:58.600
I think tonight's Long Short is interesting. I mean, we're definitely going to go vastly

00:58.600 --> 01:05.240
further into the past than tonight's Long Short is. But part of civilization's fragility

01:05.240 --> 01:11.120
comes both from its interconnectedness and that's also one of the things that really

01:11.120 --> 01:18.560
makes civilization robust. So I think tonight's Long Short shows a little bit of each of that.

01:18.560 --> 01:18.840
Enjoy.

03:24.200 --> 03:30.240
Good evening. I'm Stuart Brand from the Long Now Foundation. As you know, the Long Now we define

03:30.240 --> 03:35.840
as the next 10,000 years, which we're building a clock for in the last 10,000 years, which we're

03:35.840 --> 03:45.280
still figuring out what happened. Part of the idea of all that is to sort of calibrate how we

03:45.280 --> 03:51.360
think about time and history and eternity, which doesn't actually play into this at all forever is

03:51.360 --> 04:00.560
not part of this story. But time has size. And we're pretty good at the minutes and hours and

04:00.560 --> 04:07.160
the kind of stuff we saw in the film here. We're still figuring out decades, centuries, millennia.

04:10.280 --> 04:17.360
So half the way back 5,000 years ago was the beginning of the Bronze Age, starting to get

04:17.360 --> 04:23.360
bronze tools and weapons and the kind of society that can use those things. And that went on for

04:23.360 --> 04:34.960
2,000 years. And then it ended much more suddenly than it began. And we have a speaker who knows

04:34.960 --> 04:49.760
more about that than anybody or a client. Thank you so much for inviting me here. Thank you all for

04:49.760 --> 04:54.960
coming. I'm presuming you're out there. It's hard for me to see. But what I would like to do tonight

04:54.960 --> 05:01.920
in the next hour or so is to take you back, take you back between 4,000 and 3,000 years ago

05:02.880 --> 05:13.360
to the time that is my favorite period in ancient history. Late Bronze Age, 1700 to 1200 BC. If I

05:13.360 --> 05:20.800
could be reincarnated backwards, that's the period I would like to live in. I don't think I'd survive

05:20.800 --> 05:29.520
for about more than 48 hours. But it would be a marvelous 48 hours. Now, this is the period when

05:29.520 --> 05:35.840
we have what I would call the G8 of the ancient world. And I'm cheating a little bit because in

05:35.840 --> 05:42.320
order to do that, I have to combine the Minoans and the Mycenaeans of Greece into one entity.

05:42.320 --> 05:48.480
But we have them on the edge of the screen there. We also have the Hittites in purple up here in

05:48.480 --> 05:56.880
Turkey. Matani is in red. Assyrians and Babylonians are in kind of a mustard yellow. And then

05:56.880 --> 06:03.520
Egyptians are the orange going up the Nile and into Canaan. We also have Cypriots and other people

06:03.520 --> 06:08.800
as well. Now, all of these people are interacting in the time period that we're going to talk about.

06:08.800 --> 06:15.360
And I dare say that you actually know more about that time period already than you might suspect.

06:15.360 --> 06:21.440
So for example, this is the time when Hatshepsut lives, the famous female pharaoh. How many people

06:21.440 --> 06:28.400
have heard of her? Okay. Tupmosis III, one of the greatest military conquerors, lives at that time.

06:28.400 --> 06:34.960
My boy, Amenhotep III. He is the guy I most wish I could meet in antiquity. Akhenaten,

06:34.960 --> 06:41.040
the famous heretic pharaoh. I dare say you've heard of him. King Tut, that's the man that everybody

06:41.040 --> 06:47.920
knows. Ramses II, Ramses III. This is the time period that we're talking about. And during these

06:47.920 --> 06:55.520
centuries, everything flourished. It was, in fact, a time that was almost globalized if we can use

06:55.520 --> 07:01.920
that word and put it, project it back into the past. But with that comes other things too, not

07:01.920 --> 07:08.000
just trade, not just diplomacy, but things like wars. So for example, we've got the battle of Kadesh

07:08.000 --> 07:12.800
between the Hittites and the Egyptians. We've got a little thing called the Trojan War.

07:13.040 --> 07:19.120
You may have seen a movie that Brad Pitt was in. We also have things like the Exodus, which,

07:19.120 --> 07:26.080
if it took place, will have taken place at about this time period. Now what we've got is a globalized

07:26.080 --> 07:32.560
society in which everyone is interconnected. If you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

07:32.560 --> 07:39.680
we've kind of got that here as well. This is a social network diagram that my wife Diane Klein

07:40.240 --> 07:46.800
made. And you can see that pretty much everybody is interconnected in some way. If the Mycenaeans and

07:46.800 --> 07:51.840
the Hittites aren't directly connected, they know somebody who can connect them. And in fact,

07:51.840 --> 07:58.240
we've got writing from that time period, such as this. This is a typical Cuneiform tablet.

07:58.240 --> 08:03.360
Looks like a bird has stepped an ink and walked across the page. There is an archive that dates

08:03.360 --> 08:11.120
to about 1350 BC in which we found about 400 of these tablets and their letters to and fro,

08:11.120 --> 08:16.480
to and from the kings of that time period, the king of the Hittites, king of Egyptians,

08:16.480 --> 08:22.640
king of Babylon, king of Assyria, and also to the vassal kings, the ones that owed them allegiance.

08:23.360 --> 08:30.000
And if you map them, you can see that we really are talking about a small world effect, which is

08:30.000 --> 08:35.280
where, again, if you don't know the person, at least you know somebody in between. And usually,

08:35.280 --> 08:41.120
there's no more than about three leaps that separate any particular person. So if you map these out,

08:41.120 --> 08:46.720
as my wife did here, you can see with a couple of huge nodes with the king of Egypt and the king

08:46.720 --> 08:52.160
of the Hittites and so on, that pretty much everybody is in contact with everyone else.

08:52.160 --> 08:58.160
So I know that saying that that time period is globalized is a loaded term, and yet I think we

08:58.240 --> 09:04.880
can use it. It was globalized for its time period. And that is from Italy on the west

09:05.760 --> 09:13.520
to Afghanistan on the east. Everybody is in contact. They're trading. They are swapping

09:14.160 --> 09:20.320
raw materials, gold, silver, copper, tin. They're also trading finished goods.

09:20.960 --> 09:28.240
Now this is the Bronze Age, which starts in about 3000 BC. It's all going to come collapsing down

09:28.240 --> 09:35.120
at about 1200 BC. So what I actually want to do tonight is to build this up, show you what they

09:35.120 --> 09:42.960
were doing, what was there, and then collapse it all down by the time we're done. We don't know

09:42.960 --> 09:47.120
why they collapsed, and that's part of the mystery, and that's part of what I will talk about. But

09:47.200 --> 09:53.040
before I collapse it, let me build it up. So this is the Bronze Age. To make bronze, you need tin

09:53.040 --> 09:59.600
and you need copper. By the way, if you don't have tin, you can also use arsenic. I don't recommend

09:59.600 --> 10:06.080
that, but you won't live very long. But you can make arsenical copper, but tin is much better.

10:06.080 --> 10:12.960
90% copper, 10% tin, and you'll get your bronze. Now the copper is not a problem. The copper is

10:12.960 --> 10:17.760
going to come from Cyprus. In fact, that's where the name comes from, Kipros. It means copper.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.440
The tin is a little bit more difficult. There's some tin, of course, up in Cornwall. There's some

10:23.440 --> 10:31.040
in southeastern Turkey, but not enough. Most of the tin seems to be coming from an area off this

10:31.040 --> 10:37.200
map. You can see the arrow going off. It is, in fact, an area in what is modern-day Afghanistan,

10:37.200 --> 10:43.760
the Badakshan region. And in fact, not only tin comes from there. Anybody here have lapis lazuli

10:43.760 --> 10:52.480
jewelry? Lapis also comes from that region. So what we've got is the need to get tin all the way

10:52.480 --> 10:59.200
into the region of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Aegean. And this is going to involve trade routes. That

10:59.200 --> 11:04.480
can be hundreds or even thousands of miles long. And in fact, we know that they are doing this.

11:04.480 --> 11:12.400
There is a letter at Mari, which is in Syria on the river there. Not sure if Mari actually exists

11:12.400 --> 11:17.760
anymore. ISIS has occupied it and is looting it. So we don't know if it's still there. But

11:17.760 --> 11:26.880
there was a cache of letters found. And among them was an itinerary in which it describes

11:26.880 --> 11:33.760
tin coming from Afghanistan to Mari in what is now Syria, then going on to Ugarit on the

11:33.760 --> 11:41.440
northern coast of Syria, and then going from there over to Crete. And in fact, it says that at

11:41.440 --> 11:50.320
Ugarit, which is right up there, that there is in fact a man from Crete, a Minoan, who can speak

11:50.320 --> 11:56.560
the local language. He is the translator. So we know that they are sending tin all over there.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.400
And in fact, a good friend of mine, Carol Bell, she's a British archaeologist,

12:01.200 --> 12:07.920
she has said that their need for tin is basically the equivalent of our need for oil.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.520
And that the search for tin would have occupied the king of Egypt and the king up in the Hittite

12:13.520 --> 12:20.160
region in Turkey, just as the search for oil today occupies like a U.S. president. So if you can

12:20.160 --> 12:25.360
think of that kind of a parallel, that's what we've got here. But as I say, they're not only

12:25.440 --> 12:32.960
trading for raw materials, they're also trading finished goods. And in these Mari letters,

12:32.960 --> 12:38.880
which actually date a little bit earlier than our period, they date to about 1800 BC. So just under

12:38.880 --> 12:47.600
4,000 years ago, we have one text that describes a weapon that's being brought from Crete. It says,

12:47.600 --> 12:53.200
one Kaftorian weapon. Kaftor is their name for Crete and the Minoans. The top and the base are

12:53.200 --> 12:58.800
covered with gold. Its top is encrusted with lapis lazuli. So it would have looked something like

12:58.800 --> 13:04.480
this, though this isn't it, because this is from the death pits of war dating to about 2500 BC.

13:04.480 --> 13:08.640
But nevertheless, it's quite nice. And I wouldn't actually mind having one of these.

13:09.840 --> 13:14.640
Not sure I'd be able to carry it, but I wouldn't mind. So this is one good example of what they're

13:14.640 --> 13:19.840
sending back and forth. But my absolute favorite, and it shows that nothing has really changed,

13:20.560 --> 13:28.000
is a text that talks about what must be sandals that says one pair of leather shoes in the Kaftorian

13:28.000 --> 13:33.600
style. Now if anybody's been to Crete, you know that Kaftorian Star, their Minoan style, are either

13:33.600 --> 13:38.800
sandals or boots. You can still get a nice pair of boots at Hanya. I suspect they're sandals,

13:38.800 --> 13:45.040
but I'm not sure. But the text then says, which to the palace of Hammurabi, the king of Babylon,

13:45.040 --> 13:49.120
and yes, that is the Hammurabi, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,

13:50.080 --> 13:53.920
Bach the limb carried them, but which were returned?

13:58.400 --> 14:04.800
For the life of me, I can't figure out why they were returned. Were they too small? Were they two

14:05.440 --> 14:12.400
last millennium? And in fact, I asked my students once to read through the whole law code. There's

14:12.400 --> 14:17.920
about 272 laws. And I said, find me the law with the penalty for returning shoes.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.480
And they came back and they said, there isn't one, we can't find it. I said, exactly, he got away

14:22.480 --> 14:27.120
with it. But I still don't know, wouldn't you have kept them and at least re-gifted them?

14:28.400 --> 14:33.760
So things have not changed all that much. So basically my point here is they are trading

14:33.760 --> 14:39.600
finished goods and raw materials, and they are in fact going back and forth between the different

14:39.600 --> 14:47.760
countries. We know, for example, that Hatshepsut sends an embassy down to Punt. We don't quite

14:47.760 --> 14:53.040
know where Punt was, or at least we didn't know until recently. But on her mortuary temple,

14:53.040 --> 14:59.280
she has descriptions and pictures of the ships that went. She even has pictures of the goods

14:59.280 --> 15:06.320
that are brought back. And she even tells us in the lowest picture there that the queen is named

15:06.320 --> 15:11.600
Eti. So we know all about this. The problem was, as I said, we didn't quite know where Punt was

15:11.600 --> 15:18.240
until recently. And then someone did an analysis of some baboon mummies in the British Museum

15:18.240 --> 15:25.280
and determined that they were most closely related to baboons in Eretria or Ethiopia. And that was

15:25.280 --> 15:30.400
one of the possibilities for Punt. So that's probably where it was. Now she wasn't the first

15:30.400 --> 15:35.440
person to send embassies there, and she's not the last, but that's what she is known for.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.120
Other embassies, though, other trade missions may have gone over to the Aegean, to Greece.

15:43.840 --> 15:50.400
Here is the tomb of Rekmere, and in here, Rekmere is the vizier, like the right-hand man,

15:50.400 --> 15:55.680
to the pharaoh. We see people from Greece. These are Minoans or Mycenians, and they're bringing

15:55.680 --> 16:03.200
typical Aegean goods to Egypt. Same thing here. In this tomb, again, you can see somebody is

16:03.200 --> 16:09.760
carrying a bull's head. That's straight out of Canosos. So we know that Egypt and Greece are trading

16:09.760 --> 16:18.320
already back at, well, about 1400, 1450 BC would be when this is taken place. And it continues.

16:19.280 --> 16:25.920
This is Amenhotep III's mortuary temple. I wager that some of you have seen these. The Colossae

16:25.920 --> 16:31.040
of Memnon, they're about 60 feet tall. And in fact, there were Greek and Roman tourists that

16:31.040 --> 16:38.000
went to see these. They scratched their names. Kilroy was here, but in Greek. What you don't see

16:38.000 --> 16:44.160
is the missing mortuary temple that these were at the entrance to, because it was stolen by the

16:44.160 --> 16:49.760
later pharaohs. Why go out and quarry more stone when you can just take this from a dead pharaoh

16:49.760 --> 16:57.440
and make your own temple? So most of them are now gone. Now, much more interesting to my mind

16:57.440 --> 17:04.080
than the big 60 foot tall ones are the smaller ones that were probably only about 10 feet tall.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.920
You can't see these statues anymore. They're gone. You just see the feet here.

17:08.640 --> 17:14.960
But in the 1960s, German archaeologists were excavating and they found five of these statue

17:14.960 --> 17:21.360
baseless. They hypothesized there were 10. In fact, the new excavations that are there now have

17:21.360 --> 17:29.680
revealed more than 40 of these statue baseless. On each of these bases are the names of foreign

17:29.680 --> 17:35.200
powers, foreign countries. One mentions places that we know belong to the Hittites. Another one

17:35.200 --> 17:41.040
mentions the Babylonians and the Assyrians. But this particular one is the one that caught my

17:41.040 --> 17:47.840
interest, the Aegean list. It has names that had never appeared in Egypt before and would never

17:47.840 --> 17:56.320
appear again for the most part. Because what you see on one side is two names over here,

17:57.200 --> 18:03.440
which are the head names for the list, Keftiou and Tanaya. Keftiou is the Egyptian name for Crete,

18:04.560 --> 18:11.040
just like they called it Kaftor up in Mesopotamia. In Egypt, they call it Keftiou. Tanaya is probably

18:11.040 --> 18:16.560
mainland Greece. So we've got Crete and mainland Greece. And then on the other side and going

18:16.560 --> 18:25.760
around the edge, we've got a series of 14 names that mention, again, places that had never been

18:25.760 --> 18:38.560
written down in Egypt before. Amnesos, Vestos, Caedonia, Mycenae, Catozacro, Naphthion, Ilios,

18:39.200 --> 18:46.400
Canosos, and Amnesos again, which is kind of interesting. Now, the very first time it was

18:46.400 --> 18:51.680
deciphered when it was translated into English, Ken Kitchen, a rather preeminent British scholar,

18:52.560 --> 18:58.160
published and he said, I'm rather hesitant to suggest this, but this looks uncomfortably like

18:58.160 --> 19:05.840
Mycenae and Canosos. Well, uncomfortable enough, it was Mycenae and Canosos, and this list is

19:05.840 --> 19:12.640
basically one of a kind. But if you go over to Greece and you look at the sites that are mentioned

19:12.640 --> 19:19.520
on that statue base, you actually find objects with Amenhotep III's name on it, or his wife,

19:19.520 --> 19:25.280
Queen T, they seem to have married for love. But here we've got a phion's plaque with Egyptian

19:25.280 --> 19:30.800
hieroglyphs. And we've got on the right side, you can see Netra Nefer, Nehmet Ra, the good God,

19:31.360 --> 19:37.200
and then the name of Amenhotep III. And at a number of the sites that are on the statue base,

19:37.200 --> 19:43.520
we've got objects with his name on it. So for instance, at Canosos on Crete, here is a scarab

19:43.520 --> 19:50.880
of Amenhotep III. So I think that this is not just boasting or bragging. I actually think it

19:50.880 --> 19:57.680
might record an itinerary of the way to get from Egypt up to Greece and back again. And I would

19:57.760 --> 20:04.880
suspect that maybe that's why Amnesos is on here twice. It's a round trip. So you're going from

20:04.880 --> 20:08.720
Egypt, you get up to Crete and you stop, it's the first place, get off, everybody use the bathroom,

20:08.720 --> 20:13.760
it's time for a coffee. And then you go, and you've known the Minoans for quite a while, the

20:13.760 --> 20:18.400
Egyptians had known them already for a couple hundred years. But the Mycenaeans are new upstarts

20:18.400 --> 20:24.320
at this time at about 1350 BC. So let's go up to mainland Greece and see what's going on up there.

20:24.320 --> 20:29.120
Then we come back down to Crete and here we are at Amnesos again. Everybody use the bathroom,

20:29.120 --> 20:33.920
it's going to be a long ride till we get back to Egypt, right? Sounds familiar. So I think that we

20:33.920 --> 20:38.800
might actually have an itinerary here. I can't prove it, but I think it's a definite possibility.

20:39.520 --> 20:45.600
One of the reasons why I say this is because we have the remains of actual ships that were going

20:45.600 --> 20:52.640
around and around the Mediterranean at that time. This is the rather well-known Ulubarun shipwreck

20:52.640 --> 21:00.480
which went down off the coast of Turkey in about 1300 BC. It's been excavated by George Bass and

21:00.480 --> 21:06.960
Jamal Pulik of Texas A&M, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, and they found what you're looking

21:06.960 --> 21:12.320
at here. You can see the stones going right down through the middle with the holes in them.

21:12.320 --> 21:20.240
Those are anchors. There are 14 stone anchors on here. But the majority of the cargo, 300

21:21.200 --> 21:28.000
copper ingots, which you see here. The copper is 99% pure and it comes from Cyprus. So this

21:28.000 --> 21:35.120
particular ship is carrying, actually it's more than 300 ingots. You can carry them on your shoulder.

21:35.120 --> 21:42.880
They each weigh about 60 pounds. It's got 10 tons of copper. It also has a ton of tin on this same

21:42.880 --> 21:49.200
boat. So if you mix the copper and the tin, you're looking at an awful lot of bronze. In fact, George

21:49.200 --> 21:54.960
Bass at one point estimated that there is enough raw material on board this one ship that you could

21:54.960 --> 22:01.680
have outfitted an army of 300 soldiers with swords, shields, helmets, greaves, everything that you would

22:01.680 --> 22:08.960
need to get a modern Bronze Age army back then. So when this ship went down, somebody lost a fortune

22:08.960 --> 22:15.840
and I actually hoped they were insured. Now seriously, there was insurance back then. We

22:15.840 --> 22:21.120
know it from the tech. So it's not out of the question that this was insured. So we've got

22:21.120 --> 22:26.960
lots and lots of copper, lots and lots of tin. In fact, we have other things as well. The top

22:26.960 --> 22:32.800
left hand column picture there. You actually have tin. You can see the round bun ingot there.

22:33.520 --> 22:40.000
You've also got in the top right hand picture also round ingots. But this is raw glass,

22:40.800 --> 22:45.680
colored with cobalt. And in fact, when the Corning Museum of Glass analyzed these,

22:46.240 --> 22:51.760
it matched perfectly with glass from Mycenaean Greece and New Kingdom Egypt. So they're all

22:51.760 --> 22:57.600
getting their glass from the same place. We've also got in the lower line there, all the way

22:57.600 --> 23:02.800
down bottom on the left, terribenthe resin, which comes from the pistachio tree. You use it in making

23:02.880 --> 23:10.080
perfume. In the middle, ivory of course, but not just from elephants, also from hippopotamus.

23:11.120 --> 23:15.760
And it actually turns out that about 90% of the ivory in the late Bronze Age is from hippo,

23:15.760 --> 23:24.080
not from elephants, which people found surprising. And then new unused pottery from Cyprus and Canaan,

23:24.080 --> 23:31.440
Israel, Lebanon, Syria. So this is for me a microcosm of the international trade that was going on

23:32.160 --> 23:39.040
at the time that this ship sunk in about 1300 BC. And in fact, if you plot this on a map, which

23:39.040 --> 23:44.480
National Geographic did, by the way, if you're interested, it's December 1987. It's my favorite

23:44.480 --> 23:53.440
issue ever. They on this map put the objects from the ship on the map as to where they came from.

23:53.440 --> 23:59.280
They thought the ship was going around and round and round, hence the blue arrows. I'm actually

23:59.280 --> 24:04.400
not so sure that they were doing that. I think it might be a gift from one king to another,

24:04.400 --> 24:09.600
in which case it's going straight across. But it's not out of the question it was also on a

24:09.600 --> 24:15.920
shopping expedition, because everything they needed would have been used by a Mycenaean palace.

24:16.640 --> 24:22.320
So we need raw glass. We need more pistachio resin. We need some tin. We need some copper and

24:22.320 --> 24:27.680
get some milk while you're out. But the ship never came back. So for me, this is, as I say,

24:27.680 --> 24:34.640
a microcosm. But we've also got the writing. A text from Ugarit on the north coast of Syria

24:34.640 --> 24:39.280
dates to about 40 years after this ship went down. It's called the Siniranu text,

24:39.280 --> 24:44.720
because it mentions a merchant, a private merchant named Siniranu. It says,

24:44.720 --> 24:50.640
from the present day, Ammestamru, the son of Nick Meppa, king of Ugarit, exempt Siniranu,

24:50.640 --> 24:55.360
son of Siginu. By the way, I wanted to name our kids this. My wife refused for some reason.

24:55.920 --> 25:03.120
At any rate, let's see, his grain, his beer, his olive oil to the palace, he shall not deliver.

25:03.120 --> 25:10.560
His ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete. So we have a private merchant in about 1260 B.C.,

25:10.560 --> 25:19.680
who is importing olive oil, beer, and grain, and he's exempt from taxes. I actually think this

25:19.680 --> 25:24.800
might be the first corporate tax exemption in history, but can't be sure about that. So when

25:24.800 --> 25:29.840
you combine the physical evidence from the shipwreck and the written evidence from the Siniranu

25:29.840 --> 25:36.000
text, I think it's pretty clear that we've got international trade going on. So basically what

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
we've got, we've got a globalized society, and I do use that term warily, but interconnection,

25:42.640 --> 25:50.720
merrily going along, 17th century, 16th, 15th, 14th, 13th, everybody's having fun being diplomatic

25:50.800 --> 25:56.800
and trading, and there's reciprocity going on. And then into this, a little chaos was dropped,

25:58.320 --> 26:04.560
and one by one, each of the civilizations winked out. Actually, they did it pretty fast. The only

26:04.560 --> 26:09.840
one that was left standing was Egypt, and even they were so weakened that they were never the

26:09.840 --> 26:16.880
same again. The New Kingdom is the high point. So just after 1200 B.C., we get what we call the

26:16.880 --> 26:22.080
collapse or the calamity, and pretty much everything gets destroyed. Everything that

26:22.080 --> 26:27.440
had been good, everything that had been ticking along merrily, suddenly goes out as if somebody

26:27.440 --> 26:34.240
had just snapped their fingers. Now the question is, what caused it? And that's been one of history's

26:34.240 --> 26:39.760
great mysteries. One thing we can say is that the magnitude of the collapse when it did take

26:39.760 --> 26:46.080
place was enormous. I don't think anything comes close to it until the Roman Empire collapsed,

26:46.080 --> 26:52.640
and that was 1500 years later. But as I say, the question of what caused it is a bit of a problem,

26:52.640 --> 26:58.560
and that's where my book comes in. Rob Tempio of Princeton University Press asked me if I would

26:58.560 --> 27:04.160
write a book about the collapse, and I said, sure, but I also want to write about what collapsed. So

27:04.160 --> 27:09.040
the beginning and the end are about the collapse, and the middle is what I've just described to you,

27:09.040 --> 27:14.160
what collapsed, telling the stories about that. Now I also realized that I'm not the first person

27:14.240 --> 27:19.520
that's discussed the collapse of civilizations. There was a guy named Edward Gibbon who wrote a

27:19.520 --> 27:26.320
little book about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Joseph Tainter in 1988 put out a book,

27:26.320 --> 27:33.280
The Collapse of Societies of Complex Societies, which has been an absolute marvelous book for

27:33.280 --> 27:39.120
all of us. And then of course, I imagine a number of you have read Jared Diamond's book on collapse.

27:39.120 --> 27:44.400
The difference, though, is that when the Late Bronze Age collapsed, it was a multitude of

27:44.400 --> 27:50.240
interconnected and intertwined civilizations that all went down at once. These books mostly are

27:50.240 --> 27:57.760
talking about the decline of a single civilization at a time, Roman Empire, Maya, Mongols, Indus Valley.

27:57.760 --> 28:04.320
We are rather unique here in the Late Bronze Age in that that is one of the few times when you

28:04.320 --> 28:10.720
actually had interconnected civilizations much as we have today. So I actually think the parallels

28:10.720 --> 28:16.720
between us today and them back then are much stronger than you might suppose, even though they

28:16.720 --> 28:23.120
were 3,200 years ago. So anything that we can learn about their collapse, I think, is not just

28:23.120 --> 28:29.840
idly studying ancient history, but may contain some lessons for us today. But the big problem is

28:29.840 --> 28:36.080
trying to figure out why they collapsed. And what used to be the easy solution, everybody said, oh,

28:36.080 --> 28:43.360
it was the Sea Peoples. Why not? Sure, Sea Peoples. Well, we actually know these from the Egyptians.

28:43.360 --> 28:50.880
We know that they came through twice. 1207 BC and 1177 BC. And you can see right there,

28:50.880 --> 28:55.360
that's where the title of the book comes from. But actually, it would be better to say the fifth

28:55.360 --> 29:01.360
year of Monapta or the eighth year of Ramses III because the Egyptologists keep changing the

29:01.360 --> 29:08.400
chronology. Everything is on a sliding scale. So in fact, when the book came out, a senior

29:08.400 --> 29:14.560
colleague of mine up in New York sent me an email in which he said, nice job, congratulations. The

29:14.560 --> 29:21.200
title should have been 1186. I sent him back a two word email.

29:29.120 --> 29:37.120
And no, it's not what you think. My email to him simply said, it was. And in fact,

29:37.120 --> 29:43.200
in the contract I signed, the title was originally 1186 BC. But in the years that I was doing the

29:43.200 --> 29:47.360
research and the writing, the Egyptologists changed the chronology again. And so it became

29:47.360 --> 29:54.000
1177. In the interval since the book has come out, they've changed the chronology again. And so

29:54.000 --> 30:00.800
the next edition is going to have to be called 1188. Anyway, so for us, let's just say the

30:00.800 --> 30:07.280
eighth year of Ramses III. Well, what happens here? He actually tells us in both pictures and

30:07.360 --> 30:14.400
texts, and he shows us the naval battle and talks about the land battle. And he says, and I'll quote

30:14.400 --> 30:19.920
here, the foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands. All that once the lands were removed

30:19.920 --> 30:27.120
and scattered in the fray, no land could stand before their arms from Hattay, Koday, Karkamesh,

30:27.120 --> 30:33.200
Artsua, and Alashia on. Now we know where those places are. Kati, those are the Hittites up in

30:33.200 --> 30:40.000
Turkey. Koday and Karkamesh, that's where Turkey joins Syria. Artsua is on the western coast of

30:40.000 --> 30:45.360
Turkey. Alashia, that's the ancient name for Cyprus. So we can see that these people are basically

30:45.360 --> 30:52.640
coming across Greece to Turkey to Cyprus and then into Canaan because he continues a camp was set up

30:52.640 --> 31:00.240
in one place in Amur. Amuru is by Ugarit on the north coast of Syria. They desolated its people.

31:00.320 --> 31:05.120
Its land was like that which comes, never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt

31:05.120 --> 31:10.480
while the flame was prepared before them. And then he gives us the names of the peoples because

31:10.480 --> 31:15.360
there's not just one sea peoples. In fact, he doesn't call them the sea peoples. That's our name

31:15.360 --> 31:22.640
for him. He gives us the actual groups, the Peleset, the Tejaker, the Shekilesh, the Denyan,

31:22.640 --> 31:29.200
and the Weshash. And then he says that he defeated them. And we know this from his year 12, Papyrus

31:29.200 --> 31:34.880
Harris says, I overthrew those who invaded from their lands. I slew the Denyan who are in their

31:34.880 --> 31:40.640
aisles. The Tejaker and the Peleset were made ashes. The Shardana and the Weshash of the sea,

31:40.640 --> 31:46.320
they were made as those that exist not. So you can see how we've got the name, the peoples of the

31:46.320 --> 31:52.720
sea, but he actually gives us the names. In fact, when you combine this with the earlier invasion,

31:52.720 --> 31:59.360
30 years previously, there's nine of these groups that all come in. So the big question that we've

31:59.360 --> 32:04.720
got is who are these people? Where did they come from? And where did they go to? Now we know what

32:04.720 --> 32:11.920
they look like because Ramses shows us them. These are pictures of captive sea peoples. In fact,

32:11.920 --> 32:16.880
if you want to dress up at Halloween, it's quite easy to do it. But trying to find where they came

32:16.960 --> 32:22.800
from is more and more difficult. So people have been playing, for example, linguistic games. So

32:22.800 --> 32:28.480
Shardana, name me a place in the Mediterranean that has similar consonants where they could have

32:28.480 --> 32:35.520
come from and give you a hint. Look in the western Mediterranean. Sardinia, people have suggested

32:35.520 --> 32:43.120
that's where they came from. Same thing with Shekelesh, nearby Sicily, possibly. Tejaker,

32:43.120 --> 32:49.520
maybe somewhere in Italy or Turkey. The Danians, some people have suggested that these are the

32:49.520 --> 32:55.600
Danans, Homer's, Mycenaean, Greeks. Weshash, we're not quite sure about, maybe from Willowsoe. It's

32:55.600 --> 33:02.000
only the Peleset that we think we know, the Philistines. And in fact, Jean-François Champollion,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.640
the guy who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics, he had already suggested that the Peleset were the

33:06.640 --> 33:14.720
Philistines way back in 1823 or so. Now, one of the problems we've got, though, is did they come

33:14.720 --> 33:20.000
from there or did they go there afterward? Are they from Sardinia or is that where they fled

33:20.000 --> 33:25.040
after they were defeated? And we don't know the answers. All I can tell you right now is that

33:25.040 --> 33:30.560
no site has been excavated where we can definitively say that's where the Sea Peoples come from.

33:30.560 --> 33:36.720
They are a mystery. We do know where some of them ended up. The Philistines, the Peleset,

33:36.720 --> 33:43.200
they wind up in what is now Israel, Lebanon, Syria. And in fact, you can see from this

33:43.200 --> 33:48.560
Philistine stirrup jar, it's what we would call degenerate Mycenaean. It looks like somebody

33:48.560 --> 33:55.600
from Greece is still making their pots, their stirrup jars, but they're now using local clay

33:55.600 --> 34:01.760
from Rhodes or Cyprus or even Canaan, ancient Israel. So it really looks like at least part

34:01.760 --> 34:07.600
of the Mycenaeans had joined the Sea Peoples maybe after they lost. And in fact, I suspect

34:07.600 --> 34:13.200
that that's why we've got the disparate groups. As these people swept over the lands, some of the

34:13.200 --> 34:19.120
people they were vanquishing joined in. So what we see in Egypt is the end of the process, this

34:19.200 --> 34:25.760
motley crew. But they're not Vikings. They're not raiders. We shouldn't be thinking like that.

34:26.480 --> 34:33.840
Because in the pictures that Ramesses shows us, he shows us, and you can see on the left and also

34:33.840 --> 34:39.680
the drawing on the right there, they're coming with their possessions. They're coming with ox carts.

34:39.680 --> 34:46.800
They're coming with wives and children. This is a migration. This is a movement. Think 1930s

34:46.800 --> 34:53.760
Dustball and everybody moving from Oklahoma to California. That's what this is. It's a migration.

34:53.760 --> 35:00.880
It's not just Viking raids. So then the question is, well, what caused that? And for the longest

35:00.880 --> 35:07.360
time, there was a very simple, logical, linear explanation that there was a drought. And that

35:07.360 --> 35:13.520
drought led to famine. And that led to the movement of the Sea Peoples. That led to havoc and the

35:13.520 --> 35:19.040
cutting of the trade routes. And that led to collapse. And it's a nice, easily told bedtime

35:19.040 --> 35:25.520
story, or perhaps not bedtime. But the problem is, it's too logical. It's too messy. Nothing

35:25.520 --> 35:32.240
is that logical. I think it's too simple. So what really happened? Well, that was what I

35:32.240 --> 35:39.200
wanted to investigate. If everything was gone, what caused it? Why did everything collapse?

35:39.280 --> 35:44.480
So suddenly. So the Sea Peoples were usually blamed for it. But I actually think

35:44.480 --> 35:49.920
they were as much the victims as they were the oppressors. I think they've been given a bad name.

35:49.920 --> 35:55.440
They got bad press. Yes, they were there. Yes, they did some damage. But I think they actually

35:55.440 --> 36:01.840
had a little bit of problem themselves. So what else could have caused it? Well, drought has been

36:01.840 --> 36:09.120
suggested. Famines been suggested. Invaders have been suggested. Earthquakes have been suggested.

36:09.120 --> 36:16.160
So if we have to pick and choose one of them, I respectfully decline. I would choose them all.

36:16.960 --> 36:21.760
I think there's a perfect storm. I think they all happened. Let me present the evidence to you

36:21.760 --> 36:29.680
rather quickly and then see what you think. Drought is not a recent suggestion. In fact,

36:29.680 --> 36:35.600
Rhys Carpenter, who was a professor at Bryn Mawr, suggested this in the 1960s. He said that the

36:35.600 --> 36:41.840
Mycenaeans had declined and gone downhill very quickly because of drought. But he didn't have

36:41.840 --> 36:48.400
proof for it. He didn't have any hard data. And so people gradually forgot that he had suggested

36:48.400 --> 36:55.920
this. But we now have that data. We've got it in the last five years. Connie Juski, a French

36:56.800 --> 37:01.840
professor, has been going with his team to a number of different places. And they went here

37:01.840 --> 37:10.000
to the north coast of Syria, a place called Gibala. And they took course from dried up

37:10.000 --> 37:15.680
lagoons and lakes. And then they looked at the pollen that was in there. And they decided,

37:15.680 --> 37:23.200
they could see, that the plants had changed. And there was what they call a 300-year dry event.

37:23.200 --> 37:29.280
In other words, a drought. And the pollen shows that there were drier climatic changes

37:29.280 --> 37:35.920
back then from about the 12th century or the 13th century, right about our time period,

37:35.920 --> 37:42.560
just after 1200, all the way down to the 9th century. So 300 years. So North Syria looks like

37:42.560 --> 37:49.040
it had a drought. They went over to Cyprus, did the same thing at Hollis-Sultantechi.

37:50.000 --> 37:57.840
Same thing. There is a drought there as well from 1200 to about 850 BC, judging from the pollen.

37:58.560 --> 38:04.960
And then Brandon Drake pulled together a bunch of different data in a study that was published in

38:04.960 --> 38:09.440
the Journal of Archaeological Science, including things like the temperature of the sea,

38:10.400 --> 38:17.280
which dropped. And when you do that, you get less rain on the, in this case, the Mycenaean

38:17.280 --> 38:22.880
or Greek mainland. And he said that took place about 1250 down to 1197 BC.

38:23.760 --> 38:30.320
Now, Brandon's article was so good. I did something that I rarely do. I wanted to contact him

38:30.320 --> 38:36.000
and give him my congratulations, a superb article. So I Googled him. All I knew was that it was

38:36.000 --> 38:41.440
Brandon Drake from University of New Mexico. And Google came up and the very first thing it said was,

38:41.520 --> 38:49.520
you are friends in Facebook. Really? So I sent an email to him and he's like, hey Eric,

38:49.520 --> 38:57.200
how's it going? Haven't seen you since Megiddo in 2006. All right, we dug together. So you may

38:57.200 --> 39:04.480
know people you don't even know you know. The power of the internet. The most recent of these

39:04.480 --> 39:09.840
scientific tests has taken place with Daphne Langut, who you can see in the picture down there in

39:09.840 --> 39:15.840
Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Litt, a German scientist. They also did the coring and the

39:15.840 --> 39:21.760
pollen analysis this time from the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. And they showed that in Israel

39:21.760 --> 39:28.240
too, there was a drought. It didn't last quite as long. It was from about 1250 down to 1100 BC.

39:28.240 --> 39:34.160
But so we've now got that missing data that Reese Carpenter was looking for, that there was a dry

39:34.160 --> 39:43.920
event, a drought that lasted from, well, at least 13 or 1200 BC down to, take your pick, 1150, 900,

39:43.920 --> 39:50.400
somewhere in there. And it's in Israel, it's in Syria, it's in Cyprus, it's in Greece. So at least

39:50.400 --> 39:55.120
the science is telling us that there is a drought. And of course the media went wild over this.

39:55.840 --> 40:00.720
Right, New York Times, pollen study points to drought is culprit in Bronze Age mystery.

40:01.520 --> 40:06.640
LA Times got into the act. Climate change may have caused demise of late Bronze Age civilizations.

40:07.840 --> 40:13.200
Archaeology magazine and National Geographic didn't want to be left out. There's Nat Geo,

40:13.200 --> 40:18.800
here's archaeology. New York Post got into it and they tossed in globalization for good measure.

40:21.040 --> 40:25.760
How globalization and climate change destroyed ancient civilization. And then you may remember

40:25.760 --> 40:31.760
that NASA funded study that turned out to be not so funded by NASA, that said that we were going

40:31.760 --> 40:37.760
to collapse in just a couple of decades. And at that point I was a little fed up, so I put an op-ed

40:37.760 --> 40:47.040
in the Huffington Post, the collapse of civilizations, it's complicated. Which it is. Now, with drought

40:47.040 --> 40:52.720
you frequently get famine, but famine can be difficult to discern in the archaeological record

40:52.720 --> 40:58.160
unless you find bodies and things like that. But that's where written texts come in. And in fact,

40:58.160 --> 41:05.040
we've got archives at Ugarit which tell us that, in fact, that's what's going on. Here is a letter

41:05.040 --> 41:09.120
from the house of Ortenu. He's another one of those private merchants like

41:09.120 --> 41:17.920
Senorano only a hundred or more years later. He has a outlying office in the city of Imar in

41:18.000 --> 41:24.800
land Syria and he gets word back. There is famine in our house. We will all die of hunger. If you

41:24.800 --> 41:30.560
do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from

41:30.560 --> 41:36.320
your land. So I think you can agree with me that there's probably famine going on there. We've got

41:36.320 --> 41:42.560
the written records. And we've even got this from the king of Ugarit. Another letter. Here with me

41:42.560 --> 41:48.560
Plenty has become famine. I think this is incontrovertual evidence. Even the Hittite king,

41:49.200 --> 41:54.240
do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands? It is a matter of life and death.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.760
And in fact, we know from other records that the Egyptians who until recently had been mortal

41:59.760 --> 42:07.440
enemies of the Hittites were sending grain ships up to help relieve the famine in the Hittite lands.

42:07.440 --> 42:14.640
So we've got that going on, which we see the same sort of things today. Now, adding insult to

42:14.640 --> 42:21.760
injury, though, do we have invaders? Well, yes, we do see people. So remember them, the Egyptian

42:21.760 --> 42:27.680
records. But it can be tough sometimes to figure out who's causing your destruction. So it could

42:27.680 --> 42:33.360
just as easily be internal rebellion. And in fact, we've got yet another letter from the king of

42:33.360 --> 42:39.680
Ugarit, in this case being sent to the king of Cyprus. And he says, my father, now the ships of

42:39.680 --> 42:44.560
the enemy have come. They've been setting fire to my cities and have done harm to the land.

42:45.120 --> 42:50.160
Doesn't my father know that all of my infantry and chariots are stationed in Hathi? So they're

42:50.160 --> 42:55.360
up in the Hittite lands in Turkey. And then he says, seven ships have been sighted. If any more

42:55.360 --> 43:00.960
are coming, then please let me know. Now, the story that was told for decades was that this text

43:00.960 --> 43:07.040
had been found in a kiln at Ugarit. It was being baked before it was shipped over to Cyprus,

43:07.040 --> 43:13.680
so it wouldn't fall apart. But that the destroyers had shown back up, those ships had come again,

43:13.680 --> 43:18.960
and that the kiln and the whole city had been destroyed before it could be sent. Makes a great

43:18.960 --> 43:26.240
story. Again, too good to be true. Re-examination has now shown that it was not in a kiln. It was,

43:26.320 --> 43:32.480
in fact, probably in a basket up on the second story, which fell and landed upside down. And in

43:32.480 --> 43:39.280
that basket were this tablet and about 70 others. And as the basket disintegrated, it left a kiln

43:39.280 --> 43:45.360
shaped lump with all these tablets. So in fact, we now think that it in fact was sent, and this

43:45.360 --> 43:52.640
could actually be a copy that was left. So we don't actually know if it's from the last Sea

43:52.640 --> 43:59.200
peoples or the previous one 30 years earlier. So it's not as much of a help as we thought. And yet,

44:00.160 --> 44:06.400
it's definitely evidence for invaders. We've even got another letter. It's a private letter. It's one

44:06.400 --> 44:11.760
of the last from Ugarit, which says, when your messenger arrived, the army was already humiliated

44:11.760 --> 44:16.800
and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floor was burnt and the vineyards were also

44:16.800 --> 44:22.480
destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it? May you know it? So somebody is coming in

44:22.480 --> 44:28.960
and destroying this area. And in fact, Kaniyusky, the same guy that took the pollen samples,

44:28.960 --> 44:36.800
when he was at Gibala in North Syria, he actually identified a destruction layer as sea peoples.

44:36.800 --> 44:42.320
But this is a bit hasty. There's definitely a destruction layer, but it's not necessarily by

44:42.320 --> 44:47.920
the Sea peoples. We don't actually know who did it. So this is a bit of a problem. And in fact,

44:47.920 --> 44:54.560
I give you one example. Canaanite hotsore in the north of Israel definitely destroyed somewhere

44:54.560 --> 45:00.720
around 1200 BC. We know this because we've got the archaeological evidence of the Late Bronze Age

45:00.720 --> 45:08.320
palace that is completely torched. The mud bricks are, sorry, the mud bricks are burnt red and black.

45:09.040 --> 45:16.240
A fire destroyed this. And in fact, the excavators, actually two excavators, Amnon Ben Tor and

45:16.240 --> 45:22.160
Sharon Zerkerman who just recently passed away, they were directing the site. And Amnon Ben Tor

45:22.160 --> 45:27.680
said, you know what? It's probably not Egyptians that did this destruction because there are

45:27.680 --> 45:33.120
Egyptian statues that are in the destruction level and they're defaced. They have their arms hacked

45:33.120 --> 45:37.840
off inside. So no Egyptian would have done that. So it can't be Egyptian. And same thing with the

45:37.920 --> 45:42.960
Canaanites because there's also Canaanite statues in the destruction and they are also defaced.

45:42.960 --> 45:48.560
So it's not Canaanites that are doing this. He says that leaves the Israelites and the Sea peoples

45:48.560 --> 45:53.760
and this is too far inland for Sea peoples. And I would actually debate that. Sea peoples got

45:53.760 --> 45:59.600
quite far inland, but he didn't want them. That left the Israelites, Joshua. And in fact,

45:59.600 --> 46:05.280
Hotsores mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities that Joshua burned down. Well,

46:05.280 --> 46:11.440
Sharon Zerkerman said, wait, not quite so fast. This is definitely burnt down. That's for sure.

46:11.440 --> 46:15.680
But how do you know who did it? And he says, well, what do you mean? She says, well, if you look and

46:15.680 --> 46:22.080
see what's destroyed, it's the palace and a couple of temples, but the actual domestic areas where

46:22.080 --> 46:26.160
the people are living and working, they're untouched. They're not burnt. They're not destroyed.

46:26.720 --> 46:32.480
She said, to me, that's the sign of an internal rebellion of the lower classes rising up against

46:32.480 --> 46:38.240
the upper class when they don't have enough food or enough money or whatever. So she said,

46:38.240 --> 46:44.000
it's an internal rebellion. And my point here is very simple. If the two co-directors can't decide

46:44.000 --> 46:49.600
who destroyed their site, then how are we ever going to decide? All we know is that it is destroyed

46:49.600 --> 46:58.080
by somebody or maybe by some thing because we can't rule out earthquakes. And in fact,

46:59.040 --> 47:06.560
if you take a map of the sites that are destroyed in this collapse from about 1225 to 1175,

47:06.560 --> 47:12.800
everything you see here with the red X is destroyed. And if you overlay it on top of a map

47:12.800 --> 47:18.800
of earthquakes that have happened just in the last century, or a little bit more since about 1900,

47:18.800 --> 47:25.440
you can see that most of the sites are actually in active seismic zones. In fact, we've got

47:25.520 --> 47:29.600
a number of fault lines. You've got the North Anatolian fault line in light blue.

47:29.600 --> 47:34.880
You've got another fault line in green. You've got an orange one coming up the Great Rift Valley.

47:34.880 --> 47:38.960
So there are lots of fault lines and lots of earthquakes in this region.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.960
And in fact, we have something that I find absolutely fascinating. This is the North

47:44.960 --> 47:52.400
Anatolian fault line running across the top of Turkey. It has had what is called in modern terms

47:52.400 --> 48:00.560
an earthquake sequence over the last 60 or more years. In fact, specifically about 1939 to 1999.

48:00.560 --> 48:04.720
An earthquake sequence is when you have an earthquake and it doesn't release all the pressure,

48:05.840 --> 48:09.440
there'll be another earthquake right next to it. We're nearby sometime in the future,

48:09.440 --> 48:14.320
a week later, a year later, maybe a decade later. If that one doesn't release all the pressure,

48:14.320 --> 48:19.520
you'll have another one and another one until the fault line unzips. This is stuff that Amos

48:19.520 --> 48:24.880
Norit, Stanford studies. So earthquake sequence is what they call it when it happens in modern times.

48:24.880 --> 48:30.560
But it happened in antiquity as well. They have a much cooler name for it. It's called an earthquake

48:30.560 --> 48:38.560
storm. When you have this earthquake storm and it unzips over a period of 50 or 60 years,

48:38.560 --> 48:45.440
it then takes about another 400 years to generate enough steam and start the whole process over

48:45.440 --> 48:51.680
again. And it looks like if we look at some of the sites that are destroyed that there is a 50-year

48:51.680 --> 48:56.880
earthquake storm right around our period. So I think that there are earthquakes taking place here.

48:56.880 --> 49:03.280
So for instance, my sceni here on the land gate, you can see the Cyclopean masonry on the left side

49:03.280 --> 49:09.280
and it's built on top of what looks like bedrock there. That's actually one side of a fault zone.

49:10.240 --> 49:14.560
All the geoarchaeologists went there and just started laughing. They're like,

49:14.560 --> 49:20.560
wait a minute, they built the major city on top of an active fault zone? Who would do that?

49:24.880 --> 49:28.560
Yeah, the people from San Francisco just kind of shook their head.

49:31.200 --> 49:36.640
And in fact, we've got victims that are obviously killed in an earthquake. Here is one young lady.

49:36.640 --> 49:41.440
It's actually the same one in both pictures here. You can see the rock that's lying to the side of

49:41.440 --> 49:47.840
her head in the, what is that, the right picture for you. That rock was actually embedded in her skull.

49:47.840 --> 49:52.560
She had taken shelter in a doorway, which is usually the best place to do it, in the basement,

49:52.560 --> 49:59.600
but the whole thing had collapsed and had killed her. So mycena, tirans, just three kilometers away,

49:59.600 --> 50:04.720
same sort of thing. In this case, we've got a woman and a child killed by a collapsing

50:04.720 --> 50:09.040
building at the same time period. If you go over to Troy with the Trojan War and all that,

50:09.040 --> 50:15.280
Troy Six, you've got a wall that is not supposed to look like that, right? That one that's leaning.

50:15.280 --> 50:21.040
Trust me, it wasn't built like the way originally. And even at Ugarit, this is a slightly earlier

50:21.040 --> 50:26.960
one, but you see how that wall undulates. It's not supposed to do that. So there are earthquakes at

50:26.960 --> 50:32.400
this time. So here, my point would be that if you see a site that's destroyed, it might not be who.

50:32.400 --> 50:38.320
It might be what that destroyed it in this particular case. But if you do have a who,

50:38.320 --> 50:43.680
then you've got the cutting of these international trade routes. And that is going on. And I bring

50:43.680 --> 50:50.560
us back to one of our original slides here, where you've got this long trade route with the bronze

50:50.560 --> 50:57.200
and the copper and the tin. And if imagine it had been cut at any point along that, and you

50:57.200 --> 51:02.640
suddenly couldn't get your tin anymore, then how are you going to make your bronze? Now,

51:02.640 --> 51:07.280
that's not going to bring your bronze age to a complete halt in and of itself. But if you add

51:07.360 --> 51:12.480
that in to the great mix, then I think you can see you've got a problem. And in fact,

51:12.480 --> 51:17.200
they were lucky that they were able to turn to iron to take over. And in fact, you know,

51:17.200 --> 51:23.120
in the bronze age, there are already using iron. In King Tut's tomb, there's an iron dagger.

51:23.120 --> 51:28.400
It's just that they're using bronze much more. And even in the iron age that takes over, they're

51:28.400 --> 51:34.400
still using bronze, but not as much. So in this particular case, we see basically an innovation

51:34.480 --> 51:39.280
taking over to fill a gap where they don't have bronze anymore, and they've got iron.

51:40.160 --> 51:46.160
So in terms of what happened, well, it's still a mystery. But I think we can sum up

51:46.880 --> 51:52.320
if I give you three points that I think you will agree with me, and there'll be no arguments,

51:52.320 --> 51:58.320
we can then proceed from there. So first point, would you agree that we have a number of separate

51:58.320 --> 52:04.000
civilizations that are flourishing between, say, the 15th and the 13th centuries? We've named

52:04.000 --> 52:09.200
some of them, Mycenaeans, Minoans, Hittites, Egyptians, Canaanites, Cypriots. They're all

52:09.200 --> 52:14.000
independent, but they are all interacting with each other, especially through trade routes.

52:14.560 --> 52:21.680
Would you agree with me with that point? Okay, so we've got that. Second point, it's pretty clear

52:21.680 --> 52:26.800
that many of the cities were destroyed and that the late Bronze Age pretty much came to an end

52:26.800 --> 52:33.280
right around 1177 or soon thereafter. We all agreed with that. No argument there. Everything's

52:33.280 --> 52:40.000
destroyed. Everything goes down. But point number three, there's no proof as to what or who has

52:40.000 --> 52:45.440
actually caused this. All we know is that it did collapse. So we've got three main points that

52:45.440 --> 52:51.600
everybody agrees on, and yet it in a way doesn't help us all that much. And in fact, people are

52:51.600 --> 52:58.160
still even today going with that same linear progression. They still say, I heard it last

52:58.160 --> 53:03.440
November. Drought, famine, cutting of the trade routes, movement, all that. I still say

53:04.160 --> 53:12.560
that is too linear. It was much, much messier. So if you were to say to me, well, what is it?

53:12.560 --> 53:18.080
Earthquakes, famine, drought, movement of peoples. I would say yes to all of the above. In fact,

53:18.080 --> 53:22.960
the only thing that's missing is plague. There's no evidence for plague. And I actually do find

53:22.960 --> 53:27.360
that surprising. I think there should be, but no evidence for that yet. But everything else,

53:28.080 --> 53:34.400
absolutely, we've got the whole thing. The problem is I don't know that we can point to any one

53:34.400 --> 53:40.720
single driver or stressor. Certainly climate change seems big, but is that the major stressor

53:40.720 --> 53:46.400
or driver? Well, that can be argued because some of the others may have caused a problem as well.

53:46.400 --> 53:51.680
And in fact, different parts of this region, ranging from, remember, we're going from Italy and

53:51.680 --> 53:57.040
Greece all the way over to Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan, different problems may have

53:57.040 --> 54:02.480
arisen in different places and they may have reacted differently. But the ending is the same.

54:02.480 --> 54:11.120
They all end. They are depending on each other for both raw materials and finished products.

54:11.120 --> 54:17.120
And therefore, when one went down, there is a domino effect. What happens to the Hittites affects

54:17.120 --> 54:22.800
the Mycenians, which affects the Cypriots, which affects the Assyrians and so on. So anything that

54:22.800 --> 54:29.760
gets destabilized in a system like this is ultimately going to affect everything. And in fact,

54:29.760 --> 54:35.920
what we're looking at is a systems collapse. This isn't an explanation for it. It's just a name for

54:35.920 --> 54:40.720
it. When you've got a systems collapse, and Colin Renfrew was talking about this already back in

54:40.720 --> 54:47.520
about 1979, you have a collapse of the central administration. You've got the disappearance

54:47.600 --> 54:53.440
of the traditional elite. You've got the collapse of the economy, if you've got a centralized

54:53.440 --> 55:00.480
economy, and you have entire population shifts and decline. Now, this doesn't happen overnight.

55:00.480 --> 55:05.520
Systems collapse, which we can see in a number of different places, takes about 100 years.

55:07.120 --> 55:16.320
And in fact, I would say that 1177 is the wrong title for my book. Civilization did not collapse

55:16.320 --> 55:24.240
in that year. That is just shorthand for the whole collapse. Just as we say that Rome fell in 476.

55:24.240 --> 55:28.720
Even though we know it didn't, it took most of the 5th century, and even then you've still got the

55:28.720 --> 55:35.760
Eastern Roman Empire continuing on. We still say Rome fell in 476. It's shorthand, if you will.

55:35.760 --> 55:42.480
That's what 1177 is. It's a shorthand. Perhaps a better way to say it would be that the world in

55:42.480 --> 55:49.600
1200 was very different from the world in 1100 and completely different in the year 1000.

55:50.400 --> 55:57.440
But that doesn't really fit on a book cover. So, we're looking at something that takes about a

55:57.440 --> 56:03.200
century, and when everything does fall, you get a dark age. And in fact, we've got that. We've got

56:03.200 --> 56:09.200
the Greek dark ages that go for about 300 years. And in the systems collapse, you frequently get

56:09.200 --> 56:14.560
myths about the golden age that came just before. So, think, for example, about Homer,

56:14.560 --> 56:19.200
and a story about the Trojan War. It's a perfect example. So, what I would say that we're looking

56:19.200 --> 56:26.880
at is indeed a systems collapse from that time period. So, what are the takeaways? What lessons

56:26.880 --> 56:34.800
can we learn from this? Well, one of the questions we can ask is, are we facing a similar situation

56:34.880 --> 56:44.000
today? Now, that might be, I mean, it's 3200 years, but let me ask you, is there climate change today?

56:44.720 --> 56:48.480
Well, we could argue about that till the cows go home, but I think most people now would say yes.

56:49.760 --> 56:55.200
Famines and droughts somewhere in the world? Absolutely. Earthquakes going on? Yes.

56:56.160 --> 57:01.280
Rebellions? Sure. In fact, I think the only thing we're missing are the sea peoples.

57:01.680 --> 57:09.040
And in fact, I'm not so sure we're missing the sea peoples, because there could be two different

57:09.040 --> 57:14.240
groups that you can interpret as the sea peoples. It could either be ISIS, which is busy destroying

57:14.240 --> 57:18.560
everything in the Near East. Our antiquity is going to be gone if we don't do something about it.

57:18.560 --> 57:25.120
Or there could be the refugees that have fled from Syria and elsewhere that are now in Europe.

57:25.200 --> 57:31.840
It depends if you see the sea peoples as victims or oppressors, or maybe both. So,

57:31.840 --> 57:36.880
I actually think we do have the sea peoples today as well, just with a slightly different name.

57:37.680 --> 57:45.040
And in fact, if we take a look at headlines from around the world, from say the last two or three

57:45.040 --> 57:52.800
years, Greece's economy is tanked, right? That's been in the news. Internal rebellions have engulfed

57:52.800 --> 57:59.360
Libya, Egypt, and Syria. Outsiders and foreign warriors are fanning our flames. Yes, not news.

57:59.360 --> 58:06.720
It's on TV every night. Turkey's afraid it's going to be involved, as does Israel. Jordan is crowded

58:06.720 --> 58:13.680
with refugees. Iran is bellicose and threatening, and Iraq is in turmoil, right? All of this ripped

58:13.680 --> 58:18.640
from the headlines in the last couple of years. Well, what if we had newspapers from 1200 BC?

58:19.360 --> 58:24.080
What would the headlines have read? Pretty much the same thing.

58:27.360 --> 58:36.880
So, my question is, we are more technologically advanced. We are also more aware of our surroundings.

58:37.600 --> 58:45.760
That is, the Hittites did not have SUVs. They did not cause climate change. But Mother Nature

58:45.840 --> 58:51.600
did a pretty good job of it back then. I also think the Hittites were not aware of what was

58:51.600 --> 58:56.400
happening. What was a drought? Why didn't it rain? I mean, you pray to the storm god, and if works,

58:56.400 --> 59:03.600
or it doesn't work. We know what is happening. We know what's causing it, and we might know what

59:03.600 --> 59:10.320
to do about it. The question is, will we do it? Now, I look backwards. That's my job as a historian.

59:10.320 --> 59:16.400
It is the job of others, including in this audience, to look forward. So, I would simply say

59:17.360 --> 59:26.240
that if a similar globalized society collapsed 3,200 years ago, might we not want to study it a

59:26.240 --> 59:32.080
little bit to find out what we could learn and maybe stop ourselves from doing the same thing?

59:32.880 --> 59:35.360
Food for thought. Thank you.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.000
Thanks, Eric. Have a seat.

59:48.640 --> 01:00:04.160
Say more about the dark age. 300 years of what? What was lost? I mean, you said you wanted to live in

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:12.800
the Golden Bronze Age. There are lots of apparently good things. But languages lost,

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.680
technologies lost, cities emptied. What does darkness mean in this case?

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:24.160
Darkness means totality. I mean, you ask what's lost. What isn't lost? They lose the art of writing.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.880
The art of writing. Well, if you want to call it the art of writing, they forget how to write.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.800
Now, remember that only 1% can read a right back then. So, when you take off that traditional

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.120
elite, including the Scrabble class, you're left with not many people who know to read and write.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:46.080
So, Linear B goes away, which the Mycenaeans are using, and so on. So, they lose writing,

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.280
they lose the monumental architecture, they lose much of what we would call the hallmarks

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.720
of civilization. Now, they're going to get it back, but it's going to take a while. It takes a

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.600
different period of time depending on where you are. So, in Greece, for example, it takes about

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.680
two to 300 years to come back. But in other places, it takes them far less. For example,

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.920
remember, Egypt doesn't really collapse. It's just weakened. And Assyria and Babylon,

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.840
they bounce back in a couple of decades. And I think the secret there is they're all on major

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.640
rivers. You've got the Menile, you've got the Tigris and the Euphrates. So, even if you've got a

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:31.680
drought, I think they're less affected. But even they have dark ages. So, it's what happens.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:40.240
So, was there a Renaissance where people sort of rediscovering stuff from before and there was

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.720
continuity or was there a completely new invention of these things? Both. There's both a Renaissance

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.040
and new inventions. But in fact, there is a period of Greek history that we call the Greek Renaissance.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.800
And this is the period when you have Homer, Heciate, and then Sappho and the Greek poets. The

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.280
eighth century is when they're coming back up and rediscovering. But in the meantime, you've

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.480
got new things. For example, the Phoenicians have brought their alphabet. And so, when they're now

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.120
writing in the eighth and seventh centuries, they're using an alphabet, which is completely

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.040
different from what they had done with Linear B, which is basically pictograms. So, there's both

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.960
the Renaissance and new ideas. And one of the things that occurred to me is, you know, I hate to

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.520
kind of put it this way, but if you have an old growth forest, sometimes a forest fire is good.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.360
It clears away the underbrush and lets new things grow. And that's kind of what happened here.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.200
Because think about a what if. What if this hadn't collapsed? Would you have the Israelites

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.480
coming in? Would you have Moses and Monotheism? Would you, a couple centuries down the pike,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.320
have Greece and democracy? I mean, it's all kinds. So, because this collapsed, we've got our world

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.640
today. So, one of these days, I want to write something about a what if. What if it hadn't

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:04.800
collapsed? What would we be doing? Smart dinosaurs. Right. Question from Chris Brousseau.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.040
Please illustrate the scale of the cities, kingdoms, armies, and navies of the towns.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.600
What was the population of Knossos and so on? What, how many people are we talking about?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.720
It's very tough to estimate population. And it depends that you ask three different people,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.880
you get three different answers. But they have a range, probably. Yeah, they've got a range. And

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.520
in fact, there's a new article out saying Knossos is three times larger than we ever thought it was

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.880
at this time period or actually in the Iron Age. So, new theory or new data?

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.000
New data that's just coming out. Yes. But the, the upshot is in terms of cities, I mean, we're

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.800
talking a couple thousand people. We're talking armies that are maybe a couple of hundred people.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.440
They're not huge. There is in the Battle of Kadesh. Army of a couple hundred people. A couple

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:54.480
hundred people can do pretty devastating attacks. Not even a, you know. Yeah. Yeah. There is in the

01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.160
Battle of Megiddo, for example, there are 900 chariots that are captured. That's a huge fighting

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.760
force. That actually is. That's a lot of tanks. Yeah. Armored cavalry. Armored cavalry for that

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:12.480
time period. We have another, a Hittite text that talks about a force in the region of Troy

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.640
in about 1500 BC. And it says, so and so landed with a hundred men. That was a lot.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.280
So, we're not talking huge amounts. We're talking a couple thousand. I think if a city is 10 or

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:31.040
20,000, it's, it's big. It's huge. And what was in these cities that people would want? I mean,

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.640
I can see this sort of the, not invasion, but refugee approach. But some of these sound like

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.960
they were, you know, we're going to take down your city. And what was there that they would want?

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.640
Is this slave gold? I mean, what's there? Well, in a lot of these cases, what it seems is at the

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.320
end of the late Bronze Age, they're burning down the cities and then reoccupying them. So, remember,

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.560
this is a migration. They're actually looking for places to settle. And in fact, some of the

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:05.600
archaeological evidence is indicating that the assimilation, if you will, was much more peaceful.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:12.400
The Canaanites and the Philistines, for example, Asafchus Orlando of Haifa, is, has got evidence

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.560
that these are actually maybe much more peaceful settling down. So, yes, there is some warfare,

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.760
yes, there is some destruction, but they're not, you know, pillaging and burning and moving on.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.920
They are even at Gibala, where Kaniyuski was looking. There is a destruction and then there's

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.440
an immediate reoccupation. And in that case, there is this Philistine looking pottery, which is why

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.960
he thinks it's sea peoples. Had there been a long peace before all of this breakdown that

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.880
made these societies more vulnerable in some sense, more relaxed about things?

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:53.280
It's possible. That is quite possible. They are definitely, this is an era of prosperity,

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.760
I would say, from the 14th century on. So, growing prosperity. People are growing.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.800
Generation to generation, better and better off. Exactly. And they may have been lulled into a sense

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:09.040
of false security. I was at a conference a year or two ago on climate change at this time period.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:16.880
And one of the people there suggested that there was actually a time in the 14th century of more

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.920
rain and better times, and that perhaps they overextended themselves. And so, when the ending

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:29.600
came, it was all that more drastic. So, yes, they may have been, I wouldn't say lulled into

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:35.360
false security, but things were going really well in the 14th and 13th centuries. And in fact,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.600
that's the thing about this collapse is everything is going really well until suddenly it's not.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.320
It's not like things were going badly for a while. It's in Ugar, for example, the letters from the

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.360
merchants and the kings and all that. Everything is going great until suddenly the city is destroyed.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.760
So, are these societies, do they have histories of themselves? Are they telling stories of their

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.760
own past? Or are they living in a kind of a rolling present?

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.840
Depends on the city. Ugar, for example, has, there's actually a cottage industry of

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.240
Ugaritic studies. They've got history. They've got king lists. They've got queen lists. They've

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.000
got epics. They've got, so we've got that. But from others, it's mute that we don't have anything.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.520
So, it just depends where you are. Steve Levines, can you comment on the languages of the period?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.160
Was there a lingua franca? So, they're doing all this trade. There's numbers and we have this

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.960
accounting. Is there something besides numbers that they all speak? Absolutely. Excellent question.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.920
And yes, the lingua franca of that day is Akkadian, which the Amarna letters that I cited at the

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:42.880
beginning. If you were Hittite and you could read or write, you would know Hittite and Akkadian.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.240
If you were Egyptian, you would know Egyptian and Akkadian. Even probably the Mycenaeans,

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.800
they would know linear B and Akkadian. If you are living in Assyria and Babylon,

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.560
you're home free because you're doing Akkadian anyway. Right, but that is the lingua franca and

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.120
we do see the diplomatic correspondence being written in it. Some of the Amarna letters are,

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.920
one of them is written or two of them are written in Hittite, but that's unusual. Most of them are

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.720
Akkadian. Everybody's got their own language and then there's one diplomatic language. So,

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.320
that in a sense was the Bronze Age lingua franca. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, well, well, like

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:28.960
English now. Some guy writing in the dark, I can't read his name. Bob Copac, it might look like.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.320
When did the iron business start? That iron technology you mentioned briefly that it was

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:44.160
just getting going in Egypt suddenly. Where? And say a little bit about bronze technology versus

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:54.720
iron technology. Okay, this is a much debated point, but basically iron, once you are able to

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.480
master the smelting and all that, of course, iron is going to be much better than copper.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:07.200
But copper is in some ways seems to be easier to manipulate. Now, that's not always true, but

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.840
there is a good reason why they are using bronze for almost 2000 years and that iron doesn't take

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:20.560
over until it really absolutely has to. The actual date for the invention of iron is a bit of a debate

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.360
and there's kind of an old wives tale that the Hittites invented it and had a monopoly.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.520
And that's why they were able to capture most of the Middle East at one point. That turns out to

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.720
have been a mistranslation of one of the texts. And so, while the Hittites did know iron, so did

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.400
everybody else. But it's the type of thing where you're not going to actually do it until you have

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:48.800
to. And so, I would say, as I said, that this is something where if your supply of tin is cut off

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.200
and you can't make bronze anymore, you will turn to iron. Which turns out to be better anyway.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:00.400
Which turns out to be better anyway. Exactly. Well, yeah, what is the sharpness of a bronze dagger

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.320
versus iron? Does it really matter how sharp it is? If it goes in you, it goes in you. All that.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.800
But bronze doesn't hold an edge, presumably, as well. Bronze does not hold an edge as well.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.560
I still would not want to get attacked by it. Fair enough. I promise not to.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:27.040
Manual Manal Mehta, I think, asks, what could they have done in 1177 to prevent the collapse?

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.600
Good question. I've been wondering that myself. What could they have done to prevent the collapse?

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.200
Who would be the they in this? Who would be the they? Yes. Might be Egypt. In fact, I think

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:44.720
Egypt did prepare. If Ugarit is destroyed between 1190 and 1185, which we think,

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.560
and the Sea Peoples don't wind up in Egypt until 1177, that gives them a good seven to

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.480
10 to 15 years to figure it out. So I think Egypt was plenty prepared. In fact, there's some new

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:04.480
evidence, by a colleague of mine, that thinks the land battle, there's a land battle and a naval

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.160
battle. And she thinks the land battle was actually fought earlier up in Syria, and that it was kind

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.520
of an offensive defense. Go protect your country. And Egypt sort of reached up. And the Egyptians

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.120
went all the way up. And then later they fought the naval battle down below. So I do think that

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.280
they had some time to prepare. And I think that's probably why they were successful.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:32.080
Others, you know, what can you do if you're if your supply of a crucial raw material is cut off?

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.400
It can be difficult. If you're hit by an earthquake, I don't know anything that can prepare you for

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:42.960
that. So I'm not so sure it was possible to have survived it. And this is one thing that

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.040
I would say if an earthquake hits, you can survive it. If a famine hits, you can survive it. I mean,

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:55.760
people will die, but you can survive it. A drought? Invaders? Yes. Somebody always survives. But what

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:03.520
if you have one, then two, then three, and then four? What if you have the perfect storm? That also

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.960
gets you a multiplier effect, right? Where everything is going to get worse and worse and worse. And I

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.440
think that's what we've got here. So I think if it had been just a famine, they could have survived

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.920
it. They've done that before. We know they had a famine back in the 14th century. They survived it.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.680
We know there's invaders. They've survived it. But when you've got them all at once,

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.160
so there, how do you prepare for that? And I'm not sure that you can.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.760
So you've got a sort of cascading effects. You've got a chaos leading to chaos. You mentioned four

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:40.640
things in your slide, the sort of loss of administrative center, the loss of kind of an

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:47.040
economic apparatus, the loss of the elites, and I forget what the other. Right. The population

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:56.320
declines and movements. So do the cities really empty out in these circumstances or what happens?

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.720
Some of them did. Some of them did. They're actually population movements. And in fact,

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.440
that's what Reese Carpenter was basing himself on. He didn't have the data about the pollen and

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.040
everything, but he did notice the population shifts. And he said one of the only reasons that could

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.440
caused it was drought and then the whole thing collapsed. So indeed. So people go away from

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.800
drought. That makes a lot of sense. They go away from chaos, but toward what? Right. Ironically,

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:29.440
however, one of the major suggestions is that if the Sea Peoples, the Shardana and the Shackalash

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.720
really did come from Sardinia and Sicily, which I do adhere to that. I don't think they went there

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.640
afterward. I think they came from there. The hypothesis is that there was an original drought

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.760
up in Europe or in Western Mediterranean that started them moving. In which case,

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.280
they had the worst rotten luck because they're moving from one drought into another drought

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.320
on the Eastern Mediterranean. And what do you do if you have a 300 year long drought? That's pretty

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:04.720
hard to survive. Famously. So Egypt goes into a steep decline. That's the way you describe it. Say

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.880
a little more about that. So even though they were prepared and they're the ones that survive,

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.680
what does survival mean under these circumstances? In this particular case, there is still upheaval

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:21.120
and turmoil and rebellions in Egypt. Everything is not hunky dory. They do survive. In fact,

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.480
Ramses III himself, the man who saved Egypt from the Sea Peoples. Was that how he was seen at the

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.680
time? Was the guy who... I would imagine. We don't actually have anything that says it. Well,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:39.520
actually, he himself says that. I'm sure he said that. I'm the one. He was assassinated in a harem

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:48.640
conspiracy, which is kind of an interesting way to end your life. In fact, and it was... We know

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.160
about it because it was written. It's actually a fairly famous papyrus where it says that there

01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.400
was an assassination plot and it names a minor queen who had just had a son. And there were

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.920
something like 40 accomplices in the harem and they're all put on trial and they're put to death,

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:14.080
but nobody knew whether it had succeeded. The actual report doesn't say. But Ramses III's

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:21.840
mummy was x-rayed in CAT scan not so long ago and his mummy has kind of a scarf around his neck.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.760
And when they looked through it, they just now saw, this is the last couple of years,

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.560
a knife, an incision by a knife that went right in and just cut his throat, basically. He would

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.840
have died pretty much instantly. And so it looks like the assassination did in fact take place.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:44.960
Now, in the same tomb, they also found a young man wrapped in a goat skin and not mummified,

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.960
which is what you do when somebody is... Well, you don't want them to survive into the afterlife.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.200
And that mummy of the young man shows evidence of having been strangled to death.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.840
So the hypothesis is that that is the young prince who was part of it and that he was then

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.400
buried with his father after the assassination took place. So even though you beat the sea peoples,

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.480
you might have trouble at home. Yeah, the most dangerous thing is a pharaoh's either your family

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:25.760
or your harem or both. Michael M asks, there are lots of mysteries. What one piece of information

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.600
would you as an archaeologist most like to find that would solve most of the questions you have?

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.040
What would I most like to find that would solve most of my questions? Or would you like somebody

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:43.840
else to find that you would be glad to read? Yes. Do both, actually. There's digs that you work on

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.160
and there's digs that other people work on. Absolutely. So, for example, at Megiddo, where I

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:57.280
was for the last 20 years, we know that the king of Megiddo, Biridia in 1350, is writing to Amenhotep

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:03.200
III. Or maybe that's where Megiddo is. Megiddo, sorry, is northern Israel, Jezreel Valley. In fact,

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.440
Megiddo is Armageddon. Har-Megiddo in Hebrew is the mound or mountain of Megiddo. Har-Megiddo,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:15.360
Armageddon. The original rough breathing or H was lost to us over translation. So,

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.240
Megiddo is Armageddon. And that was kind of fun digging in Armageddon for 20 years. In fact,

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:30.240
our shirts at the back said, I survived Armageddon. Well, in about 1350, the king of Megiddo is writing

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:36.080
to the Egyptian pharaoh and we have six letters from him in that Amarna archive in Egypt. What we

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.680
don't have are the responses. They are somewhere at Megiddo. And that was actually why I joined the

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.680
project originally in 1994. I wanted to find that archive. In fact, I think I know where it is because

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.640
Chicago, who was there 1925 to 1939, they excavated half of the late Bronze Age palace. And the other

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.920
half is still there waiting to be excavated. And that's probably where the archive is. I was so

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.880
sure we were going to find it in 94. I brought my Akkadian textbooks. I was prepared to translate

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:11.360
them on the spot. Oh boy, yeah. We never found. Listen to this. Exactly. Look what he got in return.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.480
So I would love to find the archive at Megiddo that I know is there. We just haven't found it.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:23.360
So, but basically writing, writing, writing. At my other side of Calvary, which is a Canaanite palace

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.400
way up in the north of Israel. Think right on the Lebanese border. That's where we are. We've got a

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:36.080
Middle Bronze Age Canaanite palace. And in 2013 and 2015, we found the oldest and largest wine

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.640
seller from the ancient world. So we've got about 16,000 liters of wine. It's got an earthy taste now, but

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.200
no, it's all gone. We just have the jars, but organic residue analysis can tell you what was in

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.880
the jars. We don't have a scrap of writing. I would love to know if they were writing,

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.920
or were they writing too? Because they've got connections to Greece. So it's the missing tablets

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.960
that have me in a conundrum. That's in my wildest daydreams. That's what I would want to find.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.600
Another couple of archives. You realize that if civilization collapses about 30 years from now,

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:13.120
there'll be no writing at all recording what the hell happened. It'll all be in the cloud.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.040
We'll be out there, you know, analyzing corpses, trying to find out what they were sick with.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.080
Absolutely. And that, for me, as an archaeologist, is a fascinating question. What are people going

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.400
to find from our civilization if and when we do collapse? And if there are any future archaeologists,

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.360
what are they going to think when they excavate, say, the Smithsonian Museum or the Washington

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.000
Zoo or all the Starbucks that are out there? Well, do a little taxonomy of collapse here. So

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:50.640
the one clearly that we in the West take most seriously was the collapse of the Roman Empire.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:58.240
Compare and contrast what happened then with what happened 1500 years earlier, 1177.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:06.320
Well, I think the collapse of the Late Bronze Age was at least as great as the collapse of the

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:12.880
Roman Empire in terms of what we lost. In terms of, I mean, the Babylonians and Assyrians are doing

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.200
complex mathematics and astronomy and medicine. We've got the text from them and from the Egyptians.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.720
Right. All sorts of things that were lost. All that astronomy was lost. All that was gone.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:31.120
Yeah. Now, it's later reincorporated. I mean, we've got the Neo-Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrians

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.160
who rise up in the first millennium and they continue. Like I said, for them, they only go down

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.680
for a couple of decades. So they are able to have the Renaissance right away. And so we've got

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.000
Neo-Babylonian astronomy, for example, is quite advanced. But in other cases, I mean,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.400
it's so lost we don't even know what they had. The Mycenaeans, their language was only deciphered

01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:02.640
in 1952 as an early version of Greek. One gets a sort of sense of trauma that happened in the West

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.120
after Rome went down. Do you think it was that kind of traumatic in the Mediterranean

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.400
when the Bronze Age went down? Yes, I think it was absolutely traumatic, especially for the survivors

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.320
that probably didn't know what hit them and really what to do about it. I mean, think if you've

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.920
got a complex society and everything's ticking away merrily and then into it, like I said, you

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:32.640
just drop a little chaos. You've got everything. It's like a fine race car where if you throw a rod

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.440
from your engine, suddenly you're driving a piece of junk. Same thing here. I think it had been

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:42.800
absolutely marvelous and wonderful and they were going places and suddenly it's a screeching halt

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:51.680
and everything stops. And then you've got, so these were monumental civilizations and so you've

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:59.200
got, you know, the thing that we saw in a sense after Rome and after the later demise or slowdown

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:05.680
of Egypt of people sort of camping out in the ruins of a former civilization. Yes, and we do have

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:12.320
that. We have squatters in most of these places. In fact, can also us with them thinking that now

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.880
in the Iron Age it's three times bigger. In the immediate aftermath, it probably was squatters.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.480
In fact, Mycenae, for example, Agamemnon's Mycenae, there are squatters that continue. It doesn't

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:29.680
just go down. It continues on a trickle. Squatters show up how in archaeology. It's hard to tell

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:35.520
sometimes, but when they're living in what are obviously ruined buildings and yet they're still

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.880
living there, that's a pretty good indication.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.160
See a little more about, you mentioned when we were talking before, you're working on a couple

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.400
of stories now, one being Megidae, one being archaeology of the future. We at Long Now Foundation

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.600
are very interested in archaeology of the future since we're trying to create some

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:07.280
with a 10,000 year clock. What have you got? What is you bear down on? What future archaeologists

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:16.160
will find? What stands out? Well, it's an interesting question. Actually, it comes from

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.920
The World Without Us, a book published a couple years ago. Yeah, he gave a talk here. Exactly.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.080
Got me thinking about that. And they were a couple of specials on TV at the time.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.240
So now, when I fly into a major city, I try and imagine what I would find as an archaeologist

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.200
in say 2,000 years. And of course, what would be left are the plastics and the things that are

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.840
non-biodegradable probably. But then I do come to the question of how you would interpret it.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.480
Because in archaeology, for example, we've got a saying, of course it's tongue-in-cheek,

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.000
but if we don't understand something, then it's cultic or religious.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:59.760
Or fertility, right? Or fertility? Or fertility, exactly. So, for example, I mean,

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.680
if you were excavating some of the Smithsonian museums, that's going to throw you for a loop.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.800
What's the hope diamond doing next to an elephant doing next to a... But you know,

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.240
Nabonitis in the 6th century BC, he had a museum. I was going to say, there must be historic museums

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.080
that look like that, because everything cobbled together. And that through the archaeologists

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.600
for a loop when they're finding Sumerian stuff next to Babylonian stuff, they're going,

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.640
what's going on? They suddenly realized we're digging an ancient museum. So what if you have

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.040
something like that? Or what would be left, say, of the zoo, San Francisco Zoo, Washington Zoo?

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.720
If the animals got out and you just have empty cages, or if the animals don't get out and they're

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.680
still there, what are you going to do with that? And then, really, what are you going to do with

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.720
all the McDonald's and Starbucks that are on every corner? Are you going to interpret it religious?

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:57.680
You've got that green hair goddess. So I can think of it. We were talking earlier about Motel

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:03.600
of the Mysteries, which a wonderful book where they misinterpret a motel and they've got somebody

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.880
lying in the sacred chamber and they're on the sacred platform and they have the sacred communicator

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.200
looking at the altar. And you realize it's a TV with the remote and he's on the bed.

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.040
Right. And then he's shouting into the toilet, which is the... It makes it this great echoing sound.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.200
Absolutely. And my favorite picture is where she is wearing toothbrushes dangling from her ears

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.200
and she's got the sanitize for your protection around her head and was wearing a toilet seat

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.480
and it's a deliberate recreation of Sophie Schleeman wearing Priam's treasure from Troy.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.920
Absolutely marvelous. So what's the future of archaeology? I mean,

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.960
don't we run out of things to dig up after a while?

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.680
Fortunately, no. There is no shortage. No, there's so much past and there's so much stuff in so many

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.440
places we never run out. Right. We will not run out. There's no such thing as peak antique.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.480
No. There will always be something. The question though on a serious note is,

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.120
how are we going to do archaeology? And that's one of the things I've been wrestling with.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.240
There have been so many advances, for example, just in the last couple of decades. Now we're using

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.240
satellite imagery, right? Sarah Park Act, the space archaeologist, is finding stuff from space.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.320
Some of you may have seen her on Colbert. And drawings that can go right over the

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:34.480
area. Absolutely. Light arc and see through the jungles. So I'm actually getting a bit

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.680
frustrated, to be honest, of digging blind, as I say, where we put a trench down and we're not

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.360
sure if we're going to hit something. So there are ways to look through electromagnetic and

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.080
resistivity and conductivity and things like that. But there's got to be something out there that

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:56.000
can actually tell us more what we're looking for. And I suspect it's there that somebody here in

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.480
Silicon Valley or whatever is already using it. And I just have to talk to the right person who

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:08.800
says basically, oh yeah, we got that. So what can we find, for instance, looking into a mound

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.360
like Megiddo, which has 20 cities, one on top of another? We don't do that anymore. We don't

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.880
stack our cities quite the way we used to do it. No, we do not stack our city, more is the pity.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.120
Yeah. It's going to be a whole future archaeologist. The coastal cities may do that,

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.640
as the sea level rises. Perhaps. But no, but they did it. They stacked them. But I would love to be

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.480
able to, something that would tell me, yes, 20 feet down there is a plaster floor. It should be

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.960
able to be something that would detect the components of plaster. I would think. You don't just drill

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:46.320
on these things. No, you don't. So I think we had a major revolution with these new sensing

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.400
devices. But that was, for the most part, 30 years ago. I think it's time, it's ripe for a new

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.280
revolution. The question is, what's it going to be? Now, the people that were digging in the 60s

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:03.040
could never predict LIDAR or satellite images, at least not the archaeologists. Micro biome

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:09.360
analysis of, you know, what's in the wine jar. Exactly. The organic residue analysis. Absolutely.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.080
So what's it going to be like 30 years from now? Well, that's one reason that we don't do 100%

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.920
excavation of a site. We leave part of the site knowing that the next generation is going to

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.880
either be better than us or have better equipment than us. I've always admired the

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.720
long-term thinking involved in that. Is it actually the case that people do go back and do another

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:39.200
trench? And so there is a sort of a return. Absolutely. The problem is that each time somebody

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.760
else comes, they take away a little bit more. So for instance, Heinrich Schlemann was at Troy

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.680
first, and he actually dug right through the layer that he was looking for and threw it out on his

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.080
back pile. If I had $50,000, I'd go dig through the back pile at Troy, because that's where all the

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:58.720
good stuff is because Schlemann threw it out. So the next person, Dortfeld, had to dig around the

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.560
edges. And then the next person after him, Blagen, had to dig around his edges. And it was only until

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:10.480
Manfred Korfmann got there in 1988 with new technology that he was able to figure out that

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:16.480
what we know of as Troy is just the citadel where the king and his retainers were. There is a lower

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:22.880
city in the plain below that expands the size of the city by 10 or 15 times. Oh boy. Yeah. So that

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:28.960
gets closer to the city we hear about in Homer. Exactly. So now it fits better. But in that

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.320
particular case, had Schlemann realized there was a lower city, I'm sure there'd be nothing there

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:40.960
for anybody else to ask. So there's two things being discovered here. One is more, well,

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.640
better tools to discover more stuff. Probably more archaeologists now alive than there have

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.600
ever been. I would think so, yes. And archaeology is now there's not only more of us, it's more

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:58.960
scientific than it ever was. It's more theory based as well. And it's more both inter and cross

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.840
disciplinary theory in terms of the theory of archaeology, a theory of what's being discovered.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:09.120
Both. Okay. Both, I would say. We're trying to ask bigger questions. We're no longer digging

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.960
just to dig. We're not digging just get Oh, it's a city. Let's see what's there.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:19.520
For example, at Cabri, our Canaanite Palace, we are our larger questions. We're trying to

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.440
investigate the rise of rulership. We're trying to look at the Canaanite economy and try and

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.280
compare palatial versus non palatial. So we're we've actually got bigger questions that the

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:38.960
digging can help us answer. This story continues. They'll keep finding more stuff. And what I

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:44.080
love is you keep finding new stories emerging from the stuff. Thank you for the stories tonight.
