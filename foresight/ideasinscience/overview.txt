1. **Chemical Gradients**: Professor Pace is working with a ceramic foam reactor that creates heat gradients within an open system, suggesting the presence of convection. This design allows for the concentration of organics like quinine from nanomolar to millimolar concentrations in a process that can be turned on and off by adjusting the heat source.

2. **Concentration of Organics**: The reactor has successfully concentrated quinine, demonstrating its ability to increase the concentration of substances in an open system under controlled conditions.

3. **Mimicking ATP**: Pace explored the possibility of acetyl phosphate functioning as an analogue for ATP. This is significant because while ATP and acetyl CoA are not typically associated with early stages of abiogenesis, they could be formed under plausible prebiotic conditions. The synthesis of acetyl phosphate has been demonstrated at neutral pH levels (around pH 7) in the presence of magnesium, suggesting it could be part of an energy-driven process similar to the acetyl CoA pathway.

4. **Phosphorylation**: The system has shown the ability to phosphorylate adenosine into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) under prebiotic conditions, albeit with low yields.

5. **Polymerization of Amino Acids**: Successful polymerization of glycine into di-glycine or its cyclic form, dihydroxy amino acid, has been achieved using acetyl phosphate, indicating the potential for protein-like structures to form under these conditions.

6. **Progress Towards Acetyl CoA Pathway**: The ultimate goal is to replicate the full acetyl CoA pathway starting from simple molecules like hydrogen and CO2. This would involve a series of reactions that include carboxylation and hydrogenation, powered by ATP or its equivalent in an abiotic setting.

7. **Next Steps**: The next steps involve replicating the remaining steps of the acetyl CoA pathway one at a time, ultimately leading to the synthesis of nucleotide bases from amino acids, which is a common process in methanogens.

In summary, Professor Pace's research is focused on demonstrating the potential for prebiotic chemistry to create essential biomolecules, such as ATP analogs and amino acid polymers, under conditions that could be present on early Earth or other environments in the universe. The work involves creating chemical gradients that facilitate the concentration of organic compounds and conducting these reactions one at a time to build up complex molecules from simple starting materials.
