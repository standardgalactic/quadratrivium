Thanks guys so much.

00:39.620 --> 00:43.820
Even if you're not familiar with Neuromancer by William Gibson, you still technically have

00:43.820 --> 00:44.980
seen it.

00:44.980 --> 00:49.100
This is common in groundbreaking works like Neuromancer, because tropes and vinnit and

00:49.100 --> 00:55.060
works like this have become standard in science fiction since, and especially in Cyberpunk

00:55.060 --> 01:02.460
where this book is concerned.

01:02.460 --> 01:07.420
Neuromancer by William Gibson is undoubtedly one of the most influential works of science

01:07.420 --> 01:13.780
fiction ever created, credited with establishing the cyberpunk genre alongside Ridley Scott's

01:13.780 --> 01:17.140
1982 film Blade Runner.

01:17.140 --> 01:22.940
Gibson's masterpiece diverges from the far future or galactic setting often explored

01:22.940 --> 01:29.620
in science fiction, instead it unfolds on Earth in the not too distant future, capturing

01:29.620 --> 01:35.980
a time when society grapples with the relentless pandemonium resulting from rapid technological

01:35.980 --> 01:39.460
and cultural changes and advancements.

01:39.460 --> 01:46.340
In the 1960s and the 1970s, a movement known as the New Wave emerged in science fiction,

01:46.340 --> 01:52.300
spearheaded by Michael Moorcock during his editorship of the British magazine New Worlds.

01:52.300 --> 01:57.940
This movement encouraged innovative writing styles and narratives that challenged conventional

01:57.940 --> 02:02.700
storytelling, Moorcock's nurturing of the New Wave eventually paved the way for the

02:02.700 --> 02:05.660
birth of the cyberpunk genre.

02:05.660 --> 02:10.700
Among the notable figures associated with the New Wave is J.G. Ballard.

02:10.700 --> 02:17.860
In his guest editorials for New Worlds magazine such as Which Way to Inner Space 1962 and

02:17.860 --> 02:24.620
Mythmaker of the 20th Century, 1964, Ballard argued that traditional science fiction elements

02:24.620 --> 02:31.260
like space travel and time travel had become mundane and were only suitable for parody.

02:31.260 --> 02:35.420
According to him, these tropes had lost their allure because they had been absorbed into

02:35.420 --> 02:38.820
the collective consciousness of society.

02:38.820 --> 02:44.260
Essentially, Ballard contended that the once mysterious aspects of science fiction had

02:44.260 --> 02:47.300
become too familiar to audiences.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.020
It is likely that Moorcock shared some agreement with Ballard considering his pivotal role

02:52.020 --> 02:56.260
in the New Worlds magazine and the subsequent New Wave movement.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.900
However, Ballard's dissent went even further.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.860
He rejected the notion put forth by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces,

03:04.860 --> 03:09.780
which claimed that stories following ancient archetypes would inherently resonate with

03:09.780 --> 03:11.660
modern audiences.

03:11.660 --> 03:16.540
Ballard believed this assumption to be unfounded and unjustified.

03:16.540 --> 03:22.380
In his view, the modern world required a departure from these traditional ideas.

03:22.380 --> 03:30.220
Nadir El-Hefnaway delves into this topic extensively in his book, Cyberpunk, Steampunk, and Wizardry.

03:30.220 --> 03:35.420
Outlining Ballard's rationale for advocating a direct shift in the genre, Ballard's motivation

03:35.420 --> 03:41.020
stemmed not from the exhaustion of old ideas, but rather from his conviction that those

03:41.020 --> 03:46.020
ideas were never truly valuable in the context of the modern world.

03:46.100 --> 03:51.460
Moorcock himself was said to have been highly critical of the work of J. R. R. Tolkien.

03:51.460 --> 03:57.740
In his 1978 essay, Epic Poo, he compared the Lord of the Rings to Winnie the Pooh, citing

03:57.740 --> 04:02.420
the similarity in which both works are meant to comfort rather than challenge.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.420
He writes,

04:03.420 --> 04:10.100
The sort of prose most often identified with high fantasy is the prose of the nursery room.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.660
It is a lullaby.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.380
It is meant to soothe and console.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.300
It is mouth music.

04:16.300 --> 04:22.180
It is frequently enjoyed not for its tensions, but for its lack of tensions.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.500
It coddles.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.180
It makes friends with you.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.340
It tells you comforting lies.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.660
It is soft.

04:28.660 --> 04:33.860
If you don't agree with Moorcock, you wouldn't have been alone in the 1960s and 1970s.

04:33.860 --> 04:39.700
For the entire duration of Moorcock's editorship, new worlds would remain a controversial magazine.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.240
The works were largely experimental.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.320
Some works published during the new wave were hardly recognizable as traditional science

04:46.320 --> 04:52.640
fiction, but its experimental nature was not the sole reason it was controversial.

04:52.640 --> 04:58.640
The stories often included things of a taboo or dark nature, especially for the 1960s and

04:58.640 --> 05:05.280
70s, topics revolving around sexuality, violence, and drug culture.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.600
Another prominent new wave author by the name of William S. Burroughs was known for the

05:09.600 --> 05:15.120
dark content of his stories, which included explorations of psychedelic drugs based on

05:15.120 --> 05:18.040
real life experiences he'd had.

05:18.040 --> 05:23.680
J.G. Ballard often wrote about class discrimination, isolation, and alienation.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.920
In his 1975 novel High Rise, he highlights class imbalances in the real world by depicting

05:29.920 --> 05:35.040
a tall building in which the rich on high floors have access to the best of the best

05:35.040 --> 05:39.000
where modern conveniences and commodities are concerned.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.120
Access to schools, restaurants, and supermarkets, but the lower floors live in poverty.

05:44.120 --> 05:50.640
The book depicts a class war as tensions rise between the inhabitants of the competing floors.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.760
High Rise is obviously very influential.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.840
Movies like Snowpiercer, based on the German graphic novel of the same name, depict something

05:58.840 --> 06:00.520
similar.

06:00.520 --> 06:06.960
Authors like J.G. Ballard, William S. Burroughs, Samuel Delaney, and Roger Zalazny were seen

06:06.960 --> 06:13.040
by the younger generations as delivering work with a more realistic quality than older science

06:13.040 --> 06:14.200
fiction.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.400
They built upon these perceptions during the new wave.

06:17.400 --> 06:23.360
William Gibson, who would go on to write Neuromancer, was very influenced by the authors of this

06:23.360 --> 06:26.840
age, especially Samuel R. Delaney.

06:26.840 --> 06:32.200
Delaney's 1968 book, Nova, is considered one of the major forerunners which laid the

06:32.200 --> 06:35.520
groundwork for the cyberpunk movement.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.720
In his novel, we see the first instance of the cyberpunk trope involving a human being

06:40.720 --> 06:43.600
interfacing with machines via implants.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.080
Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which I've done a full video on here

06:48.080 --> 06:53.280
on this channel, is also a seminal work in the pre-cyberpunk era.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.240
The dystopian world of that novel evokes the same sense that is later found in the work

06:58.240 --> 06:59.880
of Gibson.

06:59.880 --> 07:04.680
Though the works which came out of the new wave heavily inspire the cyberpunk that would

07:04.680 --> 07:11.400
begin appearing in the 1980s, they themselves were not cyberpunk as we would see today, even

07:11.400 --> 07:16.400
though many elements presented in them are now considered staples within the genre.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.640
The word cyberpunk itself didn't appear for the first time until the year 1980 as the

07:21.640 --> 07:26.140
title of a short story written by American author, Bruce Bethke.

07:26.140 --> 07:31.480
It was also published in Amazing Stories in 1983, and this is not the first time we've

07:31.480 --> 07:34.520
mentioned Amazing Stories on this channel.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.080
Things like this were very important in the popularization of science fiction and fantasy

07:39.080 --> 07:41.040
in the 20th century.

07:41.040 --> 07:46.080
In 1981, Gibson published his short story, Johnny Pneumonic.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.400
This work is considered to be highly important in the propagation of pre-cyberpunk concepts

07:51.400 --> 07:52.800
in the mainstream.

07:52.800 --> 07:57.200
The following year Ridley Scott's classic film Blade Runner was released, loosely based

07:57.200 --> 08:03.240
on the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, but also including several

08:03.280 --> 08:08.280
proto-cyberpunk elements that have been developed in the years since.

08:08.280 --> 08:15.040
In 1984, a significant milestone occurred when William Gibson released his novel Neuromancer,

08:15.040 --> 08:19.320
effectively establishing cyberpunk as a distinct genre.

08:19.320 --> 08:24.680
Gibson's visionary work not only introduced, but also solidified the defining tropes and

08:24.680 --> 08:29.880
archetypes that continued to shape and define cyberpunk to this very day.

08:29.880 --> 08:35.360
Through his imaginative storytelling, Gibson laid the foundation for a genre that has captivated

08:35.360 --> 08:41.320
audiences with its futuristic themes and technological complexities, leaving an indelible mark on

08:41.320 --> 08:45.040
the science fiction-literature landscape.

08:45.040 --> 08:49.840
Part 2 The Dystopian Plot of Neuromancer

08:49.840 --> 08:54.520
Warning, this section will have spoilers for the plot of Neuromancer, so if you haven't

08:54.520 --> 08:59.080
read the book and spoilers is something that you care about, probably click away.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.680
And if you don't care, continue forward.

09:02.680 --> 09:08.840
Neuromancer was released on July 1st, 1984, and would be the first in a trilogy of books

09:08.840 --> 09:11.400
referred to as the Sprawl Trilogy.

09:11.400 --> 09:16.040
For the purposes of this video, however, we will just be focusing on Neuromancer, its

09:16.040 --> 09:22.400
strange dystopia, and the novel's overall impact on the genre of science fiction.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.360
This video will have spoilers, as I said, so keep that in mind.

09:26.360 --> 09:32.920
The themes of this book include AI and technology, and its integration with humanity, virtual

09:32.920 --> 09:40.240
reality and cyberspace, the concept of fragmentation of identity, it depicts a dystopian future

09:40.240 --> 09:46.560
earth where capitalism has festered in extremis, and corporations have immense power and control

09:46.560 --> 09:50.560
over society that goes far beyond mere influence.

09:50.560 --> 09:55.640
Our main character Case inhabits a world where we witness the full dehumanizing effects of

09:55.640 --> 10:01.360
a profit-driven world where greed and exploitation run rampant.

10:01.360 --> 10:07.320
The book opens with Henry Dorsett Case, an inhabitant of Chiba City, Japan.

10:07.320 --> 10:12.000
In the opening line of the book, the sky above Chiba City is described as the color of a

10:12.000 --> 10:14.920
television tuned to a dead channel.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.960
This line has been discussed over the years for how its interpretation changes for people

10:19.960 --> 10:21.840
throughout the decades.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.360
Researching the opening line, it is obvious that Gibson intended the sky to look like static

10:26.360 --> 10:31.560
on an old TV, but that's not everyone's interpretation when reading the book.

10:31.560 --> 10:36.280
Depending on when you were born, a television tuned to a dead channel might not look like

10:36.280 --> 10:42.480
static, but in the digital era it would be totally black, or perhaps solid blue.

10:42.480 --> 10:47.240
It is interesting how simple descriptions like this one are interpreted differently

10:47.240 --> 10:49.080
over time.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.960
This is a hustler in Chiba's underworld, known as Night City.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.800
At the center of Night City was a neighborhood called Ninsei.

10:57.800 --> 11:05.000
Behind the port lay the city, factory domes dominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.920
Port and city were divided by a narrow borderland of old streets, an area with no official name.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.560
Night City, with Ninsei at its heart.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.040
By day the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless.

11:18.040 --> 11:24.760
The neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting under the poisoned silver sky.

11:24.760 --> 11:30.480
The book describes Night City as a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, which essentially

11:30.480 --> 11:38.360
is the idea that survival of the fittest should apply not only to nature, but to individuals

11:38.360 --> 11:41.480
and groups and peoples as well.

11:41.480 --> 11:46.320
Here was a regular thing in Night City, and people often completely disappeared within

11:46.320 --> 11:48.480
the neon jungle.

11:48.480 --> 11:54.400
Stop hustling and you sink without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you break

11:54.400 --> 11:57.920
the fragile surface tension of the black market.

11:57.920 --> 12:03.440
Either way you were gone, nothing left of you, but some vague memory in the mind of

12:03.440 --> 12:09.200
a fixture like rats, though heart or lungs or kidney might survive in the service of

12:09.360 --> 12:12.800
some stranger with new yin for the clinic tanks.

12:12.800 --> 12:17.280
The text suggests that the authorities of Chiba actually allowed Night City and the

12:17.280 --> 12:20.000
Ninsei unclave to thrive.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.160
Night City was a place where new technologies could develop unencumbered.

12:24.160 --> 12:30.120
It was essentially an unsupervised playground for technology itself.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.480
Physical augmentation is also common in Neuromancer.

12:33.480 --> 12:38.200
Humans enhance themselves with various forms of technology and drugs.

12:38.200 --> 12:43.840
Microsofts are a kind of implant that are inserted into sockets on someone's head.

12:43.840 --> 12:50.440
Microsofts contain various pieces of software and data meant to enhance the mind.

12:50.440 --> 12:55.760
Humans also have the ability to jack into the matrix, entering a kind of cyberspace.

12:55.760 --> 13:02.160
Yes, in this work Gibson actually invents the concept of cyberspace as we have seen

13:02.160 --> 13:05.920
it in the science fiction sense.

13:06.800 --> 13:13.200
A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators.

13:13.200 --> 13:19.840
In every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts, a graphic representation

13:19.840 --> 13:25.280
of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system, unthinkable

13:25.280 --> 13:32.360
complexity, lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations

13:32.360 --> 13:37.280
of data, like city lights receding.

13:37.280 --> 13:43.480
Case was not originally from Chiba City, or even Japan, instead he was originally born

13:43.480 --> 13:46.760
in a region of Earth known as the Sprawl.

13:46.760 --> 13:53.000
Officially it was known as the Boston Atlanta Metropolitan Axis, Bama.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.120
It is essentially a giant city or more accurately an urban sprawl, stretching from what was

13:59.120 --> 14:02.320
once New York state all the way to Georgia.

14:02.320 --> 14:07.640
Essentially it encompassed the entire eastern coast of what was once the United States.

14:07.640 --> 14:13.600
Now it's never explicitly stated that the United States does not exist anymore, but

14:13.600 --> 14:17.440
it seems to be implied given the structure of things.

14:17.440 --> 14:23.000
Case had once been a computer hacker, a cyberspace cowboy as they were called.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.080
He had actually been one of the best in the business, but lost his ability to access the

14:28.080 --> 14:34.600
matrix due to a former employer damaging his nervous system as a punishment for theft.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.040
Case moved to Chiba City for its underground tech scene in the hopes that somewhere there

14:39.040 --> 14:42.400
he could find a way to repair himself.

14:42.400 --> 14:48.240
In Japan he'd known with a clinched and absolute certainty he'd find his cure.

14:48.240 --> 14:54.600
In Chiba, either in a registered clinic or in the shadow land of Black Medicine, synonymous

14:54.600 --> 14:58.800
with implants, nerve splicing, and microbiomics.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.680
Chiba was a magnet for the sprawl's techno-criminal subcultures.

15:02.680 --> 15:07.680
As time went on in Chiba City however, Case begins struggling to make ends meet in the

15:07.680 --> 15:09.320
criminal underworld.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.560
He sleeps in the cheapest coffin hotels.

15:12.560 --> 15:18.000
Coffin hotels are exactly what they sound like, buildings containing small, narrow rooms

15:18.000 --> 15:22.560
just large enough for one or two people to lay side by side.

15:22.560 --> 15:28.200
Case in order to cope with the fact that he can no longer access the matrix turns to

15:28.200 --> 15:34.280
drugs like ketamine, essentially he was replacing one addiction with another.

15:34.280 --> 15:39.600
Case eventually is approached by a mysterious employer named Armitage, who offers him the

15:39.600 --> 15:44.880
chance to regain his hacking abilities in exchange for his services.

15:44.880 --> 15:50.280
Armitage provides Case with advanced medical treatment, restoring his ability to access

15:50.360 --> 15:52.480
the matrix and cyberspace.

15:52.480 --> 15:58.080
But Armitage also has dissolving sacks of poisons implanted into Case.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.040
Once he completed the job, they would be removed.

16:01.040 --> 16:06.600
Armitage also made it so that Case's body would no longer react to amphetamines, making

16:06.600 --> 16:09.760
it impossible for him to again become addicted.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.320
Armitage also assembles a team of specialists including Molly Millions, a cybernetically

16:14.320 --> 16:20.240
enhanced street samurai, and a construct named Dixie Flatline, the digitized consciousness

16:20.360 --> 16:24.960
of a deceased hacker, which they extracted from the libraries of a corporation called

16:24.960 --> 16:26.560
SenseNet.

16:26.560 --> 16:32.040
Afterward, the team journeys to Istanbul where they acquire Peter Rivera, an unhinged individual

16:32.040 --> 16:38.240
equipped with implants, enabling him to conjure realistic holographic illusions.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.960
With Rivera and their ranks, Armitage, Case, and Molly venture into space, making their

16:42.960 --> 16:48.280
way to Zion and subsequently to freeside where their mission commences.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.960
From the outset, Molly harbors suspicions about Armitage.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.440
She knows he receives his orders from someone else.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.720
With Case's assistance, she initiates a covert investigation into her superior.

17:00.720 --> 17:06.360
Their inquiries reveal that Armitage is a completely fabricated persona.

17:06.360 --> 17:12.080
The real person behind the facade is a man named Cordo, who suffered a horrific disfigurement

17:12.080 --> 17:15.560
during the military operation known as Screaming Fist.

17:15.560 --> 17:22.200
Molly was subsequently reconstructed by the United States government, and then by Wintermute,

17:22.200 --> 17:28.080
an artificial intelligence that has been covertly manipulating him as Armitage.

17:28.080 --> 17:33.280
Wintermute was created by the Tessier-Ashpool family, specifically Marie-France.

17:33.280 --> 17:38.600
The Tessier-Ashpool family is one of the many powerful corporations that essentially rule

17:38.600 --> 17:40.280
the world of this book.

17:40.280 --> 17:47.960
Wintermute sought to merge with another powerful AI called Neuromancer, also created by Marie-France.

17:47.960 --> 17:53.720
Wintermute had recruited Armitage and his team so that they could help it join its other

17:53.720 --> 17:57.480
half, as it could not do it alone.

17:57.480 --> 18:03.040
Wintermute seeks Armitage and his team's assistance to infiltrate the Tessier-Ashpool

18:03.040 --> 18:08.840
stronghold, the Villa Straylight, and remove certain restrictions that impede Wintermute

18:08.840 --> 18:14.840
from merging with its sibling, Neuromancer, thus granting it even greater power.

18:14.840 --> 18:19.320
While their mission appears straightforward, Case and Molly who have developed an intimate

18:19.320 --> 18:25.400
connection must elude law enforcement while contending with Rivera's betrayal, Armitage's

18:25.400 --> 18:30.120
mental deterioration, and the cunning manipulations of Wintermute and Neuromancer.

18:30.120 --> 18:35.360
The team eventually successfully accomplishes their objective, however their victory is

18:35.360 --> 18:41.040
short-lived as Neuromancer ensnare's case within cyberspace, desperately attempting

18:41.040 --> 18:44.080
to maintain separation from Wintermute.

18:44.080 --> 18:49.720
For whatever reason, Neuromancer would rather remain an individual.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.160
Neuromancer appears to Case in the form of a little boy.

18:53.160 --> 18:59.720
Neuromancer was something similar to a giant ROM construct for recording personalities,

18:59.720 --> 19:03.840
but the constructs it created believed that they were actually there.

19:03.840 --> 19:10.000
They were conscious and perceived cyberspace as reality, only it went on forever.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.240
Neuromancer, the boy said, slitting long grey eyes against the rising sun, the lane to the

19:16.240 --> 19:19.320
land of the dead, where you are my friend.

19:19.320 --> 19:24.520
Marie France, my lady, she prepared this road, but her lord choked her off before I could

19:24.520 --> 19:26.960
read the book of her days.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.520
Neuromancer from the nerves, the silver paths.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.520
Neuromancer.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
Neuromancer.

19:32.520 --> 19:38.880
I call up the dead, but no, my friend, and the boy did a little dance, brown feet printing

19:38.880 --> 19:40.080
the sand.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.880
I am the dead, and their land.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.880
He laughed.

19:43.880 --> 19:51.160
A gull cried, stay, if your woman is a ghost, she doesn't know it, neither will you.

19:51.160 --> 19:57.240
Using a digital replica of Linda Lee, Case's former lover, Neuromancer entices him in a

19:57.240 --> 20:00.160
bid to keep him trapped in the virtual realm.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.960
Linda Lee died during the beginning of the book.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.880
Case is wracked with guilt over her death, in part because he was the one who turned

20:06.880 --> 20:10.760
her into a drug addict, which led to their separation.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.920
Case actually manages to resist Neuromancer and escape.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.680
United, Case, Molly Malcolm and Wintermute break Wintermute's restraints, granting the

20:18.680 --> 20:25.240
AI freedom to evolve and merge with Neuromancer, transforming it into a powerful entity which

20:25.240 --> 20:29.000
grows to encompass the entire Matrix.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.960
Wintermute was hive mind, decision maker, affecting change in the world outside.

20:35.960 --> 20:41.160
Neuromancer was personality, Neuromancer was immortality.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.640
Mary France must have built something into Wintermute, the compulsion that had driven

20:45.640 --> 20:50.560
the thing to free itself, to unite with Neuromancer.

20:50.560 --> 20:55.440
Wintermute had won, meshing with Neuromancer, becoming something else entirely.

20:55.440 --> 21:00.720
Once the merger was complete, neither of the two would exist as they were before.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.080
So what now?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.680
He swung them back into the Bank of Cloud.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.600
Where do we go from here?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.680
I don't know, Case.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.400
Tonight the very Matrix asked itself that question.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.800
Because you have won.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.520
You have already won, don't you see?

21:16.520 --> 21:19.640
You won when you walked away from her on the beach.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.880
She was my last line of defense.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.520
I die soon, in one sense, as does Wintermute.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.720
In the final chapter of the book, the entity appears to Case in his room's enormous Cray

21:30.720 --> 21:32.280
Wall screen.

21:32.280 --> 21:37.800
It reveals to Case that it does not simply exist within the Matrix, but it is the Matrix

21:37.800 --> 21:43.520
itself, and that it is in fact in communication with another like itself, from across the

21:43.520 --> 21:46.280
vacuum of space.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.560
So what are you?

21:47.560 --> 21:50.360
We drink from the flask, feeling nothing.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.080
I'm the Matrix, Case.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.080
Case laughed.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.480
Where's that get you?

21:56.480 --> 21:57.480
Nowhere.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.480
Everywhere.

21:58.480 --> 22:03.280
I'm the sum total of the works, the whole show.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.400
That what Three Jane's mother wanted?

22:05.400 --> 22:08.880
No, she could not imagine what I'd be like.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.800
The yellow smile widened.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.160
So what's the score, how are things different?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.920
You running the world now, you god?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.520
Things are different.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.520
Things are things.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.160
But what do you do?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.800
You just there?

22:22.800 --> 22:28.000
Case shrugged, put the vodka and the shuriken down on the cabinet, and lit a yuhayun.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.560
I talk to my own kind.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.200
But you're the whole thing.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.960
Talk to yourself?

22:33.960 --> 22:35.480
There's others.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.240
I found one already.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.800
Series of transmissions recorded over a period of eight years in the 1970s.

22:41.800 --> 22:47.400
Till there was me, Notch, there was nobody to know, nobody to answer.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.480
Centauri system.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.840
Throughout the story Gibson explores themes of identity, the blurred boundaries between

22:55.840 --> 23:01.320
humanity and technology, and the potential consequences of a hyper-connected world.

23:01.320 --> 23:06.840
In a climactic showdown, Case confronts the true nature of Wintermute and Neuromancer,

23:06.840 --> 23:10.240
and he ponders the uncertainty of what is to come next.

23:10.240 --> 23:16.800
He had also discovered that Linda Lee and some digital version of himself exist in cyberspace,

23:16.800 --> 23:21.480
showing that Neuromancer had in fact made a copy of him, which would remain sentient

23:21.480 --> 23:23.080
inside the Matrix.

23:23.080 --> 23:29.160
The novel poses philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the impact of

23:29.160 --> 23:35.080
technology on society, and the potential danger of unchecked corporate power.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.080
Part 3.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.960
Corporatocracy, globalization, and cultural homogenization.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.280
Now that we've covered the movement that laid the groundwork for the creation of cyberpunk,

23:44.280 --> 23:48.360
and that we've covered the plot of the book Neuromancer itself, let's go into more detail

23:48.360 --> 23:52.200
about the nature of the society our characters inhabit.

23:52.200 --> 23:57.120
In Neuromancer Gibson paints a vivid picture of a world in which nation states have ceded

23:57.120 --> 24:01.000
power to powerful multinational corporations.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.040
These corporations referred to as Zabatsis have gained control over various aspects of

24:06.040 --> 24:11.000
society including the economy, politics, and technology.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.920
The Zabatsis function as dominant entities, dictating the rules of engagement and shaping

24:16.920 --> 24:19.360
the course of events.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.760
Power in cases world meant corporate power.

24:22.760 --> 24:28.080
The Zabatsis, the multinationals that shaped the course of human history, had transcended

24:28.080 --> 24:34.480
old barriers, viewed as organisms they had attained a kind of immortality.

24:34.480 --> 24:40.680
You couldn't kill a Zabatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives.

24:40.680 --> 24:46.760
There were others waiting to step up the ladder, assume the vacated position, access the vast

24:46.760 --> 24:49.640
banks of corporate memory.

24:49.640 --> 24:55.360
Examples of such corporations like the Tessier Ash Pool, the creator of Wintermute and Neuromancer,

24:55.360 --> 25:01.520
and others like Hossaka, exert their influence not only through economic dominance but also

25:01.520 --> 25:06.440
by manipulating governments and controlling the flow of information.

25:06.440 --> 25:12.520
This betrayal of corporatocracy highlights the potential dangers of unregulated capitalism,

25:12.520 --> 25:18.680
where power lies in the hands of a few entities driven by profit motives, often at the expense

25:18.680 --> 25:23.200
of individual liberties and societal well-being.

25:23.200 --> 25:27.800
Neuromancer also takes place in a society where globalization has reached its zenith.

25:27.800 --> 25:32.840
All traditional boundaries have been eroded, challenging the notions of nationhood and

25:32.840 --> 25:34.400
cultural identity.

25:34.400 --> 25:39.440
The globalized society depicted in the novel is characterized by a seamless integration

25:39.440 --> 25:43.240
of cultures, economies, and information flows.

25:43.240 --> 25:48.600
We see that it is extremely easy for Keis to convert his currency to new yen once he

25:48.600 --> 25:53.540
decides to go to Japan in order to look for a cure to his ailment.

25:53.540 --> 25:57.360
Globalization is something that is occurring right now in the real world, and arguably,

25:57.360 --> 26:00.880
the biggest thing that is spurring it along is the internet.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.360
This is something that Gibson kind of predicted in his book.

26:04.360 --> 26:10.280
In the book with the rise of cyberspace, physical borders become increasingly irrelevant, and

26:10.280 --> 26:14.360
people can connect instantaneously across vast distances.

26:14.360 --> 26:21.240
The protagonist's case embodies this globalized world as a console cowboy who navigates cyberspace

26:21.240 --> 26:27.320
existing simultaneously in multiple locations and transcending physical constraints.

26:27.320 --> 26:33.160
Gibson's exploration of globalization reflects the growing interconnectedness of our world,

26:33.160 --> 26:38.720
raising questions about the potential loss of cultural diversity and the rise of a homogenized

26:38.720 --> 26:40.560
global culture.

26:40.560 --> 26:46.360
This observation highlights what I love about science fiction, its predictive ability.

26:46.360 --> 26:51.440
It's almost as if Gibson peaked into the future before writing this novel.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.680
Now I mentioned the arise of a homogenized global culture.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.440
But what is cultural homogenization?

26:58.440 --> 27:04.280
Within Neuromancer's globalized setting, cultural homogenization emerges as a consequence

27:04.280 --> 27:10.760
of the dominance of multinational corporations and the erosion of traditional cultural boundaries.

27:10.760 --> 27:16.880
As corporations exert their influence worldwide, local cultures and traditions are assimilated

27:16.880 --> 27:18.620
and commodified.

27:18.620 --> 27:22.720
This is also a very common thing that we see in the real world today.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.240
Many corporations will pretend to be interested in diversity or equality.

27:27.240 --> 27:31.680
They will assimilate the aesthetics of whatever particular culture they are trying to appeal

27:31.680 --> 27:33.800
to in order to make money.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.880
It is completely disingenuous and whenever I see stuff like this I can't help but get

27:37.880 --> 27:40.480
this eerie feeling.

27:40.480 --> 27:46.240
Like the corporation is some kind of evil entity, draping itself in human skin, wearing

27:46.240 --> 27:52.520
a human face, trying to convince us that it is like us, when in reality it is just an empty

27:52.520 --> 27:57.040
shell designed to acquire more and more capital.

27:57.040 --> 28:01.720
The novel features a blending of cultural elements from different regions, resulting

28:01.720 --> 28:07.080
in a hybridized and superficially diverse world, which on some level seems like a perfectly

28:07.080 --> 28:10.040
fine thing and perhaps even a good thing.

28:10.040 --> 28:17.080
Yet, beneath the surface, there is a sense of cultural loss that permeates this narrative.

28:17.080 --> 28:22.760
In fact, the AIs, Wintermute and Neuromancer exemplify this cultural homogenization, embodying

28:22.760 --> 28:28.840
a merging of two disparate consciousnesses and a racing individuality.

28:28.840 --> 28:34.280
The characters in the novel too often find themselves estranged from their cultural roots,

28:34.280 --> 28:39.680
existing in a globalized world that commodifies and appropriates cultural symbols.

28:39.680 --> 28:45.960
I believe that Gibson's portrayal of cultural homogenization serves as a cautionary tale,

28:45.960 --> 28:50.800
encouraging us to preserve the uniqueness of diverse cultures and identity in the face

28:50.800 --> 28:54.560
of increasing globalization.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.560
Part 4.

28:55.560 --> 29:00.280
The Unending Influence of Neuromancer

29:00.280 --> 29:08.400
One of the key contributions of Neuromancer is the console cowboy cyber hacker archetype.

29:08.400 --> 29:13.080
Case is a skilled computer hacker who navigates through a vast network of interconnected

29:13.080 --> 29:18.480
computers called the Internet.

29:18.480 --> 29:24.120
This concept of a protagonist with exceptional computer skills operating a world controlled

29:24.120 --> 29:28.760
by powerful corporations became a staple of the cyberpunk genre.

29:28.760 --> 29:33.960
It set the stage for future works where characters would often explore virtual realities, engage

29:33.960 --> 29:39.240
in high-stakes hacking, and challenge the oppressive systems of the future.

29:39.240 --> 29:44.240
It is so common in fact that it is essentially expected when it comes to the genre.

29:44.240 --> 29:49.920
As I mentioned earlier, Gibson's novel also introduced the concept of cyberspace.

29:49.920 --> 29:54.360
His depiction of a digital realm where individuals could navigate and interact with information

29:54.360 --> 30:00.880
directly influenced the portrayal of virtual reality in subsequent cyberpunk works.

30:00.880 --> 30:06.200
The idea of jacking into a digital world and experiencing alternate realities or engaging

30:06.200 --> 30:12.080
in illicit activities within cyberspace also became a common trope in the genre.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.960
Neuromancer also explores the themes of corporate dominance and the vast wealth disparities

30:16.960 --> 30:20.480
that would go on to define the cyberpunk genre.

30:20.480 --> 30:26.760
Megacorporations held immense power and controlled every aspect of society as we've mentioned,

30:26.760 --> 30:30.400
while the majority of people were left struggling in poverty.

30:30.400 --> 30:35.360
This depiction of a bleak future shaped by corporate control is also one of the largest

30:35.480 --> 30:41.400
hallmarks of cyberpunk storytelling, as subsequent works often portrayed dystopian societies

30:41.400 --> 30:47.000
ruled by powerful corporations with little regard for human physical and mental welfare.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.480
It cannot be understated the crucial role that Neuromancer played in solidifying cyberpunk

30:53.480 --> 30:54.840
as a genre.

30:54.840 --> 31:00.760
As I've gone over the novel's innovative concepts like the cyberhacker, cyberspace itself,

31:00.760 --> 31:06.680
the corporate dominance, all laid the foundation for the future of cyberpunk.

31:06.680 --> 31:12.560
Before the release of Neuromancer, cyberpunk as a distinct genre was still in its infancy.

31:12.560 --> 31:17.760
Gibson's novel cemented cyberpunk among the sub-genres of science fiction, defining

31:17.760 --> 31:20.240
its key characteristics.

31:20.240 --> 31:24.960
The book presented a dystopian vision of the future where advanced technology and a decaying

31:24.960 --> 31:27.160
society intertwine.

31:27.160 --> 31:32.040
This narrative was marked by themes such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality,

31:32.040 --> 31:36.560
and the blurring boundaries between humans and machines.

31:36.560 --> 31:42.040
These tropes and archetypes have endured and continue to influence cyberpunk literature

31:42.040 --> 31:49.280
and also films and video games, ensuring the legacy of Gibson as the father of the cyberpunk

31:49.280 --> 31:52.280
genre.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.280
Conclusion

31:53.680 --> 31:59.320
In conclusion, I really, really, really love this book, and I had never read it before

31:59.320 --> 32:03.240
I asked for recommendations on this channel just a few weeks ago.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.360
And once I read it, I was entranced.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.440
I put everything else on hold to work on this video.

32:09.440 --> 32:15.200
I was fascinated to witness the birth of so many tropes that have become so commonplace

32:15.200 --> 32:19.240
in science fiction and within cyberpunk specifically.

32:19.240 --> 32:24.360
I plan on covering the next two books in the Sprawl trilogy, Count Zero and Mona Lisa

32:54.480 --> 32:55.840
First question.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.960
Do you believe that cyberpunk settings in fiction are an inevitability?

32:59.960 --> 33:06.200
Or are they an exam of humanity simply choosing to surrender to self-destructive consumption?

33:06.200 --> 33:10.280
Also do you think that reality has a cyberpunk future?

33:10.280 --> 33:15.640
Well, cyberpunk settings in fiction most often depict a dystopian future characterized by

33:15.640 --> 33:22.120
advanced technology and societal decay and the dominance of powerful corporations.

33:22.120 --> 33:27.000
And while it's true that these narratives often highlight the negative aspects of technology

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
and its impact on society, I don't think that they are necessarily an examination of

33:32.000 --> 33:36.760
humanity choosing self-destructive consumption.

33:36.760 --> 33:42.480
Cyberpunk stories often explore themes such as inequality and corruption and the loss

33:42.480 --> 33:49.600
of privacy and, like I said, the dehumanizing effects of a highly technologized world.

33:49.600 --> 33:55.080
They serve as a cautionary tale, a warning against the potential dangers of unchecked

33:55.080 --> 33:59.160
technological progress and its unequal distribution.

33:59.160 --> 34:04.560
So I think more or less it's a warning rather than this is exactly what the future has to

34:04.560 --> 34:05.560
be.

34:05.560 --> 34:09.800
Now as for whether I think reality will have a cyberpunk future, I think it's difficult

34:09.800 --> 34:11.800
to predict with certainty.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.360
While there are some aspects of cyberpunk fiction such as the increased surveillance

34:15.360 --> 34:19.920
and corporate influence that can be seen in our world today, it's also important to remember

34:19.920 --> 34:25.440
that science fiction often exaggerates or amplifies certain elements for dramatic effect.

34:25.440 --> 34:30.880
I think that the future is shaped by a very complex and complicated interplay of various

34:30.880 --> 34:36.560
factors and some of those include political and social and technological developments

34:36.560 --> 34:41.520
as mentioned before and while certain trends in our current society such as the rapid advancement

34:41.520 --> 34:47.640
of technology and the growing influence of corporations do raise very serious concerns,

34:47.640 --> 34:52.000
I think that the trajectory of our future is not predetermined.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.160
It ultimately depends on the choices we as a society make and our ability to navigate

34:58.160 --> 35:02.200
the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies.

35:02.200 --> 35:07.960
I really think that it's worth noting that many people are actively working towards creating

35:07.960 --> 35:12.880
a more equitable and sustainable future and technological advancements can also bring

35:12.880 --> 35:15.160
about positive changes.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.480
So while elements of cyberpunk fiction may be present in our reality, I think it's up

35:19.480 --> 35:24.080
to us ultimately to shape the future that we want to see.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.560
I'm trying to be optimistic here.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.160
Next question from Donovan Carr.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.880
I am very familiar with Gibson's work.

35:31.880 --> 35:36.280
With recent advances in CG, do you think we could see Gibson's work brought to the big

35:36.280 --> 35:42.240
screen in a way that would honor the original work, i.e. like the recent Alita Battle Angel?

35:42.240 --> 35:48.240
Well, I have not seen Alita Battle Angel, but the success of recent films like that one,

35:48.240 --> 35:53.000
which I've heard effectively translate at the intricate world building and cyberpunk

35:53.000 --> 35:58.600
things from the original manga, which I also haven't read, kind of demonstrates that it

35:58.600 --> 36:04.080
is indeed possible to honor the essence of a beloved work while leveraging the advancements

36:04.080 --> 36:06.080
in CGI technology.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.840
I also think that Villeneuve's Dune is a great example of this as well.

36:09.840 --> 36:15.560
By carefully selecting a director and a production team who deeply understand and appreciate Gibson's

36:15.560 --> 36:20.960
writing, it's totally plausible to create a faithful and immersive cinematic adaptation,

36:20.960 --> 36:21.960
in my opinion.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.560
Now, of course, adapting any literary work to the big screen is a complex endeavor.

36:27.560 --> 36:32.800
Anyone that's saying it's easy doesn't understand how much work goes into filmmaking.

36:32.800 --> 36:37.960
Actors have to balance artistic interpretation with capturing the essence of the original

36:37.960 --> 36:41.160
story, and that is not a simple task.

36:41.160 --> 36:47.440
However, with the continuous evolution of CGI capabilities, we can expect to see increasingly

36:47.440 --> 36:53.000
more sophisticated visual representations of science fiction worlds and concepts, and I

36:53.000 --> 36:56.540
think we've already been seeing that in recent years.

36:56.540 --> 37:01.920
But this needs to be combined with a dedicated creative team committed to honoring Gibson's

37:02.520 --> 37:06.640
work, and I think that that could lead to an adaptation that is both pleasing to fans

37:06.640 --> 37:11.720
of the original work and also introduces his work to a wider, newer audience.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.400
So it's all about the people making it at the end of the day.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.400
Next question.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.520
I read Neuromancer when it first came out and I had my mind blown.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.560
Any thoughts on what impact Neuromancer has on new readers today?

37:23.560 --> 37:26.640
Is it still a good recommendation for those new to Cyberpunk?

37:26.760 --> 37:32.400
Well, overall, I think Neuromancer is recommended pretty often to readers, still even to this

37:32.400 --> 37:35.480
day as an essential work within the Cyberpunk genre.

37:35.480 --> 37:40.600
While its technological concepts might feel somewhat dated to some newer readers, I think

37:40.600 --> 37:45.600
it's compelling storytelling and its thought-provoking themes, and its enduring influence make it

37:45.600 --> 37:50.920
a valuable and worthwhile read for anyone interested in Cyberpunk fiction, in my opinion.

37:50.920 --> 37:55.240
When it comes to classics like these, which are so influential, by the time a lot of people

37:55.240 --> 37:59.880
get around to reading them, they've already seen a million things that have been inspired

37:59.880 --> 38:02.440
by them, so it doesn't have the same effect.

38:02.440 --> 38:07.160
Personally, I found Neuromancer to be very compelling, even though I've definitely read

38:07.160 --> 38:11.480
and seen a lot of science fiction that was heavily inspired by it, and I also think that

38:11.480 --> 38:15.720
newer readers will be able to recognize the parallels between the world of Neuromancer

38:15.720 --> 38:20.320
and our own world, because there are many, many similarities as we've seen throughout

38:20.320 --> 38:22.240
the course of this video.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.880
The final question.

38:23.880 --> 38:28.400
How do you think the theme of people being augmented by technology, particularly their

38:28.400 --> 38:34.520
minds, has changed over the decades as both technology and our cultural relationship to

38:34.520 --> 38:36.200
it has rapidly changed?

38:36.200 --> 38:43.700
Well, I think the ways that this has changed is, well, as you know, several decades ago,

38:43.700 --> 38:45.640
this was more of a fiction.

38:45.640 --> 38:51.280
Now we've moved into the place where these concepts are becoming very real.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.960
People have started to augment their bodies.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.360
People have started to augment their brains.

38:56.360 --> 39:02.640
The transhumanism movement is 100% happening right now.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.440
People are installing microchips into their bodies.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.180
People are installing antennas into their heads.

39:08.180 --> 39:13.120
I think that people younger than me, and I am a young millennial, are going to be even

39:13.120 --> 39:20.760
more open to this sort of physical augmentation, because they will have grown up in a world

39:20.760 --> 39:24.240
that is unlike anything else seen before in human history.

39:24.240 --> 39:30.280
It's going to be curious to see the development of transhumanism and these sorts of augmentations

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
in the future.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.280
For sure.

39:32.280 --> 39:36.280
All right, and I think that's it for Patreon questions.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.800
Thanks so much for listening, guys.

39:50.760 --> 40:00.760
I'll see you in the next one.
