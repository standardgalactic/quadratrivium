Thanks guys so much.

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,820
Even if you're not familiar with Neuromancer by William Gibson, you still technically have

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,980
seen it.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,100
This is common in groundbreaking works like Neuromancer, because tropes and vinnit and

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,060
works like this have become standard in science fiction since, and especially in Cyberpunk

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:02,460
where this book is concerned.

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,420
Neuromancer by William Gibson is undoubtedly one of the most influential works of science

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,780
fiction ever created, credited with establishing the cyberpunk genre alongside Ridley Scott's

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,140
1982 film Blade Runner.

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,940
Gibson's masterpiece diverges from the far future or galactic setting often explored

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,620
in science fiction, instead it unfolds on Earth in the not too distant future, capturing

17
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,980
a time when society grapples with the relentless pandemonium resulting from rapid technological

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,460
and cultural changes and advancements.

19
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,340
In the 1960s and the 1970s, a movement known as the New Wave emerged in science fiction,

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,300
spearheaded by Michael Moorcock during his editorship of the British magazine New Worlds.

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,940
This movement encouraged innovative writing styles and narratives that challenged conventional

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,700
storytelling, Moorcock's nurturing of the New Wave eventually paved the way for the

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,660
birth of the cyberpunk genre.

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,700
Among the notable figures associated with the New Wave is J.G. Ballard.

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,860
In his guest editorials for New Worlds magazine such as Which Way to Inner Space 1962 and

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,620
Mythmaker of the 20th Century, 1964, Ballard argued that traditional science fiction elements

27
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,260
like space travel and time travel had become mundane and were only suitable for parody.

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,420
According to him, these tropes had lost their allure because they had been absorbed into

29
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,820
the collective consciousness of society.

30
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,260
Essentially, Ballard contended that the once mysterious aspects of science fiction had

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,300
become too familiar to audiences.

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,020
It is likely that Moorcock shared some agreement with Ballard considering his pivotal role

33
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,260
in the New Worlds magazine and the subsequent New Wave movement.

34
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,900
However, Ballard's dissent went even further.

35
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,860
He rejected the notion put forth by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces,

36
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,780
which claimed that stories following ancient archetypes would inherently resonate with

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,660
modern audiences.

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,540
Ballard believed this assumption to be unfounded and unjustified.

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,380
In his view, the modern world required a departure from these traditional ideas.

40
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,220
Nadir El-Hefnaway delves into this topic extensively in his book, Cyberpunk, Steampunk, and Wizardry.

41
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,420
Outlining Ballard's rationale for advocating a direct shift in the genre, Ballard's motivation

42
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,020
stemmed not from the exhaustion of old ideas, but rather from his conviction that those

43
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,020
ideas were never truly valuable in the context of the modern world.

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,460
Moorcock himself was said to have been highly critical of the work of J. R. R. Tolkien.

45
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,740
In his 1978 essay, Epic Poo, he compared the Lord of the Rings to Winnie the Pooh, citing

46
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,420
the similarity in which both works are meant to comfort rather than challenge.

47
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
He writes,

48
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,100
The sort of prose most often identified with high fantasy is the prose of the nursery room.

49
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,660
It is a lullaby.

50
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,380
It is meant to soothe and console.

51
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,300
It is mouth music.

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,180
It is frequently enjoyed not for its tensions, but for its lack of tensions.

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,500
It coddles.

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,180
It makes friends with you.

55
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,340
It tells you comforting lies.

56
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,660
It is soft.

57
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,860
If you don't agree with Moorcock, you wouldn't have been alone in the 1960s and 1970s.

58
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,700
For the entire duration of Moorcock's editorship, new worlds would remain a controversial magazine.

59
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,240
The works were largely experimental.

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
Some works published during the new wave were hardly recognizable as traditional science

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,640
fiction, but its experimental nature was not the sole reason it was controversial.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
The stories often included things of a taboo or dark nature, especially for the 1960s and

63
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,280
70s, topics revolving around sexuality, violence, and drug culture.

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Another prominent new wave author by the name of William S. Burroughs was known for the

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,120
dark content of his stories, which included explorations of psychedelic drugs based on

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,040
real life experiences he'd had.

67
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,680
J.G. Ballard often wrote about class discrimination, isolation, and alienation.

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,920
In his 1975 novel High Rise, he highlights class imbalances in the real world by depicting

69
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,040
a tall building in which the rich on high floors have access to the best of the best

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,000
where modern conveniences and commodities are concerned.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,120
Access to schools, restaurants, and supermarkets, but the lower floors live in poverty.

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,640
The book depicts a class war as tensions rise between the inhabitants of the competing floors.

73
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,760
High Rise is obviously very influential.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,840
Movies like Snowpiercer, based on the German graphic novel of the same name, depict something

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,520
similar.

76
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,960
Authors like J.G. Ballard, William S. Burroughs, Samuel Delaney, and Roger Zalazny were seen

77
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,040
by the younger generations as delivering work with a more realistic quality than older science

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,200
fiction.

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,400
They built upon these perceptions during the new wave.

80
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,360
William Gibson, who would go on to write Neuromancer, was very influenced by the authors of this

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,840
age, especially Samuel R. Delaney.

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,200
Delaney's 1968 book, Nova, is considered one of the major forerunners which laid the

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,520
groundwork for the cyberpunk movement.

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,720
In his novel, we see the first instance of the cyberpunk trope involving a human being

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,600
interfacing with machines via implants.

86
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,080
Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which I've done a full video on here

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,280
on this channel, is also a seminal work in the pre-cyberpunk era.

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,240
The dystopian world of that novel evokes the same sense that is later found in the work

89
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,880
of Gibson.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Though the works which came out of the new wave heavily inspire the cyberpunk that would

91
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,400
begin appearing in the 1980s, they themselves were not cyberpunk as we would see today, even

92
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,400
though many elements presented in them are now considered staples within the genre.

93
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,640
The word cyberpunk itself didn't appear for the first time until the year 1980 as the

94
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,140
title of a short story written by American author, Bruce Bethke.

95
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,480
It was also published in Amazing Stories in 1983, and this is not the first time we've

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,520
mentioned Amazing Stories on this channel.

97
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Things like this were very important in the popularization of science fiction and fantasy

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
in the 20th century.

99
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,080
In 1981, Gibson published his short story, Johnny Pneumonic.

100
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,400
This work is considered to be highly important in the propagation of pre-cyberpunk concepts

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
in the mainstream.

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,200
The following year Ridley Scott's classic film Blade Runner was released, loosely based

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,240
on the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, but also including several

104
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,280
proto-cyberpunk elements that have been developed in the years since.

105
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,040
In 1984, a significant milestone occurred when William Gibson released his novel Neuromancer,

106
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,320
effectively establishing cyberpunk as a distinct genre.

107
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,680
Gibson's visionary work not only introduced, but also solidified the defining tropes and

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,880
archetypes that continued to shape and define cyberpunk to this very day.

109
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,360
Through his imaginative storytelling, Gibson laid the foundation for a genre that has captivated

110
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,320
audiences with its futuristic themes and technological complexities, leaving an indelible mark on

111
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,040
the science fiction-literature landscape.

112
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Part 2 The Dystopian Plot of Neuromancer

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,520
Warning, this section will have spoilers for the plot of Neuromancer, so if you haven't

114
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,080
read the book and spoilers is something that you care about, probably click away.

115
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,680
And if you don't care, continue forward.

116
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,840
Neuromancer was released on July 1st, 1984, and would be the first in a trilogy of books

117
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,400
referred to as the Sprawl Trilogy.

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,040
For the purposes of this video, however, we will just be focusing on Neuromancer, its

119
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,400
strange dystopia, and the novel's overall impact on the genre of science fiction.

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,360
This video will have spoilers, as I said, so keep that in mind.

121
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,920
The themes of this book include AI and technology, and its integration with humanity, virtual

122
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,240
reality and cyberspace, the concept of fragmentation of identity, it depicts a dystopian future

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,560
earth where capitalism has festered in extremis, and corporations have immense power and control

124
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
over society that goes far beyond mere influence.

125
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,640
Our main character Case inhabits a world where we witness the full dehumanizing effects of

126
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,360
a profit-driven world where greed and exploitation run rampant.

127
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,320
The book opens with Henry Dorsett Case, an inhabitant of Chiba City, Japan.

128
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,000
In the opening line of the book, the sky above Chiba City is described as the color of a

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,920
television tuned to a dead channel.

130
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,960
This line has been discussed over the years for how its interpretation changes for people

131
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,840
throughout the decades.

132
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,360
Researching the opening line, it is obvious that Gibson intended the sky to look like static

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,560
on an old TV, but that's not everyone's interpretation when reading the book.

134
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,280
Depending on when you were born, a television tuned to a dead channel might not look like

135
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,480
static, but in the digital era it would be totally black, or perhaps solid blue.

136
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,240
It is interesting how simple descriptions like this one are interpreted differently

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
over time.

138
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,960
This is a hustler in Chiba's underworld, known as Night City.

139
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,800
At the center of Night City was a neighborhood called Ninsei.

140
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Behind the port lay the city, factory domes dominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies.

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,920
Port and city were divided by a narrow borderland of old streets, an area with no official name.

142
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,560
Night City, with Ninsei at its heart.

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,040
By day the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless.

144
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,760
The neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting under the poisoned silver sky.

145
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,480
The book describes Night City as a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, which essentially

146
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:38,360
is the idea that survival of the fittest should apply not only to nature, but to individuals

147
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
and groups and peoples as well.

148
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,320
Here was a regular thing in Night City, and people often completely disappeared within

149
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
the neon jungle.

150
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,400
Stop hustling and you sink without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you break

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,920
the fragile surface tension of the black market.

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,440
Either way you were gone, nothing left of you, but some vague memory in the mind of

153
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,200
a fixture like rats, though heart or lungs or kidney might survive in the service of

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
some stranger with new yin for the clinic tanks.

155
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,280
The text suggests that the authorities of Chiba actually allowed Night City and the

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,000
Ninsei unclave to thrive.

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,160
Night City was a place where new technologies could develop unencumbered.

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,120
It was essentially an unsupervised playground for technology itself.

159
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,480
Physical augmentation is also common in Neuromancer.

160
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,200
Humans enhance themselves with various forms of technology and drugs.

161
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Microsofts are a kind of implant that are inserted into sockets on someone's head.

162
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,440
Microsofts contain various pieces of software and data meant to enhance the mind.

163
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,760
Humans also have the ability to jack into the matrix, entering a kind of cyberspace.

164
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Yes, in this work Gibson actually invents the concept of cyberspace as we have seen

165
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,920
it in the science fiction sense.

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,200
A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators.

167
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,840
In every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts, a graphic representation

168
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,280
of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system, unthinkable

169
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,360
complexity, lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations

170
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,280
of data, like city lights receding.

171
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,480
Case was not originally from Chiba City, or even Japan, instead he was originally born

172
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,760
in a region of Earth known as the Sprawl.

173
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,000
Officially it was known as the Boston Atlanta Metropolitan Axis, Bama.

174
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,120
It is essentially a giant city or more accurately an urban sprawl, stretching from what was

175
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
once New York state all the way to Georgia.

176
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,640
Essentially it encompassed the entire eastern coast of what was once the United States.

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,600
Now it's never explicitly stated that the United States does not exist anymore, but

178
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
it seems to be implied given the structure of things.

179
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,000
Case had once been a computer hacker, a cyberspace cowboy as they were called.

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,080
He had actually been one of the best in the business, but lost his ability to access the

181
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,600
matrix due to a former employer damaging his nervous system as a punishment for theft.

182
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,040
Case moved to Chiba City for its underground tech scene in the hopes that somewhere there

183
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,400
he could find a way to repair himself.

184
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,240
In Japan he'd known with a clinched and absolute certainty he'd find his cure.

185
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,600
In Chiba, either in a registered clinic or in the shadow land of Black Medicine, synonymous

186
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
with implants, nerve splicing, and microbiomics.

187
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Chiba was a magnet for the sprawl's techno-criminal subcultures.

188
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,680
As time went on in Chiba City however, Case begins struggling to make ends meet in the

189
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,320
criminal underworld.

190
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,560
He sleeps in the cheapest coffin hotels.

191
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,000
Coffin hotels are exactly what they sound like, buildings containing small, narrow rooms

192
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,560
just large enough for one or two people to lay side by side.

193
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,200
Case in order to cope with the fact that he can no longer access the matrix turns to

194
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,280
drugs like ketamine, essentially he was replacing one addiction with another.

195
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,600
Case eventually is approached by a mysterious employer named Armitage, who offers him the

196
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,880
chance to regain his hacking abilities in exchange for his services.

197
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,280
Armitage provides Case with advanced medical treatment, restoring his ability to access

198
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,480
the matrix and cyberspace.

199
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,080
But Armitage also has dissolving sacks of poisons implanted into Case.

200
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,040
Once he completed the job, they would be removed.

201
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,600
Armitage also made it so that Case's body would no longer react to amphetamines, making

202
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,760
it impossible for him to again become addicted.

203
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,320
Armitage also assembles a team of specialists including Molly Millions, a cybernetically

204
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,240
enhanced street samurai, and a construct named Dixie Flatline, the digitized consciousness

205
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,960
of a deceased hacker, which they extracted from the libraries of a corporation called

206
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,560
SenseNet.

207
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,040
Afterward, the team journeys to Istanbul where they acquire Peter Rivera, an unhinged individual

208
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,240
equipped with implants, enabling him to conjure realistic holographic illusions.

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,960
With Rivera and their ranks, Armitage, Case, and Molly venture into space, making their

210
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,280
way to Zion and subsequently to freeside where their mission commences.

211
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,960
From the outset, Molly harbors suspicions about Armitage.

212
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,440
She knows he receives his orders from someone else.

213
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
With Case's assistance, she initiates a covert investigation into her superior.

214
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,360
Their inquiries reveal that Armitage is a completely fabricated persona.

215
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,080
The real person behind the facade is a man named Cordo, who suffered a horrific disfigurement

216
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,560
during the military operation known as Screaming Fist.

217
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,200
Molly was subsequently reconstructed by the United States government, and then by Wintermute,

218
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,080
an artificial intelligence that has been covertly manipulating him as Armitage.

219
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,280
Wintermute was created by the Tessier-Ashpool family, specifically Marie-France.

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,600
The Tessier-Ashpool family is one of the many powerful corporations that essentially rule

221
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,280
the world of this book.

222
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:47,960
Wintermute sought to merge with another powerful AI called Neuromancer, also created by Marie-France.

223
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,720
Wintermute had recruited Armitage and his team so that they could help it join its other

224
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,480
half, as it could not do it alone.

225
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,040
Wintermute seeks Armitage and his team's assistance to infiltrate the Tessier-Ashpool

226
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,840
stronghold, the Villa Straylight, and remove certain restrictions that impede Wintermute

227
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,840
from merging with its sibling, Neuromancer, thus granting it even greater power.

228
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,320
While their mission appears straightforward, Case and Molly who have developed an intimate

229
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,400
connection must elude law enforcement while contending with Rivera's betrayal, Armitage's

230
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,120
mental deterioration, and the cunning manipulations of Wintermute and Neuromancer.

231
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,360
The team eventually successfully accomplishes their objective, however their victory is

232
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,040
short-lived as Neuromancer ensnare's case within cyberspace, desperately attempting

233
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,080
to maintain separation from Wintermute.

234
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,720
For whatever reason, Neuromancer would rather remain an individual.

235
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,160
Neuromancer appears to Case in the form of a little boy.

236
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,720
Neuromancer was something similar to a giant ROM construct for recording personalities,

237
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,840
but the constructs it created believed that they were actually there.

238
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,000
They were conscious and perceived cyberspace as reality, only it went on forever.

239
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Neuromancer, the boy said, slitting long grey eyes against the rising sun, the lane to the

240
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,320
land of the dead, where you are my friend.

241
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,520
Marie France, my lady, she prepared this road, but her lord choked her off before I could

242
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,960
read the book of her days.

243
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,520
Neuromancer from the nerves, the silver paths.

244
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Neuromancer.

245
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Neuromancer.

246
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,880
I call up the dead, but no, my friend, and the boy did a little dance, brown feet printing

247
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
the sand.

248
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
I am the dead, and their land.

249
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
He laughed.

250
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,160
A gull cried, stay, if your woman is a ghost, she doesn't know it, neither will you.

251
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,240
Using a digital replica of Linda Lee, Case's former lover, Neuromancer entices him in a

252
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,160
bid to keep him trapped in the virtual realm.

253
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,960
Linda Lee died during the beginning of the book.

254
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
Case is wracked with guilt over her death, in part because he was the one who turned

255
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,760
her into a drug addict, which led to their separation.

256
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,920
Case actually manages to resist Neuromancer and escape.

257
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,680
United, Case, Molly Malcolm and Wintermute break Wintermute's restraints, granting the

258
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,240
AI freedom to evolve and merge with Neuromancer, transforming it into a powerful entity which

259
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,000
grows to encompass the entire Matrix.

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Wintermute was hive mind, decision maker, affecting change in the world outside.

261
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Neuromancer was personality, Neuromancer was immortality.

262
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,640
Mary France must have built something into Wintermute, the compulsion that had driven

263
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,560
the thing to free itself, to unite with Neuromancer.

264
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,440
Wintermute had won, meshing with Neuromancer, becoming something else entirely.

265
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,720
Once the merger was complete, neither of the two would exist as they were before.

266
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
So what now?

267
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,680
He swung them back into the Bank of Cloud.

268
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,600
Where do we go from here?

269
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,680
I don't know, Case.

270
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,400
Tonight the very Matrix asked itself that question.

271
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
Because you have won.

272
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,520
You have already won, don't you see?

273
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,640
You won when you walked away from her on the beach.

274
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
She was my last line of defense.

275
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,520
I die soon, in one sense, as does Wintermute.

276
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,720
In the final chapter of the book, the entity appears to Case in his room's enormous Cray

277
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,280
Wall screen.

278
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,800
It reveals to Case that it does not simply exist within the Matrix, but it is the Matrix

279
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,520
itself, and that it is in fact in communication with another like itself, from across the

280
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,280
vacuum of space.

281
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
So what are you?

282
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,360
We drink from the flask, feeling nothing.

283
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm the Matrix, Case.

284
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Case laughed.

285
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,480
Where's that get you?

286
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Nowhere.

287
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Everywhere.

288
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm the sum total of the works, the whole show.

289
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,400
That what Three Jane's mother wanted?

290
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,880
No, she could not imagine what I'd be like.

291
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,800
The yellow smile widened.

292
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,160
So what's the score, how are things different?

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,920
You running the world now, you god?

294
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,520
Things are different.

295
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Things are things.

296
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,160
But what do you do?

297
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
You just there?

298
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,000
Case shrugged, put the vodka and the shuriken down on the cabinet, and lit a yuhayun.

299
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,560
I talk to my own kind.

300
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,200
But you're the whole thing.

301
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,960
Talk to yourself?

302
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,480
There's others.

303
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,240
I found one already.

304
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,800
Series of transmissions recorded over a period of eight years in the 1970s.

305
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,400
Till there was me, Notch, there was nobody to know, nobody to answer.

306
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,480
Centauri system.

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,840
Throughout the story Gibson explores themes of identity, the blurred boundaries between

308
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,320
humanity and technology, and the potential consequences of a hyper-connected world.

309
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,840
In a climactic showdown, Case confronts the true nature of Wintermute and Neuromancer,

310
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
and he ponders the uncertainty of what is to come next.

311
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,800
He had also discovered that Linda Lee and some digital version of himself exist in cyberspace,

312
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,480
showing that Neuromancer had in fact made a copy of him, which would remain sentient

313
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
inside the Matrix.

314
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,160
The novel poses philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the impact of

315
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,080
technology on society, and the potential danger of unchecked corporate power.

316
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Part 3.

317
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,960
Corporatocracy, globalization, and cultural homogenization.

318
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,280
Now that we've covered the movement that laid the groundwork for the creation of cyberpunk,

319
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,360
and that we've covered the plot of the book Neuromancer itself, let's go into more detail

320
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,200
about the nature of the society our characters inhabit.

321
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,120
In Neuromancer Gibson paints a vivid picture of a world in which nation states have ceded

322
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,000
power to powerful multinational corporations.

323
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,040
These corporations referred to as Zabatsis have gained control over various aspects of

324
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,000
society including the economy, politics, and technology.

325
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,920
The Zabatsis function as dominant entities, dictating the rules of engagement and shaping

326
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,360
the course of events.

327
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,760
Power in cases world meant corporate power.

328
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,080
The Zabatsis, the multinationals that shaped the course of human history, had transcended

329
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,480
old barriers, viewed as organisms they had attained a kind of immortality.

330
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,680
You couldn't kill a Zabatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives.

331
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,760
There were others waiting to step up the ladder, assume the vacated position, access the vast

332
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,640
banks of corporate memory.

333
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,360
Examples of such corporations like the Tessier Ash Pool, the creator of Wintermute and Neuromancer,

334
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,520
and others like Hossaka, exert their influence not only through economic dominance but also

335
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,440
by manipulating governments and controlling the flow of information.

336
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,520
This betrayal of corporatocracy highlights the potential dangers of unregulated capitalism,

337
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,680
where power lies in the hands of a few entities driven by profit motives, often at the expense

338
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,200
of individual liberties and societal well-being.

339
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Neuromancer also takes place in a society where globalization has reached its zenith.

340
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,840
All traditional boundaries have been eroded, challenging the notions of nationhood and

341
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,400
cultural identity.

342
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,440
The globalized society depicted in the novel is characterized by a seamless integration

343
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,240
of cultures, economies, and information flows.

344
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,600
We see that it is extremely easy for Keis to convert his currency to new yen once he

345
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,540
decides to go to Japan in order to look for a cure to his ailment.

346
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,360
Globalization is something that is occurring right now in the real world, and arguably,

347
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,880
the biggest thing that is spurring it along is the internet.

348
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,360
This is something that Gibson kind of predicted in his book.

349
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,280
In the book with the rise of cyberspace, physical borders become increasingly irrelevant, and

350
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,360
people can connect instantaneously across vast distances.

351
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,240
The protagonist's case embodies this globalized world as a console cowboy who navigates cyberspace

352
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,320
existing simultaneously in multiple locations and transcending physical constraints.

353
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,160
Gibson's exploration of globalization reflects the growing interconnectedness of our world,

354
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,720
raising questions about the potential loss of cultural diversity and the rise of a homogenized

355
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,560
global culture.

356
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,360
This observation highlights what I love about science fiction, its predictive ability.

357
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,440
It's almost as if Gibson peaked into the future before writing this novel.

358
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,680
Now I mentioned the arise of a homogenized global culture.

359
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,440
But what is cultural homogenization?

360
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,280
Within Neuromancer's globalized setting, cultural homogenization emerges as a consequence

361
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,760
of the dominance of multinational corporations and the erosion of traditional cultural boundaries.

362
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,880
As corporations exert their influence worldwide, local cultures and traditions are assimilated

363
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,620
and commodified.

364
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,720
This is also a very common thing that we see in the real world today.

365
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,240
Many corporations will pretend to be interested in diversity or equality.

366
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,680
They will assimilate the aesthetics of whatever particular culture they are trying to appeal

367
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,800
to in order to make money.

368
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,880
It is completely disingenuous and whenever I see stuff like this I can't help but get

369
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,480
this eerie feeling.

370
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,240
Like the corporation is some kind of evil entity, draping itself in human skin, wearing

371
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,520
a human face, trying to convince us that it is like us, when in reality it is just an empty

372
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,040
shell designed to acquire more and more capital.

373
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,720
The novel features a blending of cultural elements from different regions, resulting

374
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,080
in a hybridized and superficially diverse world, which on some level seems like a perfectly

375
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,040
fine thing and perhaps even a good thing.

376
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:17,080
Yet, beneath the surface, there is a sense of cultural loss that permeates this narrative.

377
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,760
In fact, the AIs, Wintermute and Neuromancer exemplify this cultural homogenization, embodying

378
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,840
a merging of two disparate consciousnesses and a racing individuality.

379
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,280
The characters in the novel too often find themselves estranged from their cultural roots,

380
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,680
existing in a globalized world that commodifies and appropriates cultural symbols.

381
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,960
I believe that Gibson's portrayal of cultural homogenization serves as a cautionary tale,

382
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,800
encouraging us to preserve the uniqueness of diverse cultures and identity in the face

383
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,560
of increasing globalization.

384
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Part 4.

385
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,280
The Unending Influence of Neuromancer

386
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:08,400
One of the key contributions of Neuromancer is the console cowboy cyber hacker archetype.

387
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,080
Case is a skilled computer hacker who navigates through a vast network of interconnected

388
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,480
computers called the Internet.

389
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,120
This concept of a protagonist with exceptional computer skills operating a world controlled

390
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,760
by powerful corporations became a staple of the cyberpunk genre.

391
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,960
It set the stage for future works where characters would often explore virtual realities, engage

392
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,240
in high-stakes hacking, and challenge the oppressive systems of the future.

393
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,240
It is so common in fact that it is essentially expected when it comes to the genre.

394
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,920
As I mentioned earlier, Gibson's novel also introduced the concept of cyberspace.

395
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,360
His depiction of a digital realm where individuals could navigate and interact with information

396
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,880
directly influenced the portrayal of virtual reality in subsequent cyberpunk works.

397
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,200
The idea of jacking into a digital world and experiencing alternate realities or engaging

398
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,080
in illicit activities within cyberspace also became a common trope in the genre.

399
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
Neuromancer also explores the themes of corporate dominance and the vast wealth disparities

400
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,480
that would go on to define the cyberpunk genre.

401
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,760
Megacorporations held immense power and controlled every aspect of society as we've mentioned,

402
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,400
while the majority of people were left struggling in poverty.

403
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,360
This depiction of a bleak future shaped by corporate control is also one of the largest

404
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,400
hallmarks of cyberpunk storytelling, as subsequent works often portrayed dystopian societies

405
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,000
ruled by powerful corporations with little regard for human physical and mental welfare.

406
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,480
It cannot be understated the crucial role that Neuromancer played in solidifying cyberpunk

407
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,840
as a genre.

408
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,760
As I've gone over the novel's innovative concepts like the cyberhacker, cyberspace itself,

409
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,680
the corporate dominance, all laid the foundation for the future of cyberpunk.

410
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,560
Before the release of Neuromancer, cyberpunk as a distinct genre was still in its infancy.

411
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,760
Gibson's novel cemented cyberpunk among the sub-genres of science fiction, defining

412
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,240
its key characteristics.

413
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,960
The book presented a dystopian vision of the future where advanced technology and a decaying

414
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,160
society intertwine.

415
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,040
This narrative was marked by themes such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality,

416
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,560
and the blurring boundaries between humans and machines.

417
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,040
These tropes and archetypes have endured and continue to influence cyberpunk literature

418
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,280
and also films and video games, ensuring the legacy of Gibson as the father of the cyberpunk

419
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
genre.

420
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Conclusion

421
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,320
In conclusion, I really, really, really love this book, and I had never read it before

422
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,240
I asked for recommendations on this channel just a few weeks ago.

423
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,360
And once I read it, I was entranced.

424
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,440
I put everything else on hold to work on this video.

425
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,200
I was fascinated to witness the birth of so many tropes that have become so commonplace

426
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,240
in science fiction and within cyberpunk specifically.

427
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,360
I plan on covering the next two books in the Sprawl trilogy, Count Zero and Mona Lisa

428
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,880
Overdrive.

429

436
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,840
First question.

437
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,960
Do you believe that cyberpunk settings in fiction are an inevitability?

438
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Or are they an exam of humanity simply choosing to surrender to self-destructive consumption?

439
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,280
Also do you think that reality has a cyberpunk future?

440
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,640
Well, cyberpunk settings in fiction most often depict a dystopian future characterized by

441
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,120
advanced technology and societal decay and the dominance of powerful corporations.

442
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,000
And while it's true that these narratives often highlight the negative aspects of technology

443
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and its impact on society, I don't think that they are necessarily an examination of

444
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,760
humanity choosing self-destructive consumption.

445
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,480
Cyberpunk stories often explore themes such as inequality and corruption and the loss

446
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,600
of privacy and, like I said, the dehumanizing effects of a highly technologized world.

447
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,080
They serve as a cautionary tale, a warning against the potential dangers of unchecked

448
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,160
technological progress and its unequal distribution.

449
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,560
So I think more or less it's a warning rather than this is exactly what the future has to

450
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
be.

451
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,800
Now as for whether I think reality will have a cyberpunk future, I think it's difficult

452
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
to predict with certainty.

453
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,360
While there are some aspects of cyberpunk fiction such as the increased surveillance

454
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,920
and corporate influence that can be seen in our world today, it's also important to remember

455
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,440
that science fiction often exaggerates or amplifies certain elements for dramatic effect.

456
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,880
I think that the future is shaped by a very complex and complicated interplay of various

457
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,560
factors and some of those include political and social and technological developments

458
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,520
as mentioned before and while certain trends in our current society such as the rapid advancement

459
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,640
of technology and the growing influence of corporations do raise very serious concerns,

460
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,000
I think that the trajectory of our future is not predetermined.

461
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,160
It ultimately depends on the choices we as a society make and our ability to navigate

462
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,200
the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies.

463
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,960
I really think that it's worth noting that many people are actively working towards creating

464
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,880
a more equitable and sustainable future and technological advancements can also bring

465
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,160
about positive changes.

466
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,480
So while elements of cyberpunk fiction may be present in our reality, I think it's up

467
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,080
to us ultimately to shape the future that we want to see.

468
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,560
I'm trying to be optimistic here.

469
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,160
Next question from Donovan Carr.

470
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,880
I am very familiar with Gibson's work.

471
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,280
With recent advances in CG, do you think we could see Gibson's work brought to the big

472
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,240
screen in a way that would honor the original work, i.e. like the recent Alita Battle Angel?

473
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Well, I have not seen Alita Battle Angel, but the success of recent films like that one,

474
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,000
which I've heard effectively translate at the intricate world building and cyberpunk

475
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,600
things from the original manga, which I also haven't read, kind of demonstrates that it

476
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,080
is indeed possible to honor the essence of a beloved work while leveraging the advancements

477
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
in CGI technology.

478
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,840
I also think that Villeneuve's Dune is a great example of this as well.

479
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,560
By carefully selecting a director and a production team who deeply understand and appreciate Gibson's

480
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,960
writing, it's totally plausible to create a faithful and immersive cinematic adaptation,

481
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
in my opinion.

482
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,560
Now, of course, adapting any literary work to the big screen is a complex endeavor.

483
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,800
Anyone that's saying it's easy doesn't understand how much work goes into filmmaking.

484
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,960
Actors have to balance artistic interpretation with capturing the essence of the original

485
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,160
story, and that is not a simple task.

486
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,440
However, with the continuous evolution of CGI capabilities, we can expect to see increasingly

487
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,000
more sophisticated visual representations of science fiction worlds and concepts, and I

488
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,540
think we've already been seeing that in recent years.

489
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,920
But this needs to be combined with a dedicated creative team committed to honoring Gibson's

490
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,640
work, and I think that that could lead to an adaptation that is both pleasing to fans

491
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,720
of the original work and also introduces his work to a wider, newer audience.

492
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,400
So it's all about the people making it at the end of the day.

493
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Next question.

494
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,520
I read Neuromancer when it first came out and I had my mind blown.

495
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,560
Any thoughts on what impact Neuromancer has on new readers today?

496
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,640
Is it still a good recommendation for those new to Cyberpunk?

497
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,400
Well, overall, I think Neuromancer is recommended pretty often to readers, still even to this

498
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,480
day as an essential work within the Cyberpunk genre.

499
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,600
While its technological concepts might feel somewhat dated to some newer readers, I think

500
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,600
it's compelling storytelling and its thought-provoking themes, and its enduring influence make it

501
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,920
a valuable and worthwhile read for anyone interested in Cyberpunk fiction, in my opinion.

502
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,240
When it comes to classics like these, which are so influential, by the time a lot of people

503
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,880
get around to reading them, they've already seen a million things that have been inspired

504
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,440
by them, so it doesn't have the same effect.

505
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,160
Personally, I found Neuromancer to be very compelling, even though I've definitely read

506
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,480
and seen a lot of science fiction that was heavily inspired by it, and I also think that

507
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,720
newer readers will be able to recognize the parallels between the world of Neuromancer

508
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,320
and our own world, because there are many, many similarities as we've seen throughout

509
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,240
the course of this video.

510
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,880
The final question.

511
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,400
How do you think the theme of people being augmented by technology, particularly their

512
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,520
minds, has changed over the decades as both technology and our cultural relationship to

513
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,200
it has rapidly changed?

514
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,700
Well, I think the ways that this has changed is, well, as you know, several decades ago,

515
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,640
this was more of a fiction.

516
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,280
Now we've moved into the place where these concepts are becoming very real.

517
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,960
People have started to augment their bodies.

518
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,360
People have started to augment their brains.

519
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,640
The transhumanism movement is 100% happening right now.

520
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,440
People are installing microchips into their bodies.

521
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,180
People are installing antennas into their heads.

522
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:13,120
I think that people younger than me, and I am a young millennial, are going to be even

523
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,760
more open to this sort of physical augmentation, because they will have grown up in a world

524
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,240
that is unlike anything else seen before in human history.

525
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,280
It's going to be curious to see the development of transhumanism and these sorts of augmentations

526
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
in the future.

527
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
For sure.

528
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,280
All right, and I think that's it for Patreon questions.

529
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,800
Thanks so much for listening, guys.

530
00:39:50,760 --> 00:40:00,760
I'll see you in the next one.
