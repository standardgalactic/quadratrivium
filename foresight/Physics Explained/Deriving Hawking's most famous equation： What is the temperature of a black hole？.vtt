00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a black hole is a region of

00:05.160 --> 00:09.240
space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

00:09.240 --> 00:14.040
The boundary of this region is known as the event horizon of the black hole, and

00:14.040 --> 00:18.960
according to classical relativity, once an object has passed the event horizon,

00:18.960 --> 00:23.720
it will never be able to escape the clutches of the black hole. However, when

00:23.720 --> 00:28.040
you throw quantum mechanics into the mix, as is often the case, the situation

00:28.040 --> 00:34.600
becomes a bit more subtle. In fact, in 1974, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that by

00:34.600 --> 00:39.080
combining certain elements of quantum field theory with general relativity, it

00:39.080 --> 00:43.760
was possible to show that black holes do in fact radiate, causing them to slowly

00:43.760 --> 00:48.960
evaporate and eventually disappear. Now, I don't know about you, but when I first

00:48.960 --> 00:53.400
read about black holes as a child, I was instantly hooked and desperately wanted

00:53.400 --> 00:57.480
to find out more. The only problem is that the physics of black holes, and in

00:57.480 --> 01:01.520
particular Hawking's work, is notoriously difficult and requires an

01:01.520 --> 01:05.480
advanced knowledge of Einstein's theory of general relativity, as well as quantum

01:05.480 --> 01:09.320
field theory. But is it possible to determine the most exciting and

01:09.320 --> 01:13.360
mysterious properties of black holes using only advanced high school

01:13.360 --> 01:18.360
mathematics? Well, it turns out the answer is yes, and in this short video, I'd like

01:18.360 --> 01:23.480
to show you how. In fact, our strategy is quite simple. We are essentially going to

01:23.480 --> 01:26.720
guess the structure of the black hole equations without doing the full

01:26.720 --> 01:30.720
calculation, using a handy technique known as dimensional analysis.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.360
Dimensional analysis is perhaps the most valuable tool in a theoretical

01:35.360 --> 01:39.920
physicist's toolkit, as it allows you to construct equations without doing any of

01:39.920 --> 01:44.720
the hard work, and as you will see, it's remarkably successful. So how does it work?

01:44.720 --> 01:49.200
Well, the first thing to appreciate is that an equation in physics simply

01:49.200 --> 01:53.480
represents a relationship between physical properties, and a measurable

01:53.480 --> 01:58.480
physical property is referred to as a dimension. In what follows, we will focus

01:58.480 --> 02:03.880
on the basic dimensions of length, time, mass, and temperature, which we will

02:03.880 --> 02:08.920
signify with the letters L, T, M, and theta. To understand what I mean by

02:08.920 --> 02:13.920
dimensional analysis, let's look at a simple example. The great thing about

02:13.920 --> 02:18.160
physics equations is that they provide a relationship between the dimensions of

02:18.160 --> 02:22.720
the properties appearing in the equation. For example, consider the equation

02:22.720 --> 02:27.680
speed equals distance divided by time. To determine the dimensions of speed, we

02:27.680 --> 02:31.880
simply refer to the defining equation, which tells us that the dimension of

02:31.880 --> 02:37.200
speed is equal to the dimension of length divided by time. Square brackets are

02:37.200 --> 02:41.440
used to signify that we are interested in the dimension of the quantity inside

02:41.440 --> 02:45.920
the bracket. Now, it turns out that some physics equations are special, in the

02:45.920 --> 02:50.960
sense that they contain what are known as fundamental constants. A fundamental

02:50.960 --> 02:55.840
constant is a physical quantity that is believed to be universal in nature and

02:55.840 --> 03:01.160
constant in time. The most famous example being the speed of light, which appears

03:01.160 --> 03:06.560
in the famous equation equals mc2. This equation allows us to calculate the mass

03:06.560 --> 03:12.480
energy of an object if we know its mass. The speed of light, c, is a fundamental

03:12.520 --> 03:18.000
constant that tells us the exchange rate between mass and energy. Since c refers

03:18.000 --> 03:24.040
to a speed, the dimensions of c can be written as c equals l over t. We also

03:24.040 --> 03:28.640
note that we can use the equation equals mc2 to determine the dimensions of

03:28.640 --> 03:33.880
energy, which can be written as ml squared over t squared. Let's now use this

03:33.880 --> 03:38.280
dimensional information to explore some of the other fundamental constants that

03:38.280 --> 03:43.440
will prove crucial to our understanding of black holes. Firstly, consider the

03:43.440 --> 03:47.040
gravitational potential energy that exists due to the relative position of

03:47.040 --> 03:51.880
two or more masses. If two masses are separated by a distance r, then the

03:51.880 --> 03:56.560
gravitational potential energy can be calculated using the equation e equals

03:56.560 --> 04:02.760
minus g big m little m over r, where g is Newton's gravitational constant. By

04:02.760 --> 04:06.560
rearranging this equation and inserting the dimensions of energy that we

04:06.560 --> 04:12.640
calculated previously, we find that the units of g are equal to l cubed over mt

04:12.640 --> 04:18.120
squared. Next, consider the famous quantum energy relation e equals h bar

04:18.120 --> 04:22.560
omega, which relates the energy of a quantum of light to the frequency of the

04:22.560 --> 04:27.800
light. Here, h bar is the reduced Planck's constant. In order to determine the

04:27.800 --> 04:32.280
dimensions of h bar, we simply rearrange the energy equation, and since

04:32.280 --> 04:36.960
frequency has dimensions of inverse time, we see that the dimensions of h bar

04:36.960 --> 04:42.560
is ml squared over t. The final fundamental constant that we'll be

04:42.560 --> 04:46.880
concerned with relates to the field of thermodynamics, and more specifically

04:46.880 --> 04:51.800
systems of large numbers of particles. According to the kinetic theory of gases,

04:51.800 --> 04:57.480
for a system of n particles at temperature t, such as an ideal gas, the

04:57.480 --> 05:01.560
thermal energy is related to the temperature by the equation e equals

05:01.560 --> 05:08.120
three over two n kt, where k is Boltzmann's constant. By rearranging this

05:08.120 --> 05:12.000
equation for Boltzmann's constant, we see that the dimensions of Boltzmann's

05:12.000 --> 05:18.600
constant is given by ml squared over theta t squared. Having laid the necessary

05:18.600 --> 05:22.680
foundations, we're now in a position to start building equations using the

05:22.680 --> 05:26.280
fundamental constants as our building blocks. The rules of the game are as

05:26.280 --> 05:31.120
follows. When using dimensional analysis to construct equations, we should include

05:31.120 --> 05:36.120
the speed of light c when things are moving fast or involve light. We should

05:36.120 --> 05:40.680
include the gravitational constant g when things are massive. We should include

05:40.680 --> 05:44.360
Planck's constant when dealing with quantum systems, and we should include

05:44.360 --> 05:49.280
Boltzmann's constant when things are hot. It sounds simple, so let's get started.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.360
Our objective is to uncover the properties of black holes using

05:53.360 --> 05:58.080
dimensional analysis. The good news is that our task is made significantly

05:58.080 --> 06:03.160
easier because of a famous theorem known as the no-hair theorem. The no-hair

06:03.160 --> 06:06.960
theorem states that all black hole solutions in general relativity can be

06:06.960 --> 06:12.200
completely characterized by only three externally observable classical parameters

06:12.200 --> 06:18.520
mass, electric charge and angular momentum. All other information, for which

06:18.520 --> 06:23.280
hair is a metaphor about the matter that formed the black hole, disappears behind

06:23.280 --> 06:27.640
the black hole event horizon and is therefore permanently inaccessible to

06:27.640 --> 06:32.800
external observers. In what follows, we will focus on a special class of black

06:32.800 --> 06:37.360
holes known as Schwarzschild black holes, which have neither electric charge nor

06:37.360 --> 06:41.560
angular momentum, and therefore a Schwarzschild black hole is completely

06:41.560 --> 06:46.200
characterized by its mass. Armed with the no-hair theorem and dimensional

06:46.200 --> 06:51.120
analysis, we are now in a position to answer the following question. What is the

06:51.120 --> 06:57.840
area of the event horizon of a black hole? Well firstly, black holes are

06:57.840 --> 07:01.880
clearly massive objects and so our equation should include Newton's

07:01.880 --> 07:06.120
gravitational constant g along with the characteristic mass of the black hole

07:06.120 --> 07:11.000
m. Furthermore, we know that a black hole is a region of spacetime where

07:11.000 --> 07:15.520
gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape and so we should

07:15.520 --> 07:20.400
expect the speed of light to feature in our equation. Our strategy is to write

07:20.400 --> 07:25.960
the area of the event horizon as a equals g to the power alpha times c to the

07:25.960 --> 07:30.920
power beta times m to the power gamma and then we will use dimensional analysis

07:30.920 --> 07:36.880
to determine alpha, beta and gamma. So let's do that. To fix alpha, beta and gamma,

07:36.880 --> 07:41.640
we simply need to match the dimensions on either side of this expression. The

07:41.640 --> 07:46.040
left hand side represents an area which has dimensions of length squared. For the

07:46.040 --> 07:50.000
right hand side, we need to insert the dimensions of g and c that we

07:50.000 --> 07:56.040
calculated earlier. If we do that then we find the following green expression. We

07:56.040 --> 08:00.200
can then use the law of exponents to gather terms and simplify this expression

08:00.200 --> 08:05.120
in which case we find the following. Now since the dimensions on both sides of

08:05.120 --> 08:09.200
the equation need to match, this places a set of constraints on alpha, beta and

08:09.200 --> 08:13.800
gamma. To make this clear, we can imagine writing the left hand side in an

08:13.800 --> 08:19.240
equivalent form as follows. We can do this because any quantity raised to the

08:19.280 --> 08:24.880
power of 0 is simply equal to 1. If we then match up the exponents of L, T and

08:24.880 --> 08:29.560
m, we find a set of three simultaneous equations which can be solved by

08:29.560 --> 08:34.280
substitution. After a little bit of algebra, we find that alpha equals 2,

08:34.280 --> 08:39.640
beta equals minus 4 and gamma equals 2. If we then sub these values into our

08:39.640 --> 08:43.880
original expression, we find that the area of the event horizon of a black

08:43.960 --> 08:50.320
hole is proportional to g squared m squared divided by c to the power of 4. In

08:50.320 --> 08:54.800
other words, the area of the event horizon will increase as more mass falls

08:54.800 --> 08:59.280
into the black hole. More specifically, we see that if the mass of our black hole

08:59.280 --> 09:04.520
doubles, then the area of the event horizon will quadruple. And so we begin

09:04.520 --> 09:08.840
to see the power of dimensional analysis. Although we don't know the exact

09:08.840 --> 09:12.520
value of the proportionality constant appearing in the mass area expression,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.640
dimensional analysis does allow us to determine the structure of the

09:16.640 --> 09:21.640
relationship. And often this is the most important part of an equation. It's

09:21.640 --> 09:25.200
interesting to note that a detailed calculation of the black hole event

09:25.200 --> 09:29.760
horizon yields the following exact expression. And we see that the structure

09:29.760 --> 09:34.000
of this expression does indeed match the one derived using dimensional analysis.

09:34.760 --> 09:39.040
So why is this mass area relationship important? And what is it telling us

09:39.040 --> 09:43.480
about black holes? Well, the first thing to appreciate is that from a classical

09:43.480 --> 09:47.720
point of view, nothing can ever escape from inside the event horizon of a black

09:47.720 --> 09:52.520
hole. And therefore, in all physical processes, the area of the event horizon

09:52.520 --> 09:57.720
can only ever increase. It can never decrease. Now, the idea that there exists

09:57.720 --> 10:01.920
a quantity that can only ever increase with time might remind you of the second

10:01.920 --> 10:06.760
law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system must

10:06.800 --> 10:11.560
increase with time. Because entropy is such an important concept, and a key

10:11.560 --> 10:15.880
part of our analysis of black holes, it's worth taking a short detour to

10:15.880 --> 10:20.800
understand the concept in a bit more detail. The concept of thermodynamic

10:20.800 --> 10:25.160
entropy was first introduced into gas dynamics by the German physicist

10:25.160 --> 10:30.200
Rudolf Klausius. Klausius had introduced the concept to describe the flow of

10:30.200 --> 10:35.320
heat. He originally defined the change in entropy of a system as the heat

10:35.320 --> 10:39.040
energy it absorbed divided by the temperature at which it absorbed the

10:39.040 --> 10:43.640
heat. The remarkable discovery of Klausius was that because heat always

10:43.640 --> 10:48.080
moves from high temperature regions to low temperature regions, the total

10:48.080 --> 10:52.160
change in entropy summed over all the parts of the system that were exchanging

10:52.160 --> 10:56.680
heat with one another was always positive. The entropy was always

10:56.680 --> 11:03.040
increasing. But why is this true? Although Klausius had successfully

11:03.080 --> 11:07.360
introduced a mathematical definition of entropy, he was unable to provide a

11:07.360 --> 11:11.640
fundamental explanation of why the second law of thermodynamics was true.

11:12.200 --> 11:18.720
However, in 1877, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann provided a beautiful

11:18.720 --> 11:23.200
explanation of entropy in terms of the microscopic components of a physical

11:23.200 --> 11:27.600
system. According to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system is simply

11:27.600 --> 11:32.160
characterized by the number of ways of rearranging the microscopic components

11:32.160 --> 11:36.560
of the system in such a way that some macroscopic feature, such as the pressure

11:36.560 --> 11:41.440
or temperature, remains unchanged. This statement is encoded in Boltzmann's

11:41.440 --> 11:46.160
famous entropy law, which can be found etched into his gravestone. According

11:46.160 --> 11:50.400
to Boltzmann's definition, the entropy of a system is equal to Boltzmann's

11:50.400 --> 11:55.240
constant multiplied by the logarithm of W, where W is the number of

11:55.240 --> 12:00.200
microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. To make this a bit

12:00.200 --> 12:04.400
clearer, imagine the bottom of a box is completely covered with red and green

12:04.400 --> 12:09.360
marbles. Now imagine that you arrange the marbles so that the left half is green

12:09.360 --> 12:14.040
and the right half is red. This corresponds to a particular appearance or

12:14.040 --> 12:20.120
macrostate of the system. Let's label this macrostate as the split state. If we

12:20.120 --> 12:24.160
then shook the box of marbles so that the two sets of marbles became thoroughly

12:24.160 --> 12:28.320
mixed together, we would see a random arrangement of the marbles, which we

12:28.320 --> 12:33.480
might label as a mixed macrostate. If we then shook the box again, we would get

12:33.480 --> 12:37.760
a different arrangement of the marbles, but we would still label the macrostate

12:37.760 --> 12:42.680
of the system as being mixed. In fact, there are a huge number of marble

12:42.680 --> 12:48.000
configurations or microstates corresponding to a mixed macrostate. On

12:48.000 --> 12:51.400
the other hand, there are clearly fewer ways for the marbles to arrange

12:51.400 --> 12:56.400
themselves into the neatly separated split state. Boltzmann's great insight

12:56.400 --> 13:01.320
was to realize that he could define the entropy as the number of microstates

13:01.320 --> 13:06.960
corresponding to a particular macrostate. Fewer microstates corresponds to lower

13:06.960 --> 13:12.080
entropy and therefore more order in the system. So what has this got to do with

13:12.080 --> 13:16.960
black holes? Well, you can think of a black hole as a universal waste basket

13:16.960 --> 13:21.720
that swallows up information as matter falls inside. Since a black hole refuses

13:21.720 --> 13:26.320
to tell us what has fallen inside, we can view a black hole as a system that

13:26.360 --> 13:32.080
has the same external state for lots of possible internal states. This suggests

13:32.080 --> 13:37.080
that the black hole may have a very large entropy value. But exactly how large?

13:37.080 --> 13:41.560
Well, we've already uncovered the first clue when we discovered that the area of

13:41.560 --> 13:47.280
the horizon of the black hole always increases when mass falls inside. In

13:47.280 --> 13:52.880
1972, Jacob Beckenstein, an Israeli physicist, proposed that it does indeed

13:52.920 --> 13:57.120
make sense to assign an entropy to a black hole. And furthermore, that the

13:57.120 --> 14:01.920
entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. In other

14:01.920 --> 14:06.800
words, Beckenstein suggested that it should be possible to write s equals eta

14:06.800 --> 14:12.080
times a, where eta is a constant of proportionality. So how might we determine

14:12.080 --> 14:16.800
eta? Well, the first thing we need to do is determine the dimensions of entropy,

14:17.120 --> 14:21.120
since this will then allow us to figure out the dimensions of eta. To do this,

14:21.360 --> 14:25.960
we refer back to the thermodynamic definition of entropy, ds equals dq

14:25.960 --> 14:30.720
over t, which tells us that entropy has dimensions of energy divided by

14:30.720 --> 14:35.520
temperature. And so we find that entropy has dimensions of ml squared t to the

14:35.520 --> 14:40.760
minus two theta to the minus one. We can then use this to determine the

14:40.760 --> 14:45.720
dimensions of eta, since eta is equal to the entropy divided by the area. And so

14:45.720 --> 14:50.480
we see that the dimensions of eta must be mt to the minus two theta to the minus

14:50.560 --> 14:55.760
one. Furthermore, we know that eta is a constant, and therefore eta must be

14:55.760 --> 15:00.320
constructed from quantities which are themselves constant in time. And this

15:00.320 --> 15:04.880
provides a strong hint that eta can be built using the fundamental constants

15:04.880 --> 15:08.960
we encountered earlier. But which constant shall we use in our

15:08.960 --> 15:13.840
dimensional analysis? Well, this is where we need to make an educated guess.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.880
Firstly, we are dealing with gravity in black holes, and so we should expect

15:18.880 --> 15:23.840
the gravitational constant and speed of light to be involved. Furthermore, since

15:23.840 --> 15:28.240
we are trying to construct an equation for entropy, and entropy is connected to

15:28.240 --> 15:33.280
thermodynamics, it makes sense to include Boltzmann's constant. And finally,

15:33.280 --> 15:38.640
following the suggestion of Beckenstein in his original 1972 paper, we should also

15:38.640 --> 15:44.480
include Planck's constant. As Beckenstein himself commented, we need not be alarmed

15:44.480 --> 15:48.160
at the appearance of H-bar in the expression for black hole entropy. It is

15:48.160 --> 15:52.240
as well known that H-bar also appears in the equations for entropy of many

15:52.240 --> 15:56.720
thermodynamic systems that are conventionally regarded as classical. For

15:56.720 --> 16:02.160
example, the Boltzmann ideal gas. This is a reflection of the fact that entropy is,

16:02.160 --> 16:07.120
in a sense, a count of states of the system, and the underlying states of any

16:07.120 --> 16:12.320
system are always quantum in nature. And so, following in the footsteps of

16:12.320 --> 16:16.560
Beckenstein, we will propose that eta can be written as g to the alpha,

16:16.560 --> 16:23.440
H-bar to the beta, c to the gamma times k to the delta. So, how do we determine alpha,

16:23.440 --> 16:28.400
beta, gamma and delta? Well, as we've already seen, we simply need to apply the

16:28.400 --> 16:34.480
rules of dimensional analysis. So let's do that. Firstly, we have already calculated

16:34.480 --> 16:39.520
the dimensions of eta from the definition of thermodynamic entropy. Secondly,

16:39.520 --> 16:45.680
we know that the combined dimensions of g, H-bar, c and k must match these. If we

16:45.680 --> 16:50.320
substitute the dimensions we calculated earlier for the fundamental constants,

16:50.320 --> 16:54.640
then we find the following yellow expression. If we then use the law of

16:54.640 --> 16:59.040
exponents to gather appropriate terms together, we can write this expression

16:59.040 --> 17:04.640
in the following form. Just like before, we can then match exponents on either side

17:04.640 --> 17:10.080
of the equation to form a set of simultaneous equations. If we do this,

17:10.080 --> 17:14.560
then we find the following set of constraints. We can then solve this set of

17:14.560 --> 17:18.960
simultaneous equations by substitution, and we find that alpha and beta equal

17:18.960 --> 17:24.640
minus one, gamma equals three, and delta equals one. If we then substitute these

17:24.640 --> 17:29.200
expressions back into the original equation proposed by Beckenstein, we find that,

17:29.200 --> 17:34.240
up to an undetermined numerical factor, the entropy of a black hole is proportional

17:34.240 --> 17:40.480
to the following expression. In 1974, using a subtle and sophisticated

17:40.480 --> 17:45.600
combination of general relativity and quantum field theory, Stephen Hawking was able to show

17:45.600 --> 17:50.960
that the exact form of the entropy equation includes a numerical factor of exactly one

17:50.960 --> 17:58.240
quarter, and so the modern-day expression for black hole entropy is written as s equals k c cubed

17:58.240 --> 18:04.640
over four h-bar g times the area of the event horizon. One of the most immediately

18:04.640 --> 18:09.440
striking aspects of this expression is that the entropy of a black hole is going to be

18:09.440 --> 18:15.680
incredibly large, since the equation contains a factor of c cubed in the numerator and both

18:15.680 --> 18:21.200
Planck's constant and Newton's gravitational constant in the denominator. So what is causing

18:21.200 --> 18:27.280
this large entropy value? Well, according to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system relates to

18:27.280 --> 18:32.640
the number of possible microstates of the system. So if we apply this to black holes,

18:32.640 --> 18:36.560
it suggests that black holes should have some kind of microstructure,

18:36.560 --> 18:42.320
which we can use to count states. Furthermore, the presence of both Newton's gravitational

18:42.320 --> 18:48.400
constant and Planck's constant in the entropy equation suggests that these black hole microstates

18:48.400 --> 18:51.520
might have something to do with the quantum theory of gravity.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.480
We will return to these interesting observations towards the end of this video,

18:56.480 --> 19:02.080
but for now, we wish to use the entropy equation to understand one of the most exciting predictions

19:02.080 --> 19:10.640
of 20th century physics, Hawking radiation. In 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered a remarkable

19:10.640 --> 19:16.560
fact about the universe. Black holes glow, emitting faint radiation, causing them to

19:16.560 --> 19:21.680
eventually evaporate and disappear. The exact mechanism behind Hawking radiation

19:21.680 --> 19:26.560
involves a complex and subtle interplay between the curvature of spacetime caused by the event

19:26.560 --> 19:32.160
horizon and quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of empty space, a topic which I hope to return to

19:32.160 --> 19:37.440
in a future video. Hawking discovered that since radiation appears to be emitted from the region

19:37.440 --> 19:42.080
of space surrounding the event horizon of the black hole, it should be possible to assign an

19:42.080 --> 19:47.760
absolute temperature to the black hole, the aptly named Hawking temperature. Furthermore,

19:47.760 --> 19:52.560
because mass and energy are seen as equivalent according to Einstein's theory, when a black hole

19:52.560 --> 19:57.840
radiates energy, it effectively loses mass, and therefore should eventually evaporate.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.720
So let's now turn our attention to these remarkable discoveries and see if we can

20:02.720 --> 20:08.640
calculate the Hawking temperature and evaporation time of a black hole using our rudimentary toolkit.

20:09.760 --> 20:14.800
Our start point is to combine the first law of thermodynamics with the definition of

20:14.800 --> 20:19.440
thermodynamic entropy that we encountered earlier. Assuming that the black hole does

20:19.440 --> 20:26.480
no work on its surroundings, we can set dw equal to zero, and so we can write de equals

20:26.480 --> 20:32.640
t times ds, where de refers to the change in energy of the black hole, t the thermodynamic

20:32.640 --> 20:39.600
temperature, and ds the entropy. If we then rewrite this expression in terms of the temperature t,

20:39.600 --> 20:47.760
we have that t equals de by ds. Next, if we assume that the total energy content of the black hole

20:47.760 --> 20:53.280
is due to the mass contained within it, then we can use Einstein's famous equation to write

20:53.280 --> 21:00.080
e equals mc squared. If we then combine this with the expression for t, we see that the temperature

21:00.080 --> 21:07.040
of the black hole can be written in the following form, which we can then invert and write as c

21:07.040 --> 21:14.000
squared times the inverse of ds by dm. So we see that in order to calculate the temperature of our

21:14.080 --> 21:19.200
black hole, we need to differentiate the black hole entropy with respect to mass.

21:20.400 --> 21:26.080
And so our next task is to rewrite the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of mass.

21:26.720 --> 21:32.720
To do that, we simply need to substitute the event horizon area equation into the entropy

21:32.720 --> 21:38.080
equation, and we find that s is proportional to the square of the black hole mass.

21:39.040 --> 21:44.800
If we then differentiate this entropy equation with respect to m, then we find the following green

21:44.800 --> 21:50.560
equation. And so we are now finally in a position to determine the thermodynamic temperature of a

21:50.560 --> 21:56.480
black hole. We simply need to substitute this green expression into the equation we wrote for the

21:56.480 --> 22:02.320
thermodynamic temperature. If we do this, then we find that the temperature of our black hole can be

22:02.480 --> 22:10.880
written as h bar times c cubed divided by 8 pi kgm. This temperature is known as the Hawking

22:10.880 --> 22:15.840
temperature of the black hole, and it's the temperature that we associate with the radiation

22:15.840 --> 22:21.520
being emitted from the black hole. One immediately striking feature of this expression is that the

22:21.520 --> 22:28.080
Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the mass, and so the smaller the mass of a black hole,

22:28.160 --> 22:34.880
the higher the temperature, and therefore unlike most objects, a black hole's temperature increases

22:34.880 --> 22:41.280
as it radiates away its mass. But what kind of temperatures are we talking about? If we sub in

22:41.280 --> 22:46.320
the values for the fundamental constants, then we find that the Hawking temperature can be approximated

22:46.320 --> 22:52.480
by the following blue expression. To get a sense of scale, the smallest stellar mass black hole that

22:52.480 --> 22:58.960
has so far been discovered has a mass of around three solar masses. If we insert this mass into

22:58.960 --> 23:04.560
the blue equation, then we see that the Hawking temperature is around 2 times 10 to the minus

23:04.560 --> 23:12.160
8 Kelvin, which is about 20 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. By way of comparison, we know

23:12.160 --> 23:17.360
that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 2.7 Kelvin,

23:18.000 --> 23:23.040
and therefore a black hole of this mass would actually be absorbing far more energy than it

23:23.040 --> 23:29.280
emits and wouldn't begin to lose mass until the universe has expanded sufficiently to reduce the

23:29.280 --> 23:36.160
temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Okay, but let's for a moment assume

23:36.160 --> 23:41.920
that the universe has expanded sufficiently and the black hole begins to lose mass through Hawking

23:41.920 --> 23:48.480
radiation. How long will it take for all the energy of the black hole to radiate away? To answer

23:48.480 --> 23:54.320
this question, we need to determine the power output of the black hole, the rationale being that

23:54.320 --> 24:00.160
since power is defined as energy per unit time, if we know the energy content of the black hole

24:00.160 --> 24:06.000
and the power output, then we can calculate the time taken for the energy to radiate away. So our

24:06.000 --> 24:11.840
next task is to determine how the power output of a black hole relates to the Hawking temperature.

24:12.320 --> 24:18.400
To this we now turn. Our start point is to use dimensional analysis to estimate the power

24:18.400 --> 24:24.640
emitted per unit area from an object with temperature T. Since we're dealing with radiation,

24:24.640 --> 24:29.520
we should expect our equation to include the speed of light, and since we're dealing with heat,

24:29.520 --> 24:34.720
we expect our equation to include Boltzmann's constant, along with the temperature T. And

24:34.720 --> 24:40.400
finally, we will also include Planck's constant. After all, it was by explaining the radiation

24:40.400 --> 24:45.520
properties of hot objects that Planck was first led to introduce the constant that bears his name.

24:46.320 --> 24:52.000
So let's begin by assuming that the power per unit area depends on the fundamental constants

24:52.000 --> 24:58.800
in the following way. As before, we can determine the constants alpha, beta and gamma and delta

24:58.800 --> 25:04.960
by matching the dimensions on either side of the equation. We see that the left hand side has

25:04.960 --> 25:10.880
dimensions of mT to the minus 3, whereas the right hand side is given by the following blue

25:10.880 --> 25:17.520
expression. If we expand out the brackets and simplify, then we find the following green expression.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.800
If we then match up the exponents on either side of the equation, we find the following set of

25:24.800 --> 25:31.120
simultaneous equations, which can be solved to find that alpha equals minus 3, beta equals minus 2,

25:31.120 --> 25:37.280
and gamma and delta equal 4. And therefore, we see that the power per unit area is given by

25:37.280 --> 25:43.120
the following green equation, which you might recognise as the famous Steffen-Boltzmann relation,

25:43.120 --> 25:48.640
which says that the power per unit area of a hot object is proportional to the fourth power of the

25:48.640 --> 25:54.800
temperature. A detailed quantum mechanical calculation yields the well-known exact result,

25:54.800 --> 26:00.160
and we see that the numerical coefficient is equal to pi squared over 60. If you're interested

26:00.160 --> 26:05.120
in how this result is derived, I refer you to my video on the cosmic microwave background radiation.

26:05.840 --> 26:11.840
For our purposes, let's use the Steffen-Boltzmann relation to estimate the power output of our

26:11.840 --> 26:17.040
three solar mass black hole, which if you recall, had a Hawking temperature of 2 times 10 to the

26:17.040 --> 26:23.040
minus 8 Kelvin. If we plug in the numbers, then we find that the power output of the black hole

26:23.040 --> 26:30.640
is incredibly small, around 10 to the power of minus 29 watts. For comparison, our sun has a power

26:30.640 --> 26:37.520
output of around 10 to the power of 26 watts. Given the incredibly small power output of a black hole,

26:37.520 --> 26:43.680
we might expect that it will take a very long time for a black hole to evaporate. But exactly how long?

26:44.640 --> 26:49.200
To answer this question, we first note that because the power of the black hole will be

26:49.200 --> 26:56.240
changing with time, we will need to express the power relation in differential form as DE by DT.

26:57.120 --> 27:01.840
The appearance of the minus sign is due to the fact that the power of the Hawking radiation

27:01.840 --> 27:08.560
is the rate of energy loss of the black hole. Next, we need to take the Steffen-Boltzmann relation

27:08.560 --> 27:14.480
and rewrite this in terms of the mass of our black hole. To do this, we need to substitute the

27:14.480 --> 27:21.040
expressions for the event horizon area and Hawking temperature that we've already met. If we do this,

27:21.040 --> 27:27.360
then we find the following blue equation. Note that as the mass of the black hole decreases,

27:27.360 --> 27:35.440
the power output will actually increase. Next, we will rewrite the energy in terms of the mass

27:35.440 --> 27:41.200
by using Einstein's equation equals mc squared, where m is the total mass of the black hole.

27:41.920 --> 27:47.440
If we sub this into the differential expression, then we can write our power equation in terms

27:47.440 --> 27:53.120
of the rate of change of mass instead of the rate of change of energy. This makes sense because the

27:53.120 --> 27:59.440
right hand side of the equation is expressed in terms of the mass. In order to solve this equation,

27:59.440 --> 28:05.760
we will use the method of separation of variables. The first step is to rearrange this equation so

28:05.840 --> 28:12.080
that we have m squared dm on the left hand side and dt on the right hand side. If we then integrate

28:12.080 --> 28:17.520
both sides of this equation with respect to t, we find the following yellow expression, where t

28:17.520 --> 28:23.120
equals zero refers to when the black hole starts evaporating and t refers to some later time.

28:24.080 --> 28:28.720
Integrating m squared will give a factor of m cubed over three on the left hand side,

28:28.720 --> 28:33.360
whereas integrating with respect to time on the right hand side will give rise to a factor of t.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.840
If we then insert the limits, we find the following result.

28:38.640 --> 28:43.680
We can then use this expression to estimate the time taken for an isolated black hole to

28:43.680 --> 28:49.920
evaporate completely. In other words, the time taken for a black hole to lose all of its mass.

28:50.640 --> 28:58.000
To do this, let's define t equals t evaporation as the moment in time when the mass of the black

28:58.080 --> 29:06.080
hole has reduced to zero. If we then substitute this information back into our equation and simplify,

29:06.080 --> 29:12.080
we find the following green equation expressed in terms of the evaporation time. Finally,

29:12.080 --> 29:17.280
if we rearrange for t, then we find that the evaporation time is proportional to the cube

29:17.280 --> 29:23.040
of the mass of the black hole. Plugging in the values for the constants, we find that the evaporation

29:23.040 --> 29:29.440
time is roughly equal to 10 to the power of minus 16 times m cubed, where m is the mass of the black

29:29.440 --> 29:35.920
hole at the start of the evaporation process. If we again consider a black hole of three solar

29:35.920 --> 29:42.480
masses, then we find that the evaporation time is of order 10 to the 68 years. Considering the

29:42.480 --> 29:49.200
universe is believed to be around 13.8 billion years old, we see that the time taken for evaporation

29:49.200 --> 29:54.480
is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe, and therefore a solar

29:54.480 --> 30:00.240
mass black hole is likely to be around long after all the stars in the universe have died out,

30:00.240 --> 30:04.720
making it highly unlikely that we'll ever observe the black hole's final farewell.

30:05.600 --> 30:11.120
So is there any way that a black hole might evaporate in a shorter period of time? Well,

30:11.120 --> 30:16.000
a quick glance at the black hole evaporation equation reveals that the only factor affecting

30:16.000 --> 30:21.760
the evaporation time is the black hole mass. Could it be possible then that a black hole with

30:21.760 --> 30:27.120
sufficiently small mass, perhaps created in the early universe, has an evaporation time roughly

30:27.120 --> 30:32.480
equal to the age of the universe? That way, the primordial black hole could be coming towards

30:32.480 --> 30:37.440
the end of its life at the present moment, and we might be able to detect the dying radiation burst

30:37.440 --> 30:42.320
of the black hole. Well, it turns out that it's relatively straightforward to estimate what the

30:42.400 --> 30:47.280
mass of such a black hole would need to be. We simply rearrange the black hole evaporation

30:47.280 --> 30:52.480
equation for M, and substitute the age of the universe, and we find that the initial mass of

30:52.480 --> 30:57.360
the black hole must have been around 10 to the power 11 kilograms, which is roughly equivalent

30:57.360 --> 31:02.880
to the mass of an asteroid. Now, according to our current laws of physics, a black hole of such

31:02.880 --> 31:07.840
small mass could not have formed as a result of stellar death, as is typical for black hole

31:07.840 --> 31:14.000
formation. Rather, it's conceivable that such primordial black holes might have formed by random

31:14.000 --> 31:19.680
fluctuations in the very early universe, and if so, these primordial black holes should be coming

31:19.680 --> 31:25.360
towards the end of their lives. So what exactly happens during the last few moments of a black

31:25.360 --> 31:31.120
hole's life? Well, we can estimate the amount of energy released in the last second of a black

31:31.120 --> 31:37.200
hole's life, because this is equal to the energy equivalent of the mass of a black hole whose lifetime

31:37.200 --> 31:44.080
equals one second. So if we sub in t equals one into the evaporation equation, we find that the

31:44.080 --> 31:49.920
black hole radiates the energy equivalent of 10 to the power 5 kilograms of mass during its final

31:49.920 --> 31:56.720
second. We can work out how much energy this corresponds to by using Einstein's famous equation

31:56.720 --> 32:04.160
equals mc squared, and we find a value of around 10 to the power of 22 joules. By way of comparison,

32:04.160 --> 32:10.480
the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated on Earth, known as the SA-bomber, released 10 to the

32:10.480 --> 32:16.320
17 joules of energy, and so we see that the energy released in the final one second of a black hole

32:16.320 --> 32:21.760
is roughly equivalent to the energy released by 100,000 SA nuclear bombs.

32:23.360 --> 32:28.640
So could we detect this? The release of this much energy in one second might just be observable

32:28.640 --> 32:33.360
here on Earth. Although it's only a fraction of a percent of the luminosity of the Sun,

32:33.360 --> 32:38.160
it would come out in a characteristic burst of gamma rays which could hopefully be detected.

32:38.720 --> 32:43.280
But how do we know it would be gamma rays? Well that comes from the Vien displacement law,

32:43.280 --> 32:48.320
which says that for an object at temperature T, the wavelength corresponding to peak intensity

32:48.320 --> 32:53.120
emission is inversely proportional to the temperature. I refer you to my video on the

32:53.120 --> 32:58.640
cosmic microwave background radiation for a derivation of this result. For our purposes,

32:58.640 --> 33:04.080
we can estimate the wavelength of peak emission by inserting the Hawking temperature corresponding

33:04.080 --> 33:10.080
to a black hole of mass 10 to the 5 kilograms. And we find that the peak wavelength is of order

33:10.080 --> 33:16.000
10 to the minus 21 meters, which is in the high energy gamma wavelength range of electromagnetic

33:16.000 --> 33:21.360
radiation. And therefore the hope is that it should be possible to detect this characteristic

33:21.360 --> 33:26.560
burst of gamma radiation, which signals the last few moments of an evaporating black hole's life.

33:27.280 --> 33:32.320
It's worth noting that so far nothing of this nature has ever been observed,

33:32.320 --> 33:37.120
and therefore at this stage primordial black holes represent a purely theoretical idea.

33:39.120 --> 33:44.480
I would like to end by briefly discussing another important theoretical consequence of Hawking

33:44.480 --> 33:50.960
radiation, the famous black hole information paradox. Soon after Hawking realised that

33:51.040 --> 33:57.520
black holes evaporate, he recognised a serious problem. Imagine throwing a laptop or a book

33:57.520 --> 34:02.880
or even a human being into a black hole. What happens to all of this information?

34:03.680 --> 34:08.880
The problem that Hawking recognised is that the thermal radiation emitted from a black hole as

34:08.880 --> 34:14.720
it evaporates has no memory whatsoever of what went into the black hole in the first place.

34:15.440 --> 34:20.000
As we've already seen, only the mass and therefore temperature of the black hole

34:20.000 --> 34:25.440
determines what type of radiation is emitted, and this would seem to imply that information

34:25.440 --> 34:31.920
has been lost. In other words, we cannot use the Hawking radiation emitted from a black hole

34:31.920 --> 34:37.680
to reconstruct the information content of what originally fell inside. Now this might not

34:37.680 --> 34:43.440
immediately strike you as a problem, however the irretrievable loss of information conflicts with

34:43.440 --> 34:49.280
one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics. According to the Schrodinger equation, physical

34:49.280 --> 34:54.640
systems that change over time cannot create or destroy information, a property known as

34:54.640 --> 35:00.240
unitarity. This apparent contradiction between general relativity and quantum mechanics is

35:00.240 --> 35:06.800
the information paradox, so either quantum mechanics is wrong or the information somehow

35:06.800 --> 35:12.560
gets out of the black hole. One possible solution to the problem is known as the holographic

35:12.560 --> 35:18.640
principle, which suggests that the information content of a black hole is somehow encoded

35:18.720 --> 35:23.760
on the event horizon of the black hole. So let's look at this suggestion in a bit more detail.

35:24.480 --> 35:29.920
As we've already seen, Bekingstein and Hawking were able to relate the entropy of a black hole

35:29.920 --> 35:35.680
to the area of the event horizon. However, according to Boltzmann's definition of entropy,

35:35.680 --> 35:40.480
it should be possible to define the entropy in relation to some fundamental microstates of the

35:40.480 --> 35:46.720
black hole system. So what could these fundamental microstates be? To shed some light on this,

35:46.720 --> 35:52.720
notice that we can rewrite the Bekingstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of the Planck length,

35:52.720 --> 35:57.920
which, if you recall, is believed to be the smallest meaningful distance that we can probe in nature.

35:58.800 --> 36:04.720
If we square the Planck length, we get the Planck area, and notice that the Planck area

36:04.720 --> 36:11.040
is actually contained within the Bekenstein-Hawking relation. In particular, we can write the entropy

36:11.040 --> 36:17.760
as s equals k over 4 times the area of the horizon divided by the Planck area.

36:18.960 --> 36:24.800
So we see that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the number of Planck areas

36:24.800 --> 36:30.880
that would cover the area of the black hole event horizon. So what does this mean? Well,

36:30.880 --> 36:36.720
perhaps we could use these Planck size pixels to somehow encode the information that has fallen

36:36.720 --> 36:43.120
into the black hole. More specifically, imagine that each Planck's eye cell corresponds to one bit

36:43.120 --> 36:49.280
of stored information. So for example, with one bit corresponding to one Planck's eye cell,

36:49.280 --> 36:56.000
we can encode two possible states corresponding to zero and one. With two bits or two cells,

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
we can describe four states corresponding to zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, and one, one.

37:02.720 --> 37:09.840
Continuing this pattern, we see that with n bits or n cells, we can describe two to the n states

37:09.840 --> 37:16.320
corresponding to the two to the n sequences of binary digits. Then according to Boltzmann,

37:16.320 --> 37:21.520
the entropy of the system would be equal to Boltzmann's constant multiplied by the logarithm

37:21.520 --> 37:26.960
of the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. Well, if we take two to

37:27.040 --> 37:32.640
the n as the number of microstates, then we see that the entropy would be proportional to the

37:32.640 --> 37:38.800
logarithm of two to the n. We can then use the logarithm rule for exponents to show that the

37:38.800 --> 37:45.680
log of two to the n is proportional to n. And we have already established that the number of cells

37:45.680 --> 37:50.880
is proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon. And so we see we recover the

37:50.880 --> 37:56.560
Beckenstein-Hawking relation. To get a sense of just how much information a black hole could

37:56.560 --> 38:01.680
store using these Planck's eye cells, let's for the purposes of illustration, imagine that we

38:01.680 --> 38:08.160
have a tiny black hole the size of a proton with a radius of order 10 to the minus 15 meters. We

38:08.160 --> 38:13.600
can then estimate the number of bits as the ratio of the area of the event horizon to the Planck

38:13.600 --> 38:19.440
area. And we see that we can answer of around 10 to the power of 41 bits, which is roughly 10 to the

38:19.440 --> 38:26.000
31 gigabytes. Compare this to the total data storage on all the computers in the world,

38:26.000 --> 38:32.240
which is of order 10 to the 12 gigabytes. And we see that a proton size black hole could contain

38:32.240 --> 38:39.040
more information than all the world's computers by an unimaginably large factor. This general idea

38:39.040 --> 38:44.400
that information is stored on the black hole horizon is known as the holographic principle,

38:44.400 --> 38:49.440
since the information that falls into a black hole is somehow encoded on the two-dimensional

38:49.440 --> 38:55.520
boundary, like a hologram. And therefore, according to this set of ideas, the information swallowed

38:55.520 --> 39:00.720
by a black hole could be completely restored during the process of quantum evaporation,

39:01.280 --> 39:06.800
since it always existed on the boundary of the black hole. The exact mechanism explaining how

39:06.800 --> 39:12.080
this restoration of information takes place is still an open question in theoretical physics.

39:12.080 --> 39:17.600
But there has been significant progress over the past 30 years to flesh out and generalize the

39:17.600 --> 39:23.760
holographic principle, especially within the context of string theory. The remarkable conclusion

39:23.760 --> 39:29.680
that comes out of this line of reasoning is the realization that in order to describe what is going

39:29.680 --> 39:35.040
on in a volume of space, we need only concern ourselves with the physics that resides on the

39:35.040 --> 39:40.160
boundary of the volume. You can think of a region of space as being surrounded by tiny

39:40.160 --> 39:45.600
plank-sized pixelated cells. And when things move around inside the volume, that information is

39:45.600 --> 39:51.760
somehow encoded in those cells. You can picture them lighting up. As you put more stuff inside the

39:51.760 --> 39:57.520
volume of space, more of the pixels light up. And at the exact moment just before the volume

39:57.520 --> 40:03.360
of space collapses to form a black hole, all of the pixels have lit up. In other words,

40:03.360 --> 40:09.200
all of the information is at the boundary, not inside the space. What controls the physics

40:09.200 --> 40:13.600
lives on the boundary of the space. And this is the essence of the holographic principle.

40:15.760 --> 40:19.680
A detailed discussion of the holographic principle within the context of string theory

40:19.680 --> 40:24.640
will no doubt form the basis of a future video. But for now, I would like to leave you with the

40:24.640 --> 40:29.840
words of one of the founding fathers of the holographic principle, Leonard Susskind. The

40:29.840 --> 40:35.680
universe, filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders and people, is a hologram.

40:35.680 --> 40:42.080
An image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface. This new law of physics,

40:42.080 --> 40:46.880
known as the holographic principle, asserts that everything inside a region of space

40:46.880 --> 40:50.560
can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.160
Thank you for watching and see you next time.
