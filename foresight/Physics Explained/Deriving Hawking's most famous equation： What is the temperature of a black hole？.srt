1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a black hole is a region of

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,240
space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,040
The boundary of this region is known as the event horizon of the black hole, and

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,960
according to classical relativity, once an object has passed the event horizon,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,720
it will never be able to escape the clutches of the black hole. However, when

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,040
you throw quantum mechanics into the mix, as is often the case, the situation

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,600
becomes a bit more subtle. In fact, in 1974, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that by

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,080
combining certain elements of quantum field theory with general relativity, it

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,760
was possible to show that black holes do in fact radiate, causing them to slowly

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,960
evaporate and eventually disappear. Now, I don't know about you, but when I first

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,400
read about black holes as a child, I was instantly hooked and desperately wanted

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,480
to find out more. The only problem is that the physics of black holes, and in

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,520
particular Hawking's work, is notoriously difficult and requires an

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,480
advanced knowledge of Einstein's theory of general relativity, as well as quantum

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,320
field theory. But is it possible to determine the most exciting and

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,360
mysterious properties of black holes using only advanced high school

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,360
mathematics? Well, it turns out the answer is yes, and in this short video, I'd like

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,480
to show you how. In fact, our strategy is quite simple. We are essentially going to

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,720
guess the structure of the black hole equations without doing the full

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
calculation, using a handy technique known as dimensional analysis.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
Dimensional analysis is perhaps the most valuable tool in a theoretical

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
physicist's toolkit, as it allows you to construct equations without doing any of

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,720
the hard work, and as you will see, it's remarkably successful. So how does it work?

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
Well, the first thing to appreciate is that an equation in physics simply

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,480
represents a relationship between physical properties, and a measurable

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,480
physical property is referred to as a dimension. In what follows, we will focus

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,880
on the basic dimensions of length, time, mass, and temperature, which we will

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,920
signify with the letters L, T, M, and theta. To understand what I mean by

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,920
dimensional analysis, let's look at a simple example. The great thing about

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
physics equations is that they provide a relationship between the dimensions of

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,720
the properties appearing in the equation. For example, consider the equation

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,680
speed equals distance divided by time. To determine the dimensions of speed, we

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,880
simply refer to the defining equation, which tells us that the dimension of

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,200
speed is equal to the dimension of length divided by time. Square brackets are

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,440
used to signify that we are interested in the dimension of the quantity inside

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,920
the bracket. Now, it turns out that some physics equations are special, in the

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,960
sense that they contain what are known as fundamental constants. A fundamental

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,840
constant is a physical quantity that is believed to be universal in nature and

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,160
constant in time. The most famous example being the speed of light, which appears

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,560
in the famous equation equals mc2. This equation allows us to calculate the mass

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,480
energy of an object if we know its mass. The speed of light, c, is a fundamental

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,000
constant that tells us the exchange rate between mass and energy. Since c refers

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,040
to a speed, the dimensions of c can be written as c equals l over t. We also

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,640
note that we can use the equation equals mc2 to determine the dimensions of

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,880
energy, which can be written as ml squared over t squared. Let's now use this

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,280
dimensional information to explore some of the other fundamental constants that

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,440
will prove crucial to our understanding of black holes. Firstly, consider the

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
gravitational potential energy that exists due to the relative position of

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,880
two or more masses. If two masses are separated by a distance r, then the

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,560
gravitational potential energy can be calculated using the equation e equals

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,760
minus g big m little m over r, where g is Newton's gravitational constant. By

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,560
rearranging this equation and inserting the dimensions of energy that we

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,640
calculated previously, we find that the units of g are equal to l cubed over mt

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,120
squared. Next, consider the famous quantum energy relation e equals h bar

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,560
omega, which relates the energy of a quantum of light to the frequency of the

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,800
light. Here, h bar is the reduced Planck's constant. In order to determine the

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,280
dimensions of h bar, we simply rearrange the energy equation, and since

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,960
frequency has dimensions of inverse time, we see that the dimensions of h bar

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,560
is ml squared over t. The final fundamental constant that we'll be

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
concerned with relates to the field of thermodynamics, and more specifically

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,800
systems of large numbers of particles. According to the kinetic theory of gases,

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,480
for a system of n particles at temperature t, such as an ideal gas, the

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,560
thermal energy is related to the temperature by the equation e equals

64
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,120
three over two n kt, where k is Boltzmann's constant. By rearranging this

65
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,000
equation for Boltzmann's constant, we see that the dimensions of Boltzmann's

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,600
constant is given by ml squared over theta t squared. Having laid the necessary

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
foundations, we're now in a position to start building equations using the

68
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,280
fundamental constants as our building blocks. The rules of the game are as

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,120
follows. When using dimensional analysis to construct equations, we should include

70
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,120
the speed of light c when things are moving fast or involve light. We should

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,680
include the gravitational constant g when things are massive. We should include

72
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Planck's constant when dealing with quantum systems, and we should include

73
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,280
Boltzmann's constant when things are hot. It sounds simple, so let's get started.

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
Our objective is to uncover the properties of black holes using

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
dimensional analysis. The good news is that our task is made significantly

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,160
easier because of a famous theorem known as the no-hair theorem. The no-hair

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,960
theorem states that all black hole solutions in general relativity can be

78
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,200
completely characterized by only three externally observable classical parameters

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,520
mass, electric charge and angular momentum. All other information, for which

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,280
hair is a metaphor about the matter that formed the black hole, disappears behind

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,640
the black hole event horizon and is therefore permanently inaccessible to

82
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,800
external observers. In what follows, we will focus on a special class of black

83
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
holes known as Schwarzschild black holes, which have neither electric charge nor

84
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,560
angular momentum, and therefore a Schwarzschild black hole is completely

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,200
characterized by its mass. Armed with the no-hair theorem and dimensional

86
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,120
analysis, we are now in a position to answer the following question. What is the

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,840
area of the event horizon of a black hole? Well firstly, black holes are

88
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,880
clearly massive objects and so our equation should include Newton's

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,120
gravitational constant g along with the characteristic mass of the black hole

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,000
m. Furthermore, we know that a black hole is a region of spacetime where

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,520
gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape and so we should

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
expect the speed of light to feature in our equation. Our strategy is to write

93
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,960
the area of the event horizon as a equals g to the power alpha times c to the

94
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,920
power beta times m to the power gamma and then we will use dimensional analysis

95
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,880
to determine alpha, beta and gamma. So let's do that. To fix alpha, beta and gamma,

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,640
we simply need to match the dimensions on either side of this expression. The

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,040
left hand side represents an area which has dimensions of length squared. For the

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,000
right hand side, we need to insert the dimensions of g and c that we

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,040
calculated earlier. If we do that then we find the following green expression. We

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,200
can then use the law of exponents to gather terms and simplify this expression

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,120
in which case we find the following. Now since the dimensions on both sides of

102
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,200
the equation need to match, this places a set of constraints on alpha, beta and

103
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,800
gamma. To make this clear, we can imagine writing the left hand side in an

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,240
equivalent form as follows. We can do this because any quantity raised to the

105
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,880
power of 0 is simply equal to 1. If we then match up the exponents of L, T and

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,560
m, we find a set of three simultaneous equations which can be solved by

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,280
substitution. After a little bit of algebra, we find that alpha equals 2,

108
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,640
beta equals minus 4 and gamma equals 2. If we then sub these values into our

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,880
original expression, we find that the area of the event horizon of a black

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,320
hole is proportional to g squared m squared divided by c to the power of 4. In

111
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
other words, the area of the event horizon will increase as more mass falls

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,280
into the black hole. More specifically, we see that if the mass of our black hole

113
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,520
doubles, then the area of the event horizon will quadruple. And so we begin

114
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,840
to see the power of dimensional analysis. Although we don't know the exact

115
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,520
value of the proportionality constant appearing in the mass area expression,

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,640
dimensional analysis does allow us to determine the structure of the

117
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,640
relationship. And often this is the most important part of an equation. It's

118
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,200
interesting to note that a detailed calculation of the black hole event

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
horizon yields the following exact expression. And we see that the structure

120
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
of this expression does indeed match the one derived using dimensional analysis.

121
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,040
So why is this mass area relationship important? And what is it telling us

122
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,480
about black holes? Well, the first thing to appreciate is that from a classical

123
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,720
point of view, nothing can ever escape from inside the event horizon of a black

124
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,520
hole. And therefore, in all physical processes, the area of the event horizon

125
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,720
can only ever increase. It can never decrease. Now, the idea that there exists

126
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,920
a quantity that can only ever increase with time might remind you of the second

127
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,760
law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system must

128
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,560
increase with time. Because entropy is such an important concept, and a key

129
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,880
part of our analysis of black holes, it's worth taking a short detour to

130
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,800
understand the concept in a bit more detail. The concept of thermodynamic

131
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,160
entropy was first introduced into gas dynamics by the German physicist

132
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,200
Rudolf Klausius. Klausius had introduced the concept to describe the flow of

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,320
heat. He originally defined the change in entropy of a system as the heat

134
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,040
energy it absorbed divided by the temperature at which it absorbed the

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,640
heat. The remarkable discovery of Klausius was that because heat always

136
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,080
moves from high temperature regions to low temperature regions, the total

137
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,160
change in entropy summed over all the parts of the system that were exchanging

138
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,680
heat with one another was always positive. The entropy was always

139
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,040
increasing. But why is this true? Although Klausius had successfully

140
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,360
introduced a mathematical definition of entropy, he was unable to provide a

141
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,640
fundamental explanation of why the second law of thermodynamics was true.

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,720
However, in 1877, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann provided a beautiful

143
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
explanation of entropy in terms of the microscopic components of a physical

144
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
system. According to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system is simply

145
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,160
characterized by the number of ways of rearranging the microscopic components

146
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
of the system in such a way that some macroscopic feature, such as the pressure

147
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,440
or temperature, remains unchanged. This statement is encoded in Boltzmann's

148
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
famous entropy law, which can be found etched into his gravestone. According

149
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,400
to Boltzmann's definition, the entropy of a system is equal to Boltzmann's

150
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,240
constant multiplied by the logarithm of W, where W is the number of

151
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,200
microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. To make this a bit

152
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,400
clearer, imagine the bottom of a box is completely covered with red and green

153
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,360
marbles. Now imagine that you arrange the marbles so that the left half is green

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,040
and the right half is red. This corresponds to a particular appearance or

155
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,120
macrostate of the system. Let's label this macrostate as the split state. If we

156
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,160
then shook the box of marbles so that the two sets of marbles became thoroughly

157
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,320
mixed together, we would see a random arrangement of the marbles, which we

158
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,480
might label as a mixed macrostate. If we then shook the box again, we would get

159
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,760
a different arrangement of the marbles, but we would still label the macrostate

160
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,680
of the system as being mixed. In fact, there are a huge number of marble

161
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,000
configurations or microstates corresponding to a mixed macrostate. On

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,400
the other hand, there are clearly fewer ways for the marbles to arrange

163
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,400
themselves into the neatly separated split state. Boltzmann's great insight

164
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,320
was to realize that he could define the entropy as the number of microstates

165
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,960
corresponding to a particular macrostate. Fewer microstates corresponds to lower

166
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,080
entropy and therefore more order in the system. So what has this got to do with

167
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,960
black holes? Well, you can think of a black hole as a universal waste basket

168
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,720
that swallows up information as matter falls inside. Since a black hole refuses

169
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,320
to tell us what has fallen inside, we can view a black hole as a system that

170
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,080
has the same external state for lots of possible internal states. This suggests

171
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,080
that the black hole may have a very large entropy value. But exactly how large?

172
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,560
Well, we've already uncovered the first clue when we discovered that the area of

173
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,280
the horizon of the black hole always increases when mass falls inside. In

174
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,880
1972, Jacob Beckenstein, an Israeli physicist, proposed that it does indeed

175
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,120
make sense to assign an entropy to a black hole. And furthermore, that the

176
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,920
entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. In other

177
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,800
words, Beckenstein suggested that it should be possible to write s equals eta

178
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,080
times a, where eta is a constant of proportionality. So how might we determine

179
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,800
eta? Well, the first thing we need to do is determine the dimensions of entropy,

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
since this will then allow us to figure out the dimensions of eta. To do this,

181
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,960
we refer back to the thermodynamic definition of entropy, ds equals dq

182
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,720
over t, which tells us that entropy has dimensions of energy divided by

183
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,520
temperature. And so we find that entropy has dimensions of ml squared t to the

184
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,760
minus two theta to the minus one. We can then use this to determine the

185
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,720
dimensions of eta, since eta is equal to the entropy divided by the area. And so

186
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,480
we see that the dimensions of eta must be mt to the minus two theta to the minus

187
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,760
one. Furthermore, we know that eta is a constant, and therefore eta must be

188
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,320
constructed from quantities which are themselves constant in time. And this

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,880
provides a strong hint that eta can be built using the fundamental constants

190
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,960
we encountered earlier. But which constant shall we use in our

191
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,840
dimensional analysis? Well, this is where we need to make an educated guess.

192
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Firstly, we are dealing with gravity in black holes, and so we should expect

193
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,840
the gravitational constant and speed of light to be involved. Furthermore, since

194
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,240
we are trying to construct an equation for entropy, and entropy is connected to

195
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,280
thermodynamics, it makes sense to include Boltzmann's constant. And finally,

196
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,640
following the suggestion of Beckenstein in his original 1972 paper, we should also

197
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,480
include Planck's constant. As Beckenstein himself commented, we need not be alarmed

198
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
at the appearance of H-bar in the expression for black hole entropy. It is

199
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,240
as well known that H-bar also appears in the equations for entropy of many

200
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,720
thermodynamic systems that are conventionally regarded as classical. For

201
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,160
example, the Boltzmann ideal gas. This is a reflection of the fact that entropy is,

202
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,120
in a sense, a count of states of the system, and the underlying states of any

203
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,320
system are always quantum in nature. And so, following in the footsteps of

204
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Beckenstein, we will propose that eta can be written as g to the alpha,

205
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,440
H-bar to the beta, c to the gamma times k to the delta. So, how do we determine alpha,

206
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,400
beta, gamma and delta? Well, as we've already seen, we simply need to apply the

207
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,480
rules of dimensional analysis. So let's do that. Firstly, we have already calculated

208
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,520
the dimensions of eta from the definition of thermodynamic entropy. Secondly,

209
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,680
we know that the combined dimensions of g, H-bar, c and k must match these. If we

210
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,320
substitute the dimensions we calculated earlier for the fundamental constants,

211
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,640
then we find the following yellow expression. If we then use the law of

212
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,040
exponents to gather appropriate terms together, we can write this expression

213
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,640
in the following form. Just like before, we can then match exponents on either side

214
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,080
of the equation to form a set of simultaneous equations. If we do this,

215
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,560
then we find the following set of constraints. We can then solve this set of

216
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,960
simultaneous equations by substitution, and we find that alpha and beta equal

217
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,640
minus one, gamma equals three, and delta equals one. If we then substitute these

218
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
expressions back into the original equation proposed by Beckenstein, we find that,

219
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,240
up to an undetermined numerical factor, the entropy of a black hole is proportional

220
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,480
to the following expression. In 1974, using a subtle and sophisticated

221
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,600
combination of general relativity and quantum field theory, Stephen Hawking was able to show

222
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,960
that the exact form of the entropy equation includes a numerical factor of exactly one

223
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,240
quarter, and so the modern-day expression for black hole entropy is written as s equals k c cubed

224
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,640
over four h-bar g times the area of the event horizon. One of the most immediately

225
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,440
striking aspects of this expression is that the entropy of a black hole is going to be

226
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,680
incredibly large, since the equation contains a factor of c cubed in the numerator and both

227
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,200
Planck's constant and Newton's gravitational constant in the denominator. So what is causing

228
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,280
this large entropy value? Well, according to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system relates to

229
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,640
the number of possible microstates of the system. So if we apply this to black holes,

230
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,560
it suggests that black holes should have some kind of microstructure,

231
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,320
which we can use to count states. Furthermore, the presence of both Newton's gravitational

232
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,400
constant and Planck's constant in the entropy equation suggests that these black hole microstates

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,520
might have something to do with the quantum theory of gravity.

234
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,480
We will return to these interesting observations towards the end of this video,

235
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,080
but for now, we wish to use the entropy equation to understand one of the most exciting predictions

236
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,640
of 20th century physics, Hawking radiation. In 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered a remarkable

237
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,560
fact about the universe. Black holes glow, emitting faint radiation, causing them to

238
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,680
eventually evaporate and disappear. The exact mechanism behind Hawking radiation

239
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,560
involves a complex and subtle interplay between the curvature of spacetime caused by the event

240
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,160
horizon and quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of empty space, a topic which I hope to return to

241
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
in a future video. Hawking discovered that since radiation appears to be emitted from the region

242
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,080
of space surrounding the event horizon of the black hole, it should be possible to assign an

243
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,760
absolute temperature to the black hole, the aptly named Hawking temperature. Furthermore,

244
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,560
because mass and energy are seen as equivalent according to Einstein's theory, when a black hole

245
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,840
radiates energy, it effectively loses mass, and therefore should eventually evaporate.

246
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
So let's now turn our attention to these remarkable discoveries and see if we can

247
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,640
calculate the Hawking temperature and evaporation time of a black hole using our rudimentary toolkit.

248
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,800
Our start point is to combine the first law of thermodynamics with the definition of

249
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,440
thermodynamic entropy that we encountered earlier. Assuming that the black hole does

250
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,480
no work on its surroundings, we can set dw equal to zero, and so we can write de equals

251
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,640
t times ds, where de refers to the change in energy of the black hole, t the thermodynamic

252
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,600
temperature, and ds the entropy. If we then rewrite this expression in terms of the temperature t,

253
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:47,760
we have that t equals de by ds. Next, if we assume that the total energy content of the black hole

254
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,280
is due to the mass contained within it, then we can use Einstein's famous equation to write

255
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,080
e equals mc squared. If we then combine this with the expression for t, we see that the temperature

256
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,040
of the black hole can be written in the following form, which we can then invert and write as c

257
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:14,000
squared times the inverse of ds by dm. So we see that in order to calculate the temperature of our

258
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,200
black hole, we need to differentiate the black hole entropy with respect to mass.

259
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,080
And so our next task is to rewrite the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of mass.

260
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,720
To do that, we simply need to substitute the event horizon area equation into the entropy

261
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,080
equation, and we find that s is proportional to the square of the black hole mass.

262
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,800
If we then differentiate this entropy equation with respect to m, then we find the following green

263
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,560
equation. And so we are now finally in a position to determine the thermodynamic temperature of a

264
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,480
black hole. We simply need to substitute this green expression into the equation we wrote for the

265
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,320
thermodynamic temperature. If we do this, then we find that the temperature of our black hole can be

266
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,880
written as h bar times c cubed divided by 8 pi kgm. This temperature is known as the Hawking

267
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,840
temperature of the black hole, and it's the temperature that we associate with the radiation

268
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,520
being emitted from the black hole. One immediately striking feature of this expression is that the

269
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,080
Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the mass, and so the smaller the mass of a black hole,

270
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,880
the higher the temperature, and therefore unlike most objects, a black hole's temperature increases

271
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,280
as it radiates away its mass. But what kind of temperatures are we talking about? If we sub in

272
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,320
the values for the fundamental constants, then we find that the Hawking temperature can be approximated

273
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,480
by the following blue expression. To get a sense of scale, the smallest stellar mass black hole that

274
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,960
has so far been discovered has a mass of around three solar masses. If we insert this mass into

275
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,560
the blue equation, then we see that the Hawking temperature is around 2 times 10 to the minus

276
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,160
8 Kelvin, which is about 20 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. By way of comparison, we know

277
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,360
that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 2.7 Kelvin,

278
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,040
and therefore a black hole of this mass would actually be absorbing far more energy than it

279
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,280
emits and wouldn't begin to lose mass until the universe has expanded sufficiently to reduce the

280
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,160
temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Okay, but let's for a moment assume

281
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,920
that the universe has expanded sufficiently and the black hole begins to lose mass through Hawking

282
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,480
radiation. How long will it take for all the energy of the black hole to radiate away? To answer

283
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,320
this question, we need to determine the power output of the black hole, the rationale being that

284
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,160
since power is defined as energy per unit time, if we know the energy content of the black hole

285
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,000
and the power output, then we can calculate the time taken for the energy to radiate away. So our

286
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,840
next task is to determine how the power output of a black hole relates to the Hawking temperature.

287
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,400
To this we now turn. Our start point is to use dimensional analysis to estimate the power

288
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,640
emitted per unit area from an object with temperature T. Since we're dealing with radiation,

289
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,520
we should expect our equation to include the speed of light, and since we're dealing with heat,

290
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,720
we expect our equation to include Boltzmann's constant, along with the temperature T. And

291
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,400
finally, we will also include Planck's constant. After all, it was by explaining the radiation

292
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,520
properties of hot objects that Planck was first led to introduce the constant that bears his name.

293
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,000
So let's begin by assuming that the power per unit area depends on the fundamental constants

294
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,800
in the following way. As before, we can determine the constants alpha, beta and gamma and delta

295
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,960
by matching the dimensions on either side of the equation. We see that the left hand side has

296
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,880
dimensions of mT to the minus 3, whereas the right hand side is given by the following blue

297
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,520
expression. If we expand out the brackets and simplify, then we find the following green expression.

298
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,800
If we then match up the exponents on either side of the equation, we find the following set of

299
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,120
simultaneous equations, which can be solved to find that alpha equals minus 3, beta equals minus 2,

300
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,280
and gamma and delta equal 4. And therefore, we see that the power per unit area is given by

301
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,120
the following green equation, which you might recognise as the famous Steffen-Boltzmann relation,

302
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,640
which says that the power per unit area of a hot object is proportional to the fourth power of the

303
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,800
temperature. A detailed quantum mechanical calculation yields the well-known exact result,

304
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,160
and we see that the numerical coefficient is equal to pi squared over 60. If you're interested

305
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,120
in how this result is derived, I refer you to my video on the cosmic microwave background radiation.

306
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,840
For our purposes, let's use the Steffen-Boltzmann relation to estimate the power output of our

307
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,040
three solar mass black hole, which if you recall, had a Hawking temperature of 2 times 10 to the

308
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,040
minus 8 Kelvin. If we plug in the numbers, then we find that the power output of the black hole

309
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,640
is incredibly small, around 10 to the power of minus 29 watts. For comparison, our sun has a power

310
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,520
output of around 10 to the power of 26 watts. Given the incredibly small power output of a black hole,

311
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,680
we might expect that it will take a very long time for a black hole to evaporate. But exactly how long?

312
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,200
To answer this question, we first note that because the power of the black hole will be

313
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,240
changing with time, we will need to express the power relation in differential form as DE by DT.

314
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,840
The appearance of the minus sign is due to the fact that the power of the Hawking radiation

315
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,560
is the rate of energy loss of the black hole. Next, we need to take the Steffen-Boltzmann relation

316
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,480
and rewrite this in terms of the mass of our black hole. To do this, we need to substitute the

317
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,040
expressions for the event horizon area and Hawking temperature that we've already met. If we do this,

318
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,360
then we find the following blue equation. Note that as the mass of the black hole decreases,

319
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:35,440
the power output will actually increase. Next, we will rewrite the energy in terms of the mass

320
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,200
by using Einstein's equation equals mc squared, where m is the total mass of the black hole.

321
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,440
If we sub this into the differential expression, then we can write our power equation in terms

322
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,120
of the rate of change of mass instead of the rate of change of energy. This makes sense because the

323
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,440
right hand side of the equation is expressed in terms of the mass. In order to solve this equation,

324
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,760
we will use the method of separation of variables. The first step is to rearrange this equation so

325
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,080
that we have m squared dm on the left hand side and dt on the right hand side. If we then integrate

326
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,520
both sides of this equation with respect to t, we find the following yellow expression, where t

327
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,120
equals zero refers to when the black hole starts evaporating and t refers to some later time.

328
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
Integrating m squared will give a factor of m cubed over three on the left hand side,

329
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,360
whereas integrating with respect to time on the right hand side will give rise to a factor of t.

330
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
If we then insert the limits, we find the following result.

331
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,680
We can then use this expression to estimate the time taken for an isolated black hole to

332
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,920
evaporate completely. In other words, the time taken for a black hole to lose all of its mass.

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,000
To do this, let's define t equals t evaporation as the moment in time when the mass of the black

334
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:06,080
hole has reduced to zero. If we then substitute this information back into our equation and simplify,

335
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,080
we find the following green equation expressed in terms of the evaporation time. Finally,

336
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,280
if we rearrange for t, then we find that the evaporation time is proportional to the cube

337
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,040
of the mass of the black hole. Plugging in the values for the constants, we find that the evaporation

338
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,440
time is roughly equal to 10 to the power of minus 16 times m cubed, where m is the mass of the black

339
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,920
hole at the start of the evaporation process. If we again consider a black hole of three solar

340
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,480
masses, then we find that the evaporation time is of order 10 to the 68 years. Considering the

341
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,200
universe is believed to be around 13.8 billion years old, we see that the time taken for evaporation

342
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,480
is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe, and therefore a solar

343
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,240
mass black hole is likely to be around long after all the stars in the universe have died out,

344
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,720
making it highly unlikely that we'll ever observe the black hole's final farewell.

345
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,120
So is there any way that a black hole might evaporate in a shorter period of time? Well,

346
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,000
a quick glance at the black hole evaporation equation reveals that the only factor affecting

347
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,760
the evaporation time is the black hole mass. Could it be possible then that a black hole with

348
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,120
sufficiently small mass, perhaps created in the early universe, has an evaporation time roughly

349
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,480
equal to the age of the universe? That way, the primordial black hole could be coming towards

350
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,440
the end of its life at the present moment, and we might be able to detect the dying radiation burst

351
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,320
of the black hole. Well, it turns out that it's relatively straightforward to estimate what the

352
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,280
mass of such a black hole would need to be. We simply rearrange the black hole evaporation

353
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,480
equation for M, and substitute the age of the universe, and we find that the initial mass of

354
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,360
the black hole must have been around 10 to the power 11 kilograms, which is roughly equivalent

355
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,880
to the mass of an asteroid. Now, according to our current laws of physics, a black hole of such

356
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,840
small mass could not have formed as a result of stellar death, as is typical for black hole

357
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,000
formation. Rather, it's conceivable that such primordial black holes might have formed by random

358
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,680
fluctuations in the very early universe, and if so, these primordial black holes should be coming

359
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,360
towards the end of their lives. So what exactly happens during the last few moments of a black

360
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,120
hole's life? Well, we can estimate the amount of energy released in the last second of a black

361
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,200
hole's life, because this is equal to the energy equivalent of the mass of a black hole whose lifetime

362
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,080
equals one second. So if we sub in t equals one into the evaporation equation, we find that the

363
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,920
black hole radiates the energy equivalent of 10 to the power 5 kilograms of mass during its final

364
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,720
second. We can work out how much energy this corresponds to by using Einstein's famous equation

365
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,160
equals mc squared, and we find a value of around 10 to the power of 22 joules. By way of comparison,

366
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,480
the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated on Earth, known as the SA-bomber, released 10 to the

367
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,320
17 joules of energy, and so we see that the energy released in the final one second of a black hole

368
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,760
is roughly equivalent to the energy released by 100,000 SA nuclear bombs.

369
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,640
So could we detect this? The release of this much energy in one second might just be observable

370
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,360
here on Earth. Although it's only a fraction of a percent of the luminosity of the Sun,

371
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,160
it would come out in a characteristic burst of gamma rays which could hopefully be detected.

372
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,280
But how do we know it would be gamma rays? Well that comes from the Vien displacement law,

373
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,320
which says that for an object at temperature T, the wavelength corresponding to peak intensity

374
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,120
emission is inversely proportional to the temperature. I refer you to my video on the

375
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,640
cosmic microwave background radiation for a derivation of this result. For our purposes,

376
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,080
we can estimate the wavelength of peak emission by inserting the Hawking temperature corresponding

377
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,080
to a black hole of mass 10 to the 5 kilograms. And we find that the peak wavelength is of order

378
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,000
10 to the minus 21 meters, which is in the high energy gamma wavelength range of electromagnetic

379
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,360
radiation. And therefore the hope is that it should be possible to detect this characteristic

380
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,560
burst of gamma radiation, which signals the last few moments of an evaporating black hole's life.

381
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,320
It's worth noting that so far nothing of this nature has ever been observed,

382
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,120
and therefore at this stage primordial black holes represent a purely theoretical idea.

383
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,480
I would like to end by briefly discussing another important theoretical consequence of Hawking

384
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,960
radiation, the famous black hole information paradox. Soon after Hawking realised that

385
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,520
black holes evaporate, he recognised a serious problem. Imagine throwing a laptop or a book

386
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,880
or even a human being into a black hole. What happens to all of this information?

387
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,880
The problem that Hawking recognised is that the thermal radiation emitted from a black hole as

388
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,720
it evaporates has no memory whatsoever of what went into the black hole in the first place.

389
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,000
As we've already seen, only the mass and therefore temperature of the black hole

390
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,440
determines what type of radiation is emitted, and this would seem to imply that information

391
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,920
has been lost. In other words, we cannot use the Hawking radiation emitted from a black hole

392
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,680
to reconstruct the information content of what originally fell inside. Now this might not

393
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,440
immediately strike you as a problem, however the irretrievable loss of information conflicts with

394
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,280
one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics. According to the Schrodinger equation, physical

395
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,640
systems that change over time cannot create or destroy information, a property known as

396
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,240
unitarity. This apparent contradiction between general relativity and quantum mechanics is

397
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,800
the information paradox, so either quantum mechanics is wrong or the information somehow

398
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,560
gets out of the black hole. One possible solution to the problem is known as the holographic

399
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,640
principle, which suggests that the information content of a black hole is somehow encoded

400
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,760
on the event horizon of the black hole. So let's look at this suggestion in a bit more detail.

401
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,920
As we've already seen, Bekingstein and Hawking were able to relate the entropy of a black hole

402
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,680
to the area of the event horizon. However, according to Boltzmann's definition of entropy,

403
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,480
it should be possible to define the entropy in relation to some fundamental microstates of the

404
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,720
black hole system. So what could these fundamental microstates be? To shed some light on this,

405
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,720
notice that we can rewrite the Bekingstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of the Planck length,

406
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,920
which, if you recall, is believed to be the smallest meaningful distance that we can probe in nature.

407
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,720
If we square the Planck length, we get the Planck area, and notice that the Planck area

408
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,040
is actually contained within the Bekenstein-Hawking relation. In particular, we can write the entropy

409
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,760
as s equals k over 4 times the area of the horizon divided by the Planck area.

410
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,800
So we see that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the number of Planck areas

411
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,880
that would cover the area of the black hole event horizon. So what does this mean? Well,

412
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,720
perhaps we could use these Planck size pixels to somehow encode the information that has fallen

413
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,120
into the black hole. More specifically, imagine that each Planck's eye cell corresponds to one bit

414
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:49,280
of stored information. So for example, with one bit corresponding to one Planck's eye cell,

415
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,000
we can encode two possible states corresponding to zero and one. With two bits or two cells,

416
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
we can describe four states corresponding to zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, and one, one.

417
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,840
Continuing this pattern, we see that with n bits or n cells, we can describe two to the n states

418
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:16,320
corresponding to the two to the n sequences of binary digits. Then according to Boltzmann,

419
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,520
the entropy of the system would be equal to Boltzmann's constant multiplied by the logarithm

420
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,960
of the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. Well, if we take two to

421
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,640
the n as the number of microstates, then we see that the entropy would be proportional to the

422
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,800
logarithm of two to the n. We can then use the logarithm rule for exponents to show that the

423
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,680
log of two to the n is proportional to n. And we have already established that the number of cells

424
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,880
is proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon. And so we see we recover the

425
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,560
Beckenstein-Hawking relation. To get a sense of just how much information a black hole could

426
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,680
store using these Planck's eye cells, let's for the purposes of illustration, imagine that we

427
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,160
have a tiny black hole the size of a proton with a radius of order 10 to the minus 15 meters. We

428
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,600
can then estimate the number of bits as the ratio of the area of the event horizon to the Planck

429
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,440
area. And we see that we can answer of around 10 to the power of 41 bits, which is roughly 10 to the

430
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,000
31 gigabytes. Compare this to the total data storage on all the computers in the world,

431
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,240
which is of order 10 to the 12 gigabytes. And we see that a proton size black hole could contain

432
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,040
more information than all the world's computers by an unimaginably large factor. This general idea

433
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,400
that information is stored on the black hole horizon is known as the holographic principle,

434
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,440
since the information that falls into a black hole is somehow encoded on the two-dimensional

435
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,520
boundary, like a hologram. And therefore, according to this set of ideas, the information swallowed

436
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,720
by a black hole could be completely restored during the process of quantum evaporation,

437
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,800
since it always existed on the boundary of the black hole. The exact mechanism explaining how

438
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,080
this restoration of information takes place is still an open question in theoretical physics.

439
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,600
But there has been significant progress over the past 30 years to flesh out and generalize the

440
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,760
holographic principle, especially within the context of string theory. The remarkable conclusion

441
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,680
that comes out of this line of reasoning is the realization that in order to describe what is going

442
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,040
on in a volume of space, we need only concern ourselves with the physics that resides on the

443
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
boundary of the volume. You can think of a region of space as being surrounded by tiny

444
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,600
plank-sized pixelated cells. And when things move around inside the volume, that information is

445
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,760
somehow encoded in those cells. You can picture them lighting up. As you put more stuff inside the

446
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,520
volume of space, more of the pixels light up. And at the exact moment just before the volume

447
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,360
of space collapses to form a black hole, all of the pixels have lit up. In other words,

448
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,200
all of the information is at the boundary, not inside the space. What controls the physics

449
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,600
lives on the boundary of the space. And this is the essence of the holographic principle.

450
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,680
A detailed discussion of the holographic principle within the context of string theory

451
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,640
will no doubt form the basis of a future video. But for now, I would like to leave you with the

452
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,840
words of one of the founding fathers of the holographic principle, Leonard Susskind. The

453
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,680
universe, filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders and people, is a hologram.

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,080
An image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface. This new law of physics,

00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,880
known as the holographic principle, asserts that everything inside a region of space

456
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,560
can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.
