0	5160	According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a black hole is a region of
5160	9240	space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
9240	14040	The boundary of this region is known as the event horizon of the black hole, and
14040	18960	according to classical relativity, once an object has passed the event horizon,
18960	23720	it will never be able to escape the clutches of the black hole. However, when
23720	28040	you throw quantum mechanics into the mix, as is often the case, the situation
28040	34600	becomes a bit more subtle. In fact, in 1974, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that by
34600	39080	combining certain elements of quantum field theory with general relativity, it
39080	43760	was possible to show that black holes do in fact radiate, causing them to slowly
43760	48960	evaporate and eventually disappear. Now, I don't know about you, but when I first
48960	53400	read about black holes as a child, I was instantly hooked and desperately wanted
53400	57480	to find out more. The only problem is that the physics of black holes, and in
57480	61520	particular Hawking's work, is notoriously difficult and requires an
61520	65480	advanced knowledge of Einstein's theory of general relativity, as well as quantum
65480	69320	field theory. But is it possible to determine the most exciting and
69320	73360	mysterious properties of black holes using only advanced high school
73360	78360	mathematics? Well, it turns out the answer is yes, and in this short video, I'd like
78360	83480	to show you how. In fact, our strategy is quite simple. We are essentially going to
83480	86720	guess the structure of the black hole equations without doing the full
86720	90720	calculation, using a handy technique known as dimensional analysis.
90720	95360	Dimensional analysis is perhaps the most valuable tool in a theoretical
95360	99920	physicist's toolkit, as it allows you to construct equations without doing any of
99920	104720	the hard work, and as you will see, it's remarkably successful. So how does it work?
104720	109200	Well, the first thing to appreciate is that an equation in physics simply
109200	113480	represents a relationship between physical properties, and a measurable
113480	118480	physical property is referred to as a dimension. In what follows, we will focus
118480	123880	on the basic dimensions of length, time, mass, and temperature, which we will
123880	128920	signify with the letters L, T, M, and theta. To understand what I mean by
128920	133920	dimensional analysis, let's look at a simple example. The great thing about
133920	138160	physics equations is that they provide a relationship between the dimensions of
138160	142720	the properties appearing in the equation. For example, consider the equation
142720	147680	speed equals distance divided by time. To determine the dimensions of speed, we
147680	151880	simply refer to the defining equation, which tells us that the dimension of
151880	157200	speed is equal to the dimension of length divided by time. Square brackets are
157200	161440	used to signify that we are interested in the dimension of the quantity inside
161440	165920	the bracket. Now, it turns out that some physics equations are special, in the
165920	170960	sense that they contain what are known as fundamental constants. A fundamental
170960	175840	constant is a physical quantity that is believed to be universal in nature and
175840	181160	constant in time. The most famous example being the speed of light, which appears
181160	186560	in the famous equation equals mc2. This equation allows us to calculate the mass
186560	192480	energy of an object if we know its mass. The speed of light, c, is a fundamental
192520	198000	constant that tells us the exchange rate between mass and energy. Since c refers
198000	204040	to a speed, the dimensions of c can be written as c equals l over t. We also
204040	208640	note that we can use the equation equals mc2 to determine the dimensions of
208640	213880	energy, which can be written as ml squared over t squared. Let's now use this
213880	218280	dimensional information to explore some of the other fundamental constants that
218280	223440	will prove crucial to our understanding of black holes. Firstly, consider the
223440	227040	gravitational potential energy that exists due to the relative position of
227040	231880	two or more masses. If two masses are separated by a distance r, then the
231880	236560	gravitational potential energy can be calculated using the equation e equals
236560	242760	minus g big m little m over r, where g is Newton's gravitational constant. By
242760	246560	rearranging this equation and inserting the dimensions of energy that we
246560	252640	calculated previously, we find that the units of g are equal to l cubed over mt
252640	258120	squared. Next, consider the famous quantum energy relation e equals h bar
258120	262560	omega, which relates the energy of a quantum of light to the frequency of the
262560	267800	light. Here, h bar is the reduced Planck's constant. In order to determine the
267800	272280	dimensions of h bar, we simply rearrange the energy equation, and since
272280	276960	frequency has dimensions of inverse time, we see that the dimensions of h bar
276960	282560	is ml squared over t. The final fundamental constant that we'll be
282560	286880	concerned with relates to the field of thermodynamics, and more specifically
286880	291800	systems of large numbers of particles. According to the kinetic theory of gases,
291800	297480	for a system of n particles at temperature t, such as an ideal gas, the
297480	301560	thermal energy is related to the temperature by the equation e equals
301560	308120	three over two n kt, where k is Boltzmann's constant. By rearranging this
308120	312000	equation for Boltzmann's constant, we see that the dimensions of Boltzmann's
312000	318600	constant is given by ml squared over theta t squared. Having laid the necessary
318600	322680	foundations, we're now in a position to start building equations using the
322680	326280	fundamental constants as our building blocks. The rules of the game are as
326280	331120	follows. When using dimensional analysis to construct equations, we should include
331120	336120	the speed of light c when things are moving fast or involve light. We should
336120	340680	include the gravitational constant g when things are massive. We should include
340680	344360	Planck's constant when dealing with quantum systems, and we should include
344360	349280	Boltzmann's constant when things are hot. It sounds simple, so let's get started.
349280	353360	Our objective is to uncover the properties of black holes using
353360	358080	dimensional analysis. The good news is that our task is made significantly
358080	363160	easier because of a famous theorem known as the no-hair theorem. The no-hair
363160	366960	theorem states that all black hole solutions in general relativity can be
366960	372200	completely characterized by only three externally observable classical parameters
372200	378520	mass, electric charge and angular momentum. All other information, for which
378520	383280	hair is a metaphor about the matter that formed the black hole, disappears behind
383280	387640	the black hole event horizon and is therefore permanently inaccessible to
387640	392800	external observers. In what follows, we will focus on a special class of black
392800	397360	holes known as Schwarzschild black holes, which have neither electric charge nor
397360	401560	angular momentum, and therefore a Schwarzschild black hole is completely
401560	406200	characterized by its mass. Armed with the no-hair theorem and dimensional
406200	411120	analysis, we are now in a position to answer the following question. What is the
411120	417840	area of the event horizon of a black hole? Well firstly, black holes are
417840	421880	clearly massive objects and so our equation should include Newton's
421880	426120	gravitational constant g along with the characteristic mass of the black hole
426120	431000	m. Furthermore, we know that a black hole is a region of spacetime where
431000	435520	gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape and so we should
435520	440400	expect the speed of light to feature in our equation. Our strategy is to write
440400	445960	the area of the event horizon as a equals g to the power alpha times c to the
445960	450920	power beta times m to the power gamma and then we will use dimensional analysis
450920	456880	to determine alpha, beta and gamma. So let's do that. To fix alpha, beta and gamma,
456880	461640	we simply need to match the dimensions on either side of this expression. The
461640	466040	left hand side represents an area which has dimensions of length squared. For the
466040	470000	right hand side, we need to insert the dimensions of g and c that we
470000	476040	calculated earlier. If we do that then we find the following green expression. We
476040	480200	can then use the law of exponents to gather terms and simplify this expression
480200	485120	in which case we find the following. Now since the dimensions on both sides of
485120	489200	the equation need to match, this places a set of constraints on alpha, beta and
489200	493800	gamma. To make this clear, we can imagine writing the left hand side in an
493800	499240	equivalent form as follows. We can do this because any quantity raised to the
499280	504880	power of 0 is simply equal to 1. If we then match up the exponents of L, T and
504880	509560	m, we find a set of three simultaneous equations which can be solved by
509560	514280	substitution. After a little bit of algebra, we find that alpha equals 2,
514280	519640	beta equals minus 4 and gamma equals 2. If we then sub these values into our
519640	523880	original expression, we find that the area of the event horizon of a black
523960	530320	hole is proportional to g squared m squared divided by c to the power of 4. In
530320	534800	other words, the area of the event horizon will increase as more mass falls
534800	539280	into the black hole. More specifically, we see that if the mass of our black hole
539280	544520	doubles, then the area of the event horizon will quadruple. And so we begin
544520	548840	to see the power of dimensional analysis. Although we don't know the exact
548840	552520	value of the proportionality constant appearing in the mass area expression,
553000	556640	dimensional analysis does allow us to determine the structure of the
556640	561640	relationship. And often this is the most important part of an equation. It's
561640	565200	interesting to note that a detailed calculation of the black hole event
565200	569760	horizon yields the following exact expression. And we see that the structure
569760	574000	of this expression does indeed match the one derived using dimensional analysis.
574760	579040	So why is this mass area relationship important? And what is it telling us
579040	583480	about black holes? Well, the first thing to appreciate is that from a classical
583480	587720	point of view, nothing can ever escape from inside the event horizon of a black
587720	592520	hole. And therefore, in all physical processes, the area of the event horizon
592520	597720	can only ever increase. It can never decrease. Now, the idea that there exists
597720	601920	a quantity that can only ever increase with time might remind you of the second
601920	606760	law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system must
606800	611560	increase with time. Because entropy is such an important concept, and a key
611560	615880	part of our analysis of black holes, it's worth taking a short detour to
615880	620800	understand the concept in a bit more detail. The concept of thermodynamic
620800	625160	entropy was first introduced into gas dynamics by the German physicist
625160	630200	Rudolf Klausius. Klausius had introduced the concept to describe the flow of
630200	635320	heat. He originally defined the change in entropy of a system as the heat
635320	639040	energy it absorbed divided by the temperature at which it absorbed the
639040	643640	heat. The remarkable discovery of Klausius was that because heat always
643640	648080	moves from high temperature regions to low temperature regions, the total
648080	652160	change in entropy summed over all the parts of the system that were exchanging
652160	656680	heat with one another was always positive. The entropy was always
656680	663040	increasing. But why is this true? Although Klausius had successfully
663080	667360	introduced a mathematical definition of entropy, he was unable to provide a
667360	671640	fundamental explanation of why the second law of thermodynamics was true.
672200	678720	However, in 1877, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann provided a beautiful
678720	683200	explanation of entropy in terms of the microscopic components of a physical
683200	687600	system. According to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system is simply
687600	692160	characterized by the number of ways of rearranging the microscopic components
692160	696560	of the system in such a way that some macroscopic feature, such as the pressure
696560	701440	or temperature, remains unchanged. This statement is encoded in Boltzmann's
701440	706160	famous entropy law, which can be found etched into his gravestone. According
706160	710400	to Boltzmann's definition, the entropy of a system is equal to Boltzmann's
710400	715240	constant multiplied by the logarithm of W, where W is the number of
715240	720200	microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. To make this a bit
720200	724400	clearer, imagine the bottom of a box is completely covered with red and green
724400	729360	marbles. Now imagine that you arrange the marbles so that the left half is green
729360	734040	and the right half is red. This corresponds to a particular appearance or
734040	740120	macrostate of the system. Let's label this macrostate as the split state. If we
740120	744160	then shook the box of marbles so that the two sets of marbles became thoroughly
744160	748320	mixed together, we would see a random arrangement of the marbles, which we
748320	753480	might label as a mixed macrostate. If we then shook the box again, we would get
753480	757760	a different arrangement of the marbles, but we would still label the macrostate
757760	762680	of the system as being mixed. In fact, there are a huge number of marble
762680	768000	configurations or microstates corresponding to a mixed macrostate. On
768000	771400	the other hand, there are clearly fewer ways for the marbles to arrange
771400	776400	themselves into the neatly separated split state. Boltzmann's great insight
776400	781320	was to realize that he could define the entropy as the number of microstates
781320	786960	corresponding to a particular macrostate. Fewer microstates corresponds to lower
786960	792080	entropy and therefore more order in the system. So what has this got to do with
792080	796960	black holes? Well, you can think of a black hole as a universal waste basket
796960	801720	that swallows up information as matter falls inside. Since a black hole refuses
801720	806320	to tell us what has fallen inside, we can view a black hole as a system that
806360	812080	has the same external state for lots of possible internal states. This suggests
812080	817080	that the black hole may have a very large entropy value. But exactly how large?
817080	821560	Well, we've already uncovered the first clue when we discovered that the area of
821560	827280	the horizon of the black hole always increases when mass falls inside. In
827280	832880	1972, Jacob Beckenstein, an Israeli physicist, proposed that it does indeed
832920	837120	make sense to assign an entropy to a black hole. And furthermore, that the
837120	841920	entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. In other
841920	846800	words, Beckenstein suggested that it should be possible to write s equals eta
846800	852080	times a, where eta is a constant of proportionality. So how might we determine
852080	856800	eta? Well, the first thing we need to do is determine the dimensions of entropy,
857120	861120	since this will then allow us to figure out the dimensions of eta. To do this,
861360	865960	we refer back to the thermodynamic definition of entropy, ds equals dq
865960	870720	over t, which tells us that entropy has dimensions of energy divided by
870720	875520	temperature. And so we find that entropy has dimensions of ml squared t to the
875520	880760	minus two theta to the minus one. We can then use this to determine the
880760	885720	dimensions of eta, since eta is equal to the entropy divided by the area. And so
885720	890480	we see that the dimensions of eta must be mt to the minus two theta to the minus
890560	895760	one. Furthermore, we know that eta is a constant, and therefore eta must be
895760	900320	constructed from quantities which are themselves constant in time. And this
900320	904880	provides a strong hint that eta can be built using the fundamental constants
904880	908960	we encountered earlier. But which constant shall we use in our
908960	913840	dimensional analysis? Well, this is where we need to make an educated guess.
914480	918880	Firstly, we are dealing with gravity in black holes, and so we should expect
918880	923840	the gravitational constant and speed of light to be involved. Furthermore, since
923840	928240	we are trying to construct an equation for entropy, and entropy is connected to
928240	933280	thermodynamics, it makes sense to include Boltzmann's constant. And finally,
933280	938640	following the suggestion of Beckenstein in his original 1972 paper, we should also
938640	944480	include Planck's constant. As Beckenstein himself commented, we need not be alarmed
944480	948160	at the appearance of H-bar in the expression for black hole entropy. It is
948160	952240	as well known that H-bar also appears in the equations for entropy of many
952240	956720	thermodynamic systems that are conventionally regarded as classical. For
956720	962160	example, the Boltzmann ideal gas. This is a reflection of the fact that entropy is,
962160	967120	in a sense, a count of states of the system, and the underlying states of any
967120	972320	system are always quantum in nature. And so, following in the footsteps of
972320	976560	Beckenstein, we will propose that eta can be written as g to the alpha,
976560	983440	H-bar to the beta, c to the gamma times k to the delta. So, how do we determine alpha,
983440	988400	beta, gamma and delta? Well, as we've already seen, we simply need to apply the
988400	994480	rules of dimensional analysis. So let's do that. Firstly, we have already calculated
994480	999520	the dimensions of eta from the definition of thermodynamic entropy. Secondly,
999520	1005680	we know that the combined dimensions of g, H-bar, c and k must match these. If we
1005680	1010320	substitute the dimensions we calculated earlier for the fundamental constants,
1010320	1014640	then we find the following yellow expression. If we then use the law of
1014640	1019040	exponents to gather appropriate terms together, we can write this expression
1019040	1024640	in the following form. Just like before, we can then match exponents on either side
1024640	1030080	of the equation to form a set of simultaneous equations. If we do this,
1030080	1034560	then we find the following set of constraints. We can then solve this set of
1034560	1038960	simultaneous equations by substitution, and we find that alpha and beta equal
1038960	1044640	minus one, gamma equals three, and delta equals one. If we then substitute these
1044640	1049200	expressions back into the original equation proposed by Beckenstein, we find that,
1049200	1054240	up to an undetermined numerical factor, the entropy of a black hole is proportional
1054240	1060480	to the following expression. In 1974, using a subtle and sophisticated
1060480	1065600	combination of general relativity and quantum field theory, Stephen Hawking was able to show
1065600	1070960	that the exact form of the entropy equation includes a numerical factor of exactly one
1070960	1078240	quarter, and so the modern-day expression for black hole entropy is written as s equals k c cubed
1078240	1084640	over four h-bar g times the area of the event horizon. One of the most immediately
1084640	1089440	striking aspects of this expression is that the entropy of a black hole is going to be
1089440	1095680	incredibly large, since the equation contains a factor of c cubed in the numerator and both
1095680	1101200	Planck's constant and Newton's gravitational constant in the denominator. So what is causing
1101200	1107280	this large entropy value? Well, according to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system relates to
1107280	1112640	the number of possible microstates of the system. So if we apply this to black holes,
1112640	1116560	it suggests that black holes should have some kind of microstructure,
1116560	1122320	which we can use to count states. Furthermore, the presence of both Newton's gravitational
1122320	1128400	constant and Planck's constant in the entropy equation suggests that these black hole microstates
1128400	1131520	might have something to do with the quantum theory of gravity.
1132240	1136480	We will return to these interesting observations towards the end of this video,
1136480	1142080	but for now, we wish to use the entropy equation to understand one of the most exciting predictions
1142080	1150640	of 20th century physics, Hawking radiation. In 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered a remarkable
1150640	1156560	fact about the universe. Black holes glow, emitting faint radiation, causing them to
1156560	1161680	eventually evaporate and disappear. The exact mechanism behind Hawking radiation
1161680	1166560	involves a complex and subtle interplay between the curvature of spacetime caused by the event
1166560	1172160	horizon and quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of empty space, a topic which I hope to return to
1172160	1177440	in a future video. Hawking discovered that since radiation appears to be emitted from the region
1177440	1182080	of space surrounding the event horizon of the black hole, it should be possible to assign an
1182080	1187760	absolute temperature to the black hole, the aptly named Hawking temperature. Furthermore,
1187760	1192560	because mass and energy are seen as equivalent according to Einstein's theory, when a black hole
1192560	1197840	radiates energy, it effectively loses mass, and therefore should eventually evaporate.
1198480	1202720	So let's now turn our attention to these remarkable discoveries and see if we can
1202720	1208640	calculate the Hawking temperature and evaporation time of a black hole using our rudimentary toolkit.
1209760	1214800	Our start point is to combine the first law of thermodynamics with the definition of
1214800	1219440	thermodynamic entropy that we encountered earlier. Assuming that the black hole does
1219440	1226480	no work on its surroundings, we can set dw equal to zero, and so we can write de equals
1226480	1232640	t times ds, where de refers to the change in energy of the black hole, t the thermodynamic
1232640	1239600	temperature, and ds the entropy. If we then rewrite this expression in terms of the temperature t,
1239600	1247760	we have that t equals de by ds. Next, if we assume that the total energy content of the black hole
1247760	1253280	is due to the mass contained within it, then we can use Einstein's famous equation to write
1253280	1260080	e equals mc squared. If we then combine this with the expression for t, we see that the temperature
1260080	1267040	of the black hole can be written in the following form, which we can then invert and write as c
1267040	1274000	squared times the inverse of ds by dm. So we see that in order to calculate the temperature of our
1274080	1279200	black hole, we need to differentiate the black hole entropy with respect to mass.
1280400	1286080	And so our next task is to rewrite the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of mass.
1286720	1292720	To do that, we simply need to substitute the event horizon area equation into the entropy
1292720	1298080	equation, and we find that s is proportional to the square of the black hole mass.
1299040	1304800	If we then differentiate this entropy equation with respect to m, then we find the following green
1304800	1310560	equation. And so we are now finally in a position to determine the thermodynamic temperature of a
1310560	1316480	black hole. We simply need to substitute this green expression into the equation we wrote for the
1316480	1322320	thermodynamic temperature. If we do this, then we find that the temperature of our black hole can be
1322480	1330880	written as h bar times c cubed divided by 8 pi kgm. This temperature is known as the Hawking
1330880	1335840	temperature of the black hole, and it's the temperature that we associate with the radiation
1335840	1341520	being emitted from the black hole. One immediately striking feature of this expression is that the
1341520	1348080	Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the mass, and so the smaller the mass of a black hole,
1348160	1354880	the higher the temperature, and therefore unlike most objects, a black hole's temperature increases
1354880	1361280	as it radiates away its mass. But what kind of temperatures are we talking about? If we sub in
1361280	1366320	the values for the fundamental constants, then we find that the Hawking temperature can be approximated
1366320	1372480	by the following blue expression. To get a sense of scale, the smallest stellar mass black hole that
1372480	1378960	has so far been discovered has a mass of around three solar masses. If we insert this mass into
1378960	1384560	the blue equation, then we see that the Hawking temperature is around 2 times 10 to the minus
1384560	1392160	8 Kelvin, which is about 20 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. By way of comparison, we know
1392160	1397360	that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 2.7 Kelvin,
1398000	1403040	and therefore a black hole of this mass would actually be absorbing far more energy than it
1403040	1409280	emits and wouldn't begin to lose mass until the universe has expanded sufficiently to reduce the
1409280	1416160	temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Okay, but let's for a moment assume
1416160	1421920	that the universe has expanded sufficiently and the black hole begins to lose mass through Hawking
1421920	1428480	radiation. How long will it take for all the energy of the black hole to radiate away? To answer
1428480	1434320	this question, we need to determine the power output of the black hole, the rationale being that
1434320	1440160	since power is defined as energy per unit time, if we know the energy content of the black hole
1440160	1446000	and the power output, then we can calculate the time taken for the energy to radiate away. So our
1446000	1451840	next task is to determine how the power output of a black hole relates to the Hawking temperature.
1452320	1458400	To this we now turn. Our start point is to use dimensional analysis to estimate the power
1458400	1464640	emitted per unit area from an object with temperature T. Since we're dealing with radiation,
1464640	1469520	we should expect our equation to include the speed of light, and since we're dealing with heat,
1469520	1474720	we expect our equation to include Boltzmann's constant, along with the temperature T. And
1474720	1480400	finally, we will also include Planck's constant. After all, it was by explaining the radiation
1480400	1485520	properties of hot objects that Planck was first led to introduce the constant that bears his name.
1486320	1492000	So let's begin by assuming that the power per unit area depends on the fundamental constants
1492000	1498800	in the following way. As before, we can determine the constants alpha, beta and gamma and delta
1498800	1504960	by matching the dimensions on either side of the equation. We see that the left hand side has
1504960	1510880	dimensions of mT to the minus 3, whereas the right hand side is given by the following blue
1510880	1517520	expression. If we expand out the brackets and simplify, then we find the following green expression.
1520000	1524800	If we then match up the exponents on either side of the equation, we find the following set of
1524800	1531120	simultaneous equations, which can be solved to find that alpha equals minus 3, beta equals minus 2,
1531120	1537280	and gamma and delta equal 4. And therefore, we see that the power per unit area is given by
1537280	1543120	the following green equation, which you might recognise as the famous Steffen-Boltzmann relation,
1543120	1548640	which says that the power per unit area of a hot object is proportional to the fourth power of the
1548640	1554800	temperature. A detailed quantum mechanical calculation yields the well-known exact result,
1554800	1560160	and we see that the numerical coefficient is equal to pi squared over 60. If you're interested
1560160	1565120	in how this result is derived, I refer you to my video on the cosmic microwave background radiation.
1565840	1571840	For our purposes, let's use the Steffen-Boltzmann relation to estimate the power output of our
1571840	1577040	three solar mass black hole, which if you recall, had a Hawking temperature of 2 times 10 to the
1577040	1583040	minus 8 Kelvin. If we plug in the numbers, then we find that the power output of the black hole
1583040	1590640	is incredibly small, around 10 to the power of minus 29 watts. For comparison, our sun has a power
1590640	1597520	output of around 10 to the power of 26 watts. Given the incredibly small power output of a black hole,
1597520	1603680	we might expect that it will take a very long time for a black hole to evaporate. But exactly how long?
1604640	1609200	To answer this question, we first note that because the power of the black hole will be
1609200	1616240	changing with time, we will need to express the power relation in differential form as DE by DT.
1617120	1621840	The appearance of the minus sign is due to the fact that the power of the Hawking radiation
1621840	1628560	is the rate of energy loss of the black hole. Next, we need to take the Steffen-Boltzmann relation
1628560	1634480	and rewrite this in terms of the mass of our black hole. To do this, we need to substitute the
1634480	1641040	expressions for the event horizon area and Hawking temperature that we've already met. If we do this,
1641040	1647360	then we find the following blue equation. Note that as the mass of the black hole decreases,
1647360	1655440	the power output will actually increase. Next, we will rewrite the energy in terms of the mass
1655440	1661200	by using Einstein's equation equals mc squared, where m is the total mass of the black hole.
1661920	1667440	If we sub this into the differential expression, then we can write our power equation in terms
1667440	1673120	of the rate of change of mass instead of the rate of change of energy. This makes sense because the
1673120	1679440	right hand side of the equation is expressed in terms of the mass. In order to solve this equation,
1679440	1685760	we will use the method of separation of variables. The first step is to rearrange this equation so
1685840	1692080	that we have m squared dm on the left hand side and dt on the right hand side. If we then integrate
1692080	1697520	both sides of this equation with respect to t, we find the following yellow expression, where t
1697520	1703120	equals zero refers to when the black hole starts evaporating and t refers to some later time.
1704080	1708720	Integrating m squared will give a factor of m cubed over three on the left hand side,
1708720	1713360	whereas integrating with respect to time on the right hand side will give rise to a factor of t.
1714320	1717840	If we then insert the limits, we find the following result.
1718640	1723680	We can then use this expression to estimate the time taken for an isolated black hole to
1723680	1729920	evaporate completely. In other words, the time taken for a black hole to lose all of its mass.
1730640	1738000	To do this, let's define t equals t evaporation as the moment in time when the mass of the black
1738080	1746080	hole has reduced to zero. If we then substitute this information back into our equation and simplify,
1746080	1752080	we find the following green equation expressed in terms of the evaporation time. Finally,
1752080	1757280	if we rearrange for t, then we find that the evaporation time is proportional to the cube
1757280	1763040	of the mass of the black hole. Plugging in the values for the constants, we find that the evaporation
1763040	1769440	time is roughly equal to 10 to the power of minus 16 times m cubed, where m is the mass of the black
1769440	1775920	hole at the start of the evaporation process. If we again consider a black hole of three solar
1775920	1782480	masses, then we find that the evaporation time is of order 10 to the 68 years. Considering the
1782480	1789200	universe is believed to be around 13.8 billion years old, we see that the time taken for evaporation
1789200	1794480	is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe, and therefore a solar
1794480	1800240	mass black hole is likely to be around long after all the stars in the universe have died out,
1800240	1804720	making it highly unlikely that we'll ever observe the black hole's final farewell.
1805600	1811120	So is there any way that a black hole might evaporate in a shorter period of time? Well,
1811120	1816000	a quick glance at the black hole evaporation equation reveals that the only factor affecting
1816000	1821760	the evaporation time is the black hole mass. Could it be possible then that a black hole with
1821760	1827120	sufficiently small mass, perhaps created in the early universe, has an evaporation time roughly
1827120	1832480	equal to the age of the universe? That way, the primordial black hole could be coming towards
1832480	1837440	the end of its life at the present moment, and we might be able to detect the dying radiation burst
1837440	1842320	of the black hole. Well, it turns out that it's relatively straightforward to estimate what the
1842400	1847280	mass of such a black hole would need to be. We simply rearrange the black hole evaporation
1847280	1852480	equation for M, and substitute the age of the universe, and we find that the initial mass of
1852480	1857360	the black hole must have been around 10 to the power 11 kilograms, which is roughly equivalent
1857360	1862880	to the mass of an asteroid. Now, according to our current laws of physics, a black hole of such
1862880	1867840	small mass could not have formed as a result of stellar death, as is typical for black hole
1867840	1874000	formation. Rather, it's conceivable that such primordial black holes might have formed by random
1874000	1879680	fluctuations in the very early universe, and if so, these primordial black holes should be coming
1879680	1885360	towards the end of their lives. So what exactly happens during the last few moments of a black
1885360	1891120	hole's life? Well, we can estimate the amount of energy released in the last second of a black
1891120	1897200	hole's life, because this is equal to the energy equivalent of the mass of a black hole whose lifetime
1897200	1904080	equals one second. So if we sub in t equals one into the evaporation equation, we find that the
1904080	1909920	black hole radiates the energy equivalent of 10 to the power 5 kilograms of mass during its final
1909920	1916720	second. We can work out how much energy this corresponds to by using Einstein's famous equation
1916720	1924160	equals mc squared, and we find a value of around 10 to the power of 22 joules. By way of comparison,
1924160	1930480	the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated on Earth, known as the SA-bomber, released 10 to the
1930480	1936320	17 joules of energy, and so we see that the energy released in the final one second of a black hole
1936320	1941760	is roughly equivalent to the energy released by 100,000 SA nuclear bombs.
1943360	1948640	So could we detect this? The release of this much energy in one second might just be observable
1948640	1953360	here on Earth. Although it's only a fraction of a percent of the luminosity of the Sun,
1953360	1958160	it would come out in a characteristic burst of gamma rays which could hopefully be detected.
1958720	1963280	But how do we know it would be gamma rays? Well that comes from the Vien displacement law,
1963280	1968320	which says that for an object at temperature T, the wavelength corresponding to peak intensity
1968320	1973120	emission is inversely proportional to the temperature. I refer you to my video on the
1973120	1978640	cosmic microwave background radiation for a derivation of this result. For our purposes,
1978640	1984080	we can estimate the wavelength of peak emission by inserting the Hawking temperature corresponding
1984080	1990080	to a black hole of mass 10 to the 5 kilograms. And we find that the peak wavelength is of order
1990080	1996000	10 to the minus 21 meters, which is in the high energy gamma wavelength range of electromagnetic
1996000	2001360	radiation. And therefore the hope is that it should be possible to detect this characteristic
2001360	2006560	burst of gamma radiation, which signals the last few moments of an evaporating black hole's life.
2007280	2012320	It's worth noting that so far nothing of this nature has ever been observed,
2012320	2017120	and therefore at this stage primordial black holes represent a purely theoretical idea.
2019120	2024480	I would like to end by briefly discussing another important theoretical consequence of Hawking
2024480	2030960	radiation, the famous black hole information paradox. Soon after Hawking realised that
2031040	2037520	black holes evaporate, he recognised a serious problem. Imagine throwing a laptop or a book
2037520	2042880	or even a human being into a black hole. What happens to all of this information?
2043680	2048880	The problem that Hawking recognised is that the thermal radiation emitted from a black hole as
2048880	2054720	it evaporates has no memory whatsoever of what went into the black hole in the first place.
2055440	2060000	As we've already seen, only the mass and therefore temperature of the black hole
2060000	2065440	determines what type of radiation is emitted, and this would seem to imply that information
2065440	2071920	has been lost. In other words, we cannot use the Hawking radiation emitted from a black hole
2071920	2077680	to reconstruct the information content of what originally fell inside. Now this might not
2077680	2083440	immediately strike you as a problem, however the irretrievable loss of information conflicts with
2083440	2089280	one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics. According to the Schrodinger equation, physical
2089280	2094640	systems that change over time cannot create or destroy information, a property known as
2094640	2100240	unitarity. This apparent contradiction between general relativity and quantum mechanics is
2100240	2106800	the information paradox, so either quantum mechanics is wrong or the information somehow
2106800	2112560	gets out of the black hole. One possible solution to the problem is known as the holographic
2112560	2118640	principle, which suggests that the information content of a black hole is somehow encoded
2118720	2123760	on the event horizon of the black hole. So let's look at this suggestion in a bit more detail.
2124480	2129920	As we've already seen, Bekingstein and Hawking were able to relate the entropy of a black hole
2129920	2135680	to the area of the event horizon. However, according to Boltzmann's definition of entropy,
2135680	2140480	it should be possible to define the entropy in relation to some fundamental microstates of the
2140480	2146720	black hole system. So what could these fundamental microstates be? To shed some light on this,
2146720	2152720	notice that we can rewrite the Bekingstein-Hawking entropy equation in terms of the Planck length,
2152720	2157920	which, if you recall, is believed to be the smallest meaningful distance that we can probe in nature.
2158800	2164720	If we square the Planck length, we get the Planck area, and notice that the Planck area
2164720	2171040	is actually contained within the Bekenstein-Hawking relation. In particular, we can write the entropy
2171040	2177760	as s equals k over 4 times the area of the horizon divided by the Planck area.
2178960	2184800	So we see that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the number of Planck areas
2184800	2190880	that would cover the area of the black hole event horizon. So what does this mean? Well,
2190880	2196720	perhaps we could use these Planck size pixels to somehow encode the information that has fallen
2196720	2203120	into the black hole. More specifically, imagine that each Planck's eye cell corresponds to one bit
2203120	2209280	of stored information. So for example, with one bit corresponding to one Planck's eye cell,
2209280	2216000	we can encode two possible states corresponding to zero and one. With two bits or two cells,
2216000	2222000	we can describe four states corresponding to zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, and one, one.
2222720	2229840	Continuing this pattern, we see that with n bits or n cells, we can describe two to the n states
2229840	2236320	corresponding to the two to the n sequences of binary digits. Then according to Boltzmann,
2236320	2241520	the entropy of the system would be equal to Boltzmann's constant multiplied by the logarithm
2241520	2246960	of the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate. Well, if we take two to
2247040	2252640	the n as the number of microstates, then we see that the entropy would be proportional to the
2252640	2258800	logarithm of two to the n. We can then use the logarithm rule for exponents to show that the
2258800	2265680	log of two to the n is proportional to n. And we have already established that the number of cells
2265680	2270880	is proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon. And so we see we recover the
2270880	2276560	Beckenstein-Hawking relation. To get a sense of just how much information a black hole could
2276560	2281680	store using these Planck's eye cells, let's for the purposes of illustration, imagine that we
2281680	2288160	have a tiny black hole the size of a proton with a radius of order 10 to the minus 15 meters. We
2288160	2293600	can then estimate the number of bits as the ratio of the area of the event horizon to the Planck
2293600	2299440	area. And we see that we can answer of around 10 to the power of 41 bits, which is roughly 10 to the
2299440	2306000	31 gigabytes. Compare this to the total data storage on all the computers in the world,
2306000	2312240	which is of order 10 to the 12 gigabytes. And we see that a proton size black hole could contain
2312240	2319040	more information than all the world's computers by an unimaginably large factor. This general idea
2319040	2324400	that information is stored on the black hole horizon is known as the holographic principle,
2324400	2329440	since the information that falls into a black hole is somehow encoded on the two-dimensional
2329440	2335520	boundary, like a hologram. And therefore, according to this set of ideas, the information swallowed
2335520	2340720	by a black hole could be completely restored during the process of quantum evaporation,
2341280	2346800	since it always existed on the boundary of the black hole. The exact mechanism explaining how
2346800	2352080	this restoration of information takes place is still an open question in theoretical physics.
2352080	2357600	But there has been significant progress over the past 30 years to flesh out and generalize the
2357600	2363760	holographic principle, especially within the context of string theory. The remarkable conclusion
2363760	2369680	that comes out of this line of reasoning is the realization that in order to describe what is going
2369680	2375040	on in a volume of space, we need only concern ourselves with the physics that resides on the
2375040	2380160	boundary of the volume. You can think of a region of space as being surrounded by tiny
2380160	2385600	plank-sized pixelated cells. And when things move around inside the volume, that information is
2385600	2391760	somehow encoded in those cells. You can picture them lighting up. As you put more stuff inside the
2391760	2397520	volume of space, more of the pixels light up. And at the exact moment just before the volume
2397520	2403360	of space collapses to form a black hole, all of the pixels have lit up. In other words,
2403360	2409200	all of the information is at the boundary, not inside the space. What controls the physics
2409200	2413600	lives on the boundary of the space. And this is the essence of the holographic principle.
2415760	2419680	A detailed discussion of the holographic principle within the context of string theory
2419680	2424640	will no doubt form the basis of a future video. But for now, I would like to leave you with the
2424640	2429840	words of one of the founding fathers of the holographic principle, Leonard Susskind. The
2429840	2435680	universe, filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders and people, is a hologram.
2435680	2442080	An image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface. This new law of physics,
2442080	2446880	known as the holographic principle, asserts that everything inside a region of space
2446880	2450560	can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.
2451440	2454160	Thank you for watching and see you next time.
