1. Content moderation is a growing issue as social media platforms like Facebook face an exponential increase in content uploaded daily. This has led to a significant expansion of the workforce responsible for cleaning up the Internet, which includes reviewing and filtering out harmful or inappropriate content.

2. These content moderators often work under challenging conditions, with little recognition or support, and for low pay. Many are employed by subcontractors to distance the platform companies from direct responsibility for their workers' well-being.

3. The job can have severe psychological impacts on the moderators, with some developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to constant exposure to distressing content without adequate support or resources to cope with the trauma.

4. Grégoire, a former content moderator for Figure 8, a subcontractor of Facebook, shared his experience, including earning less than what he made at an ice cream shop and facing mental health challenges after leaving the job.

5. Sarah Roberts, a leading researcher in this field, highlighted the scale of content moderation and the economic costs involved. She also pointed out that companies push this responsibility onto low-wage workers to minimize their own costs and maintain a moral and geographic distance from the labor conditions.

6. The situation has become serious enough that some former moderators have filed lawsuits against Facebook, claiming that the work caused them psychological harm and PTSD. Despite these allegations, Facebook's parent company did not respond to requests for an interview but issued a statement emphasizing their commitment to the well-being of content moderators.

7. The sector continues to grow, with companies like Figure 8 being bought for substantial amounts of money, highlighting the lucrative nature of the industry, even as it grapples with the ethical and moral implications of its business model.
