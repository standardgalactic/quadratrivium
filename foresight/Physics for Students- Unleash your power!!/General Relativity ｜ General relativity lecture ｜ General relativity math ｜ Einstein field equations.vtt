00:00.000 --> 00:19.840
In this video we are going to look into the mathematics of general relativity, we are

00:19.840 --> 00:26.040
going to build up the basics of the foundation of the mathematics step by step one by one

00:26.040 --> 00:32.560
so that we can understand all the components, the detailed structures, the space-stand curvature,

00:32.560 --> 00:36.520
tensors, everything related to general relativity.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.120
I am keeping this video to be as simple as possible and I will make the formulations

00:42.120 --> 00:48.480
of mathematics pretty simple using analogies which are very easy to understand so that

00:48.480 --> 00:54.960
we can get to the basic root and understand the concepts of relativity using the mathematics

00:54.960 --> 00:57.080
involved in it.

00:57.080 --> 01:02.680
My name is Shaughnak and you are watching this video on my channel physics for students

01:02.680 --> 01:08.080
seasons ratings and a warm welcome to watch this video.

01:08.080 --> 01:14.320
So before we go ahead and start watching these details of the video let us look into what

01:14.320 --> 01:16.960
are the topics that we are covering.

01:16.960 --> 01:22.080
So yes we are covering Euclidean geometry then we will move to Euclidean metric covering

01:22.080 --> 01:28.080
Newton's law, what is gravitational, gravitational field, how gravitational field and Christophers

01:28.080 --> 01:33.600
symbols are related to each other then understanding a very important concept which is called a

01:33.600 --> 01:40.160
connection, what is the geometric meaning of Christophers symbols and Christophers symbols,

01:40.160 --> 01:46.120
how are they written in terms of the metric and finally we will summarize what we have

01:46.120 --> 01:47.520
learned.

01:47.520 --> 01:56.200
So first we start with the Greek philosopher and geometer Euclid, Euclid was an ancient

01:56.200 --> 02:02.600
Greek mathematician active as a geometer and logician considered to be the father of geometry

02:02.600 --> 02:08.840
he is chiefly known for the elements treatise which established the foundation of geometry

02:08.840 --> 02:14.440
that largely dominated the field until early 19th century.

02:14.440 --> 02:20.120
So here are a few of the key results of Euclidean geometry, the internal angles of a triangle

02:20.120 --> 02:26.840
add up to 180 degrees, two straight lines that are initially parallel can be extended

02:26.840 --> 02:31.520
which is known as Euclidean fifth postulate or the parallel postulate area of the circuit

02:31.520 --> 02:38.120
is given by pi r squared and the Pythagoras theorem which is the length of the hypotenuse

02:38.120 --> 02:42.240
hypotenuse squared equal to b squared plus perpendicular square.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.800
This is something elementary which we learned in the schools but as you understand mathematics

02:46.800 --> 02:52.080
is always built by adding one concept on the other so it is good to look into that.

02:52.080 --> 02:58.000
Okay so we move on to the next part where we can define a space where Euclidean geometry

02:58.000 --> 03:03.440
works which is known as Euclidean space, now it can be two dimensional or example this

03:03.440 --> 03:08.440
tabletop or it can be a three dimensional or example a cube.

03:08.440 --> 03:14.080
Now working on the approximation to the ordinary space that we look at.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.920
So this may be a statement of the obvious but we will see that Euclidean space is just

03:20.920 --> 03:27.800
not one of many possible spaces curved surfaces for examples are not Euclidean on the surface

03:27.800 --> 03:32.760
of a sphere for example lines of longitude start of parallel onto equator but meet at

03:32.760 --> 03:33.760
the poles.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.680
Now in relativity we deal with two types of four dimensional Euclidean space the first

03:39.680 --> 03:45.600
is the flat spacetime or special relativity where Euclid's parallel postulate holds and

03:45.600 --> 03:48.380
the curved spacetime of general relativity.

03:48.380 --> 03:53.840
So returning to Euclidean space Pythagoras theorem can also be used in three dimensional

03:53.840 --> 03:58.720
dimensions to calculate the corner of the opposite length of a rectangular cuboid.

03:58.720 --> 04:05.200
So what we do is that we will use this cuboid ABC and we just define this length as 1, 1

04:05.200 --> 04:10.160
and 2 and just keep it simple just to give you the basic idea so that you can understand.

04:10.160 --> 04:16.680
So here we take the 2 square plus 1 square plus the height, width and breadth and from

04:16.680 --> 04:22.080
there we calculate square root of 6 which eventually results into 2.45.

04:22.960 --> 04:28.720
Okay so now why I showed you this because if we take the same cuboid from here and we try

04:28.720 --> 04:34.880
to use this same thing so we get L square equal to A square plus B square plus C square.

04:34.880 --> 04:39.280
So what happens is that using the condition coordinates in three dimension which is as

04:39.280 --> 04:48.200
written the distance or the distance between two points x, y, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 can be

04:48.200 --> 04:54.760
given as this right or what I can do is that alternatively in terms of the interval I can

04:54.760 --> 05:01.000
write as delta L square equal to delta x square plus delta y square plus delta z square. Now

05:01.800 --> 05:05.720
why I am showing you this delta you will soon understand because this is the first notion

05:05.720 --> 05:11.160
we are trying to use the Euclidean geometry in three dimensional space and this is known

05:11.160 --> 05:16.600
is to be the space has to be Euclidean I mean to say in order to make it true and

05:17.240 --> 05:24.680
this applies for any interval when it is working for Euclidean space right and this is what we

05:24.680 --> 05:30.120
arrived to the first fundamental important mathematical concept which is called the metric.

05:30.120 --> 05:36.040
So I mean to say the metric is basically a function defines distance between two points however this

05:36.040 --> 05:40.680
interval actually applies when it is working remember in Euclidean space.

05:40.920 --> 05:48.440
Okay so we now move to the second part of our video where we will be working a little bit

05:48.440 --> 05:54.760
on the Euclidean metric which is equally important for us to learn. Now as I told you the metric is

05:54.760 --> 05:59.960
a function that defines the distance between two points in a particular space once we know the

05:59.960 --> 06:06.280
metric of a space obviously theoretically at least we can know everything about the geometry

06:06.280 --> 06:12.120
of the space what is the metric or you know it's fundamental important. So because of the nature

06:12.120 --> 06:17.320
of the Euclidean space the distance function is constant it doesn't matter where it changes so

06:17.320 --> 06:23.400
this one if you say that this is constant due to the nature of the space that means that we can

06:23.400 --> 06:30.920
plug in any values of x1, x2 minus x1, y2 minus 1 and so on and end up with the correct answer

06:31.160 --> 06:39.160
and the distance between points x1, x2, y2 and z2. So now this is something which is not

06:39.160 --> 06:45.080
same for other species. This is not same for other species but the distance function is

06:45.800 --> 06:51.560
I mean to say is not constant so to get over this problem we now introduce a kind of a

06:52.120 --> 07:04.360
new notion which is this one dLx, dLy, dLx, dx and dy and what we call these dLx, dLdxy,

07:04.360 --> 07:12.680
dyz all those and it's a four-dimensional etc. This would be what it's called coordinate

07:12.680 --> 07:18.440
differences although we discard dL it is dx, dy and z. So these are called coordinate

07:18.440 --> 07:23.960
differences and when we used to describe the distance between two infinitesimal close points

07:23.960 --> 07:30.920
in space we call this distance as line element I mean to say this is between when it is two

07:30.920 --> 07:37.400
infinitesimal close point it is called line element. So the Euclidean line element in Cartesian

07:37.400 --> 07:44.840
coordinates this is the so this is represented as this one and let me let me go back to that.

07:45.080 --> 07:51.080
Yeah so this is the Euclidean line element which is represented in Cartesian coordinates

07:51.080 --> 07:58.120
where we are taking dL equals so that is the length equals to dx square plus dy square plus dz

07:58.120 --> 08:05.560
square which is exactly the same as l square is equal to x2 minus x1 and so on which is the same

08:05.560 --> 08:11.800
in the Cartesian coordinates but in case of a curved space we need to understand something

08:11.800 --> 08:19.160
in a differential way so we are using those. Okay so now let us see that if this dL is

08:19.160 --> 08:26.360
equal to dx square for dy square so what happens is that you see this one into dx square term

08:26.360 --> 08:33.320
and one to dy square term and one to dz squares come these are actually the matrix coefficients

08:33.320 --> 08:40.200
right so we can arrange them so these are one this one this one these are basically coefficients so

08:40.200 --> 08:47.400
dx multiplied by this one equals to one and so on right so that is how it is so we can on all

08:47.400 --> 08:53.080
other products remains the same so we can arrange them and it looks like a nice kind of a matrix

08:53.080 --> 09:00.840
like this right so this matrix actually tells us how to multiply the differentials dx dy dz

09:00.840 --> 09:08.200
and we can see this in this kind of a matrix right now seeing that dx into dx times dx equals to one

09:08.200 --> 09:15.640
and dy times dy equals to one and dz times dz equals one all other products of dx dy and dz dz

09:15.640 --> 09:23.560
equals to zero so the indices if you identify i j and g by reference of rows and columns

09:26.360 --> 09:30.520
so this is the one which comes when we write now note that here is a bracket

09:31.320 --> 09:36.440
which means that we are referring specifically to the entire matrix and not to individual

09:36.440 --> 09:43.240
components so this is just a convention right so here it goes g one equals to one one g two two

09:43.240 --> 09:49.960
equals to one and g one three equals to zero and so on okay so this is something important when we

09:49.960 --> 09:56.840
are representing this into Euclidean matrix we multiply this coefficients with one in order to

09:56.840 --> 10:02.120
make it in a nice three by three matrix where all other products goes to zero and this bracket denotes

10:02.120 --> 10:08.600
that we are specifically denoting the entire matrix but not to individual component okay

10:09.240 --> 10:15.480
so now we see that this matrix actually helps us to form the metric tensor of general theory of

10:15.480 --> 10:22.760
relativity and this is something which is called a symmetric tensor so g mu nu equals to g nu mu

10:23.480 --> 10:28.840
and yeah so the metric tensor in relativity is symmetric tensor and bilinear in form this mu

10:28.840 --> 10:34.520
nu actually denotes four dimensions of space time and you will also see there are certain duplicate

10:34.520 --> 10:41.160
terms so zero one equals to one zero and so on so this actually reduces from 16 components to 10

10:41.160 --> 10:47.240
components i have shown this pretty clearly in one of my earliest videos on general relativity

10:47.240 --> 10:54.680
called richie tensor richie scalar and metric tensor which is there in the playlist of my general

10:54.680 --> 11:00.360
relativity video if you want you can look into it so this is just a kind of a quick note that

11:00.360 --> 11:08.840
how the 16 components of the metric tensor reduces to 10 components because of the duplicacy and how

11:08.840 --> 11:14.520
this g zero zero etc comes we have just seen these are the coefficients once they are multiplied

11:14.520 --> 11:20.040
it from and forms a line element it can be arranged a matrix right so till now we have

11:20.040 --> 11:26.360
understood what is the metric how it starts with the Euclidean geometry but now we turn to the real

11:26.360 --> 11:32.760
physics and we wait for somewhere someone whose birthday is nearing very soon that is Sir Isaac

11:32.760 --> 11:39.480
Newton and physics as we know is not complete by Newton's law of motion so just a quick glimpse

11:39.480 --> 11:45.080
i mean to say let us not go into that this is again you might say it's the repetition so and the

11:45.080 --> 11:51.320
first law tells that an object would remain at rest until acted upon by external force this is a quick

11:51.320 --> 12:00.200
kind of a you know visual treat that this person is kicking the ball unless acted upon by extra force

12:00.200 --> 12:06.120
so it would strain and we know that inertia is the property of a body to resist and that is called

12:06.120 --> 12:12.200
the law of inertia and the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia and is called the initial

12:12.200 --> 12:18.200
mass so we straight away move to the most important that is the second law of Newton

12:18.200 --> 12:22.520
which states that if a net force acts on an object it will cause an acceleration

12:23.240 --> 12:28.600
of that object and the relationship between an object's mass m and its acceleration a

12:28.600 --> 12:35.000
is given by this famous formula f equals to ma note that f and a i have written it in bold because

12:35.000 --> 12:40.920
i want to make sure that it is a vector notation and it also can be written in scalar notation

12:40.920 --> 12:47.880
right so the first vector form of this law is also states that the force equals the rate of

12:47.880 --> 12:53.560
change of momentum which i have shown p equals to m of v where momentum equals the mass of the

12:53.560 --> 13:00.440
object times its velocity now another way of stating the same law is this one like p equals to

13:00.440 --> 13:07.240
differential of p and t where i take this one further right so we can as you can understand

13:07.560 --> 13:14.520
pretty pretty simple i mean to say nothing more to you know tell and from here we get the si unit

13:14.520 --> 13:21.400
of Newton which is the force required to get given mass and this is one Newton that is a force

13:21.400 --> 13:28.040
required given this is one Newton to move one kg of an acceleration of one meter second square

13:28.360 --> 13:38.120
right so what we get from here we now move on to the second part where we take about from

13:38.120 --> 13:45.240
Newton's law of motion we move into what is called the gravitation right so we again stick to the

13:45.240 --> 13:51.560
laws of Newton that every particle attracts the other particle in a force that is proportional

13:51.560 --> 13:57.960
the product of the mass we all know every point at a mass attracts every other point of mass

13:57.960 --> 14:03.400
by force acting along the line intersecting two points and we know that can be expressed in

14:03.400 --> 14:10.920
this kind of a formula so we know all what it is this g is basically the Newton's constants the

14:10.920 --> 14:16.840
gravitation constant which is written over there and it also can be written as this because right

14:16.840 --> 14:24.600
so here what happens is this this is the scalar form and yeah so this r hat is basically a unit

14:24.600 --> 14:30.600
vector in the radial distance remember it's a radial distance it's pointing out from the center of

14:30.600 --> 14:38.840
the gravity right from m1 to m2 and the minus sign actually indicates that gravity is a force of

14:38.840 --> 14:45.400
attraction not repulsion all the law refers to point masses it can be shown that spherically

14:45.400 --> 14:52.200
symmetric objects behave gravitationally as if all their mass is concentrated on a central point

14:52.200 --> 14:57.960
we're not going to look much into that rather from gravitation we now move into what is called

14:57.960 --> 15:04.360
gravitational acceleration right so we move ahead with the second law the magnitude and

15:04.360 --> 15:09.640
direction which is given so if an object is freely falling in a gravitational field Newton's second

15:09.640 --> 15:16.040
law tells us that the object's mass must be to be a subject of force and this is for f equals to

15:16.040 --> 15:21.800
ma now the magnitude and direction of the force of a freely falling object is also given by

15:21.800 --> 15:27.800
Newton's law of gravitation right which is this one and we know that experiment shows that the

15:27.800 --> 15:35.320
inertial mass capital M equals to the gravitational mass small m so from here what we can do is that

15:35.320 --> 15:42.600
we can write this part of the equation and then we finally write okay yeah so the acceleration

15:42.600 --> 15:48.520
of a body due to gravity does not depend upon its mass the famous feather and iron experiment

15:48.520 --> 15:56.200
so from here we write this right so this is the mass of the gravitating body for example earth

15:56.200 --> 16:03.560
and the minus sign indicate the acceleration decreases as r increases here it is so we have

16:03.560 --> 16:08.920
till now shown the fundamental result that the acceleration of a body due to gravity

16:08.920 --> 16:14.680
does not depend on the mass I was just telling you that the feather falls as fast as breaks

16:16.200 --> 16:23.160
and so on so we know this experience right so inertial mass m equals to the gravitational mass

16:23.160 --> 16:29.160
m small so we take the gravitational mass forward acceleration forward and this is something which

16:29.160 --> 16:34.520
is a vector description of the gravitational acceleration and this is something which is a

16:34.520 --> 16:40.920
scalar description which is just a kind of a notation to make things clear so okay so when

16:40.920 --> 16:46.440
we are talking of gravitation and acceleration why don't we go into something which is called a

16:46.440 --> 16:55.880
gravitational field now gravitational field as itself it is basically a concept so it is a model

16:55.880 --> 17:02.600
or a concept you can say it is used to explain the influences that may see massive body extends

17:02.600 --> 17:08.840
onto the space around itself producing a force or another massive body so this is the gravitational

17:08.840 --> 17:15.480
field basically kind of a concept or a model that we physicists use in order to describe things

17:16.200 --> 17:26.360
so the gravitational field which we can call as g of r at any point small r is a space defined by

17:26.360 --> 17:34.200
the gravitational force felt by a unique mass at a plot place at a point r so this is a kind of a

17:34.200 --> 17:40.600
gravitating body for example you can consider this to be earth I've just given at m so and what we

17:40.600 --> 17:45.560
can do is that this is a remember just a vector field right because the gravitational force is

17:45.560 --> 17:51.480
moving the unit mass in a radial direction so this is the radial direction and it is found by

17:51.480 --> 17:57.400
taking the vector equation of Newton's law of gravitation which is this one and now what we can

17:57.400 --> 18:05.480
do f equals to minus g same what we can now do is that we can just substitute one okay just a

18:05.480 --> 18:12.760
unit mass for one of the two masses like putting unit mass and what do we get is this right so

18:12.760 --> 18:19.480
here also capital M is the mass of the credit unit in body for example earth so what happens is that

18:19.480 --> 18:26.680
this is a mass of the gravitating body right and we can plot to show the gravitational field

18:26.680 --> 18:33.880
under the uniform this kind of a uniform sphere now we know about divergence right I'm not going

18:33.880 --> 18:41.560
back so I have got a complete video on divergence in the playlist of Maxwell's equations so we

18:41.560 --> 18:46.520
know I mean to say I'm not going to explain those partials right so we made the idea of

18:46.520 --> 18:51.640
divergence we know this it's a vector field so it can be shown that the divergence of the

18:51.640 --> 19:00.040
gravitational field at any point is this one nabler dot g equals to minus 4 pi g rho right

19:00.040 --> 19:06.360
where this rho actually denotes the mass density this is a quick letter there's the mass density

19:06.360 --> 19:12.040
at that particular point and evidently what happens is that if the mass density for example

19:12.040 --> 19:18.600
we are in a space where there is no mass mass density is zero so rho becomes zero and the

19:18.600 --> 19:26.760
divergence also becomes zero right so this is to show you the basic concept of gravitational

19:26.760 --> 19:32.920
field why we are going one by one just steps because this would be required in further approaches

19:32.920 --> 19:41.320
in general activity which we will look now this nabler dot g minus 4 pi g rho is something which

19:41.320 --> 19:49.320
our old prints of mathematics has done which is called galsus law for gravity now galsus law of

19:49.320 --> 19:56.120
gravity is actually also known as galsus flux theorem of gravity and it is a law of physics

19:56.120 --> 20:02.520
that is almost equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation so it is it says it is named after

20:02.520 --> 20:08.520
Carl Fritz Rischkauss and it states that the flux or the surface integral of the gravitational field

20:08.520 --> 20:15.640
over any surface is equal to the mass in close so galsus law for gravity is more convenient sometimes

20:15.640 --> 20:23.160
to work in and Newton so this is what you know the law is just a quick note that the form of

20:23.160 --> 20:28.280
galsus law for gravity is similar to that of galsus law of electrostatics in the maximal

20:28.280 --> 20:35.400
equations so galsus gravity has the same mathematical relation to Newton that galsus law for electrostatics

20:35.400 --> 20:41.800
beers with the coulomb's law so I mean to say just I wanted to make things clear so we take a

20:41.800 --> 20:48.760
quick note on understanding these component by component so this one is the any closed surface

20:48.760 --> 20:55.000
this is the differential area this g is the gravitational field this 4 pi is the area of sphere

20:55.000 --> 21:00.520
now we are not going to take a derivation why it is 4 pi because it's 4 pi r square some of this

21:00.520 --> 21:09.000
got cancelled 4 pi g is the gravitational constant and m is the total mass so we come to this one

21:09.000 --> 21:14.200
same so this is the divergence this is the gravitational constant and this is the mass

21:14.200 --> 21:22.440
density at each point so galsus law for gravity actually states in a closed mass in a you know

21:22.440 --> 21:31.320
surface integral over a closed surface so it is good point to quickly recollect galsus law gravity

21:31.320 --> 21:38.680
also I'm going to say this is this is equally important right so this is the differential

21:38.680 --> 21:43.720
form of galsus law the earlier the left hand side is the integral form of galsus law but taking from

21:43.720 --> 21:51.400
here ahead what we need to also understand that is the core of the today's video that is gravitational

21:51.400 --> 22:00.520
potential and how it is related to christophal symbols so a name after elvin pruno christophal

22:00.520 --> 22:08.120
so we will now look a little bit deep into what is the gravitational potential now the gravitational

22:08.120 --> 22:14.200
potential as we know is denoted by this Greek letter phi right this is the gravitational potential

22:14.200 --> 22:21.720
so it is actually is defined as the work done in bringing a unit mass to that point that particular

22:21.720 --> 22:28.920
point right from an infinite place infinity so what we can say in other words that phi is the

22:28.920 --> 22:36.280
gravitational potential energy of unit mass now when we talk about gravitational potential energy

22:36.280 --> 22:42.600
the equation that immediately comes in our mind is this one right so potential energy is this we

22:42.600 --> 22:49.720
already know that from our school physics again letting one of the masses equal to one kilogram

22:49.720 --> 22:55.800
for example we put this we can define the gravitational potential field which is a scalar

22:55.800 --> 23:04.120
field as this one right phi equals to this should be not minus i'm sorry it should be minus gm by r

23:05.080 --> 23:14.280
and if we take a kind of a point at a distance r from the point mass yeah so for a for a point at a

23:14.280 --> 23:22.200
distance r from the point on the center and outside the uniform sphere of mass m so if the sphere has

23:22.200 --> 23:29.960
the radius capital r right this one would be true right this one would be true so for instance inside

23:29.960 --> 23:36.520
a uniform spherical mass if I take this one right the inside you can see this one right this one

23:36.520 --> 23:44.040
so for inside a uniform spherical mass that is for small r this one if I take the small this this

23:44.040 --> 23:51.400
holds for r which is greater than r but in case that we take a uniform mass where small r is less

23:51.400 --> 23:57.800
than bigger right so this is actually what happens a little bit you know it comes up the

23:57.800 --> 24:03.240
derivation so phi equals to minus gm to r cube thanks that I have written this time correct

24:04.040 --> 24:12.360
so right and now what we can do is that yeah so this is r 3 r square minus r square yeah

24:13.080 --> 24:21.000
so this holds actually then small r is less than big r and this holds phi equals to it should be

24:21.000 --> 24:29.160
minus gm by r anyway so if r is bigger than greater than equals to r like so at a point

24:29.160 --> 24:36.920
m at a distance r from the center and outside a uniform sphere of mass this happens and inside

24:36.920 --> 24:45.880
for a point uniform mass that it is inside this happens right okay so we now take a step back

24:45.880 --> 24:52.840
and we want to go back to that cuboid concept now why because we want to understand something

24:52.840 --> 25:00.360
which is called the magnitude of a position vector so if we take you know these lines right

25:00.360 --> 25:06.600
and what we get from here is that position vector or radial vector r from the origin o

25:07.160 --> 25:13.320
so we get this one right we already know this so we know that r equals to this one x square root

25:13.320 --> 25:20.440
of the radical of x square plus y square so in Cartesian coordinates we can now you know rewrite

25:20.440 --> 25:26.680
the gravitational potential which was this one phi equals to minus gm by r thankfully I have corrected

25:26.680 --> 25:33.080
this here right so equals to minus gm so this is the Cartesian coordinate I just wanted to

25:33.080 --> 25:39.000
take these example of skew cube so that we understand that how the square root of the denominator

25:39.000 --> 25:46.760
comes now also note that we use this nabla operator this differential operator and this is

25:46.760 --> 25:52.920
basically used for three reasons it calculates the divergence gradient and curl now if we use

25:52.920 --> 26:01.560
this nabla which is of a scalar field phi then what we get is this one right so what we get is

26:01.560 --> 26:08.360
this one I think this this this part is quite clear so we take this value okay this one yeah

26:08.360 --> 26:15.320
this is the gradient obviously so what we do is that in ordinary Euclidean space for a point a scalar

26:15.320 --> 26:22.200
phi the gradient is the vector points so we take this one this is the partial differentials and then

26:22.200 --> 26:29.240
we get this one right then we use the differential operator and we get this value calculating further

26:29.240 --> 26:35.720
we get this value now I am not explaining it right now because this requires a kind of a

26:35.720 --> 26:41.320
differential operator calculate which you can just check on the equations so we further go and

26:41.320 --> 26:50.440
we get this and now what we do is that we get ultimately the answer is this as because this

26:50.440 --> 26:59.800
small r equals to the modulus of this what we can do is that we can write yeah this one I mean to

26:59.800 --> 27:08.840
say this equal as this right and now by definition r equals to x y z equals to this this is by

27:08.840 --> 27:18.920
definition yeah given r so it denotes an ordinary Cartesian vector right and so the basis vectors

27:18.920 --> 27:26.680
are implied and we know that we don't bother to show them so some now we can rewrite this one

27:26.680 --> 27:32.920
it gets cancelled off this one r cube and all this gets cancelled off and we finally arrive into this

27:35.560 --> 27:42.440
and this is how it is treated right so now we what we do is that we find this one

27:44.120 --> 27:50.520
so this part is actually this part right so this is okay let me explain you again so now

27:50.520 --> 27:56.600
we have found an equation that relates the gravitational potential field with that of the

27:56.600 --> 28:03.080
gravitational field because this the right hand side of it is equals to this which we have dealt

28:03.080 --> 28:09.160
earlier so this is the phi the gravitational potential field which is a scalar field and this

28:09.160 --> 28:14.520
is the gravitational field which is a vector field and somehow there's a relation between these two

28:14.520 --> 28:22.600
fields and finally what we do is that it's a gravitational field so if g we replace it by

28:22.600 --> 28:30.120
nabla phi and we get this right so you can check on to this part I mean to say this is pretty simple

28:30.120 --> 28:36.280
I just trying to get in a kind of relation between the potential gravitational potential

28:36.280 --> 28:42.360
field which is a scalar with a vector and we use those differential operators in order to get this

28:42.360 --> 28:47.240
so till now what we have learned is that the gravity the gravitational potential

28:47.800 --> 28:54.680
and also we looked into how you know the gravitational potential field can be used

28:54.680 --> 29:01.960
in order to make a construct of a sphere where the solid sphere is inside and outside so I hope

29:01.960 --> 29:08.120
by but this is okay now the problem is that when we're dealing with general theory of relativity

29:08.120 --> 29:14.120
gravitational potential etc what the geometry changes with curve space time and with curve

29:14.120 --> 29:20.600
space time we need a different tool in order to establish a kind of a connection so that is what

29:20.600 --> 29:26.200
the christophal symbols does so in general again you will get a wrong notion that christophal

29:26.200 --> 29:32.840
symbols denotes gravity or gravitation potential it does in a different way so christophal symbols

29:32.840 --> 29:37.480
represent the connection coefficients of the levy-chivita connection don't worry in coming to

29:37.480 --> 29:45.080
that and they describe a change in the basis vectors through a given coordinate and it represents

29:45.080 --> 29:51.640
the fictitious forces induced by a non-initial frame of reference initial frame a non-initial

29:51.640 --> 29:57.080
frame which is moving so what we are trying to make a point over here is that when the basis of

29:57.080 --> 30:03.480
the vectors we will soon see examples changes then we need a kind of a connection and the

30:03.480 --> 30:08.920
christophal symbols actually does that but before that we'll very quickly take a look

30:08.920 --> 30:15.480
in what is called an affine connection so the notion of affine connection has its root in the

30:15.480 --> 30:22.760
19th century geometry I mean to say 10 sensor calculus it was developed later in the 1920s

30:22.760 --> 30:29.480
by Eli Carter right and Harman Weil so the many invariants of an affine connection are its torsion

30:29.480 --> 30:36.440
and curvature this is a photo you know illustration of torsion so you can see these are the tangent

30:36.440 --> 30:43.400
vector fields which connects and it can be differentiated okay so I will go step by step

30:43.400 --> 30:49.560
what I'm trying to make a point is that see in Riemannian or any pseudo Riemannian geometry we

30:49.560 --> 30:56.040
deal with manifolds right this manifold each of these manifolds are characterized by what is called

30:56.040 --> 31:01.880
an affine connection they do have an affine connection right now the manifolds also is

31:01.880 --> 31:07.480
characterized by what is called a metric tensor which measures the causal structure of space time

31:07.480 --> 31:13.240
and many other things we know what is a metric tensor now these type of manifolds who have a

31:13.240 --> 31:19.480
metric tensor they are actually called Riemannian manifolds right those who have a metric tensor

31:20.120 --> 31:26.440
now these Riemannian manifolds also have what is called an affine connection and these affine

31:26.440 --> 31:33.240
connections are called Levy-Civita connection right is named by Tulio Levy I don't remember the name

31:33.240 --> 31:39.400
of Civita right now but Tulio Levy-Civita Levy-Civita connection so the Levy-Civita connection I can

31:39.400 --> 31:45.640
tell it is a very special case of an affine connection obviously it is the affine connection

31:45.640 --> 31:51.880
for a manifold with a metric right so it is basically an affine connection of a manifold

31:51.880 --> 31:59.480
with a metric now what happens typically is that we need this affine connection or I would say

31:59.480 --> 32:06.600
that affine connection is already there because it connects the nearby tangent basis so that we can

32:06.600 --> 32:11.640
differentiate and do a better connection and Levy-Civita connection is basically

32:12.600 --> 32:16.920
a special affine connection which we will see soon how it behaves

32:19.000 --> 32:23.560
okay so now we take a quick look but I was telling that we need a special tool what is

32:23.560 --> 32:30.760
that that is called a connection now what happens is that in in the case of transporting local

32:30.760 --> 32:38.120
geometric objects from a place to others etc tangent vectors and tensor so we need a long

32:38.120 --> 32:43.880
family of curves in a parallel and consistent manner so a choice of an affine connection is also

32:43.880 --> 32:49.240
equivalent to the notion of what is called a parallel transport which is a method of transporting

32:49.240 --> 32:55.400
tangent vectors along curves now I will just use the analogy which I have used earlier in my videos

32:55.400 --> 33:01.560
also that how will you understand which one is bigger I mean to say simple concept of

33:01.560 --> 33:07.160
found rates so if we put one another arrow on the other and it overlaps then it is bigger

33:07.160 --> 33:13.080
this is obviously the smaller one right now what do we do it is a way of comparing vectors at

33:13.080 --> 33:18.360
different positions of manifold I mean to say the connection actually does what the parallel

33:18.360 --> 33:24.680
transport helps it's a way of transporting detail and smooth surfaces so let me quickly you know

33:24.680 --> 33:30.280
explain with that so here is a triangle and I've got a point this one red I'm trying to move

33:30.840 --> 33:37.880
I'm trying to keep it as safe as possible I do that I do that and then this you see that red

33:39.000 --> 33:44.280
arrow pointing towards right overlaps that that means in flat space when we have parallel

33:44.280 --> 33:51.000
transport of a vector it come back to the original point so we have no problem with that but you know

33:51.000 --> 33:57.800
generativity has got complexities and it has got curvature so we take this kind of a sphere

33:57.800 --> 34:02.920
and we stand over here this is the red point and we're trying to go to the blue point and we're

34:02.920 --> 34:09.560
carrying a kind of a you know spare or a arrow which we try to keep as straight as possible

34:09.560 --> 34:16.680
the original arrow is marked in yellow so I move over from here it is called V and I'm trying to

34:16.760 --> 34:22.680
keep it but you still see that the arrows are bending and this is because due to the curvature

34:23.240 --> 34:29.240
now from this point we try to go from the equator we are trying to keep it as clear as possible so

34:29.240 --> 34:34.600
yeah yeah the direction of the vector is due to the curvature and then from here we try to move

34:34.600 --> 34:41.480
back to a regular place right so we are keeping this as straight as possible here also but this

34:41.560 --> 34:46.440
one when we come back is a V prime which is totally different in the direction

34:46.440 --> 34:52.680
where we started that's the yellow vector so when we take out this yellow vector and this we find

34:52.680 --> 35:00.760
there's a difference V and V prime so parallel transport which is trying to move around the sphere

35:01.480 --> 35:08.360
it tries to make the sphere as constant as possible but it is not so parallel transport cannot

35:08.520 --> 35:13.720
keep vectors and all that we need something which is called a covariant derivative don't worry about

35:13.720 --> 35:19.560
the term I will soon explain you and covariant derivative is a tool which helps us to find

35:19.560 --> 35:24.360
parallel transported vector fields now who will find the parallel transported vector face the

35:24.360 --> 35:34.040
covariant derivative and in connection with another value okay so connections are basically

35:34.040 --> 35:39.720
local geometric objects they allow a comparison between local geometry at one point and local

35:39.720 --> 35:45.800
geometry at another this has got two types of connection one which measures infinite symbols

35:45.800 --> 35:50.920
and another which measures local theory and these are the different type of connections however we

35:50.920 --> 35:57.000
are just dealing with the levy-chivita connection so just to tell you that what actually you know

35:57.960 --> 36:04.440
the connections are okay so we know this is a kind of a covariant derivative and this is being

36:04.440 --> 36:11.480
replaced by the navla operator which is covariant derivative actually what happens is that levy-chivita

36:11.480 --> 36:17.080
connection refers to the covariant derivative what do we mean by covariant derivative I'm not

36:17.080 --> 36:23.720
clearly telling you but it's a kind of a derivative right so in a nice intuitive way to think about

36:23.720 --> 36:29.560
this code you know connection coefficients is to think them that they are corrections of an ordinary

36:29.560 --> 36:36.200
derivative right so because the ordinary derivatives cannot work here because the basis of the vector

36:36.200 --> 36:42.360
changes how it changes I will demonstrate to you soon and levy-chivita connection comes to save this

36:42.360 --> 36:48.760
and do the necessary corrections to an ordinary derivative so let me explain you the components

36:48.760 --> 36:56.120
of this levy-chivita connection so first we go with this right this one is basically the levy-chivita

36:56.120 --> 37:03.560
connection which connects nearby tangent spaces define a corrected notion of the derivative

37:03.560 --> 37:09.160
in arbitrary coordinates or arbitrary variables that means there is something wrong that means

37:09.160 --> 37:15.000
ordinary derivatives are not being happening we are using covariant derivative and in order to do

37:15.000 --> 37:20.200
that there is a tool which is the connection this is the levy-chivita connection right so we

37:20.200 --> 37:25.320
developed the second component which is pretty easy this is basically the ordinary derivative which

37:25.320 --> 37:32.200
basically is defined of a tangent space for example in Cartesian coordinates and this is actually this

37:32.200 --> 37:38.440
gamma term is actually a correction term remember it's a correction term called the connection

37:38.440 --> 37:45.560
coefficient or Christoffel symbol and this is correct the ordinary derivative for an arbitrary

37:45.560 --> 37:55.480
or manifold or infinite system so here note that the indices really doesn't make any sense this was

37:55.480 --> 38:00.520
because the covariant derivative is an operator that needs to act on something so the indices really

38:00.520 --> 38:06.120
doesn't make any sense so all in all this is a connection you understood what is a connection

38:06.120 --> 38:11.160
either it is different with local theory on infinite symbol it is a kind of a connection

38:11.160 --> 38:18.760
which helps us to you know correct the ordinary derivative which is not possible on a curved

38:18.760 --> 38:26.520
manifold okay so these are all mathematical calculations but as always I prefer in the video

38:26.520 --> 38:33.480
to show a geometric meaning of Christoffel symbol so that it becomes clear how it looks like so

38:33.480 --> 38:39.560
geometrically Christoffel symbols can be interpreted as describing how basis vectors changes through

38:39.560 --> 38:46.680
our coordinate system right so the basis vectors may change even due to the coordinate system being

38:46.680 --> 38:52.840
curvilinear or due to the geometry of the space as it is being curved so here I have written the

38:52.840 --> 39:00.040
Christoffel symbols essentially defined as the derivatives of basis vectors okay so here is the

39:00.120 --> 39:06.280
you know kind of a vector and what I'm going to do is that I'm going to explain it so this is how

39:06.280 --> 39:13.720
much the basis vector emu changes when it moves along the x new axis so you can just coordinate

39:13.720 --> 39:19.960
this is actually what is called the dot product however I have got a separate video which deals

39:19.960 --> 39:25.560
with the deep details of what is a dot product and cross product so intuitively understand this

39:25.640 --> 39:32.680
dot product describes how much it is derivative and the basis actually overlaps so it overlaps and

39:32.680 --> 39:37.160
it is absolutely overlap that means that they are the same and so on

39:40.440 --> 39:47.080
okay so I would like to explain you in two geometrically what is the basis vector it changes

39:47.080 --> 39:54.040
and what all those problems are all about so in a flat space we get a vector called a and this is

39:54.040 --> 40:01.320
being measured by the component a y and a x and I if I draw the lines it are more or less the same

40:01.320 --> 40:06.920
and if I take a kind of a curved surface and I plot the same I get a curved surface let's look

40:06.920 --> 40:14.360
yeah something like this so x y goes into x prime and y prime and I'm trying to make this vector

40:14.360 --> 40:19.720
the same but when I'm trying to make the measure of this vector through this component so you see

40:19.800 --> 40:25.400
the x component is something here and the y component goes something here so what happens

40:25.400 --> 40:33.080
is that when I join those I see a prime x is longer than a x we see that a prime y is also

40:33.080 --> 40:41.080
longer than a y and but the a remains invariant right so a remains invariant in the sense that

40:41.080 --> 40:46.920
it doesn't change so this is the problem that the basis of the vectors are changing in curved space

40:47.560 --> 40:55.960
so now let us say that we have some curved coordinate system this is one x1 this would

40:55.960 --> 41:03.000
be t or x2 anything that you like and this is the basis vectors like okay so these are just

41:03.000 --> 41:10.200
you know labeled as e1 e t and e x so what happens is that if you if you really calculate

41:10.200 --> 41:16.600
the dot product which we used to do in UV in a typical Cartesian coordinates the basis

41:16.680 --> 41:23.080
vector changes in the time direction and we cannot do this e dot e equal to the components

41:23.080 --> 41:27.000
we cannot do because you see here in curved space style things are changing

41:29.640 --> 41:36.040
so we take this one and we plot this one as x1 and x2 this is a curved space right

41:36.040 --> 41:42.760
curved coordinate system with x1 x2 but the basis vectors which are these which are e1 and e2

41:43.480 --> 41:50.680
now just try to imagine this is very important imagine that you move along the x1 axis and

41:50.680 --> 41:59.320
see how the basis of vector e2 changes along the x1 axis right so a small change in a vector along

41:59.320 --> 42:05.480
coordinate axis is simply the partial derivative with respect to the particular coordinate obviously

42:05.480 --> 42:10.040
you have to do a partial derivative because it's changing on a curved manifold so this

42:10.040 --> 42:17.960
derivative vector this one we take the red one can also yeah it can also components along the

42:17.960 --> 42:23.880
x1 and x2 axis obviously so this is done by taking the dot product of the red vector

42:25.080 --> 42:30.200
which I will show you this is a derivative vector right and the Christopher symbols are

42:30.200 --> 42:35.560
basically telling how the basis vectors are changing how they're actually changing

42:35.560 --> 42:46.280
okay so we see this one which if I differentiate takes this for equation this one and this one

42:46.280 --> 42:51.960
so all in all if you don't want to go into the mathematical cases of calculating those derivatives

42:51.960 --> 42:56.760
then understand that Christopher symbols geometrically represent different components

42:56.760 --> 43:02.760
of the derivative of basic vectors remember this is the different components of the derivative

43:02.760 --> 43:07.560
of basic vectors because the basis vector changes with the curved spacetime so if you

43:07.560 --> 43:12.280
you were to take the derivative of a basic vector this would give another vector right

43:12.280 --> 43:17.320
so the Christopher symbols then represent the different components of this of this new vector

43:18.040 --> 43:24.520
all these things changes now from this Christopher symbol how the vcs vectors changes and all those

43:24.520 --> 43:31.880
you will see that there is an underlying force which is also working so these are in bold remember

43:31.880 --> 43:39.000
these are corrections to an ordinary derivative okay now if these Christopher symbols which are

43:39.000 --> 43:45.160
corrections in terms of derivative if they are written in the metric form then how it would be

43:45.160 --> 43:52.040
let us have a quick look on that so we know that g mu nu is a metric tensor to define the

43:52.680 --> 44:00.200
geometric concept or on arbitrary coordinate system so we get a kind of a I would say equation like

44:00.200 --> 44:07.080
this we get a kind of a equation like this and don't worry I will just explain to you so you see

44:07.960 --> 44:14.040
these derivatives these are partial derivatives of the metric with respect to the different

44:15.320 --> 44:22.280
you know spacetime coordinates this is the basically the metric when I am writing the

44:22.600 --> 44:29.800
levy chi beta in terms of this metric this is actually happens right and this one is the index

44:29.800 --> 44:35.880
is a summation in it is a summation you know from 0 to 3 for dimension please so what I am trying to

44:35.880 --> 44:43.000
tell make a point over here is that the metric tensor to put simply is used to define different

44:43.000 --> 44:50.840
geometric concepts in arbitrary coordinate system the metric is as you know is denoted by g mu nu

44:50.840 --> 44:57.000
so the Christopher's now the Christopher symbols in the term metric it is thus how it is explained

45:01.400 --> 45:09.080
okay so what we draw a conclusion from here is that gravity is obviously a fictitious force in

45:09.080 --> 45:15.560
generativity Christopher symbols because they are denoting a change in basic vectors anything

45:15.560 --> 45:21.320
that changes it moves so the change of basic vectors obviously will give rise to fictitious

45:21.320 --> 45:28.040
force if I have gone to my earlier videos on geodesics and richie scaler you will find that

45:28.760 --> 45:35.000
how the basis of vectors changes and the geodesics are causing a curvature which is called gravity

45:35.000 --> 45:41.080
in relativity right so the change in basic vector usually gives rise to a fictitious force

45:41.960 --> 45:48.280
the Christopher symbols actually describe what are those fictitious forces and it plays the

45:48.280 --> 45:54.040
role of describing how objects actually move or get accelerated because it is actually showing the

45:54.040 --> 45:59.800
change right and Christopher symbols are gravitational fields in generativity because

45:59.800 --> 46:06.520
it is subject to change so the gravitational potential of Isaac Newton is being replaced by

46:06.520 --> 46:13.240
this one that is g mu nu the metric tensor and the gravitational force field is being replaced by

46:13.240 --> 46:21.320
this Christopher symbol now in order to understand what it is I will like to give you a quick

46:21.320 --> 46:27.160
and a very simple comparison without examples as you understand physics is not complete so

46:27.960 --> 46:34.840
in Newtonian gravity the gravitational field that is the gravitational acceleration at each

46:34.840 --> 46:42.040
point in the field is represented as a vector field right so this g which you can see is defined as

46:42.040 --> 46:48.520
the negative gradient of the gravitational potential that is why it is a minus sign so all these are

46:48.520 --> 46:55.320
partial derivatives of the gravitational potential remember that these are all partial derivatives

46:55.320 --> 47:01.720
of the gravitational potential now if I write this one right you will see these are the partial

47:01.720 --> 47:10.360
derivatives of the metric it's a big difference right so the Newtonian gravitational potential

47:11.240 --> 47:17.400
partial derivatives are the gravitational potential where in generativity partial derivatives are that

47:17.400 --> 47:23.560
of the metric and that is why gravitational potential is replaced by the metric tensor

47:23.880 --> 47:31.640
so I hope yeah you can understand what I'm trying to make it trying to make a point that how this

47:31.640 --> 47:38.920
shift really happens and this the partial derivatives in both the cases these are partial derivatives

47:38.920 --> 47:43.720
in this case Newtonian case it's gravitational potential and this is the metric

47:45.880 --> 47:50.680
okay now there is something which is called a weak field approximation it is just a hypothetical

47:50.680 --> 47:56.920
case when gravity is less and complications are less and things are moving slow you will see that

47:56.920 --> 48:03.080
Christoffel symbols are reduced which looks almost like Newtonian gravitation okay so this is the

48:03.080 --> 48:10.040
geodesic equation of weak field in generativity and you see this one this is the equation of motion

48:10.040 --> 48:16.600
in Newtonian gravity doesn't it look the same in weak field limit and this is the Christoffel symbol

48:16.680 --> 48:23.160
which looks at this limit so finally we come that Christoffel symbols represent gravitational

48:23.160 --> 48:29.720
acceleration in generativity why because it denotes the change of the basis of vectors with that

48:29.720 --> 48:37.560
change it causes the gravitational acceleration okay so just finally I just wanted to show you

48:37.560 --> 48:43.720
that the geodesic equation is basically the second law of Newton and the Einstein field

48:43.720 --> 48:50.200
equation is basically the Poisson's Poisson's equation right so now when we are talking of

48:50.200 --> 48:55.800
Poisson's equation we need to look how Poisson's equation actually reflects Einstein's field

48:55.800 --> 49:01.960
equation and that is basically what is coming up in the next part of our video we are going to

49:01.960 --> 49:08.040
look into Poisson's equation when Causs-Schmidt metric pseudo-remanian manifold geodesics parallel

49:08.040 --> 49:15.080
transport Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalars, spacetime, geodesics, energy momentum

49:15.080 --> 49:23.080
tensor and finally the Schwarz-Gill metric so yeah the mathematics of generativity will be

49:23.080 --> 49:30.280
intense it will be long so I thought to divide it into different parts so I haven't gone into the

49:30.280 --> 49:36.360
real you know summing up or the summary of this video because it is all mathematical and you know

49:36.360 --> 49:42.520
these concepts really require a summary which you can use to do so this is all I mean to say

49:42.520 --> 49:48.200
we started with you that we moved into gravitational potential and then from gravitational potential

49:48.200 --> 49:53.640
we showed that how this is related to Christoffel symbols further in from Christoffel symbols

49:53.640 --> 49:59.560
how the connection actually holds what are the different connections and so on so I will put

49:59.560 --> 50:05.000
a pause and I would like to thank you for watching this video what you can do is that you can put
