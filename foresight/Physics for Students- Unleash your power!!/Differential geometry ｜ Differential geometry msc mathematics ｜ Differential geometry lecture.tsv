0	5000	What is the first book to start in learning differential geometry?
5000	8000	What is the best choice to select books?
8000	13000	What are the most common mistakes that you make while reading books?
13000	17000	What is the method and sequence of study?
17000	21000	Will you learn the proofs first or go directly to the problems?
21000	25000	Is it difficult to start learning differential geometry?
25000	29000	In this video, I am going to answer all those questions
29000	33000	and I am going to give you the right choice of books.
33000	37000	I am also going to go through each chapter of the book,
37000	42000	explain them to you and tell you the right method of study.
42000	47000	Remember, a wrong choice right at the beginning might destroy your interest
47000	53000	as well as love for the subject forever and you may never find it interesting to study.
53000	56000	So please be careful.
56000	59000	Well, my name is Shaanak and you are watching this video on my channel,
59000	61000	Physics for Students.
61000	64000	Welcome to yet another new episode.
64000	69000	What is the right book to start learning differential geometry?
69000	72000	Well, we would go through the book and the further details,
72000	76000	but first let us see what are the topics that we are covering today.
76000	80000	We will first learn what are the mistakes that we make
80000	85000	because until we recognize them, we will continue making these mistakes forever
85000	88000	and we will fall into a forever loop.
88000	92000	How to overcome the mistakes that would be today's focus?
92000	97000	The very first book to start with, what is the edition you should select?
97000	101000	What are the reviews that are published at Amazon about that book?
101000	103000	Who should read this book?
103000	105000	I mean to say the target audience.
105000	110000	What is the content of the book and importantly how to get this book?
110000	117000	Remember, I am making this video after going through at least 20 to 25 books on differential geometry
117000	123000	and that is how I have come to this book and I want to make you very careful
123000	127000	that while you are selecting the book in order to study for the first time,
127000	132000	be very careful in understanding which book you select.
132000	136000	So, first we will understand what are the common mistakes that we make
136000	139000	and how we can overcome those.
139000	144000	So, as you see, the differential geometry as itself can be divided into two parts.
144000	147000	The first is the extrinsic differential geometry,
147000	151000	which basically consists of sub-manifolds of Euclidean space
151000	157000	and these are easy to visualize because they are mostly on R3 or a three-dimensional space.
157000	163000	Now, the intrinsic geometry are basically manifolds which contains the Riemannian metric
163000	167000	and other metric spaces and these are difficult to visualize
167000	169000	because they are very, very abstract.
169000	175000	The question is that when we are talking about difficulties in terms of visualizing
175000	181000	and something which is easy to visualize, what is the way and what is the path that we should take?
181000	185000	Now, see the common mistakes that you make is that first you do not have
185000	191000	the necessary mathematical prerequisites and you immediately jump to differential geometry,
191000	195000	you get frustrated, you get problems and you get rejection.
195000	199000	Now, I have talked at length what are the prerequisites,
199000	205000	even what are the books that you should read before getting prepared for differential geometry.
205000	211000	I would request you to look into my earlier videos which is there in the playlist of differential geometry.
211000	217000	So, my advice would be, please go through that video and first learn that yes,
217000	222000	are you ready with those mathematical tools to jump to learn differential geometry?
222000	224000	If yes, you can go ahead.
224000	231000	If not, then please go ahead and learn those prerequisites and then come to differential geometry.
232000	237000	The second problem is that you directly jump solving the problems
237000	242000	and what is the effect is that you waste time because you are unable to solve it,
242000	249000	you get confused, you look around here and there, you know, the blogs and the YouTube videos, etc.
249000	255000	and you look around to find the right solution but you waste a lot of time and you do not do.
255000	260000	And the third one is that you get into the mathematics to know without the reason,
260000	266000	which is the most important factor and we are going to make a remedy out of that.
266000	273000	You make mistakes, you are unable to visualize and the abstract mathematics becomes an enemy for you.
273000	280000	That means that it is no longer an abstract mathematics but you try to fly away and try to avoid those things.
280000	284000	The question is that what is the solution?
284000	290000	Now these are the things which are very common knowingly or unknowingly you make a mistake
290000	295000	or we make a mistake without understanding we jump directly to the problems.
295000	299000	What is the solution coming up in the next part of our video?
299000	307000	So today's focus would be in this video we would focus on which book specifically we would be talking
307000	312000	of one book because unnecessarily dealing with many books doesn't really make sense.
312000	321000	Why we should read the book and how shall we study and most importantly what is the process and method of study.
321000	327000	Now I would like to tell you that because there might be many other books which I have spoken earlier in the videos
327000	331000	as well as this book you might want all those books with you.
331000	335000	But remember there is problem which is called a choice overload.
335000	338000	If you have too many books you won't go through it.
338000	340000	If you have too many texts you won't read through it.
340000	344000	If you have too many solutions you won't run through the solutions.
344000	350000	So what will happen it will remain in the text box in the text of that or in your inbox or in your hard drive.
350000	356000	So let us pick up one book concentrate learn that and that would solve our problem.
356000	363000	So the first thing is that you understand we need to understand why you are studying the subject.
363000	369000	If you understand why you study the object then you get a proper direction and objective that okay
369000	373000	so I know what I am learning and what is the direction.
373000	377000	Now once you get a proper direction you start seeing what is in front of you.
377000	382000	That means okay this is not abstract but something I can see that this is the result
382000	385000	this is the outcome and this is the practical application.
385000	390000	And what will happen is that abstract mathematics starts to become concrete.
390000	396000	As I was telling that if you jump directly without knowing the objective it will forever remain as an abstract enemy.
396000	401000	But if you start seeing what is in front of you the abstract mathematics starts to become concrete.
401000	408000	You can understand the practical application of the subject which will give you a concrete reason
408000	412000	that when you do the mathematics you do it with a proper reason.
412000	416000	What is the final outcome of all those things that we are talking.
416000	421000	You would start loving differential geometry and I can tell you it is one of the most modern
421000	429000	and one of the most interesting subject which can give you a great career and a great learning ahead.
429000	432000	So what is the first books to start with.
432000	437000	Now before we start mentioning about the book we should know what is the objective.
437000	444000	So we will enjoy the learning differential geometry to know the present we need to know a little bit about the past.
444000	450000	You really know the reason why those theorems came and once you know the reason why those theorems came
450000	453000	the learning becomes much more effective.
453000	458000	So this is the reason that why you should read this book to enjoy to know the present
458000	464000	and you know what the theorems coming from so that the understanding become fun.
464000	468000	Okay so there are several editions of the book that I am talking about.
468000	476000	This is the book called Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometrics Development and History by Marvin J. Greenberg.
476000	478000	And this is the book we are going to talk about.
478000	484000	It contains the mathematics, it contains proofs and many other things which are yet to explore.
484000	487000	So the first edition would look like this.
487000	489000	The second edition has changed its color.
489000	493000	The third edition would be this and the fourth edition is the black one.
493000	496000	So more or less you can expect the fourth edition.
496000	500000	The first and second are there but I won't recommend to read it.
500000	506000	So let us start with the third edition and the total number of pages are around 665.
506000	508000	It's quite a heavy book to read.
508000	510000	Okay so what is the price at Amazon?
510000	512000	It is around in India.
512000	519000	Amazon it is around 26,000, 17,000 and if you want to buy a paperback it is 16,625.
519000	520000	Don't worry about the price.
520000	523000	There is an element of surprise waiting at you.
523000	524000	How do you get this book?
525000	536000	Okay if I go to amazon.com then it is around 13.34 dollars and it comes for 34 dollars and the fourth edition comes for about 99.95 dollars.
536000	541000	So you see here we get the third and the fourth edition.
541000	546000	But if I go to Amazon India I even get the first, second, third and the fourth edition.
546000	553000	And if you go for an e-text book it would be around how much it is coming to 63 to something.
553000	554000	That's it.
554000	557000	Okay so this is the book.
557000	560000	It has got an Amazon rating of 66 percent.
560000	561000	This is the professor.
561000	563000	He is an American professor of mathematics.
563000	570000	Marvin J. Greenberg and received his doctorate from Princeton University under the famous Sir Glank.
570000	576000	And you know who Sir Glank got a lot of books on differential geometry and specifically on linear algebra.
576000	579000	Okay what is the review at Amazon?
579000	588000	So it has got a five star and more or less you can see whether for class or for personal learning remarkable somebody has written four stars.
588000	589000	It is a good deal.
589000	593000	So more or less you can see great content but bad impression.
593000	596000	This bad impression you can read is basically for the printing.
596000	600000	But overall that means it says that it is quite a good book.
600000	601000	Okay.
601000	604000	Question is that who should start reading this book?
604000	606000	I mean to say who is the target audience?
606000	617000	So you see the author himself has written over here school and college geometry teachers with a rigorous treatment of the foundations of Euclidean geometry and introduction to hyperbolic geometry.
617000	626000	General education even liberal arts students can go through it who are willing to know the philosophical implication and the discovery of non Euclidean geometry.
626000	636000	So it is very clear high school and college geometry teachers and it can go ahead with general education and liberal arts people.
636000	637000	Okay.
637000	646000	And he has further written that here you see if students do not do a good number of exercises they will have difficulty following subsequent chapters.
646000	654000	So that means this book which we are going through will have a lot of exercises and I encourage you doing those exercises otherwise you won't be able to learn.
654000	660000	Now the question is that before jumping into maths one of the things that you really need to know.
660000	661000	Okay.
661000	662000	Who should read this book?
662000	665000	Now here is an important thing.
665000	673000	See he has written that I have used the development of non Euclidean geometry to revive the interest in the study of Euclidean geometry.
673000	681000	So you see it goes the other way round instead of going from Euclidean he starts with non Euclidean because that is far more fairly more interesting.
681000	685000	We will all agree on that so that the people have an interest in Euclidean geometry.
685000	691000	So you will learn the non Euclidean geometry and then you learn Euclidean geometry much better.
691000	697000	So I believe that this approach makes a traditional college course in Euclidean geometry more interesting.
697000	698000	Okay.
698000	699000	Okay.
699000	700000	Yeah.
700000	701000	That's it.
702000	706000	So we will see the content of the book very in details.
706000	713000	The first would be the Euclid geometry which basically starts you see we are starting with Euclidean geometry.
713000	714000	Why?
714000	716000	Because we want to make the base very strong.
716000	719000	So there is a very brief survey of the beginnings of geometry.
719000	725000	It starts a little bit with the history that is the Pythagoreans and then it goes to Euclid of Alexandria.
725000	732000	So this is very important because until we know who are the founders and how things happen it would be difficult.
732000	738000	The book goes further into Euclid's first four postulates attempt to prove the parallel postulate.
738000	741000	There are figures like that and that's it.
741000	748000	So Descartes analytic geometries being covered and the briefly the number pi along with I mean to say a little bit of history.
748000	757000	So you establish a relationship with these geometries and these people were way back in the history and that is how you start learning that.
757000	758000	Okay.
758000	769000	Logic and incidence geometry incidence geometry you all know that when we remove those curves and these functions and angles what it is basically the line and the point that is called.
769000	777000	So here you see logic and incidence geometry has to start with teaching you what is called elementary logic.
777000	786000	So you see it starts with elementary logic then it teaches the theorems and proof if hypothesis then conclusion and it can be translated.
786000	793000	So if first you are again learning logic why because there will be certain proof based systems which you need to prove.
793000	798000	Then the book will go into see this logic rule and it explains all those symbols also.
798000	804000	So if you don't know logical quantifiers you can take a deep breath because this book is going to teach you that.
804000	814000	And you see that incidence axiom one two and so on and then at the end there's a huge number of exercises projects and things like that.
814000	823000	So here you see the definition is given with axiom a brief history of real projective geometry and what is projective and affine planes.
823000	831000	Then we start with Hilbert's axioms the flaws in equate the axiom of betweenness and what are the axioms of betweenness that is being covered.
831000	834000	Then we forth come to what is called neutral geometry.
834000	838000	I have just mentioned those because otherwise it would be too long.
838000	846000	It will start with geometry with parallel axiom then a exterior angle theorem and angle sum of a triangle conclusion and so on.
846000	849000	Then it moves into history of the parallel postulate.
849000	855000	So you see now that we have understood a little bit of the geometry it is important that we know the history.
855000	861000	So it starts with very ancient history of Proclus then the concept of equidistance.
861000	871000	Then John Wallace who made contributions in analytic geometry the Claudius and Proclus theorem and then the Farkas-Boli.
871000	879000	So everything regarding the history of the parallel postulate is covered so that you don't have any problem understanding where from the theorem scheme.
880000	883000	The discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is covered.
883000	889000	It is a good history and people like Gauss, Riemann and Lobaczkowski is being covered.
889000	893000	So parallel line similar triangles it is an excellent read.
893000	898000	Then the seventh chapter speaks of the independence of parallel postulate.
898000	905000	So you see the Poincare model the inversions in circles models bell tram is interpretation and everything.
905000	911000	This is very important it books contains philosophical implications fruitful and applications.
911000	916000	So here you see what are the philosophical implications what is the geometry of physical space very important.
916000	927000	What is mathematics all about the controversies about foundations of mathematics and the fruitfulness of hyperboleic geometry for other branches of mathematics cosmology and art.
928000	938000	So you see why it is important because once we go on through the seven chapters now we are going deep into the philosophical implications and fruitful applications.
938000	950000	Finally it goes into geometric transformations which would include motions and similarities client learning or Erlanger program and this is the entire list of geometric transformation.
950000	955000	So now let us take a pause and you understand how well this book is organized.
955000	970000	It starts right at the beginning with the history then it goes into mathematics then it teaches you logic then again it goes back to the history of parallel postulate then it goes back to the mathematics and then it goes back to the philosophy and then finally geometric transformations.
971000	975000	The 10th chapter deals with further results in hyperboleic geometry.
975000	977000	So these are the hyperboleic trigonometry.
977000	982000	Sashary Lambert quadrilaterals boilize construction and all those things.
982000	990000	Finally it contains an appendix to appendix elliptic another Riemannian geometries Hilbert's geometry without real numbers.
990000	999000	So what we can summarize from this is that we need to first understand the reason for learning then how the development of thoughts took place.
999000	1009000	Why those theorem and proves are developed what is learning through history which makes it more interesting and the actual reason then comes in front.
1010000	1021000	So this is kind of a quick summary and this is the first book before going anything into other things like Gauss theorem and Gauss Bonnet theorem etc.
1021000	1023000	This is the first book.
1023000	1026000	I know it contains a lot of pages.
1026000	1034000	It is a long read but you will see how the entire journey of differential geometry is evolving in front of you.
1034000	1042000	You can go and you can live through those philosophers mathematicians starting from Greek and coming up to Bolli and other new geometries.
1042000	1044000	So that is interesting.
1044000	1049000	That gives you the motivation and you find and fall in love with differential geometry.
1049000	1052000	Now the question is that how to get this book.
1052000	1054000	You know it is very simple.
1054000	1062000	All you need to do is to write me an email or contact me over WhatsApp and yes obviously you need to subscribe to my channel physics for students.
