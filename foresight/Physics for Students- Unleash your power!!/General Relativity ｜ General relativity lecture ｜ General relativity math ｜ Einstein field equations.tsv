0	19840	In this video we are going to look into the mathematics of general relativity, we are
19840	26040	going to build up the basics of the foundation of the mathematics step by step one by one
26040	32560	so that we can understand all the components, the detailed structures, the space-stand curvature,
32560	36520	tensors, everything related to general relativity.
36520	42120	I am keeping this video to be as simple as possible and I will make the formulations
42120	48480	of mathematics pretty simple using analogies which are very easy to understand so that
48480	54960	we can get to the basic root and understand the concepts of relativity using the mathematics
54960	57080	involved in it.
57080	62680	My name is Shaughnak and you are watching this video on my channel physics for students
62680	68080	seasons ratings and a warm welcome to watch this video.
68080	74320	So before we go ahead and start watching these details of the video let us look into what
74320	76960	are the topics that we are covering.
76960	82080	So yes we are covering Euclidean geometry then we will move to Euclidean metric covering
82080	88080	Newton's law, what is gravitational, gravitational field, how gravitational field and Christophers
88080	93600	symbols are related to each other then understanding a very important concept which is called a
93600	100160	connection, what is the geometric meaning of Christophers symbols and Christophers symbols,
100160	106120	how are they written in terms of the metric and finally we will summarize what we have
106120	107520	learned.
107520	116200	So first we start with the Greek philosopher and geometer Euclid, Euclid was an ancient
116200	122600	Greek mathematician active as a geometer and logician considered to be the father of geometry
122600	128840	he is chiefly known for the elements treatise which established the foundation of geometry
128840	134440	that largely dominated the field until early 19th century.
134440	140120	So here are a few of the key results of Euclidean geometry, the internal angles of a triangle
140120	146840	add up to 180 degrees, two straight lines that are initially parallel can be extended
146840	151520	which is known as Euclidean fifth postulate or the parallel postulate area of the circuit
151520	158120	is given by pi r squared and the Pythagoras theorem which is the length of the hypotenuse
158120	162240	hypotenuse squared equal to b squared plus perpendicular square.
162240	166800	This is something elementary which we learned in the schools but as you understand mathematics
166800	172080	is always built by adding one concept on the other so it is good to look into that.
172080	178000	Okay so we move on to the next part where we can define a space where Euclidean geometry
178000	183440	works which is known as Euclidean space, now it can be two dimensional or example this
183440	188440	tabletop or it can be a three dimensional or example a cube.
188440	194080	Now working on the approximation to the ordinary space that we look at.
194080	200920	So this may be a statement of the obvious but we will see that Euclidean space is just
200920	207800	not one of many possible spaces curved surfaces for examples are not Euclidean on the surface
207800	212760	of a sphere for example lines of longitude start of parallel onto equator but meet at
212760	213760	the poles.
213760	219680	Now in relativity we deal with two types of four dimensional Euclidean space the first
219680	225600	is the flat spacetime or special relativity where Euclid's parallel postulate holds and
225600	228380	the curved spacetime of general relativity.
228380	233840	So returning to Euclidean space Pythagoras theorem can also be used in three dimensional
233840	238720	dimensions to calculate the corner of the opposite length of a rectangular cuboid.
238720	245200	So what we do is that we will use this cuboid ABC and we just define this length as 1, 1
245200	250160	and 2 and just keep it simple just to give you the basic idea so that you can understand.
250160	256680	So here we take the 2 square plus 1 square plus the height, width and breadth and from
256680	262080	there we calculate square root of 6 which eventually results into 2.45.
262960	268720	Okay so now why I showed you this because if we take the same cuboid from here and we try
268720	274880	to use this same thing so we get L square equal to A square plus B square plus C square.
274880	279280	So what happens is that using the condition coordinates in three dimension which is as
279280	288200	written the distance or the distance between two points x, y, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 can be
288200	294760	given as this right or what I can do is that alternatively in terms of the interval I can
294760	301000	write as delta L square equal to delta x square plus delta y square plus delta z square. Now
301800	305720	why I am showing you this delta you will soon understand because this is the first notion
305720	311160	we are trying to use the Euclidean geometry in three dimensional space and this is known
311160	316600	is to be the space has to be Euclidean I mean to say in order to make it true and
317240	324680	this applies for any interval when it is working for Euclidean space right and this is what we
324680	330120	arrived to the first fundamental important mathematical concept which is called the metric.
330120	336040	So I mean to say the metric is basically a function defines distance between two points however this
336040	340680	interval actually applies when it is working remember in Euclidean space.
340920	348440	Okay so we now move to the second part of our video where we will be working a little bit
348440	354760	on the Euclidean metric which is equally important for us to learn. Now as I told you the metric is
354760	359960	a function that defines the distance between two points in a particular space once we know the
359960	366280	metric of a space obviously theoretically at least we can know everything about the geometry
366280	372120	of the space what is the metric or you know it's fundamental important. So because of the nature
372120	377320	of the Euclidean space the distance function is constant it doesn't matter where it changes so
377320	383400	this one if you say that this is constant due to the nature of the space that means that we can
383400	390920	plug in any values of x1, x2 minus x1, y2 minus 1 and so on and end up with the correct answer
391160	399160	and the distance between points x1, x2, y2 and z2. So now this is something which is not
399160	405080	same for other species. This is not same for other species but the distance function is
405800	411560	I mean to say is not constant so to get over this problem we now introduce a kind of a
412120	424360	new notion which is this one dLx, dLy, dLx, dx and dy and what we call these dLx, dLdxy,
424360	432680	dyz all those and it's a four-dimensional etc. This would be what it's called coordinate
432680	438440	differences although we discard dL it is dx, dy and z. So these are called coordinate
438440	443960	differences and when we used to describe the distance between two infinitesimal close points
443960	450920	in space we call this distance as line element I mean to say this is between when it is two
450920	457400	infinitesimal close point it is called line element. So the Euclidean line element in Cartesian
457400	464840	coordinates this is the so this is represented as this one and let me let me go back to that.
465080	471080	Yeah so this is the Euclidean line element which is represented in Cartesian coordinates
471080	478120	where we are taking dL equals so that is the length equals to dx square plus dy square plus dz
478120	485560	square which is exactly the same as l square is equal to x2 minus x1 and so on which is the same
485560	491800	in the Cartesian coordinates but in case of a curved space we need to understand something
491800	499160	in a differential way so we are using those. Okay so now let us see that if this dL is
499160	506360	equal to dx square for dy square so what happens is that you see this one into dx square term
506360	513320	and one to dy square term and one to dz squares come these are actually the matrix coefficients
513320	520200	right so we can arrange them so these are one this one this one these are basically coefficients so
520200	527400	dx multiplied by this one equals to one and so on right so that is how it is so we can on all
527400	533080	other products remains the same so we can arrange them and it looks like a nice kind of a matrix
533080	540840	like this right so this matrix actually tells us how to multiply the differentials dx dy dz
540840	548200	and we can see this in this kind of a matrix right now seeing that dx into dx times dx equals to one
548200	555640	and dy times dy equals to one and dz times dz equals one all other products of dx dy and dz dz
555640	563560	equals to zero so the indices if you identify i j and g by reference of rows and columns
566360	570520	so this is the one which comes when we write now note that here is a bracket
571320	576440	which means that we are referring specifically to the entire matrix and not to individual
576440	583240	components so this is just a convention right so here it goes g one equals to one one g two two
583240	589960	equals to one and g one three equals to zero and so on okay so this is something important when we
589960	596840	are representing this into Euclidean matrix we multiply this coefficients with one in order to
596840	602120	make it in a nice three by three matrix where all other products goes to zero and this bracket denotes
602120	608600	that we are specifically denoting the entire matrix but not to individual component okay
609240	615480	so now we see that this matrix actually helps us to form the metric tensor of general theory of
615480	622760	relativity and this is something which is called a symmetric tensor so g mu nu equals to g nu mu
623480	628840	and yeah so the metric tensor in relativity is symmetric tensor and bilinear in form this mu
628840	634520	nu actually denotes four dimensions of space time and you will also see there are certain duplicate
634520	641160	terms so zero one equals to one zero and so on so this actually reduces from 16 components to 10
641160	647240	components i have shown this pretty clearly in one of my earliest videos on general relativity
647240	654680	called richie tensor richie scalar and metric tensor which is there in the playlist of my general
654680	660360	relativity video if you want you can look into it so this is just a kind of a quick note that
660360	668840	how the 16 components of the metric tensor reduces to 10 components because of the duplicacy and how
668840	674520	this g zero zero etc comes we have just seen these are the coefficients once they are multiplied
674520	680040	it from and forms a line element it can be arranged a matrix right so till now we have
680040	686360	understood what is the metric how it starts with the Euclidean geometry but now we turn to the real
686360	692760	physics and we wait for somewhere someone whose birthday is nearing very soon that is Sir Isaac
692760	699480	Newton and physics as we know is not complete by Newton's law of motion so just a quick glimpse
699480	705080	i mean to say let us not go into that this is again you might say it's the repetition so and the
705080	711320	first law tells that an object would remain at rest until acted upon by external force this is a quick
711320	720200	kind of a you know visual treat that this person is kicking the ball unless acted upon by extra force
720200	726120	so it would strain and we know that inertia is the property of a body to resist and that is called
726120	732200	the law of inertia and the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia and is called the initial
732200	738200	mass so we straight away move to the most important that is the second law of Newton
738200	742520	which states that if a net force acts on an object it will cause an acceleration
743240	748600	of that object and the relationship between an object's mass m and its acceleration a
748600	755000	is given by this famous formula f equals to ma note that f and a i have written it in bold because
755000	760920	i want to make sure that it is a vector notation and it also can be written in scalar notation
760920	767880	right so the first vector form of this law is also states that the force equals the rate of
767880	773560	change of momentum which i have shown p equals to m of v where momentum equals the mass of the
773560	780440	object times its velocity now another way of stating the same law is this one like p equals to
780440	787240	differential of p and t where i take this one further right so we can as you can understand
787560	794520	pretty pretty simple i mean to say nothing more to you know tell and from here we get the si unit
794520	801400	of Newton which is the force required to get given mass and this is one Newton that is a force
801400	808040	required given this is one Newton to move one kg of an acceleration of one meter second square
808360	818120	right so what we get from here we now move on to the second part where we take about from
818120	825240	Newton's law of motion we move into what is called the gravitation right so we again stick to the
825240	831560	laws of Newton that every particle attracts the other particle in a force that is proportional
831560	837960	the product of the mass we all know every point at a mass attracts every other point of mass
837960	843400	by force acting along the line intersecting two points and we know that can be expressed in
843400	850920	this kind of a formula so we know all what it is this g is basically the Newton's constants the
850920	856840	gravitation constant which is written over there and it also can be written as this because right
856840	864600	so here what happens is this this is the scalar form and yeah so this r hat is basically a unit
864600	870600	vector in the radial distance remember it's a radial distance it's pointing out from the center of
870600	878840	the gravity right from m1 to m2 and the minus sign actually indicates that gravity is a force of
878840	885400	attraction not repulsion all the law refers to point masses it can be shown that spherically
885400	892200	symmetric objects behave gravitationally as if all their mass is concentrated on a central point
892200	897960	we're not going to look much into that rather from gravitation we now move into what is called
897960	904360	gravitational acceleration right so we move ahead with the second law the magnitude and
904360	909640	direction which is given so if an object is freely falling in a gravitational field Newton's second
909640	916040	law tells us that the object's mass must be to be a subject of force and this is for f equals to
916040	921800	ma now the magnitude and direction of the force of a freely falling object is also given by
921800	927800	Newton's law of gravitation right which is this one and we know that experiment shows that the
927800	935320	inertial mass capital M equals to the gravitational mass small m so from here what we can do is that
935320	942600	we can write this part of the equation and then we finally write okay yeah so the acceleration
942600	948520	of a body due to gravity does not depend upon its mass the famous feather and iron experiment
948520	956200	so from here we write this right so this is the mass of the gravitating body for example earth
956200	963560	and the minus sign indicate the acceleration decreases as r increases here it is so we have
963560	968920	till now shown the fundamental result that the acceleration of a body due to gravity
968920	974680	does not depend on the mass I was just telling you that the feather falls as fast as breaks
976200	983160	and so on so we know this experience right so inertial mass m equals to the gravitational mass
983160	989160	m small so we take the gravitational mass forward acceleration forward and this is something which
989160	994520	is a vector description of the gravitational acceleration and this is something which is a
994520	1000920	scalar description which is just a kind of a notation to make things clear so okay so when
1000920	1006440	we are talking of gravitation and acceleration why don't we go into something which is called a
1006440	1015880	gravitational field now gravitational field as itself it is basically a concept so it is a model
1015880	1022600	or a concept you can say it is used to explain the influences that may see massive body extends
1022600	1028840	onto the space around itself producing a force or another massive body so this is the gravitational
1028840	1035480	field basically kind of a concept or a model that we physicists use in order to describe things
1036200	1046360	so the gravitational field which we can call as g of r at any point small r is a space defined by
1046360	1054200	the gravitational force felt by a unique mass at a plot place at a point r so this is a kind of a
1054200	1060600	gravitating body for example you can consider this to be earth I've just given at m so and what we
1060600	1065560	can do is that this is a remember just a vector field right because the gravitational force is
1065560	1071480	moving the unit mass in a radial direction so this is the radial direction and it is found by
1071480	1077400	taking the vector equation of Newton's law of gravitation which is this one and now what we can
1077400	1085480	do f equals to minus g same what we can now do is that we can just substitute one okay just a
1085480	1092760	unit mass for one of the two masses like putting unit mass and what do we get is this right so
1092760	1099480	here also capital M is the mass of the credit unit in body for example earth so what happens is that
1099480	1106680	this is a mass of the gravitating body right and we can plot to show the gravitational field
1106680	1113880	under the uniform this kind of a uniform sphere now we know about divergence right I'm not going
1113880	1121560	back so I have got a complete video on divergence in the playlist of Maxwell's equations so we
1121560	1126520	know I mean to say I'm not going to explain those partials right so we made the idea of
1126520	1131640	divergence we know this it's a vector field so it can be shown that the divergence of the
1131640	1140040	gravitational field at any point is this one nabler dot g equals to minus 4 pi g rho right
1140040	1146360	where this rho actually denotes the mass density this is a quick letter there's the mass density
1146360	1152040	at that particular point and evidently what happens is that if the mass density for example
1152040	1158600	we are in a space where there is no mass mass density is zero so rho becomes zero and the
1158600	1166760	divergence also becomes zero right so this is to show you the basic concept of gravitational
1166760	1172920	field why we are going one by one just steps because this would be required in further approaches
1172920	1181320	in general activity which we will look now this nabler dot g minus 4 pi g rho is something which
1181320	1189320	our old prints of mathematics has done which is called galsus law for gravity now galsus law of
1189320	1196120	gravity is actually also known as galsus flux theorem of gravity and it is a law of physics
1196120	1202520	that is almost equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation so it is it says it is named after
1202520	1208520	Carl Fritz Rischkauss and it states that the flux or the surface integral of the gravitational field
1208520	1215640	over any surface is equal to the mass in close so galsus law for gravity is more convenient sometimes
1215640	1223160	to work in and Newton so this is what you know the law is just a quick note that the form of
1223160	1228280	galsus law for gravity is similar to that of galsus law of electrostatics in the maximal
1228280	1235400	equations so galsus gravity has the same mathematical relation to Newton that galsus law for electrostatics
1235400	1241800	beers with the coulomb's law so I mean to say just I wanted to make things clear so we take a
1241800	1248760	quick note on understanding these component by component so this one is the any closed surface
1248760	1255000	this is the differential area this g is the gravitational field this 4 pi is the area of sphere
1255000	1260520	now we are not going to take a derivation why it is 4 pi because it's 4 pi r square some of this
1260520	1269000	got cancelled 4 pi g is the gravitational constant and m is the total mass so we come to this one
1269000	1274200	same so this is the divergence this is the gravitational constant and this is the mass
1274200	1282440	density at each point so galsus law for gravity actually states in a closed mass in a you know
1282440	1291320	surface integral over a closed surface so it is good point to quickly recollect galsus law gravity
1291320	1298680	also I'm going to say this is this is equally important right so this is the differential
1298680	1303720	form of galsus law the earlier the left hand side is the integral form of galsus law but taking from
1303720	1311400	here ahead what we need to also understand that is the core of the today's video that is gravitational
1311400	1320520	potential and how it is related to christophal symbols so a name after elvin pruno christophal
1320520	1328120	so we will now look a little bit deep into what is the gravitational potential now the gravitational
1328120	1334200	potential as we know is denoted by this Greek letter phi right this is the gravitational potential
1334200	1341720	so it is actually is defined as the work done in bringing a unit mass to that point that particular
1341720	1348920	point right from an infinite place infinity so what we can say in other words that phi is the
1348920	1356280	gravitational potential energy of unit mass now when we talk about gravitational potential energy
1356280	1362600	the equation that immediately comes in our mind is this one right so potential energy is this we
1362600	1369720	already know that from our school physics again letting one of the masses equal to one kilogram
1369720	1375800	for example we put this we can define the gravitational potential field which is a scalar
1375800	1384120	field as this one right phi equals to this should be not minus i'm sorry it should be minus gm by r
1385080	1394280	and if we take a kind of a point at a distance r from the point mass yeah so for a for a point at a
1394280	1402200	distance r from the point on the center and outside the uniform sphere of mass m so if the sphere has
1402200	1409960	the radius capital r right this one would be true right this one would be true so for instance inside
1409960	1416520	a uniform spherical mass if I take this one right the inside you can see this one right this one
1416520	1424040	so for inside a uniform spherical mass that is for small r this one if I take the small this this
1424040	1431400	holds for r which is greater than r but in case that we take a uniform mass where small r is less
1431400	1437800	than bigger right so this is actually what happens a little bit you know it comes up the
1437800	1443240	derivation so phi equals to minus gm to r cube thanks that I have written this time correct
1444040	1452360	so right and now what we can do is that yeah so this is r 3 r square minus r square yeah
1453080	1461000	so this holds actually then small r is less than big r and this holds phi equals to it should be
1461000	1469160	minus gm by r anyway so if r is bigger than greater than equals to r like so at a point
1469160	1476920	m at a distance r from the center and outside a uniform sphere of mass this happens and inside
1476920	1485880	for a point uniform mass that it is inside this happens right okay so we now take a step back
1485880	1492840	and we want to go back to that cuboid concept now why because we want to understand something
1492840	1500360	which is called the magnitude of a position vector so if we take you know these lines right
1500360	1506600	and what we get from here is that position vector or radial vector r from the origin o
1507160	1513320	so we get this one right we already know this so we know that r equals to this one x square root
1513320	1520440	of the radical of x square plus y square so in Cartesian coordinates we can now you know rewrite
1520440	1526680	the gravitational potential which was this one phi equals to minus gm by r thankfully I have corrected
1526680	1533080	this here right so equals to minus gm so this is the Cartesian coordinate I just wanted to
1533080	1539000	take these example of skew cube so that we understand that how the square root of the denominator
1539000	1546760	comes now also note that we use this nabla operator this differential operator and this is
1546760	1552920	basically used for three reasons it calculates the divergence gradient and curl now if we use
1552920	1561560	this nabla which is of a scalar field phi then what we get is this one right so what we get is
1561560	1568360	this one I think this this this part is quite clear so we take this value okay this one yeah
1568360	1575320	this is the gradient obviously so what we do is that in ordinary Euclidean space for a point a scalar
1575320	1582200	phi the gradient is the vector points so we take this one this is the partial differentials and then
1582200	1589240	we get this one right then we use the differential operator and we get this value calculating further
1589240	1595720	we get this value now I am not explaining it right now because this requires a kind of a
1595720	1601320	differential operator calculate which you can just check on the equations so we further go and
1601320	1610440	we get this and now what we do is that we get ultimately the answer is this as because this
1610440	1619800	small r equals to the modulus of this what we can do is that we can write yeah this one I mean to
1619800	1628840	say this equal as this right and now by definition r equals to x y z equals to this this is by
1628840	1638920	definition yeah given r so it denotes an ordinary Cartesian vector right and so the basis vectors
1638920	1646680	are implied and we know that we don't bother to show them so some now we can rewrite this one
1646680	1652920	it gets cancelled off this one r cube and all this gets cancelled off and we finally arrive into this
1655560	1662440	and this is how it is treated right so now we what we do is that we find this one
1664120	1670520	so this part is actually this part right so this is okay let me explain you again so now
1670520	1676600	we have found an equation that relates the gravitational potential field with that of the
1676600	1683080	gravitational field because this the right hand side of it is equals to this which we have dealt
1683080	1689160	earlier so this is the phi the gravitational potential field which is a scalar field and this
1689160	1694520	is the gravitational field which is a vector field and somehow there's a relation between these two
1694520	1702600	fields and finally what we do is that it's a gravitational field so if g we replace it by
1702600	1710120	nabla phi and we get this right so you can check on to this part I mean to say this is pretty simple
1710120	1716280	I just trying to get in a kind of relation between the potential gravitational potential
1716280	1722360	field which is a scalar with a vector and we use those differential operators in order to get this
1722360	1727240	so till now what we have learned is that the gravity the gravitational potential
1727800	1734680	and also we looked into how you know the gravitational potential field can be used
1734680	1741960	in order to make a construct of a sphere where the solid sphere is inside and outside so I hope
1741960	1748120	by but this is okay now the problem is that when we're dealing with general theory of relativity
1748120	1754120	gravitational potential etc what the geometry changes with curve space time and with curve
1754120	1760600	space time we need a different tool in order to establish a kind of a connection so that is what
1760600	1766200	the christophal symbols does so in general again you will get a wrong notion that christophal
1766200	1772840	symbols denotes gravity or gravitation potential it does in a different way so christophal symbols
1772840	1777480	represent the connection coefficients of the levy-chivita connection don't worry in coming to
1777480	1785080	that and they describe a change in the basis vectors through a given coordinate and it represents
1785080	1791640	the fictitious forces induced by a non-initial frame of reference initial frame a non-initial
1791640	1797080	frame which is moving so what we are trying to make a point over here is that when the basis of
1797080	1803480	the vectors we will soon see examples changes then we need a kind of a connection and the
1803480	1808920	christophal symbols actually does that but before that we'll very quickly take a look
1808920	1815480	in what is called an affine connection so the notion of affine connection has its root in the
1815480	1822760	19th century geometry I mean to say 10 sensor calculus it was developed later in the 1920s
1822760	1829480	by Eli Carter right and Harman Weil so the many invariants of an affine connection are its torsion
1829480	1836440	and curvature this is a photo you know illustration of torsion so you can see these are the tangent
1836440	1843400	vector fields which connects and it can be differentiated okay so I will go step by step
1843400	1849560	what I'm trying to make a point is that see in Riemannian or any pseudo Riemannian geometry we
1849560	1856040	deal with manifolds right this manifold each of these manifolds are characterized by what is called
1856040	1861880	an affine connection they do have an affine connection right now the manifolds also is
1861880	1867480	characterized by what is called a metric tensor which measures the causal structure of space time
1867480	1873240	and many other things we know what is a metric tensor now these type of manifolds who have a
1873240	1879480	metric tensor they are actually called Riemannian manifolds right those who have a metric tensor
1880120	1886440	now these Riemannian manifolds also have what is called an affine connection and these affine
1886440	1893240	connections are called Levy-Civita connection right is named by Tulio Levy I don't remember the name
1893240	1899400	of Civita right now but Tulio Levy-Civita Levy-Civita connection so the Levy-Civita connection I can
1899400	1905640	tell it is a very special case of an affine connection obviously it is the affine connection
1905640	1911880	for a manifold with a metric right so it is basically an affine connection of a manifold
1911880	1919480	with a metric now what happens typically is that we need this affine connection or I would say
1919480	1926600	that affine connection is already there because it connects the nearby tangent basis so that we can
1926600	1931640	differentiate and do a better connection and Levy-Civita connection is basically
1932600	1936920	a special affine connection which we will see soon how it behaves
1939000	1943560	okay so now we take a quick look but I was telling that we need a special tool what is
1943560	1950760	that that is called a connection now what happens is that in in the case of transporting local
1950760	1958120	geometric objects from a place to others etc tangent vectors and tensor so we need a long
1958120	1963880	family of curves in a parallel and consistent manner so a choice of an affine connection is also
1963880	1969240	equivalent to the notion of what is called a parallel transport which is a method of transporting
1969240	1975400	tangent vectors along curves now I will just use the analogy which I have used earlier in my videos
1975400	1981560	also that how will you understand which one is bigger I mean to say simple concept of
1981560	1987160	found rates so if we put one another arrow on the other and it overlaps then it is bigger
1987160	1993080	this is obviously the smaller one right now what do we do it is a way of comparing vectors at
1993080	1998360	different positions of manifold I mean to say the connection actually does what the parallel
1998360	2004680	transport helps it's a way of transporting detail and smooth surfaces so let me quickly you know
2004680	2010280	explain with that so here is a triangle and I've got a point this one red I'm trying to move
2010840	2017880	I'm trying to keep it as safe as possible I do that I do that and then this you see that red
2019000	2024280	arrow pointing towards right overlaps that that means in flat space when we have parallel
2024280	2031000	transport of a vector it come back to the original point so we have no problem with that but you know
2031000	2037800	generativity has got complexities and it has got curvature so we take this kind of a sphere
2037800	2042920	and we stand over here this is the red point and we're trying to go to the blue point and we're
2042920	2049560	carrying a kind of a you know spare or a arrow which we try to keep as straight as possible
2049560	2056680	the original arrow is marked in yellow so I move over from here it is called V and I'm trying to
2056760	2062680	keep it but you still see that the arrows are bending and this is because due to the curvature
2063240	2069240	now from this point we try to go from the equator we are trying to keep it as clear as possible so
2069240	2074600	yeah yeah the direction of the vector is due to the curvature and then from here we try to move
2074600	2081480	back to a regular place right so we are keeping this as straight as possible here also but this
2081560	2086440	one when we come back is a V prime which is totally different in the direction
2086440	2092680	where we started that's the yellow vector so when we take out this yellow vector and this we find
2092680	2100760	there's a difference V and V prime so parallel transport which is trying to move around the sphere
2101480	2108360	it tries to make the sphere as constant as possible but it is not so parallel transport cannot
2108520	2113720	keep vectors and all that we need something which is called a covariant derivative don't worry about
2113720	2119560	the term I will soon explain you and covariant derivative is a tool which helps us to find
2119560	2124360	parallel transported vector fields now who will find the parallel transported vector face the
2124360	2134040	covariant derivative and in connection with another value okay so connections are basically
2134040	2139720	local geometric objects they allow a comparison between local geometry at one point and local
2139720	2145800	geometry at another this has got two types of connection one which measures infinite symbols
2145800	2150920	and another which measures local theory and these are the different type of connections however we
2150920	2157000	are just dealing with the levy-chivita connection so just to tell you that what actually you know
2157960	2164440	the connections are okay so we know this is a kind of a covariant derivative and this is being
2164440	2171480	replaced by the navla operator which is covariant derivative actually what happens is that levy-chivita
2171480	2177080	connection refers to the covariant derivative what do we mean by covariant derivative I'm not
2177080	2183720	clearly telling you but it's a kind of a derivative right so in a nice intuitive way to think about
2183720	2189560	this code you know connection coefficients is to think them that they are corrections of an ordinary
2189560	2196200	derivative right so because the ordinary derivatives cannot work here because the basis of the vector
2196200	2202360	changes how it changes I will demonstrate to you soon and levy-chivita connection comes to save this
2202360	2208760	and do the necessary corrections to an ordinary derivative so let me explain you the components
2208760	2216120	of this levy-chivita connection so first we go with this right this one is basically the levy-chivita
2216120	2223560	connection which connects nearby tangent spaces define a corrected notion of the derivative
2223560	2229160	in arbitrary coordinates or arbitrary variables that means there is something wrong that means
2229160	2235000	ordinary derivatives are not being happening we are using covariant derivative and in order to do
2235000	2240200	that there is a tool which is the connection this is the levy-chivita connection right so we
2240200	2245320	developed the second component which is pretty easy this is basically the ordinary derivative which
2245320	2252200	basically is defined of a tangent space for example in Cartesian coordinates and this is actually this
2252200	2258440	gamma term is actually a correction term remember it's a correction term called the connection
2258440	2265560	coefficient or Christoffel symbol and this is correct the ordinary derivative for an arbitrary
2265560	2275480	or manifold or infinite system so here note that the indices really doesn't make any sense this was
2275480	2280520	because the covariant derivative is an operator that needs to act on something so the indices really
2280520	2286120	doesn't make any sense so all in all this is a connection you understood what is a connection
2286120	2291160	either it is different with local theory on infinite symbol it is a kind of a connection
2291160	2298760	which helps us to you know correct the ordinary derivative which is not possible on a curved
2298760	2306520	manifold okay so these are all mathematical calculations but as always I prefer in the video
2306520	2313480	to show a geometric meaning of Christoffel symbol so that it becomes clear how it looks like so
2313480	2319560	geometrically Christoffel symbols can be interpreted as describing how basis vectors changes through
2319560	2326680	our coordinate system right so the basis vectors may change even due to the coordinate system being
2326680	2332840	curvilinear or due to the geometry of the space as it is being curved so here I have written the
2332840	2340040	Christoffel symbols essentially defined as the derivatives of basis vectors okay so here is the
2340120	2346280	you know kind of a vector and what I'm going to do is that I'm going to explain it so this is how
2346280	2353720	much the basis vector emu changes when it moves along the x new axis so you can just coordinate
2353720	2359960	this is actually what is called the dot product however I have got a separate video which deals
2359960	2365560	with the deep details of what is a dot product and cross product so intuitively understand this
2365640	2372680	dot product describes how much it is derivative and the basis actually overlaps so it overlaps and
2372680	2377160	it is absolutely overlap that means that they are the same and so on
2380440	2387080	okay so I would like to explain you in two geometrically what is the basis vector it changes
2387080	2394040	and what all those problems are all about so in a flat space we get a vector called a and this is
2394040	2401320	being measured by the component a y and a x and I if I draw the lines it are more or less the same
2401320	2406920	and if I take a kind of a curved surface and I plot the same I get a curved surface let's look
2406920	2414360	yeah something like this so x y goes into x prime and y prime and I'm trying to make this vector
2414360	2419720	the same but when I'm trying to make the measure of this vector through this component so you see
2419800	2425400	the x component is something here and the y component goes something here so what happens
2425400	2433080	is that when I join those I see a prime x is longer than a x we see that a prime y is also
2433080	2441080	longer than a y and but the a remains invariant right so a remains invariant in the sense that
2441080	2446920	it doesn't change so this is the problem that the basis of the vectors are changing in curved space
2447560	2455960	so now let us say that we have some curved coordinate system this is one x1 this would
2455960	2463000	be t or x2 anything that you like and this is the basis vectors like okay so these are just
2463000	2470200	you know labeled as e1 e t and e x so what happens is that if you if you really calculate
2470200	2476600	the dot product which we used to do in UV in a typical Cartesian coordinates the basis
2476680	2483080	vector changes in the time direction and we cannot do this e dot e equal to the components
2483080	2487000	we cannot do because you see here in curved space style things are changing
2489640	2496040	so we take this one and we plot this one as x1 and x2 this is a curved space right
2496040	2502760	curved coordinate system with x1 x2 but the basis vectors which are these which are e1 and e2
2503480	2510680	now just try to imagine this is very important imagine that you move along the x1 axis and
2510680	2519320	see how the basis of vector e2 changes along the x1 axis right so a small change in a vector along
2519320	2525480	coordinate axis is simply the partial derivative with respect to the particular coordinate obviously
2525480	2530040	you have to do a partial derivative because it's changing on a curved manifold so this
2530040	2537960	derivative vector this one we take the red one can also yeah it can also components along the
2537960	2543880	x1 and x2 axis obviously so this is done by taking the dot product of the red vector
2545080	2550200	which I will show you this is a derivative vector right and the Christopher symbols are
2550200	2555560	basically telling how the basis vectors are changing how they're actually changing
2555560	2566280	okay so we see this one which if I differentiate takes this for equation this one and this one
2566280	2571960	so all in all if you don't want to go into the mathematical cases of calculating those derivatives
2571960	2576760	then understand that Christopher symbols geometrically represent different components
2576760	2582760	of the derivative of basic vectors remember this is the different components of the derivative
2582760	2587560	of basic vectors because the basis vector changes with the curved spacetime so if you
2587560	2592280	you were to take the derivative of a basic vector this would give another vector right
2592280	2597320	so the Christopher symbols then represent the different components of this of this new vector
2598040	2604520	all these things changes now from this Christopher symbol how the vcs vectors changes and all those
2604520	2611880	you will see that there is an underlying force which is also working so these are in bold remember
2611880	2619000	these are corrections to an ordinary derivative okay now if these Christopher symbols which are
2619000	2625160	corrections in terms of derivative if they are written in the metric form then how it would be
2625160	2632040	let us have a quick look on that so we know that g mu nu is a metric tensor to define the
2632680	2640200	geometric concept or on arbitrary coordinate system so we get a kind of a I would say equation like
2640200	2647080	this we get a kind of a equation like this and don't worry I will just explain to you so you see
2647960	2654040	these derivatives these are partial derivatives of the metric with respect to the different
2655320	2662280	you know spacetime coordinates this is the basically the metric when I am writing the
2662600	2669800	levy chi beta in terms of this metric this is actually happens right and this one is the index
2669800	2675880	is a summation in it is a summation you know from 0 to 3 for dimension please so what I am trying to
2675880	2683000	tell make a point over here is that the metric tensor to put simply is used to define different
2683000	2690840	geometric concepts in arbitrary coordinate system the metric is as you know is denoted by g mu nu
2690840	2697000	so the Christopher's now the Christopher symbols in the term metric it is thus how it is explained
2701400	2709080	okay so what we draw a conclusion from here is that gravity is obviously a fictitious force in
2709080	2715560	generativity Christopher symbols because they are denoting a change in basic vectors anything
2715560	2721320	that changes it moves so the change of basic vectors obviously will give rise to fictitious
2721320	2728040	force if I have gone to my earlier videos on geodesics and richie scaler you will find that
2728760	2735000	how the basis of vectors changes and the geodesics are causing a curvature which is called gravity
2735000	2741080	in relativity right so the change in basic vector usually gives rise to a fictitious force
2741960	2748280	the Christopher symbols actually describe what are those fictitious forces and it plays the
2748280	2754040	role of describing how objects actually move or get accelerated because it is actually showing the
2754040	2759800	change right and Christopher symbols are gravitational fields in generativity because
2759800	2766520	it is subject to change so the gravitational potential of Isaac Newton is being replaced by
2766520	2773240	this one that is g mu nu the metric tensor and the gravitational force field is being replaced by
2773240	2781320	this Christopher symbol now in order to understand what it is I will like to give you a quick
2781320	2787160	and a very simple comparison without examples as you understand physics is not complete so
2787960	2794840	in Newtonian gravity the gravitational field that is the gravitational acceleration at each
2794840	2802040	point in the field is represented as a vector field right so this g which you can see is defined as
2802040	2808520	the negative gradient of the gravitational potential that is why it is a minus sign so all these are
2808520	2815320	partial derivatives of the gravitational potential remember that these are all partial derivatives
2815320	2821720	of the gravitational potential now if I write this one right you will see these are the partial
2821720	2830360	derivatives of the metric it's a big difference right so the Newtonian gravitational potential
2831240	2837400	partial derivatives are the gravitational potential where in generativity partial derivatives are that
2837400	2843560	of the metric and that is why gravitational potential is replaced by the metric tensor
2843880	2851640	so I hope yeah you can understand what I'm trying to make it trying to make a point that how this
2851640	2858920	shift really happens and this the partial derivatives in both the cases these are partial derivatives
2858920	2863720	in this case Newtonian case it's gravitational potential and this is the metric
2865880	2870680	okay now there is something which is called a weak field approximation it is just a hypothetical
2870680	2876920	case when gravity is less and complications are less and things are moving slow you will see that
2876920	2883080	Christoffel symbols are reduced which looks almost like Newtonian gravitation okay so this is the
2883080	2890040	geodesic equation of weak field in generativity and you see this one this is the equation of motion
2890040	2896600	in Newtonian gravity doesn't it look the same in weak field limit and this is the Christoffel symbol
2896680	2903160	which looks at this limit so finally we come that Christoffel symbols represent gravitational
2903160	2909720	acceleration in generativity why because it denotes the change of the basis of vectors with that
2909720	2917560	change it causes the gravitational acceleration okay so just finally I just wanted to show you
2917560	2923720	that the geodesic equation is basically the second law of Newton and the Einstein field
2923720	2930200	equation is basically the Poisson's Poisson's equation right so now when we are talking of
2930200	2935800	Poisson's equation we need to look how Poisson's equation actually reflects Einstein's field
2935800	2941960	equation and that is basically what is coming up in the next part of our video we are going to
2941960	2948040	look into Poisson's equation when Causs-Schmidt metric pseudo-remanian manifold geodesics parallel
2948040	2955080	transport Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalars, spacetime, geodesics, energy momentum
2955080	2963080	tensor and finally the Schwarz-Gill metric so yeah the mathematics of generativity will be
2963080	2970280	intense it will be long so I thought to divide it into different parts so I haven't gone into the
2970280	2976360	real you know summing up or the summary of this video because it is all mathematical and you know
2976360	2982520	these concepts really require a summary which you can use to do so this is all I mean to say
2982520	2988200	we started with you that we moved into gravitational potential and then from gravitational potential
2988200	2993640	we showed that how this is related to Christoffel symbols further in from Christoffel symbols
2993640	2999560	how the connection actually holds what are the different connections and so on so I will put
2999560	3005000	a pause and I would like to thank you for watching this video what you can do is that you can put
3005000	3012040	up your comment and I will I'm sorry for the minor mistakes in signatures science etc and
3012680	3019240	that's it please do subscribe to my channel physics for students do like do comment as you do
3019240	3024840	because these are motivational facts these are motivations which keeps me moving and helps me
3024840	3031800	to improve on my video do also click on the bell notification click on all to get all the
3031800	3036920	notification from physics for students thank you very much this is Sean at signing off from
3036920	3043240	physics for students promising to come back very soon with another interesting video till then
3043800	3056680	enjoy the winter seasons greetings and best wishes goodbye until next time
3062760	3070760	now you can be a part of our team you can send your scientific articles essays research papers
3070760	3077080	lesson plans on a particular subject of science for further details please write to us at
3077640	3086280	editor at physicsforstudents.com stay safe and happy
