1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What is the first book to start in learning differential geometry?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What is the best choice to select books?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What are the most common mistakes that you make while reading books?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What is the method and sequence of study?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Will you learn the proofs first or go directly to the problems?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it difficult to start learning differential geometry?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In this video, I am going to answer all those questions

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and I am going to give you the right choice of books.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I am also going to go through each chapter of the book,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
explain them to you and tell you the right method of study.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Remember, a wrong choice right at the beginning might destroy your interest

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
as well as love for the subject forever and you may never find it interesting to study.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So please be careful.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, my name is Shaanak and you are watching this video on my channel,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Physics for Students.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome to yet another new episode.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What is the right book to start learning differential geometry?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, we would go through the book and the further details,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but first let us see what are the topics that we are covering today.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We will first learn what are the mistakes that we make

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because until we recognize them, we will continue making these mistakes forever

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and we will fall into a forever loop.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How to overcome the mistakes that would be today's focus?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The very first book to start with, what is the edition you should select?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What are the reviews that are published at Amazon about that book?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who should read this book?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I mean to say the target audience.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is the content of the book and importantly how to get this book?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Remember, I am making this video after going through at least 20 to 25 books on differential geometry

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and that is how I have come to this book and I want to make you very careful

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that while you are selecting the book in order to study for the first time,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
be very careful in understanding which book you select.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, first we will understand what are the common mistakes that we make

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and how we can overcome those.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, as you see, the differential geometry as itself can be divided into two parts.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The first is the extrinsic differential geometry,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which basically consists of sub-manifolds of Euclidean space

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and these are easy to visualize because they are mostly on R3 or a three-dimensional space.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, the intrinsic geometry are basically manifolds which contains the Riemannian metric

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and other metric spaces and these are difficult to visualize

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
because they are very, very abstract.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The question is that when we are talking about difficulties in terms of visualizing

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and something which is easy to visualize, what is the way and what is the path that we should take?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, see the common mistakes that you make is that first you do not have

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the necessary mathematical prerequisites and you immediately jump to differential geometry,

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you get frustrated, you get problems and you get rejection.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, I have talked at length what are the prerequisites,

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
even what are the books that you should read before getting prepared for differential geometry.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I would request you to look into my earlier videos which is there in the playlist of differential geometry.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, my advice would be, please go through that video and first learn that yes,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
are you ready with those mathematical tools to jump to learn differential geometry?

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If yes, you can go ahead.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If not, then please go ahead and learn those prerequisites and then come to differential geometry.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The second problem is that you directly jump solving the problems

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and what is the effect is that you waste time because you are unable to solve it,

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you get confused, you look around here and there, you know, the blogs and the YouTube videos, etc.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and you look around to find the right solution but you waste a lot of time and you do not do.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And the third one is that you get into the mathematics to know without the reason,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
which is the most important factor and we are going to make a remedy out of that.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You make mistakes, you are unable to visualize and the abstract mathematics becomes an enemy for you.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That means that it is no longer an abstract mathematics but you try to fly away and try to avoid those things.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The question is that what is the solution?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now these are the things which are very common knowingly or unknowingly you make a mistake

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or we make a mistake without understanding we jump directly to the problems.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What is the solution coming up in the next part of our video?

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So today's focus would be in this video we would focus on which book specifically we would be talking

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
of one book because unnecessarily dealing with many books doesn't really make sense.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why we should read the book and how shall we study and most importantly what is the process and method of study.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now I would like to tell you that because there might be many other books which I have spoken earlier in the videos

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
as well as this book you might want all those books with you.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But remember there is problem which is called a choice overload.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you have too many books you won't go through it.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you have too many texts you won't read through it.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you have too many solutions you won't run through the solutions.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So what will happen it will remain in the text box in the text of that or in your inbox or in your hard drive.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So let us pick up one book concentrate learn that and that would solve our problem.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So the first thing is that you understand we need to understand why you are studying the subject.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you understand why you study the object then you get a proper direction and objective that okay

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
so I know what I am learning and what is the direction.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now once you get a proper direction you start seeing what is in front of you.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That means okay this is not abstract but something I can see that this is the result

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
this is the outcome and this is the practical application.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And what will happen is that abstract mathematics starts to become concrete.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
As I was telling that if you jump directly without knowing the objective it will forever remain as an abstract enemy.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if you start seeing what is in front of you the abstract mathematics starts to become concrete.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can understand the practical application of the subject which will give you a concrete reason

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that when you do the mathematics you do it with a proper reason.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is the final outcome of all those things that we are talking.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You would start loving differential geometry and I can tell you it is one of the most modern

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and one of the most interesting subject which can give you a great career and a great learning ahead.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So what is the first books to start with.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now before we start mentioning about the book we should know what is the objective.

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So we will enjoy the learning differential geometry to know the present we need to know a little bit about the past.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You really know the reason why those theorems came and once you know the reason why those theorems came

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the learning becomes much more effective.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So this is the reason that why you should read this book to enjoy to know the present

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and you know what the theorems coming from so that the understanding become fun.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay so there are several editions of the book that I am talking about.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is the book called Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometrics Development and History by Marvin J. Greenberg.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And this is the book we are going to talk about.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It contains the mathematics, it contains proofs and many other things which are yet to explore.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So the first edition would look like this.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The second edition has changed its color.

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The third edition would be this and the fourth edition is the black one.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So more or less you can expect the fourth edition.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The first and second are there but I won't recommend to read it.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So let us start with the third edition and the total number of pages are around 665.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's quite a heavy book to read.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay so what is the price at Amazon?

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It is around in India.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Amazon it is around 26,000, 17,000 and if you want to buy a paperback it is 16,625.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't worry about the price.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There is an element of surprise waiting at you.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How do you get this book?

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay if I go to amazon.com then it is around 13.34 dollars and it comes for 34 dollars and the fourth edition comes for about 99.95 dollars.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So you see here we get the third and the fourth edition.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But if I go to Amazon India I even get the first, second, third and the fourth edition.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And if you go for an e-text book it would be around how much it is coming to 63 to something.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's it.

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay so this is the book.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It has got an Amazon rating of 66 percent.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is the professor.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He is an American professor of mathematics.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Marvin J. Greenberg and received his doctorate from Princeton University under the famous Sir Glank.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And you know who Sir Glank got a lot of books on differential geometry and specifically on linear algebra.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay what is the review at Amazon?

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So it has got a five star and more or less you can see whether for class or for personal learning remarkable somebody has written four stars.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It is a good deal.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So more or less you can see great content but bad impression.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This bad impression you can read is basically for the printing.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But overall that means it says that it is quite a good book.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Question is that who should start reading this book?

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean to say who is the target audience?

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So you see the author himself has written over here school and college geometry teachers with a rigorous treatment of the foundations of Euclidean geometry and introduction to hyperbolic geometry.

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
General education even liberal arts students can go through it who are willing to know the philosophical implication and the discovery of non Euclidean geometry.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So it is very clear high school and college geometry teachers and it can go ahead with general education and liberal arts people.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And he has further written that here you see if students do not do a good number of exercises they will have difficulty following subsequent chapters.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So that means this book which we are going through will have a lot of exercises and I encourage you doing those exercises otherwise you won't be able to learn.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Now the question is that before jumping into maths one of the things that you really need to know.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Who should read this book?

144
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now here is an important thing.

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
See he has written that I have used the development of non Euclidean geometry to revive the interest in the study of Euclidean geometry.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So you see it goes the other way round instead of going from Euclidean he starts with non Euclidean because that is far more fairly more interesting.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We will all agree on that so that the people have an interest in Euclidean geometry.

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So you will learn the non Euclidean geometry and then you learn Euclidean geometry much better.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I believe that this approach makes a traditional college course in Euclidean geometry more interesting.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's it.

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So we will see the content of the book very in details.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The first would be the Euclid geometry which basically starts you see we are starting with Euclidean geometry.

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why?

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because we want to make the base very strong.

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So there is a very brief survey of the beginnings of geometry.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It starts a little bit with the history that is the Pythagoreans and then it goes to Euclid of Alexandria.

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So this is very important because until we know who are the founders and how things happen it would be difficult.

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The book goes further into Euclid's first four postulates attempt to prove the parallel postulate.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are figures like that and that's it.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So Descartes analytic geometries being covered and the briefly the number pi along with I mean to say a little bit of history.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So you establish a relationship with these geometries and these people were way back in the history and that is how you start learning that.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Logic and incidence geometry incidence geometry you all know that when we remove those curves and these functions and angles what it is basically the line and the point that is called.

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So here you see logic and incidence geometry has to start with teaching you what is called elementary logic.

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So you see it starts with elementary logic then it teaches the theorems and proof if hypothesis then conclusion and it can be translated.

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So if first you are again learning logic why because there will be certain proof based systems which you need to prove.

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then the book will go into see this logic rule and it explains all those symbols also.

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So if you don't know logical quantifiers you can take a deep breath because this book is going to teach you that.

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And you see that incidence axiom one two and so on and then at the end there's a huge number of exercises projects and things like that.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So here you see the definition is given with axiom a brief history of real projective geometry and what is projective and affine planes.

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Then we start with Hilbert's axioms the flaws in equate the axiom of betweenness and what are the axioms of betweenness that is being covered.

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then we forth come to what is called neutral geometry.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I have just mentioned those because otherwise it would be too long.

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It will start with geometry with parallel axiom then a exterior angle theorem and angle sum of a triangle conclusion and so on.

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then it moves into history of the parallel postulate.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So you see now that we have understood a little bit of the geometry it is important that we know the history.

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So it starts with very ancient history of Proclus then the concept of equidistance.

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then John Wallace who made contributions in analytic geometry the Claudius and Proclus theorem and then the Farkas-Boli.

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So everything regarding the history of the parallel postulate is covered so that you don't have any problem understanding where from the theorem scheme.

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is covered.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It is a good history and people like Gauss, Riemann and Lobaczkowski is being covered.

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So parallel line similar triangles it is an excellent read.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then the seventh chapter speaks of the independence of parallel postulate.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So you see the Poincare model the inversions in circles models bell tram is interpretation and everything.

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is very important it books contains philosophical implications fruitful and applications.

189
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So here you see what are the philosophical implications what is the geometry of physical space very important.

190
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What is mathematics all about the controversies about foundations of mathematics and the fruitfulness of hyperboleic geometry for other branches of mathematics cosmology and art.

191
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So you see why it is important because once we go on through the seven chapters now we are going deep into the philosophical implications and fruitful applications.

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Finally it goes into geometric transformations which would include motions and similarities client learning or Erlanger program and this is the entire list of geometric transformation.

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So now let us take a pause and you understand how well this book is organized.

194
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It starts right at the beginning with the history then it goes into mathematics then it teaches you logic then again it goes back to the history of parallel postulate then it goes back to the mathematics and then it goes back to the philosophy and then finally geometric transformations.

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The 10th chapter deals with further results in hyperboleic geometry.

196
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So these are the hyperboleic trigonometry.

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Sashary Lambert quadrilaterals boilize construction and all those things.

198
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Finally it contains an appendix to appendix elliptic another Riemannian geometries Hilbert's geometry without real numbers.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So what we can summarize from this is that we need to first understand the reason for learning then how the development of thoughts took place.

200
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why those theorem and proves are developed what is learning through history which makes it more interesting and the actual reason then comes in front.

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So this is kind of a quick summary and this is the first book before going anything into other things like Gauss theorem and Gauss Bonnet theorem etc.

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is the first book.

203
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know it contains a lot of pages.

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It is a long read but you will see how the entire journey of differential geometry is evolving in front of you.

205
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You can go and you can live through those philosophers mathematicians starting from Greek and coming up to Bolli and other new geometries.

206
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So that is interesting.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That gives you the motivation and you find and fall in love with differential geometry.

208
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Now the question is that how to get this book.

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You know it is very simple.

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
All you need to do is to write me an email or contact me over WhatsApp and yes obviously you need to subscribe to my channel physics for students.

211
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And what I will do is that these are heavy books.

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is particularly is a heavy book.

213
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I will share it in Google Drive download and let me know.
