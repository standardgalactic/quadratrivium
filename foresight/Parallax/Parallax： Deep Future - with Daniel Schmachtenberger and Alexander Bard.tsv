0	11000	All right. Welcome to Parallax. I'm your host, Thomas Mark. With me today are Daniel Schmachtenberger
11000	16840	and Alexander Bart. Daniel Schmachtenberger is a social philosopher and founding member
16840	22760	of the Concilions Project aimed at providing public sense making and improving public sense
22760	29280	making and dialogue. Alexander Bart is amongst many other things, the philosopher, author
29280	34360	and futurologist. I'm very happy to bring you both together for the first time. So welcome
34360	42960	both of you. The goal and the idea of this conversation isn't short to kind of generate
42960	51080	a snapshot of where we are 2022, ideologically, politically, economically and technologically,
51080	57080	and where we are headed to the end of the decade. So where are we now in this time between
57080	62880	worlds and what are the possible and probable outcomes of our current trajectories? We are
62880	69240	facing a crisis while at the same time our institutions do not seem to fit or able to
69240	74800	solve these problems. It appears that the climate crisis unfolding right now and the
74800	79920	war is brewing, the cultural divide and the western hemisphere, the culture war is getting
79920	86200	more intense. And at the same time our myths and narratives don't work anymore. The postmodern
86200	92320	policies of deconstructions have for better or worse negated our way of reducing complexity.
92320	98040	So where are we now? Is the west going to fall as Oswald Sprengler once put it? Is the
98040	103080	chaos going to increase till we find a new way of life? Or is it as it ever was, men
103080	109480	struggling to find meaning in a complex world? Can digital providers with the means to reconstruct
109520	115200	the myth and narrative? And maybe more on the point, at what point does it become wiser
115200	119600	to acknowledge that it's too late to stop anything and turn our efforts to surviving
119600	126840	it? So Daniel, if you had to start to paint this broad painting, where we are right now,
126840	134760	where are we now when you were to take up a systemic bird's-eye view of things?
135760	145640	I tried to paint a brief, hopefully useful starting place picture. You were saying, you
145640	152200	know, we're in a global crisis and you gave a few examples. I often use a term metacrisis
152200	158000	that is not just looking at the fact that we have climate change and biodiversity loss
158000	162480	and extinction of species in dead zones and oceans and topsoil loss and all those environmental
162520	169800	issues, or that we have increasing fragility in supply chains or the problem of exponential
169800	175160	growth on the financial system and linear materials economy, hitting fragility on planetary
175160	181760	boundaries, or the AI risk, bio risk, cyber risk issues that new exponential technologies
181760	187360	create, like all of these are possibly catastrophic risks. And we're in this interesting situation
187360	191440	where the total number of catastrophic risks is increasing and the probability of them is
191480	196000	increasing. And so rather than just see each of those as different separate ones, there are
196000	200360	certain underlying drivers that we can look at that they had in common. Talk about the
200360	206840	generator functions of catastrophic risk. And so we would say that we are at a unique point in
206840	211560	history, something where Alexander and I definitely agree is that it's not just processes of the
211560	216280	same thing always under the sun. Being able to extinct species at scale and genetically
216280	222240	engineered new species and synthetic biology is a different thing than was true 2000 or 20,000
222240	231760	years ago. And so the first truly existential tech we had in terms of technology enough that we
231760	237720	could make choices that damage the habitability of the world was the nuclear bomb. And that was so
237720	244000	recent in historical time, we built an entire world system to prevent using tech, that tech,
244200	247440	and we had never done that before. Every tech we had, we always made an arms race to use as
247440	251640	fast as we could. Now we built a whole world system that involved mutually assured destruction and
251640	257560	the Bretton Woods monetary system and the UN IGO systems to ensure not doing that. While that
257560	263280	succeeded in a way, it also drove all the catastrophic risks we're facing now and to more
263280	269280	likely like let's have a monetary system that increases exponential GDP so everybody can have
269280	274280	more without taking each other's stuff on linear supply chains that externalize cost to the
274280	279440	environment pushing all the planetary boundary issues. And you can make mutually assured
279440	284160	destruction on two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon, but you can't on lots and
284160	288120	lots of non state actors all having access to different kinds of catastrophe weapons. So how
288120	292280	do you deal with that? So we're in a situation where the post World War Two world is over,
292280	296760	there's a lot more catastrophic risks. And those types of solutions don't work and we need new
296760	301200	ones. What we'd say is that there's, so like whether we're talking about the risk from a
301200	308240	particular kind of AI or bio or nuclear or climate change refugees leading to nuclear or
308240	312760	whatever it is, there's the increasing catastrophe attractor, right? There's like an
312760	318120	attractive basin defined by we can't manage our power well coordination failures creating
318120	321720	increasing catastrophes. There's a thousand scenarios, but they're all kind of the catastrophe
321760	327320	attractor. Then there's this other tractor that says, in order to manage those, we must be able
327320	332880	to monitor and control adequately. And that looks like pretty powerful centralized control
332880	340200	mechanisms, which mostly turn pretty dystopic. So we can make sure that nobody builds catastrophe
340200	344760	weapons in their basement using tabletop crisper. If we have ubiquitous surveillance and extremely
344760	350040	powerful control mechanisms, then that becomes pretty dystopic. So there's like catastrophes and
350040	354160	dystopias as these two different attractors and exponential tech makes both more likely, you
354160	360680	can run much more powerful top down systems using AI and IoT. You can also create a lot worse
360720	366000	catastrophic dynamics with exponential tech. So we want a third attractor that is neither dystopic
366000	371960	nor catastrophic. And that means that it has to have the capacity to check all of the power that
371960	376160	could cause catastrophe on purpose or accident, but where that system that checks it must also have
376200	385200	checks and balances and be oriented in a life that is somehow desirable. And so how do we make it
385200	390360	through the metacrisis means make it through the catastrophes and the dystopias to some kind of
390360	395920	third attractor? What are the criteria of that attractor? That would be a fine starting point of
395920	405560	kind of where I see that we're at in the arc of history. And that the quote in the book of Roman
405560	412160	something like the path to hell is wide and many of the path to heaven is narrow and steep. It's
412160	417120	easy to come up with dystopian sci-fi because humans have been pretty nasty stewards of power
417120	422120	historically and the idea of us having decentralized exponential power like there's just a lot of bad
422120	430880	scenarios. The idea of exponential power AI and genetic engineering and whatever, going well with
430880	436280	people like us running it requires some pretty significantly new thought. And so how do we come
436280	443480	up with a positive future narrative that is not a naive silly one? I think this is the topic would
443480	447000	be fun to have us explore today. That's my kind of initial frame.
450480	455760	I can then add to that that the reason why I got really interested in Daniel's brain a few years
455760	460840	ago was that I was very alone being a philosopher of technology for quite a long time. And it was
460840	465320	really required. Obviously, we live in the middle of a technological revolution. Here was a guy who
465320	471560	was even more a philosopher of technology than I was, which is great. So it's kind of shocking that
471560	475200	this is actually probably the first recording of conversation between us because we've been friends
475200	479920	for many years now and I highly respect Daniel's work. And I'm very excited about this conversation.
479920	486080	So I just want to say that first. What I add to this is that I'm a narratologist. Well, here's a
486080	493880	new word, right? Please recall that the 20th century was mostly used for deconstruction. You
493880	499680	know, after the atomic bomb, August the 6th, 1945, the most important date in recent history for all
499680	505240	of us on the planet. I agree completely here with Daniel. Let's use that date. There's a certain date
505240	511160	there, August 6th, 1945. It helps us to locate ourselves historically. And after that date,
511760	516600	deconstruction became the natural norm. It's just like we have to deconstruct all of history. We
516600	522720	only begun that process. We have to deconstruct Western history of the world right now. That's
522720	527000	happening. We have people over the world who realize that there's a myth about Asia that is
527000	531600	completely incorrect. There's a myth about Africa that's completely incorrect. And also America
531600	536760	is finally shifting. America is not European any longer. America is now the meeting place of the
536760	541240	world populated by people from all over the world. And America needs just a new standard
541240	546360	language of the world that we all use to communicate. So even America is shifting in the
546360	550200	sense that America is becoming truly a global meeting place today. And that's what's really
550200	556280	interesting here. So I do narratology. Narratology is more than deconstruction. It's also
556280	563320	reconstruction. It's basically the philosophical search for the narratives that human beings tell
563320	568600	about themselves. We are storytelling animals. We're storytelling flock animals. So we tell
568600	573240	stories about ourselves all the time. And fundamentally, these stories have to be split
573240	578440	into three different types of stories. So let me follow you into this one. The first one is
578440	583320	precisely the one we're down here as an expert. It's what we call the logos. This is how reality
583320	587640	actually operates and how we symbolically try to understand how the world operates. For example,
587640	592840	mathematics, you know, when language tries to be exact, that's when we go into the logos.
593400	597400	The second one is pathos. You know, every time somebody tells you do it once more,
597400	601960	we would feeling like add the pathos, please, you're a human being, right? You're not a machine,
601960	608200	you do, you do, you need to add the pathos to what you do. So pathos is the storytelling
608200	613400	that's usually banned, banned from children's use. Just like I said that pornography, violence,
613400	619000	all of that is located in the pathos. And the third one is the mythos. And the mythos is the
619000	625560	only way for the other two to be combined. So our predicament as both Hegel and Nietzsche pointed
625560	631160	out in the 19th century is that the only way for us to have some kind of narrative that we can share
631160	637080	is to create a mythos. Not myth, but a mythos here. So these are the three basic stories and
637080	642680	they are dialectically intertwined. You cannot focus on one of them rather than the other one.
642680	647640	And then if you look at power and domination, it goes to say that power and domination goes
647640	653480	into these three realms. So the logos is the symbolic order and the symbolic, it's more of
653480	657960	the masculine side of things, if you allow us to say that, but it's more of the masculine side of
657960	662360	things. And the logos, how the world actually operates, zeros and ones today, more than anything
662360	669640	is the logos. And then that is logos is presented as knowledge, the power through knowledge,
669640	674680	whoever has access to knowledge today would say data and data processing, whoever has control
674680	679560	over the knowledge or dominates in the knowledge field has enormous power and influence. And that's
679560	685000	of course, we need to start today. The other one is violence itself, who has the monocular violence
685000	689960	of a specific territory, that state turn things like that. And that is the pathos. So that's
689960	694920	the second realm. And the pathos we call the real order, the real order of things. So ultimately,
695000	698840	the physical world out there, if you walk straight into a wall and hit your head,
699560	705720	you just encounter the pathical world out there. We can fantasize all we like and we human beings
705720	709640	fantasize individually and collectively all the time. But at the end of the day, our fantasies
709640	714600	will be crushed and they will be crushed by what's called the pathos. So that's the second realm,
714600	718920	the real one. The third one, the only one that can unite the other two is the imaginary order.
719480	725240	Imaginary order is tied to the mythos. So we imagine the world. And this way it gets important.
725800	729720	We have to have an imaginary that makes sense to us. We have to have a shared imagine if you're
729720	734680	going to share your society. And that's where the crisis at. So what's happening right now,
734680	740040	our proposal is that this is a paradigm shift in the sense that we're moving into the online world
740040	744200	and the internet is taking over the world. And we're globalized because the internet itself
744200	748760	goes towards globalization, whereas we human beings are very local in our attitude towards the world.
749080	754760	So this does a paradigm shift. Why there's a metacrisis tied to the paradigm shift
754760	761080	is that all these three narratives are in crisis at the same time. Daniel is the perfect guy in
761080	766760	the world right now to list the reason why logos is in crisis. That's exactly what he's talking about.
766760	772760	After 1945, we discovered that we're exploiting the world towards our own extinction. And that's
774040	777080	not a small thing to say. That's exactly what we're doing. We could blow ourselves up with the
777080	781320	bomb. We could also blow ourselves up in many other ways to just take more time. That's what
781320	787160	the logos crisis at. The problem is the other two aspects are in crisis too. The pathos,
788040	793160	the pathos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis in a very particular way.
793160	798920	It's a crisis in the religious or the spiritual and therefore also political manner. Death has
798920	803320	become the absolute. We now have an elite in the world today who believe they really will die when
803320	807880	they die. That has never happened before in history. We have always excused ourselves
807880	813320	with an afterlife or at least with a reincarnation. The reincarnation of the east of the afterlife of
813320	818600	the west. We have always had those myths before. Now we can no longer have a myth and therefore we
818600	824280	cannot have a myth that it's utopian or dystopian either. We have to accept that we die when we die
824280	828600	and the only thing that can transcend us is children who inherit the earth after we're gone.
829560	833720	We're into that mode now. We have an elite in the world that have come to accept that
833720	838360	and they're dealing with it massively and it's not a small thing at all when it's dealt with
838360	842520	collectively. This is like Nietzsche's The Last Man. That's where we're located right now. So there's
842520	848920	a crisis in the mythos too. There's a crisis in storytelling. We can deconstruct as much as we
848920	853640	like but if we don't reconstruct something valuable to us and have a new story, we're done.
854600	858520	And the third one is the crisis in the pathos. This is the crisis of violence. This is the
858520	863560	crisis of sexuality but this is also the crisis of nature itself that's now catching up with us.
863560	869480	This is the crisis of the bomb. It's literally physical. This is the crisis of the climate.
869480	874360	It's literally physical. Therefore, there's a crisis in the pathos too. So all the three
874360	879240	different narratives are in crisis. All the three different narratives simultaneously have to be
879240	883880	retold as a new shared narratology that makes sense to us. That's why there's a mental crisis.
885720	894760	May I ask you to just clarify a bit for what has to happen in logos, in pathos, and mythos?
894760	899480	Like is there something like what you would think of as necessary and sufficient criteria of the
899480	903800	new logos, the new mythos, and the new pathos that converges towards the third attractor?
904360	912040	Yeah, absolutely. The third attractor we call protopianism and I think it was Kelly Over at
912040	915960	Wired who invented the term or maybe it's been around because it sounds a bit generic. But
916520	921960	protopianism, when I came to East Asia and you travel there too down in a lot, like when I talk
921960	925960	to the Japanese, the Korean, and the Chinese, it doesn't make sense to say anything today that
925960	929960	they don't get or they don't subscribe to. And it certainly makes a lot of sense to listen to them
929960	936120	and their history, because we share a world with them now. Protopianism makes sense to anybody in
936120	942280	East Asia. The utopian dystopian dichotomy was always Western and we got it from Abrahamic
942280	946920	religion. It doesn't make sense in India, it doesn't make sense in China or Japan, but the
946920	952600	protopian perspective which is the incremental improvement and work towards optimization or
952600	958680	processes makes sense. That makes sense globally. So I would start with saying that all these
958760	964360	different narratives now have to be protopian. We need to get rid of the utopian, the drive towards
964360	968040	the utopian and the dystopian, which is what you call the third attractor, which I think is brilliant.
968040	973640	The third attractor is now required because it's the only credible global narrative we can have.
973640	979240	And it goes for both the logos and the mythos and the pathos. They all have to be protopian.
979240	983560	And you and I in one of our little night sessions over in California came up with the term that I
983560	990120	love called symbiotic intelligence. AI is what the machines will do, but as long as we human
990120	994440	beings are involved in a collaboration with the machines, I think it makes more sense to speak
994440	1000760	of an SI. An SI is an AI ultimately controlled by humans serving our interests, but that takes a lot
1000760	1005800	of maturity from us as well to work with the symbiotic intelligence. But symbiotic intelligence
1005800	1011000	is an intelligence that works towards optimization or process at all times. And of course,
1011000	1014280	this is not an optimization of a process that's ultimately exploitative.
1015000	1020760	That's what we use to term exploitation in our work all the time. We talk about resilience,
1020760	1026440	sustainability, these things. The exploitative aspect has to be implemented within a protopian
1026440	1032120	process, meaning that you have to give back what you just used. In that sense, you cannot exploit
1032120	1037800	the world any longer because it's the end of the story. To employative means closed loop or real
1037880	1041880	closed. Exactly. Employative is opposite to exploitative. So it's easy to understand. It's
1041880	1045800	the opposite of that. We used the word for the past 20 years. And what's important here is that
1045800	1050680	protopian ideals, meaning that if you're an artist, you go protopian. If you're an engineer, you go
1050680	1055800	protopian. If you start a company, you should have a protopian company from day one. So the way to
1055800	1060120	make incremental improvements on the world through your work, which is how you do technology,
1060120	1065720	essentially. Once we've created the technology, it's there. And technology in itself is a pharma
1065720	1073000	con. It can be good or bad. It can be Hiroshima. It can also be fusion. A pharma con. A pharma con
1073000	1077960	means that a technology in itself is neutral. It depends on what we human beings deal with it.
1077960	1081400	And in this sense, of course, atomic power is the perfect sample of a pharma con.
1083320	1088120	So that's what technology itself should be neutral to us. And then we ask ourselves the
1088120	1091320	question, how do we use that technology to the benefit of mankind longer?
1091560	1101480	It was actually a funny point of intersection. And I wish that my schedule over the last week
1101480	1106200	had been different. And I've got to read more of your recent work and share some things with you.
1106920	1110680	We actually just published a paper with a conciliance project called Tech Is Not Values Neutral
1111720	1117800	like a few days ago. So it's just funny to come to this point. It's maybe an interesting
1117800	1123080	topic for us to discuss because it doesn't map to the logos, pathos, mythos perfectly,
1123080	1130440	but the infrastructure, social structure, superstructure way of looking at the domains
1130440	1135960	of civilization and the fact that psyches and cultures are directly affected by tech.
1137080	1141240	And it's not just what values we bring to it determines if it has a good or bad use. It's that
1142040	1147960	every technology is an extension of human choice making. It catches on because it confers power.
1148760	1153320	And thus whoever uses it and gets more power usually ends up driving the beginning of a
1153320	1158600	new arms race of some type that obligates other people to use it. That codes a pattern of human
1158600	1162920	behavior to use the tech as opposed to not coding that pattern of human behavior affects human
1162920	1167240	psyches, value systems, belief systems, everything. And then the distribution of that affects
1167960	1174200	cultures and societies. So we call this psychosocial externalities rather than physical
1174200	1179320	externalities. And so physical externalities, we know the pollution and the harm in the supply
1179320	1183320	chain and whatever that occurs. So we have to go physically closed loop, meaning we're not using
1183320	1189400	unrenewable physical resources or turning them into trash or pollution. We have to go psychosocial
1189400	1196760	closed loop too. And it's not going to be closed loop in the same way, but it does mean forecast
1196760	1202040	the psychosocial effects and internalize them into the design process. Because obviously
1204760	1209960	something like the nature of the algorithm that optimizes for engagement, which in
1209960	1214840	optimizes for outrage, which ends up polarizing a society or shortening attention spans like
1214840	1220760	these are very real effects on psyches and society. So it's not fair to say tech is values
1220760	1228680	neutral. Tech was built to advance certain values like ease and brevity and comfort and
1228680	1233480	whatever, it advances those that affects other values and it does so at scale. And so if you
1233480	1238120	don't actually think about what are the values that are worth valuing? And how do we build tech
1238120	1245320	that enhances those? Then because the tech is so powerful, it will end up damaging them. And so
1245320	1250440	you actually can't think about the evolution of culture independently from the techplex that
1250440	1257320	ends up determining what wins behaviorally. I agree. So the point here is that engineers
1257320	1262200	have no clue what they're doing historically. So like if you would have asked Gutenberg about
1262200	1266360	the printing press in 1415, it was quite an event where the printing press arrived. I mean,
1266360	1270760	they started printing Bibles quite quickly to start with. And that was his point. The point
1270760	1274760	was that you should translate the Bible to local dialects around Europe so that Europeans could
1274760	1279080	read the Bible and become all the good Catholics that he wanted them to be. Actually, he created
1279160	1284120	the end of the Catholic Church. It's been growing gradually, but the whole question of the Catholic
1284120	1288440	Church, and now it's just basically diminishing into nothing, started with Gutenberg. He was the
1288440	1292840	killer of the Catholic Church. He just didn't know. So the problem is that engineers are usually
1292840	1298920	historically speaking very unaware. So I just want to remove the guilt applied to them afterwards,
1298920	1302920	like you don't even know what people do with you. I mean, Nietzsche couldn't know that Hitler would
1302920	1307400	come along and Marx couldn't know that Stalin would come along. You can't blame people afterwards
1307480	1312440	what people later are doing in the sense that we usually do. So my point is this, though, that
1312440	1316360	there's a social responsibility for creating an environment where technology is created in the
1316360	1321720	first place. The one thing we have learned is that we hardly change at all. Human beings are
1321720	1327480	basically the same worthy five or 10,000 years ago in the very short span of the created civilization.
1327480	1332600	What we do create is technology. The way I frame it is that I said, women give birth to children.
1333560	1338760	Men envy women for giving birth to children. Men therefore give birth to technology.
1339400	1344120	The problem is that if technology develops quicker than children do, which tends to do,
1344840	1350920	it's only a question of time before technology kills the child unless you intervene. So that's
1350920	1357000	essentially the history of civilization in five sentences in a very Freudian sense. So my point
1357000	1361720	being calling technology value neutral is, of course, nothing is value neutral in the formal
1361720	1369240	sense, but it is to point out that technologies are pharmaconic, usually by historical necessity,
1369240	1374760	and then we can look at them. Today we know more, and today the loops of technological innovation
1374760	1381000	are so tight and involve so many people that the pathos of the mythos are obviously now involved
1381000	1385960	in the loop of the logos itself. We are really beginning to look at the word dialectically.
1385960	1390200	We're really beginning to look at the word. These three narratives are now colliding one
1390200	1395400	another. We cannot trust any one of them because as human beings we have to operate all three,
1395400	1400760	and we have to reform all three at the same time, which is exactly why this is a meta crisis to solve.
1401720	1406120	Yeah, we have to do all three at the same time, you and I totally agree on. We're not looking at a
1406920	1411640	theory of change. We're looking at an ecosystem of theories of change, an ecosystem of projects that
1412360	1419240	have a pro-topic direction to them, have a third attractor, attractive basin to them, and the desire
1419240	1428040	for what is the comprehensive solution set or roadmap for humanity is based on the fallacy
1428040	1434760	that a centralizing intelligence could do that thing. I think we think very much the same way
1434760	1438760	about that. It's interesting. I want to try to tie a couple things together that you said.
1440440	1445720	We're mentioning that Marx can't really be blamed first all and then etc. because people can't really
1445720	1451880	forecast what's going to happen afterwards. Einstein and the Baum, great example. I think it's true that
1453160	1459080	I was talking with a friend the other day about all of the hopeful projects that were going to make
1459080	1464600	the world better that didn't happen that he was kind of traumatized by and where their hope in how
1464600	1470440	good they would be was false. And I said, yeah, but you also need to equally factor all of the
1471240	1474360	devastatingly bad things that people forecasted during that time that didn't happen as well,
1474360	1480440	that the Cuban Missile Crisis didn't become World War III and Y2K didn't in the world and 2012 didn't
1480440	1486680	and on and on. And that if you factor them both, people just suck at forecasting the future because
1486680	1490040	it makes sense that we would. We can't get the weather right 10 days out like
1490040	1493720	multiply embedded complex systems are hard, we're just not going to do that.
1493720	1497880	So we have to get recursive intelligence processes that can do a little bit and increase the
1497880	1503160	collective intelligence that can keep doing that. That said, I think there are some things we can do
1504520	1510600	to forecast externalities much, much, much better than we ever have that are kind of low hanging
1510600	1515560	and it's really worthwhile. And so one thing as you're mentioning that the engineers, I mean,
1515560	1518840	I think the engineers have been profoundly competent in the domain that they were trained,
1519400	1525080	but as soon as you understand that technology codes patterns of behavior that end up coding
1525080	1529880	minds that then in mass code societies, of course, technologies have to be trained in social sciences
1530520	1537400	and axiological design, what are the value sets that will emerge from the use of these technologies
1537400	1540760	has to be a consideration doesn't mean you'll get it all right, but we need to work at it and then
1540760	1546440	recursively work at it and improve the process as we go. So I think when you have bigger frameworks
1546440	1551400	like that are superstructure and our collective definition of the good life and values, whatever
1551400	1556040	our social structure or economics governance law and agreement fields and our infrastructure or
1556040	1561000	techplex co influence each other so that you don't try to do sense making within what you do
1561000	1565720	sense making across them. Just basic shit like that really helps, right? It really helps the
1565720	1572200	forecasting. But one other thing I wanted to say is there's a very interesting thing right now where
1572200	1576760	the arguments that we can't possibly forecast the future well enough ends up being a source of plausible
1576760	1583320	deniability for people not even trying where it's in their vested interest not to. And the less
1583320	1588520	wrong community had this blog post on is it mistake theory or conflict theory that's a very
1588520	1592280	deal meaning the mistake theory or the problem is the result of shit we just couldn't have possibly
1592280	1596360	known and the externalities are too complex or is it conflict theory meaning we actually wanted
1596360	1600520	to cause that problem or we wanted to benefit and we didn't really care if we caused that problem.
1600520	1606680	And of course it's some of both. But some of the argument in there is Michael Vassar and others
1606760	1613640	commented is that the existence of the possibility of mistake theory serves as a plausible
1613640	1618040	deniability cover for a bunch of conflict theory to hide itself and say oh we couldn't have possibly
1618040	1622680	known. Oh bullshit you didn't try because it wasn't in your interest. Yeah I'm just thinking of like
1622680	1627320	Instagram wouldn't they have known that they would cause like a massive psychiatric health
1627320	1632680	crisis among teenage girls. It was quite obvious. You and I pointed that out from the very beginning
1632680	1636520	like just like they couldn't know but they didn't want to hear it right because they were
1636520	1641000	there was telling everybody at the time Facebook was starting or whatever it's going to do these
1641000	1646120	things they're like shut up hippie and no it's not there's no possible way but of course the
1646120	1649800	motivated reasoning is a problem right. Motivated reasoning is tricky. So here's the piece that I
1649800	1655080	wanted to add which is there's a very perverse piece of kind of game theory at a consentive here
1655080	1661720	that has to be bound which is that it is very disadvantageous and a market type dynamic for
1661720	1667320	any individual or group to focus on what the possible risks might be and it's very of the
1667320	1671000	thing that they would develop and it's very advantageous to just focus on the opportunities
1671000	1676920	and benefits because if I do protracted risk assessment somebody else hits first mover advantage
1676920	1681720	faster and if my protracted risk assessment says actually the field is too dangerous we
1681720	1684920	shouldn't do it it's not going to stop the fucking thing the market is going to move
1684920	1689480	the people who move fastest will privatize the benefits and then socialize the losses
1690040	1696360	and so there's a focus to move fast break things socialize the losses nobody takes responsibility
1697000	1704040	that perverse game theory keeps people from even trying to think well and when the worst
1704040	1709000	harm you could do was add lead to gasoline which was pretty fucking bad right it it decreased
1709000	1713480	the IQ of the planet by like a billion points and made people four times more violent it's like
1714280	1718120	Jesus Christ that's a huge deal when you say humans have been about the same for 5000 years I'm
1718120	1722840	like no man fucking just let it gasoline alone made us a billion IQ points stupider and four times
1722840	1727080	more violent like that's a big deal and that was one of 50 million chemicals in the in the chemical
1727080	1734760	database that it made but but when it comes to synthetic biology and general artificial intelligence
1736600	1740440	by the time we're dealing with those types of externalities it is it's totalizing
1741320	1745240	and so we actually have to do some fundamentally different types of coordination
1746040	1751720	around how to think through the long term better using models like attractive basins and things
1751720	1754840	where you don't have to get every detail of complex systems right but you can get general
1754840	1760840	principles and where you disincentivize move fast and break things and this is actually
1760840	1765480	things like to open up a new category of tech you actually have to open up these you have to get
1765480	1769960	regulatory approval to open it up as opposed to regulate after the harms have already happened
1771560	1774600	that's of course that bothers everyone because they don't trust states to regulate so we have
1774600	1779240	to also restructure the state from scratch because the power to check the catastrophes creates
1779240	1784040	dystopias unless you also have strong bindings on it but you have to face these things together
1784600	1789240	yeah and that's where it gets interesting here with the narcology you just said the state here
1790040	1796040	the state is in the imaginary realm it's not a logical rose in the imaginary realm so so we
1796040	1801160	did inherit from religion and the gods and the forefathers and all that we know this idea of the
1801160	1805960	state and that would be the king or you know with the priest and eventually that becomes the state
1805960	1811560	we have today and the state is so far behind and the problem here of course is the other one
1811560	1817000	is that if you have if you create a monopoly it will instantly go corrupt and become dysfunctional
1817000	1822040	and we created states so far that are not competing one another at all they're local monopolies
1822040	1825960	and this is of course the problem you got the market the market is incredibly efficient i can
1825960	1831880	give an example of my team we just studied construction sites in east africa east africa is
1831880	1836440	like wide open right now it wants to expand quickly it looks at china and india it doesn't care too
1836440	1840440	much about regulation so this is the perfect place for a chinese construction company to
1840440	1844760	be the shed of a french construction company with a bid for a construction in iroby because the
1844760	1849160	french come there with a european attitude they've learned you know the hard way that we need to make
1849160	1852840	an assessment a risk assessment before you start building and by the time they start the risk
1852840	1856360	assessment the chinese are ready up and building the construction anyway because they don't care
1856360	1861640	about the risk assessment so we still have this sort of this blatant aggressive form of capitalism
1861640	1866680	running around the world and they know that we have exactly what you said we need to create
1866680	1872200	a functioning container within which the market can operate with some certain rules and then people
1872200	1876360	scream oh that's socialism and we need a bigger state and we know states can function any longer
1876360	1881720	and the states are going incredibly corrupt slow and they no longer work this is again this is part
1881720	1888120	of the imaginary order of crisis so it's in the imaginary order it's a crisis of religion and politics
1888120	1894280	in a fundamental one now i like then to go back to what actually worked and i know you also you
1894280	1900440	you tend to quote the silk group try it you tend to quote daoism buddhism is orastrism i do too i
1900440	1904360	find very very little solace in christianity and islam when it comes to try to understand
1904360	1908440	we're at right now i prefer these religions that have been around for thousands of years
1908440	1914360	and they've been created along the trade routes so i go to the metaphor of the bazaar now how does
1914360	1919640	a bazaar work well a bazaar has to be exploitative because it's going to be around for thousands
1919640	1925400	of years it's probably in some kind of an oasis town along the trade route you put an old smart
1925400	1930840	wise woman at the door you know you put that bitch at the door nobody gets in without her permission
1931640	1937480	so you have a membrane and containers start with functioning membranes so there are rules
1937560	1942920	how you conduct the trade in the bazaar otherwise the bazaar will not work it's not a free market
1942920	1948200	it's not a free for all you can do whatever you like because then the bazaar falls apart so if
1948200	1952360	you think of the system we're looking at as a kind of a bazaar that we need to create for the digital
1952360	1956280	age it starts to make sense then we can have different bazaars that compete in one another
1956280	1961080	but we have to have a central framework for all the bazaars of the world which is how we
1961080	1967000	exploitatively use the world in that sense so that we don't completely go into collapse so the
1967000	1971160	problem here is that we both on a global level have to have a network of bazaars and another
1971160	1976280	local ever there are the bazaars but what I'm then proposing is that the bazaar looks to its own
1976280	1984040	self-interest long time see it keeps itself alive as a container within which you can put the content
1984040	1989320	and this is why the market will not work unless the market is regulated it has to start there
1989400	1993800	so the markets themselves have to look at their own regulation otherwise we should just boycott
1993800	1997960	the market not be part of it just say that I don't want to be in the bazaar at all unless it works
1998760	2002760	unless unless it has a functioning membrane unless it takes responsibility for itself in
2002760	2007080	relation to other bazaars it's not a trading place for me to be involved with it has to be
2007080	2013240	something like that because we have a major a metacrisis of politics right now we know the
2013240	2017400	states that we construct and no longer work and the only alternative out that seems to work right
2017400	2023160	now interesting enough imitates egyptian dictatorship and it's called communist china
2023720	2027400	they at least seem to have a sense of what we call a sensocracy where they're going how they
2027400	2031800	will control everything to a central computer we also know that that won't work either so the
2031800	2037080	question is how do we open a society that's free and open enough to stay creative and to stay open
2037080	2043720	to bad news which dictatorships never do which exactly why they go extinct eventually and this
2043800	2050040	is of course the central question ideologically speaking and it's a question of imaginary narrative
2050040	2054680	it's in imaginary order that's the crisis there the reason that you're saying it's fundamentally
2054680	2059000	imaginary and why the bazaar worked in the market didn't is the bazaar had a long-term
2059000	2064600	survival interest in the market doesn't and that the long-term interest is in the imaginary realm
2064600	2069400	there was some narrative that everyone the bazaar was a part of that was self-transcending so they
2069400	2074840	wouldn't fuck the future to benefit themselves for some reason and that that's what's missing
2074840	2082120	currently that's the mythos is what is it that has us not maximize short-term personal gain
2082920	2087560	because there is some higher order transcendental narrative that we will have be a basis to find
2087560	2091480	our behavior is that right yeah so if you're looking around the bazaar on a map this would
2091480	2096360	you find interesting every bazaar it had the hospice it had the restaurant and the hotel
2096360	2102360	it had the bath house in a clique which is also a social place it had a gym there was always a
2102360	2107480	gym around the bazaar they called sarkhani the persians invented the gym 3 000 years ago
2107480	2112280	where you go work out and make your body fit and then it has the bazaar and you need to probably
2112280	2117400	go to the whorehouse which is another word for nightclub to socialize with people and see strangers
2117400	2121560	and make friends with strangers and there's no better place than a nightclub or even a whorehouse
2121560	2125480	if we're honest about it to make friends with a stranger they'd be absolutely naked in front
2125480	2129480	of somebody which you are at a whorehouse and therefore you can make a trade the next day
2129480	2134600	so the matriarch sitting at the front of the bazaar will make sure that she checks you done all
2134600	2138920	these things now here's the most important thing though it wasn't my team in london that they
2138920	2144440	discovered that every bazaar after you leave the bazaar you leave the town and go to the next
2144440	2150440	town to trade you have to go up to a costog the costog is the origin of the monastery
2151320	2156600	you literally have after you've done your traded bazaar you need to go to spiritual center and
2156600	2162440	fix your mind this is where you go into what the Tao is called Tao or the Zoroastrian is called the
2162440	2167800	Asha of the world you go into a relationship where you actually you go back into the logos you go back
2167800	2172680	into reality as much as you possibly can including yourself and you readjust yourself your own
2172680	2178760	thinking oh you did a bad deal in the bazaar get rid of it get over it move on come back with a
2178760	2184680	constructive mindset and all these trade group religions are basically they bowled down the
2184680	2190520	ethics to in what way are you constructively participating in the world in what way are you
2190520	2195080	constructing or representing your tribe when you're out here traveling doing the trades
2195080	2199960	in what way are constructed be supporting the community that just embraced you and welcomed
2199960	2204440	just you could do your trade and what we are constructively moving on to the next community
2204440	2209880	you're gonna enter so you can go into that bazaar and make more trade so the question here is that
2209880	2216440	why do we miss out on the costog we separated religion from the rest of side and made it a
2216440	2221080	private thing something you do on Sundays you go to church and show off yourself and of course that
2221080	2225560	eventually ended up with us being cynical about religion like well I only go to church on Sunday
2225560	2230040	it's only worth investment if it looks good so I can make more money on the Monday while
2230040	2237160	exploiting the world so the costog is fundamental to interactions especially when it comes to
2237160	2241400	larger populations than our own tribe as soon as you move into a larger public zone tribe
2241400	2245960	we need to start containing ourselves in our behavior relationship to other people the costog
2245960	2250520	eventually leads to the monastery traditions of all of Eurasia especially buddhism's are
2250520	2254680	asked in the dullest monasteries and I think it really pays off for most people today to go and
2254680	2259720	spend some time a year or two in the monastery and try to figure out what it means to meditate
2259720	2263720	and contemplate every morning of your day to have a constructive mindset towards the world
2263720	2268760	it has to it has to be his personal spiritual journey involved here and it was required at the
2268760	2273800	bazaars it was required it was the first thing they would ask you the next time you come to
2273800	2278920	oh did you go to the costog after did the train of bazaar the last stop you made otherwise you're
2278920	2285000	not welcome otherwise you haven't done your work this became such an industry you even had to build
2285000	2291640	costogs in mountains you know god hello tibetan buddhism you had to build in mountain where the
2291640	2296760	monks themselves and the nuns themselves prepare themselves for all the heaven load that they had
2296760	2301960	to go through with the traders and the costogs in the trading towns so it became like a spiritual
2301960	2312200	industry but that's fine and we need one today as well so did the next bazaar require some kind of
2312920	2315800	ticket or proof that you've been in the costog or they took your word for it
2316520	2322120	no absolutely and again this is this is how you get your credibility you get your credibility
2322120	2326520	because you've done the trade many times and yeah we can trust this god the way we do grading
2326520	2332680	today this is the 5.0 okay and it also represents a community that is underrepresented inside the
2332680	2337800	bazaar meaning it's got to sell us stuff we haven't seen it before oh that's quite exotic and interesting
2337800	2343480	let him go in he will do fine but if he doesn't do fine if he's out competed about it he needs to
2343480	2348920	go to the costog more than ever the next day to not take that looser mentality with him into the
2348920	2358760	next trade it's very interesting i i not heard that story told that way um so there's a way that i
2358760	2367240	think about that relative to the world today where it uh it seems like something has changed in scale
2367240	2371880	in a way that crossed a threshold that changed in type or the same thing even in network wouldn't
2371880	2378680	apply i'd like to ask this question and get your thought on it so you went to the market
2379400	2384280	after talking about the state and then you said okay in the market there was something like law
2384280	2390680	the woman at the front um had some kind of wisdom to be able to assess who you are some
2390680	2396360	record of if you went to the costog or not some you know some indicators about you and then obviously
2396360	2401640	she's probably connected to a network of people who are reporting on what people are doing inside
2401640	2407960	and there's probably something like police and whatever right so uh if someone is stealing or
2407960	2412360	doing false advertising or whatever it would be that would go against the um written or unwritten
2412360	2417880	law of the thing then they get kicked out or something like that so there's something like
2417880	2423320	rules and there's something like enforcement which is what defines the membrane and so acting on the
2423320	2431240	inside requires participation with the rules one of the things that makes that work without
2431240	2439720	being tyrannical is the smallness of scale yes and so unlike a massive police state um if the
2440440	2445240	police in that thing started to get corrupt enough of the people could overthrow the police and
2446040	2453800	there's no such thing as a person at a bazaar who can use personalized data micro targeted
2453800	2458280	split tested advertising on me like they can just say I got the best shit and I can say what about
2458280	2462120	these guys over here their shoes are cheaper and I can go touch them by myself right so there's not
2462120	2467080	a radical asymmetry between billion dollar corporations and the purchaser it's like a dude on
2467080	2471000	one side of the table selling stuff and a dude on the other side buying stuff there's not that much
2471000	2475800	asymmetry between the police and the non-police and so the symmetry is part of what makes something
2475800	2480440	like caveat and tour by or be where be reasonable or what makes something like the second amendment
2480440	2485640	hey if we need to throw over the police we can deal with it a reasonable idea when you start to get
2485640	2491640	to much more radical when you get to much more size if you want to have something like rule of
2491640	2497480	law across that whole size a very big membrane then you get pretty radical asymmetries of power
2497480	2502360	in a radical asymmetry of power you don't even have things like the ability to check the corruption
2502360	2507960	on it or even consent as a valid idea because of things like a new influence what does consent mean
2507960	2512360	if I don't have capacity to consent because the other agent is so much smarter than I am that they
2512360	2516840	can manipulate me to do shit which is like cold dynamics but a cold dynamic is nothing compared
2516840	2521880	to ai's on social media or whatever else doing stochastic terrorism and population centric warfare
2522520	2526120	so I don't even need a monopoly of violence anymore I just need a monopoly of influence
2526760	2531080	and the monopoly of influence can make people commit the violence I want or whatever it is
2531080	2536680	so when you start dealing with those who control ai's and those who don't
2537960	2544840	when you start to deal with that level of um asymmetry of information processing capacity
2544840	2552200	voluntarism doesn't mean anything anymore the ability to uh because you cannot voluntarily consent
2552200	2555720	in or not consent when you can't check all the stuff what does it mean for the people to be able
2555720	2559560	to check the state if there's no way to process all the information because the state's using ai to
2559560	2565400	process all the shit right um and how do the people deal with the if there is a policing force at all
2565400	2571000	the levels of asymmetry of power so if you say okay fuck nation states we're just doing city
2571000	2575080	states let's keep them smaller and let's always make sure that if anybody has an ai there's a
2575080	2579400	competing ai so you at least have something of some metrical size that can compete with it
2579400	2584440	well now we get this issue that let's just even take nation states we can go to city states but
2584440	2588760	let's take something less than global governance anything less than global governance you still
2588760	2594680	get global multicoller traps meaning a situation where if they're going to do the fucked up thing
2594680	2598040	then we have to raise to do the fucked up thing or they be best right they're going to develop nukes
2598040	2601880	we have to develop nukes they're going to develop ai weapons we have to develop ai weapons they're
2601880	2606600	going to overfish the ocean well how do we stop them from overfishing the ocean if they have nukes
2606600	2610920	and then they really need the fish for their population growth so if we don't overfish the
2610920	2616600	ocean the fish are still going to go so we might as well race to overfish the ocean so those race
2616600	2620600	to the bottom coordination failures are because you don't have a monopoly of violence to be able
2620600	2624200	to enact rule of law which is why you want a global government that you don't want a global
2624200	2628360	government because a monopoly of violence with no checks and balances become totally corrupt
2628360	2633160	catastrophes dystopias so you want a global government that is not corrupt well that requires
2633160	2638920	some magic right or really good design and i think that's where you and i are going to get so
2639480	2644280	what i see is that the principles that we're operating at the bazaar were scale dependent
2645560	2650360	and that as the scale gets larger you get fundamental breakdowns in some of those things
2650360	2655720	when the scale gets large enough for instance that supply and demand have a radical asymmetry
2655720	2659720	because even though in aggregate the total amount of demand total amount of supply is
2659720	2663240	the same flow of dollars the supply is not coordinated the demand is not coordinated and
2663240	2667720	the supply is coordinated right i don't have a labor union of all google users who work together
2667720	2671240	and use ai to coordinate how they want to use google but google is the centralized corporation
2671240	2676920	that actually has long perm planning and in org chart and again chart whatever so it's really
2676920	2682760	google half a trillion dollar organization whatever using ai's against a single user or facebook or
2682760	2689000	nike or whatever it is and they can employ radical behavior mod techniques so there's no
2689000	2694760	longer authentic demand driving supply there's supply manufacturing bullshit demand based on one
2694760	2699240	marshmallow stuff rather than two marshmallow and then say oh but the people want it after driving
2699240	2706280	addiction and so when you have those types of asymmetries it's asymmetric warfare you don't
2706280	2711080	have like the same principles that apply when there's symmetry like buyer beware like second
2711080	2714760	amendment like what they just don't hold in the same way so you need a fundamentally different
2714760	2721720	way of thinking how do we deal when there are competing interests across types of asymmetries
2721800	2727160	of power that are totally unprecedented absolutely i agree totally here and i think you're not
2727160	2730760	working on the same thing you're doing it on the technological level i'm doing it on the
2730760	2735400	narratological level i'm writing a book and you can do the technical level without the narrative
2735400	2741800	level no exactly exactly that's the point yeah so the the um the narratology i'm doing at the moment
2742600	2746600	the reason why i got into this thing with the bazaar is of course the the whole the entire
2746600	2751800	history of eurasia is being rewritten at the moment by asian historians many of them asian
2751800	2757160	americans like chinese american indian american persian american historians and i have discovered
2757160	2762680	that the entire history of asia is just a european 19th century fantasy it's completely incorrect it's
2762680	2767960	just read the wrong way so that's exactly what we see these patterns and and the reason what we're
2767960	2773320	doing is because asia's history is much older than europe's and that's the asset here we need we need
2773320	2779160	deep history we need long history to to look at what systems work and what stories work over
2779160	2784360	long periods of time and which stories failed and here's the interesting thing the it is that
2784360	2790600	we're looking at units like empire which is older by the way than nation and look at these systems so
2790600	2795800	what is an empire what is a nation what could it possibly be in what we would technology subscribe
2795800	2799960	to an empire in what way can human beings subscribe to certain empire and in terms of the
2799960	2805640	empire that were very loose they were full of dialectical conflicts and economies everywhere
2805640	2810040	they were allowed they were certainly encouraged they didn't worry too much about a diversity of
2810040	2815160	looks like we do today there were much more about diversity of talents and a diversity of opinions
2815160	2818840	because the strengthens the system's long term so you want to have these sort of competitive
2818840	2823160	environments we want to have them within certain containers that work and you discover when you
2823160	2828840	do these formats that you don't need the police unless the size is big that's exactly my scale
2828840	2833800	here is incredibly important we take to the tribal size somewhere between 1200 and 1500
2833800	2837720	people quite naturally and anything smaller than that we're perfectly comfortable with
2837720	2843160	we don't need a police force to be loyal to and even live and die for a community of say 1500
2843160	2847880	people once it gets bigger than that that gets more problematic and that's why you need these
2847880	2852600	sort of social systems and eventually even states or at least city states nations whatever
2852600	2858520	for those things to work and they are required the question is on what level can people you know
2858520	2862440	align this in what on what level can they for example vote for a politician that they would
2862440	2866600	know and they say hi to industry well that's only to a certain level but that's absolutely
2866600	2870600	minimum level you must work with because otherwise people don't trust people around them they don't
2870600	2874840	trust the leaders their elders or whatever then you have to go all the way up to global that's
2874840	2880600	the challenge here it's unavoidable there has to be some kind of least loose global you know
2880600	2885640	collaboration here and some certain global rules we have to have a membrane for planet earth itself
2886520	2891560	and at least after the atomic bomb in 1945 in the late 1950s we got the first pictures of
2891560	2895800	planet earth from outer space we tend to forget how young these pictures are there's only like
2895800	2901080	a little more than 50 years ago we finally saw this beautiful green blue planet where we live
2901080	2908040	and we saw this huge cold dark space out there that we cannot relate to so at least we know we
2908040	2913400	have the dia we have we have that narrative it's there and it's unavoidable I would even say that
2913400	2917400	I challenge my students these days and say that the one thing I will take care of probably is to
2917400	2922520	conquer outer space and you will not be involved and maybe that's a good place to start because the
2922520	2928440	hubris we suffered from should have some kind of a price we need to pay so you remind the students
2928440	2933480	that if we don't fix this planet which is the only place we know we can actually live in the
2933480	2939560	universe then we're done so the planet has to be fixed it has to be fixed it's unavoidable as a question
2939560	2943560	and this is the largest size I think we should allow ourselves to think to forget about our
2943560	2949160	space but think of the satellites at least a space surrounding the planet creating the internet
2949160	2954120	and what we then come to is of course the complexity has increased to higher levels than ever
2954840	2959880	which are there for expect people to go absolutely bananas over the next 50 years that's our book
2959880	2963800	digital libido by the way it's a very dark book because the first thing that will happen now so
2963800	2968280	people will go absolutely bananas they will go for all kinds of conspiracy theories that will create
2968280	2972280	the weirdest sects and cults you've ever seen they will lose themselves completely in these
2972280	2976520	environments it will not be safe to be outside anybody can kill you for whatever reasons you don't
2976520	2981240	know you know if anybody can order your murder you don't know who's going to kill you uh she
2981240	2986760	says abe was killed in japan because somebody started making homemade guns in japan so japan
2986760	2991800	has the same gun control problem that was america for that very reason so it becoming a very unsafe
2991800	2997160	world very quickly now that's quite obvious so the question then is we then have to move quicker
2997240	3002120	towards the global order it has to be very very loose it has to be very loose then the question
3002120	3008680	the next question is what would its insocracy be like we need algorithms algorithms have bad
3008680	3012680	reputation today because they're so bad today but they could be much much much better they could
3012680	3017240	much better reflect the world how the world actually operates i call it the free and open
3017240	3022040	algorithm to give it a positive spin is to get rid of those sort of manipulated algorithms
3022040	3026760	corrupted algorithms and conformist algorithms that we have today we need to get rid of the
3026760	3033080	manipulation the conformation and the corruption of current algorithms we need proper algorithms
3033080	3037240	because algorithms is the only help we have with increased complexity try to understand the world
3037240	3041160	better and leadership has to be based on proper algorithms that give you a fair view what the
3041160	3046280	world looks like again back to the logos the conspiracy theories they want to avoid the logos
3046280	3050600	as much as they can so jump between the pathos and the mythos which is incredibly dangerous to
3050600	3054520	put a lot of people in that realm we need to go back to the logos and the algorithms are there to
3054520	3062680	help us do that can you explain for me what you mean by the good algorithms that we need for leadership
3062680	3070280	to work okay so if it's a new paradigm it will be chaotic at first now allow for chaos say an
3070280	3076120	anarchy to establish itself first which is what the internet has been so far the old institutions
3076120	3081160	that used to be powerful the old logos the old pathos and the old mythos and the institutions
3081160	3086040	built on those old narratives will try to defend themselves all they can although they're done
3086760	3093800	I call this the the the Versailles versus Paris uh dichotomy this is like 1789 in Paris so Versailles
3093800	3100520	today is politics politics tries to manipulate the algorithms in political directions so the
3100520	3104600	algorithms are not free and open they don't reflect you and don't reflect the kind of world you want
3104600	3110200	to live in and need to live in then we got the corruption of money they used to put the ads
3110200	3114360	on the side with the percent of the algorithms for you when you did your search now the ads are at
3114360	3119560	the very top of the ads are increasing the infill trading the algorithm itself it becomes a corrupt
3119560	3123480	algorithm because money is corrupting it and money should not be involved in creation of the
3123480	3129080	algorithm at least for you personally we try to search the internet the third one is the conformation
3129080	3133400	and that means the old established institutions hate the fact the world is splitting up in so
3133400	3138840	many different directions and it's becoming so chaotic so the old institutions like academia
3138840	3143480	like mass media you know television stations you know the old institutions they will all say that
3143480	3149000	you must be more alike you must be more conformed and therefore conform it in itself as a value
3149000	3155000	precisely we need more people to you know to be more creative about solving these problems we try
3155000	3159880	to conform everybody into the same pattern so these are the three fourths of the old institutions
3159880	3165800	the way Versailles would attack the streets of Paris in 1789 by telling the streets of Paris off
3165800	3171000	not realizing the people in the streets of Paris could read write or count which nobody in the
3171000	3175640	nobility of Versailles could any longer therefore the streets of Paris finally came to the conclusion
3175640	3180360	let's go to Versailles chop their heads off because the old institutions are useless to us these days
3180360	3184840	because we can create the new institutions that could work of course that led to a bloodbath
3185560	3190680	would you want to avoid what have a slow gradual decrease of the old institutions and want the
3190680	3195320	new institutions to come into place and the new institutions to come into place must represent
3195320	3200280	the logos the pathos and the mythos they must incredibly do that the different expertise
3200920	3206040	that's why you and I are very very careful to not ever speak like in a sort of general sense
3206040	3211320	we speak as the specialists we are even if we're considered to be generalists so I'm a
3211320	3217880	narratologist I do storytelling uh John Seticfist and I have worked with this for the past 25 years
3217880	3221800	you know he was a former scriptwriter I was a former music producer it makes sense to be
3221800	3226120	become philosophers of narrative and narratology and we now want to move the whole the construction
3226120	3232440	revolution of the 20th century into a reconstruction revolution of the 21st century which is fiendishly
3232440	3237720	hard we call it narrative you call it culture in your work where is the digital culture
3238840	3243400	digital is still a tale digital is hardly even happened yet we just know it's going to happen
3243400	3247480	and digital is going to remember absolutely everything the way it's been programmed at least
3247480	3252600	it's going to remember absolutely everything that happens so thankfully we have a data revolution
3252600	3258360	in parallel with increased complexity and that data revolution should be the free and open algorithms
3258360	3262520	that can help us to guide ourselves so we get a fair view how the world actually operates
3263400	3266680	it's required and if that's how we're going to solve climate change at the end of the day
3266680	3271240	you're not this working any longer you're actually providing proper data no climate change is
3271240	3276920	happening here is the data the satellites provide the data this is the actual temperature in
3276920	3281240	500 different places around the planet right now this temperature should be in July this temperature
3281240	3286280	that's in July so you know the data at the end of the day convinces people finally to give up the
3286280	3290600	resistance and realize the climate change is really happening and now it has to be worked on
3290600	3295800	and that's sort of logical argument the logos once the logos comes into the picture it becomes
3295800	3300360	a lot easier to convince more people this is actually happening you cannot escape this and
3300360	3305800	along with this must be done before that we just did the guesswork we just did the storytelling
3305800	3313240	just had fairy tales suddenly is real and this when the real on the logos when the real from
3313240	3318760	the pathos to the logos comes into the picture when the undeniable facts are there we have more
3318760	3329000	hope of getting things done than we did right before so I I generally agree that important
3329000	3333880	deconstruction happened an important reconstruction of a different type a different dimensionality
3333880	3344840	is needed when you identify rightly that all of the narratives had embedded power plays in them
3346280	3350120	and you kind of deconstruct that you look at all the motivated reasoning that was involved
3351480	3357960	in a way you actually heighten power to be the only game there is because there is no
3358920	3369240	unifying basis of ability to form shared basis for choice making and so the ability to have
3369240	3374600	epistemologies of is science and epistemologies of all ethics that work together better
3375240	3380520	that are never adequate but we're continuously improving that identify their own perverse incentives
3380520	3385000	and where the perverse incentives affect the nature of the motivated reasoning itself
3385960	3391160	gives you something like whether you call it metamodern or whatever some capacity for
3393240	3399960	shared choice making that is not just the game of power so I would very much like to go there
3399960	3404600	I'd very much like to go into the relationship between what has to happen in culture or narrative
3404600	3410200	or superstructure or like our shared values or shared meaning making to inform choice making
3410200	3416040	and how that relates to tech but I think because you said a lot in there I think the place I'd like
3416040	3421720	to start is when you said what happened between Paris and Versailles we want to do a slow version
3421720	3425880	now so it's not so bloody and that the previous institutions are kind of holding on
3428120	3431960	there's this story that like looks like the sovereign individual put forward
3432680	3438360	that said changes in tech change social structures we know that changes in info tech
3438360	3443480	specifically do right so Marvin Harris said the first argument McLuhan really went deep
3443480	3450920	with the second argument and that you get a printing press and in feudalism and usher's in
3450920	3455800	democracy and in Catholicism and usher's in you know Lutheranism and other things
3455800	3459320	because the nature of everybody can have a newspaper and everybody can have a textbook is
3459320	3464120	really different so you it's a democratizing force but it was tech affecting the social system so then
3464760	3468680	the idea that the next we we got modern democracies based out of that
3470040	3475160	the idea that the next major change in the information technology is the internet computation
3475160	3482840	and then shared distributed computation and so now we can share value online by moving bits around
3482840	3487320	in uh net space as opposed to just atoms around in physical space and we can find networks of
3487320	3492040	affinity that are stronger than just the networks of geography so the nation state that was a
3492040	3497000	geographically based thing to move atoms around will be progressively less useful than the net
3497000	3501960	based move bits around thing and so you'll get these new emergent systems that kind of debase
3501960	3508760	the old ones i think this is a good and partial insight i think there's a heap wrong with it
3509640	3515400	and i want to hear your thoughts on one part of it because one specific part there's quite a lot
3515400	3520120	the fact that we can move bits around and have that correspond to value doesn't mean we don't
3520120	3523800	also still have to move atoms around or that the virtual world doesn't completely depend upon the
3523800	3529480	physical world and if the virtual world depending upon the physical world is debasing the integrity
3529480	3534120	of the foundational thing it depends upon there's a problem in that thing um so there's a bunch of
3534120	3539000	things i have there a problem with it but one in particular we talked about how to have it be less
3539000	3544680	bloody in the old institutions there was bloody overthrow of feudalism right the american revolutionary
3544680	3550440	war is one of many there was a thing where the symmetry of power was such that the uprising
3550440	3555960	army could deal with another army sometimes right within a standing army pitch forks could deal with
3555960	3566040	swords sometimes um i don't see how the focus of how the old nation state institutional thing falls
3566840	3574680	works very well with those who hold the nukes because there is no other force that overthrows
3574680	3581080	that thing unless you talk about ai's i can capture it that's fine um outside of that we can see the
3581080	3585960	ussr go through a complete economic socioeconomic collapse a collapse of the political economy
3585960	3590280	and stay a world superpower and turn itself into something else because we got fucking nukes so
3590280	3595560	back off like it's a so i'm curious how you think about that when you think about the transition
3596120	3607160	of power and uh how hard it is to deal with that particular part of it well the old structure stays
3607960	3612680	it doesn't go away you know food was still incredibly important even when capitalism arrived
3612680	3616760	it just as food production wasn't the center of the economy any longer it became a marginal
3616760	3622520	part of the economy and so the same thing here uh the nukes are perfect cases but so far at least
3622600	3627720	they're not owned owned by corporate corporations corporations don't have the nukes yet so they're
3627720	3632280	stuck with like large nation states hopefully not too many of them too quickly because otherwise
3632280	3638120	the bomb is more of an acute problem the climate olivism so that served me an existential problem
3638120	3643560	right there and and i would say the institutions are still there and what you want to do is you
3643560	3647640	want to keep those institutions that says that okay if you those institutions still have the
3647640	3652040	problem the nuclear bomb so it's locked up for good and then we can see if we use nuclear energy
3652120	3658360	something better um in and again that means that let's not give google the bomb you know
3659000	3663160	that's that's the problem there whether that could still happen or not we don't know yet
3663800	3671320	and there's this is where it comes into we know from hegel that triads are stable and we need to
3671320	3677720	try it the problem with with digital the problem we call the nectocracy the problem with this new
3677720	3682200	sort of this sort of global power lead that rides on digital and happen to be the people
3682200	3686600	with the right talents the right motivation to be powerful and influential during digital
3686600	3692280	is that it's an entire new paradigm all together and obviously big tech is the first one of the
3692280	3698200	three nectocracies and it's the first one in the sense that the the the asset here is no longer
3698200	3703880	land or capital the asset here is data and because collecting and processing data is so
3703880	3708440	fundamentally different from collecting and processing money it requires a whole new set of
3708440	3713880	talents the money goes to those who have the data anyway meaning they can concentrate on the data
3713880	3718760	and the data processing and that's exactly big tech has done and then taught the rest of world
3718760	3725880	this is what we do so that is just the first of three necessary uh structures and it represents
3725880	3731560	the real in the sense that the data is the real here but that requires also symbolic order and
3731560	3737240	imaginary order to complement that and we don't have those yet the chinese have probably called
3737240	3740840	you the way they call me they're interested in guys like us at the moment but they have their
3740840	3745720	very definite plan what they want to do next which is to create what we called a sonsocracy
3746520	3752520	and the chinese idea of the sonsocrates is that increased complexity but also the possibility
3752520	3757320	of algorithms to control data flows and have an oversight over the increased complexity
3757400	3764440	requires at least for china and china's history to have one guy at the top so they go they don't
3764440	3769640	go for the persian model which i strongly propose which actually the us constitution was built on
3769640	3775080	which is that you install power sharing from day one into the system before the system kicks in
3775080	3780920	like in any bazaar you you you make sure that the power is split between three which none can
3780920	3785800	dominate the other two because if one dominates the other two will stand up against the third
3785800	3789720	therefore you have a split and this is the beauty of the us constitution and what has
3789720	3795160	kept the united states together since the 1700s precisely the constitution the constitution itself
3795160	3801000	is in an imperial order of persian origin and here's the difference the reason why the persians
3801000	3804920	didn't spend their entire fortune building pyramids and finally just killing their whole
3804920	3810840	civilization building pyramids was the persians knew dutching from egypt they didn't want that
3810840	3814520	they didn't want the pyramid constructions they didn't want the entire culture being obsessed
3814520	3819880	but feeding the dead which were the egyptians did right they wanted to feed the living so when
3819880	3824760	sorastical structures or asterism one of the trade group religions by the way it's very close to
3824760	3831800	buddhism and dalism when he did that 1700 before christ he said let's not do animal or human sacrifice
3831800	3837400	any longer it's just a waste of resources he was in the logos completely there are no gods
3837400	3843240	who pay any attention to sacrificing humans or animals this is ridiculous let's get over it
3843240	3847720	let's die when we die and let's transcend ourselves by having children who take over
3847720	3852600	the world from us when we die and therefore he enabled the very thought that there could be
3852600	3856600	civilization this is the first time in human history somebody thinks what a civilization
3856600	3861560	could possibly be we could improve on the world everything doesn't have to be an eternal return
3861560	3867880	of the same as it is in paganism it is an eternal return of the same the seasons come and go the
3867880	3873640	world come and goes people live and die and they breathe and live and die but there can be an event
3873640	3878520	that's why our book is called pros and they could be an event and the event can change history forever
3878520	3884360	the event can be for good or bad depending on us humans it can be Hiroshima it can also be
3884360	3889480	future nuclear power that might save the world with you know affordable and and exploitative
3889480	3893800	energy forever you know it could be any of those things it depends on where we put our imagination
3893800	3898760	or put our efforts or work that's so raster's insight and therefore he constructs that even
3898760	3904200	event is possible and the fact that event is possible is what we take with us the problem
3904200	3909080	with our culture was that we started believing the event so strongly forgot about the process
3909080	3914280	this is the essential problem of western culture if eastern culture got too stuck in the process
3914280	3919000	didn't think the event properly then the problem with western culture is that we inherited from
3919000	3923960	the persians was the belief in the event that the persians always tied to the process we ignore
3923960	3928600	the process altogether and therefore we created religions that says if we exploit the world until
3928600	3933880	extinction comes god will come and save us and give us a new Jerusalem that's literally what
3933880	3937800	Christianity and Islam have been preaching for thousands of years and that is of course not
3937800	3942680	sustainable at all we're now discovering that we need both the process eternal return of the same
3942680	3947480	circular time and we need the event which is linear time we need to think the world both ways
3948280	3953800	and this is the beauty of power sharing power sharing reinforces that it says that there must
3953800	3959480	be split power from day one before you put the button on the ai it must understand the power
3959480	3963720	must display the chinese don't want that the chinese are terrified of it they go for the
3963720	3967880	egyptian model it says no we're just gonna have one fair at the very top and build a huge pyramid
3967880	3972920	and off we go and then we know what we're gonna do with the data and increasing and now when data
3972920	3977960	solutions become incredibly complex and incredibly expensive the chinese are going to excel at that
3977960	3982360	because it's exactly what they're doing at the moment they're creating a modern day egypt the
3982360	3987640	question is then can we especially america then create an alternative which is more like the persian
3987640	3992520	imperial model and i think building on the u's constitution is the beginning because the logos
3992520	4000600	the pathos and the mythos the three narratives are split the logos is the congress the pathos is the
4000600	4007320	precedent and of course the matriarchal bitch at the opening of the bazaar is the supreme court at
4007320	4013720	least it should be where the mythos is located so the you you have a narrative here that is balanced
4013720	4019000	dialectical it never arrives in one truth because the three different truths that can be spoken at
4019000	4023960	any given time depending on which of the three positions you take now we know that for a fact
4023960	4029720	it's a pragmatic solution to the overall problem of power and the narratives must be there from
4029720	4034600	all three angles therefore we must have a system that implements all three so my suggestion that
4034600	4039480	whenever you do with ai make sure it splits itself dialectically into these three posts
4039480	4044120	before it does anything else whereas the chinese are going for now we've got a one guy at the top
4044120	4048040	we're going to marry the aabic cmp and off we go and we have the pharaoh again
4053160	4058040	okay if i might ask a question because i was uh listening to this fascinating conversation
4058600	4065400	and one question arose and maybe daniel you can answer to this because we were talking about
4065400	4071960	you know conscious design of technologies and you know outcomes that we didn't expect
4071960	4077880	kind of ways we were talking about you know a third attractor in ecology you know of of new
4077880	4085640	narratives but at the same time um we know that we are uh storytelling beings you know we can't
4085720	4092360	really live without narratives and myths and stories except we go maybe in meditation and try to
4092920	4099640	get rid of that um but then at the same time we also know that events are way more random than
4099640	4105560	we think you know so we see that you know in the policies let's say how europe dealt with russia
4105560	4111880	nobody could foresee what is happening right now and so the the question really is like if you
4111880	4119080	have uh our urge to live with narratives and the randomness of future events so the it's it's
4119080	4126760	kind of a creator paradox or creator parallax so how do we create a better future and more functional
4126760	4133000	narratives if we know that the events are way more random than we think and that we can't really
4133000	4140840	foresee what kind of uh affects our decisions might have and so that that question is kind of
4140840	4161240	boggling me sure um it's funny because um a lot of people think about religion in terms of narrative
4161240	4166600	and there's probably a distinction that alexander would make between narrative and mythos but um
4167560	4173640	roughly i'll just say in terms of narrative and you're talking about the ability to forecast the
4173640	4179320	future of a certain kind of certainty about the future um and i i think one of the things
4180600	4186760	like religions that smith mixed bag because there was like good philosophy and then political
4186760	4190520	power plays that got mixed together because of course memes don't spread for no reason they
4190600	4196200	spread because someone's invested in spreading them and they so you you get like good kind of
4196200	4199880	gnostic and the scene and whatever thinking but then you get the council and i say i'm making the
4199880	4204520	bible and the crusades and they change the stuff to be supportive so like the throw the
4204520	4208920	religions out completely or believe them completely they are both silly right you've got a kind of look
4208920	4214120	at um which memes are true good and beautiful and which one's one war and coordinated people well
4214120	4219960	and the difference between those and um but if i think about the meaningful part of religion a
4219960	4224520	big part of it is how do we actually deal with the radical uncertainty of the world
4226040	4232600	and knowing that uh all the choices we make are going to be consequential not making choices
4232600	4238120	is still making a choice is consequential and i'm making every choice under partial information
4239240	4245880	and there is some stuff that is quite possibly affecting the situation that exists in the unknown
4245960	4251320	unknown set i don't even know that i'm not factoring it so how do i make progressively
4251320	4258440	competent rational decisions while holding the profound amount of uncertainty that we have to
4258440	4264600	have um so there's like a mature relationship to both certainty and uncertainty or anything
4264600	4270680	able to hold those together where you both get way more epistemic humility and way more epistemic
4270680	4279880	rigor at the same time um okay so that was just one thing so i don't think you get anything like
4279880	4284760	perfected prediction and i don't think it's even a good impulse like i don't think it arises from
4284760	4290920	a healthy place in people this is why so often when i start conversations with friends like
4290920	4296360	what happened earlier today about ethics i end up starting with heisenberg and gordel and tarski
4296360	4301400	and like the upper limits of no ability because what it means is i'm not going to get an ethical
4301400	4307480	system that's computable um that as gordel said my mathematics can be consistent or complete but
4307480	4311720	not both which means bound to incompleteness forever or what heisenberg showed about measurement
4311720	4319880	which is deeper than science upon which science rests is i get um i get indeterminism forever
4319880	4323880	right like a fundamental thing so that doesn't just mean throw up your hands and believe in
4323880	4329880	whatever god you want but it does mean that the impulse to certainty is an immature one
4330920	4337000	and the the unknowable set is larger it's a larger infinity than the knowable set is
4337560	4342840	and so like a healthy relationship with unknowability is part of spiritual maturity or cognitive
4342840	4351160	maturity or emotional maturity or probably all of those um and so then how do we make choices
4351240	4358440	in the presence of that um i don't want my narrative to tell me how it's all going to go
4358440	4365560	with high certainty i wanted to like help me orient to how to make good choices in the presence of
4365560	4372280	the uncertainty as well i think you guys had a conversation with mark uh the rabbi on here not
4372280	4376760	that long ago and he said something to me that i think might have been the best formalization of
4376760	4380440	ethics i have had ever heard he said that all fears of ethics are feathers of intimacy
4381560	4386840	because if you're in real intimate contact with any reality whether it's a tree or a forest or a
4386840	4392760	person the intimacy of the contact meaning you're you're not modeling them in some trolley problem
4392760	4398200	way you're actually really in contact with their sentience informs you everything you need to to
4398200	4405480	not harm it both the motivation and the sentiment the sensocracy in an embodied sense of it um so
4405480	4414120	the narrative that actually takes us into way more intimacy with the world um uh how we come to
4414120	4418520	progressively better knowing but we never think that the knowing is more true than it is which
4418520	4424680	becomes a false idol right um these are the things i i want a narrative a good a good religion to do
4425720	4431080	but just very pragmatically i think there's a lot of things we say we couldn't possibly predict that
4431080	4439080	are really fucking predictable and we're we're not trying or we're lying um or we're just applying
4439080	4445160	silly models there's places where we're applying silly models like engineers not factoring psychosocial
4445160	4448920	effects if they're not being trained in social sciences like that's just silly like we should
4448920	4453160	just do a better job of that but there are plenty of places where it's like oh we had no idea putin
4453160	4459880	and such and such really like nato aggresses on his border in every fucking way possible and he's
4459880	4464120	like dude fucking just don't just commit to not take ukraine and tornado and they're like no we're
4464120	4469000	not going to do it and they're like how much did we like the cuban missile crisis the idea of
4469000	4473560	russian bases that close it's like oh we had no idea who's going to do that really like just
4473560	4477160	what would you do in his position play the game theory a little bit so there's a bunch of places
4477160	4484040	where the unpredictability is bullshit um for things that are actually decently predictable um
4484280	4490600	and then there are places where it's like okay there's a radically complex thing i don't know
4490600	4494440	what's going to happen well that's where you have to do safe to fail probes is there some way
4495000	4499080	to be able to run an experiment here that is not consequential depending upon how it goes and if
4499080	4505960	there is no safe to fail probe they just don't do the thing yet right um so with a lot of ai and
4505960	4510760	biotech and i think those are the answers and then a lot of it just has to do with processes of
4510760	4518760	recursion so let's say i want to forecast how my new technology is going to affect people
4520200	4523480	so i think about what are the things this is going to enable that will actually be really
4523480	4526920	desirable as a result what behaviors are those people are going to do as a result how does that
4526920	4531880	affect their minds and psyches is it there's some super simple principles like if it's engaging their
4531880	4536840	attention it should make their attention spend better if it has an effect just there's some base
4536840	4541880	reality that it's engaging with it should enhance the base reality it engages with if it has choice
4541880	4546120	architectures that are designed to affect the choices people make i affect their intention it
4546120	4551000	should support their net intentionality and their sovereignty of local control like there are some
4551000	4556440	things like that that should be ubiquitous and they're just not um that could help to even have
4556440	4559960	sense making frameworks to think through oh we couldn't have guessed it would have done did you
4559960	4564520	even think about what it would do to attention or intention or polarization or anything like that
4564520	4568040	so we can just do a better job but there will be still be some stuff you don't predict right
4568680	4572200	so then you run an experiment and then you say oh wow i did this shit we didn't know so now you
4572200	4578680	turn that into the design process then you do a beta release and then you're watching for a bunch
4578680	4581800	of stuff including some shit that you don't know right you're watching for some stuff but you're
4581800	4585640	also just seeing let's just watch the people using it and the people around them and just see if
4585640	4590040	there's any weird new stuff that happens because that's how we deal with the unknown unknowns is that
4590040	4596280	we don't formalize what metrics too closely we just watch for weird stuff right and we didn't expect
4596280	4600760	that there'd be less time at the family dinner table that's worth noting so one of the things is
4600760	4607080	if i don't even know what to look for just do kind of broader spectrum observation and then say okay
4607080	4611400	let's see if we can find out why do some research on it and then internalize that into the design
4611400	4616600	and fix it again but that means that when you observe the thing and then you come up with a
4616600	4621160	new design whoever comes up with a new design has to have the authority to implement it not just oh
4621160	4625720	sorry that goes against our business model and we have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit
4625720	4630360	so you have to create a business that has a collect or a corporation or whatever it is that has a
4630360	4637640	collective intelligence uh i mean excuse me that has a a type of intelligence that is oriented
4637640	4643400	to be able to forecast as much as it can and to recursively upgrade itself where mistakes were made
4647080	4652760	i think this ties nicely into our idea of the bazaar so there has to be some kind of new container
4652760	4657400	here that works and it's an alternative to the sort of the chinese fantasy of the sonocracy
4657400	4662440	that's more free and more open and therefore more sustainable more resilient and will last longer
4662440	4666680	the argument for the persian empire is not a moral one the argument is that the persian empire
4666680	4673160	lasted for 2200 years the gypsum empire repeatedly imploded and with a knot and only lasted for six
4673160	4677480	years it was over and done with so style then is it doesn't last that's the argument against
4677480	4683240	our lesson here resilient systems actually are pragmatic and and they realize that splitting
4683240	4687320	narrowcase and splitting power from the very beginning makes the system much more resilient
4687320	4691400	over time and and therefore it can work in the kind of environments moving into right now
4693000	4696680	this is something you said about splitting power and that you program that into the ai and this
4696680	4702440	seems extraordinarily problematic because um checks and balances on power yes we like that idea
4703720	4709880	so one you know as well as i do that ai is not being set up that way and it's moving really
4709880	4719240	fucking past so there's a reality to tend to here the other thing is that making uh similarly
4719240	4724840	powered ai is divided in an adversarial network is how you make both of them crazy fucking smart
4724840	4730360	right and so the reason that alpha go was able to defeat stockfish like it was standing still
4731000	4735000	was because you never programmed a single human game in it you made two computers
4735000	4740680	play each other a trillion times in three hours and so what that then does is say okay well this
4740680	4747320	system can check this system vice versa the two of those systems now in a or either of them in
4747320	4754360	combined capacity is so asymmetric to every human system true but but the the computer is
4754360	4758840	still only doing the logos at least i want to believe that so the pathos of the methods are
4758840	4764680	two realms left and if at least the computers are interesting in interacting with human beings
4764680	4768280	they don't go off into outer space and do their own thing as a technological intelligence
4768280	4773400	which probably should lead them to do is basically say you can have Mars on your own right please don't
4773400	4779400	kill us on earth right or something like that but if you think about at least at least so far
4779400	4783480	history has been about human beings and has been a human society we're talking about here
4783480	4788120	and natural logically speaking the computer cannot do the methods and the computer cannot
4788120	4793160	do the pathos it can only do the logos but it does the logos with incredible efficiency
4793160	4802600	anything credible you seen have you seen dolly yet yeah the visual gpt3 visual audio gpt3 yeah um
4802600	4810760	so it's early right but uh will it be able to generate methods that are compelling for people
4810840	4815080	at a Turing test passing level totally will it be able to generate art that is evocative enough
4815080	4821720	that people experience catharsis i.e pathos sure so is it experiencing pathos or methods no
4822280	4826680	but can it do a thing that evokes it in fact maybe even split test for its ability to do that
4826680	4831880	progressively better on an asymptote sure now this is really fucked up and interesting right
4831880	4837640	yeah and considering how terrible the latest star wars script is if that was written by humans
4837640	4842040	then humans don't deserve to survive to be honest about it you know we need better artists than that
4842040	4850280	it's just so fucking crap so yeah um i think i think though we're moving to the other we're
4850280	4856440	moving into the third nautocracy the second one is the sense of cracks or whatever is collaborating
4856440	4861400	with the satellites and the data flows around the world to create the container so if you isolate
4861400	4866040	the container and think of the container what we usually call politics is separate from say
4866040	4871800	perverse in business and enterprise which is what we call it indeed so that those two are separated
4871800	4877160	we have the informational lists or the informationism which is which is essentially data and and
4877160	4882200	that's big tech today the second one is in socracy whatever places politics we know it has to be
4882200	4886840	sense of critic and if we don't save the planet to begin with since socracy will never even happen
4886840	4890680	so the socracy has a self interest in at least saving the planet to begin with the chinese
4890680	4894360	other model we need to catch up with them quickly and create a different model that i call more
4894360	4899960	personal the third one though is the third nautocracy is the artistic one this is the imaginary one
4899960	4906360	no this is the real one it's tied to the path so this is the artistic one because art like sex
4906360	4912760	and violence are actually tied to pathos so this is intensely human this is the intense this is
4912760	4917160	where sexuality violence is located this is where we're as far away from the machines themselves
4917160	4921400	as possible and this is where the symbiotic intelligence comes in for example if you're
4921400	4926600	going to write a really fantastic eight hour series that's going to spell spell by in the world
4926600	4930920	what you would do today is that you will collaborate with the ai you will do symbiotic
4930920	4935160	intelligence and practices as an artist and i think at the end of the day the machine on its
4935160	4939480	own doing it will be vastly inferior to what a human being can do with a machine i think for the
4939480	4943480	foreseeable future we're saved by the fact the symbiotic intelligence will be better than artificial
4943480	4948760	intelligence in all of these three narratives that i'm talking about and if that is the case which
4948760	4955320	otherwise why would you must be around you know but if that is the case then the the artistic
4955320	4962120	aspect is the really protopian one so the protopian it's not so much that in art it's not so much
4962120	4966360	that you're productive you incremental improve on something one step at a time like you do
4966360	4973880	for an engineer but protopiness and for an artist is just the the unbound exploration of the darkest
4973880	4978680	shadows and the most fascinating storytelling we could possibly have and you're telling it to
4978680	4983080	grown-ups you're not telling it to children in a fundamental sense like real art is challenging
4983080	4988200	you it's challenging you in a transformative way and it has to be the third aspect of an autocracy
4988200	4993480	and we will give away the third power to the people who with their machines are capable of doing that
4993480	4998680	this is where art is heading and i think again our term the unideveloped symbiotic intelligence
4998680	5003240	fits better here than artificial intelligence when it comes to doing these things i've wrote pop songs
5003240	5008600	for 25 years and i've heard machines writing pop songs and yes they sound generic and professional
5008600	5013640	but they sound like german pop songs like they sound like i just copied last week's number one
5013640	5018280	record and i make it a new record now we can hear what you copy it it's just too similar to what we
5018280	5023160	heard it's eerily boring right and so far at least the machines have not been able to come up with
5023160	5028920	anything else because machines always work in the past the curse of logos is that logos can only
5028920	5032440	work with data that already exists they can only write things that are similar to what we already
5032440	5038280	have but the idea to imagine a future that's radically different from anything we've ever seen
5038680	5046680	is still a very very human capacity only because one of the reasons that GPT-3 is passing the
5046680	5055400	Turing test now is because for many audiences and if you have GPT-3 created text in areas of subject
5055400	5059240	matter expertise and subject matter experts are looking at it they know it doesn't pass the Turing
5059240	5064920	test but for general chatbot functions it does but it's not because the AI has gotten that good
5064920	5070200	it's because most people's ability to be able to vet theory of mind or have deep conversation
5070200	5075480	has gotten so bad that there's like this like it's kind of funny that's like reclaim the quality of
5075480	5080280	the Turing tests by increasing human intelligence to be deserving of the term of general intelligence
5080280	5086120	that we can make the test a little harder the reason i bring it up is because so let's say we
5086120	5091960	have a symbiotic intelligence where we have a human using a transformer AI to generate stuff
5092680	5098920	and people like it well in the classic adversarial network type style i could then train another AI
5098920	5105240	on the output of that symbiotic intelligence and whatever the metric of win is pop chart
5105240	5109640	hips or whatever that is going to be judged by the demand consumption of by other humans
5109640	5114440	i just say beat it and of course now what it's trained to do is be able to identify the things
5114440	5119640	to do more of that and so of course it will like it'll be able to beat that if we can define it in
5119640	5124120	any narrow metrics because it's the same as beating us at starcraft or chess or go as soon as it can
5124120	5130440	define it as a finite game i don't think it can win at the infinite game but i also don't think
5130440	5135160	most humans are oriented to infinite games right now nor our economic systems or anything else
5135160	5139800	and so it's like i think the symbiotic intelligence would produce more meaningful things
5141320	5146280	if the depth of what it means to be human in the depth of the experience the depth of the pathos
5146280	5150520	and the methods that are not the logos is fully brought to both the creation of it and fully brought
5150520	5156680	to the appreciation of it by others which is now why this work in in culture and narrative is so
5156680	5161240	important because anything less than that if it's if it's consumers who want one marshmallow
5161240	5166040	hypernormal stimuli and producers who want to supply that know the AI will be the symbiotic
5166040	5171160	intelligence yeah and this is this goes for popular culture certainly and we're very dark in
5171160	5175480	digital libido so it gets not right that the vast majority of people will be sedated by popular
5175480	5179960	cultures probably manufactured machines because it's more efficient to do it that way but there
5179960	5183960	was something eerie about it the thing is that you might be fooled once but you're not fooled
5183960	5189640	several times over until you discover this eerie feeling that this is increasingly predictable
5189640	5195160	and it's increasingly flattering like the culture's fighting and this is the problem of popular
5195160	5200760	culture it might work for kids stories it might work for disney right but that's not art at all
5200760	5204840	and i think this is why we so strongly philosophically defend the concept of art
5205320	5210440	and we put that put it in the pathical narrative the mythical narrative yes can be mass produced
5210440	5214600	they can be manufactured by technological intelligence it's just you put the button on
5214600	5219160	the and it produces disney culture that's exactly the new star wars series that's why it's crap
5219160	5223800	because the script is so bad it's so predictably bad right because it just tries to flatter you
5223800	5229080	tries to fly it doesn't it doesn't challenge you it's not going to transform you at all real art
5229080	5233960	therefore has to be located next to sex and violence and we call the tantric realm in the
5233960	5239480	really grown up adult realm it challenges you fiercely otherwise it isn't art at all and it
5239480	5245800	challenged you to transform you the truly artistic experience is not just to kill time that's what
5245800	5250680	silicon valley and hollywood are trying to do they just try to kill time no real art is that you go
5250680	5255240	through transformative experience like a spiritual experience that transforms you you're a totally
5255240	5259160	different person when you come out of experience compared to who you were before in either direction
5259160	5265400	doesn't matter you changed you have gone through an event your life is no longer the repetition of
5265400	5271400	the same i don't see any machine being able to do anything remotely like that yet that's why art has
5271400	5277720	to get out of popular culture return to its own realm and go spiritual and that's why we put art
5277720	5281800	in the pathical narrative that's what's important in their ecology mythical narrative can be mass
5281800	5287000	produced yes that's popular culture but pathical narrative is an entirely different thing and i
5287000	5291880	would know because i was in the mythical narrative production when i was a pop song writer and pop song
5291880	5298440	producer i never tried to do jazz or opera i went to the opera and i enjoyed jazz because i didn't do it
5298440	5303160	i didn't do anything pathical i did mythical things but to then go into the pathical narrative
5303160	5308680	where i tried to be as a philosopher is fiendishly more challenging but it's absolutely required
5308680	5314440	and this is probably of all the three narratives the hardest one to nail because at the end of the
5314440	5320760	day we now live in the world where death is the absolute i am adamant i'm with a lot of thinkers
5320760	5325800	today to say that the problem with the west is that we banned everything that was out of our comfort
5325800	5331720	zone and we basically called it sin and at least in the east they realized that no sin is not going
5331720	5335560	to disappear so instead of creating pressure cookers that blow over all the time and cause
5335560	5341800	huge warfare and misery instead it's better to have it around but to have it around inside a container
5341800	5345560	and only those who can handle it can go there and handle that container they're the ones who
5345560	5352360	can have access to it that's the concept of tantra this is interesting sutra is the message the
5352360	5358040	narrative that makes people love their children so they want to survive that is the ultimate truth
5358040	5363240	of sutra sutra has a direction must be exactly that the opposite of the sutra is the tantra it's like
5363240	5367400	okay we don't know where this is going therefore we're containing it we're keeping it in some kind
5367400	5372440	of a laboratory and we can only access by people who can really go through it and that's where sex
5372440	5377560	and art and violence must be located that we must realize that these are factors of human life
5377560	5381400	and that's what we're working with as philosophers at the moment so i think it's important here to
5381400	5386840	make that distinction i don't see any machine even being remotely close to creating a credible
5386840	5393320	pathological narrative in the foreseeable future it's funny that you say that the elites now believe
5393320	5403720	in death because in so many important ways i don't see that like the extreme life extension
5403720	5409080	movement radical life extension movement for radical biological extension is totally a holy
5409080	5414280	grail pursuit and then the biggest one of course and and the brain computer interface
5416040	5420840	pursued all the way up to the full digital consciousness singletarian we can all be
5421640	5426680	ai gods in a universe that we can fork infinitely remember how i told you daniel that engineers
5426680	5431720	don't know what they're doing because the engineers haven't talked to the priests this is the perfect
5431720	5435480	example to give exactly that they're going to create things that are not at all what they thought
5435480	5440200	they're going to create and so and whatever they're all going to be disappointed when they're dying
5440200	5445240	finally learn to die with some fucking grace and i think but i think the death escape has arrived
5445240	5451240	it has existed all along buddhist thoracists and Taoists always knew they would die when they die
5451240	5455480	and the question is what transcends you they always had that question that question around for
5455480	5460200	thousands of years we just need to get rid of these childish religious that promises the afterlife
5460200	5464760	of the reincarnation because it was too hard to tell children that their parents had died right
5464760	5469160	it's just it's just death as the absolute has arrived i think it's a dominant story today
5469160	5473320	and i think these people who try to escape try to escape precisely because they find it hard to die
5473720	5479720	one of the things i really like about the invisible afterlife um i like the reincarnation
5479720	5486760	version better than heaven and hell version but i like that you can get narcissistic and even
5486760	5493080	sadistic people to do the right things for the wrong reasons um meaning if i don't want to reincarnate
5493080	5502360	badly and i can't hide the karma from god or from uh universal accounting system then even though
5502360	5505880	if i could hide it from the humans i'd fuck everybody over and get ahead and if death was
5505880	5509800	the end that'd be fine the fact that i can't hide it from the day of judgment or whatever it is
5509800	5515080	means now i have to do the right thing for my own prevention of suffering i think that was actually
5515080	5519640	brilliant and i think there were places where that obviously didn't work all that well in many
5519640	5529960	places but there were places where it did um how you create a system where even if someone uh if
5529960	5540520	someone's focus of self is too personal right too much narcissistic trait not enough empathy etc
5540520	5545800	they still are oriented to a system of ethics i think that's one of the things the system has
5545800	5549880	to do as a failsafe while it works to condition people who all have authentic intimacy where
5549880	5556200	emergent ethics can arise um i know it is time for us to wrap up and it's late one thing i was
5556200	5561960	going to say we should do next time that would be fun we opened a lot more threads and we closed
5561960	5570440	but that's good you started talking about um uh what ai won't get and will get in the future and
5570440	5577880	what the three different types of uh natocracies will be and i i think if we were to just kind of
5577880	5584760	give a vision like what is a positive vision for the not too distant future like you know 50 years
5584760	5591720	out or so that we can see that involves uh getting mythos pathos logos all meaningfully better right
5591720	5596680	that my terms might be getting some of the critical things that have to happen in infrastructure and
5596680	5601640	social structure and superstructure whatever um what is a vision that could happen that would be
5601640	5608040	a fun that'd be a fun place to go i totally agree uh so i just want to add that we also need a new
5608040	5613240	sutra a new story about how we're going to love our children therefore we want our children to
5613240	5617880	survive we need a new one so we can't go back to the old ones and and when it comes to the
5617880	5623080	belief in the afterlife that also ruined ancient egypt that's why ever since then we sort of suspected
5623160	5628920	that we will not live after we're dead so the afterlife was a very very destructive thought
5628920	5632440	in that sense when it was taken all the way through the ancient egyptians at least in the
5632440	5637160	first kingdom seriously believed that life after death was more important than life right here and
5637160	5643560	now ever since then well at least we've doubted it so uh i think those those i think once the gene
5643560	5648440	is out of the bottle historically in this sense that a certain tantra is now leaked into the sutra
5648440	5652840	and we can no longer pretend it's not there that's what i mean we cannot construct the system of
5652840	5656600	believing the afterlife we believe in reincarnation and longer we cannot even believe that we're
5656600	5660120	going to conquer outer space and live another planet because we're way too late to that race
5660120	5664520	ai will certainly beat us to it so ai will take bacteria away and go to other planets and we
5664520	5669080	won't even be part of the game that's more likely so we can look into that we can look into what
5669080	5672680	could possibly the new sutra be what could be the new story we could actually tell each other and
5672680	5678680	agree on and then at least the tantra itself we know it's around but it's hidden in containers
5678680	5683080	for the people who can actually absorb it and understand it and thankfully because it's tantra
5683080	5689320	so tied to complexity that we can only specialize on certain complexities like you and i honorably
5689320	5694200	do we're supposed to be generalists but nobody can be a generalist any longer that's impossible
5694200	5698760	we can only understand that that's impossible therefore we're more hegellian in the sense that
5698760	5703160	our absolute knowing is not that we know everything is that we know the limits of our own
5703160	5708360	knowledge and we thrive within that limit and that's exactly what we're promoting very pragmatic
5708360	5713400	ideas constantly we will learn from history like and it's moving quicker than ever it's more
5713400	5718440	important than ever to be pragmatic about history and to make due process before we make decisions
5718440	5722600	and start building things that's where you're an absolute the adamant anything else is completely
5722600	5729000	responsible from now on historically speaking so i would love to be more into that yes absolutely
5729800	5735080	all right this is fun alexander daniel thank you so much for taking the time i think it's
5735080	5741000	very late at your end daniel what is it two o'clock in the morning already yes thank you again
5741960	5745960	fascinating conversation i would love to do a second part where we have a look at the future
