00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
All right. Welcome to Parallax. I'm your host, Thomas Mark. With me today are Daniel Schmachtenberger

00:11.000 --> 00:16.840
and Alexander Bart. Daniel Schmachtenberger is a social philosopher and founding member

00:16.840 --> 00:22.760
of the Concilions Project aimed at providing public sense making and improving public sense

00:22.760 --> 00:29.280
making and dialogue. Alexander Bart is amongst many other things, the philosopher, author

00:29.280 --> 00:34.360
and futurologist. I'm very happy to bring you both together for the first time. So welcome

00:34.360 --> 00:42.960
both of you. The goal and the idea of this conversation isn't short to kind of generate

00:42.960 --> 00:51.080
a snapshot of where we are 2022, ideologically, politically, economically and technologically,

00:51.080 --> 00:57.080
and where we are headed to the end of the decade. So where are we now in this time between

00:57.080 --> 01:02.880
worlds and what are the possible and probable outcomes of our current trajectories? We are

01:02.880 --> 01:09.240
facing a crisis while at the same time our institutions do not seem to fit or able to

01:09.240 --> 01:14.800
solve these problems. It appears that the climate crisis unfolding right now and the

01:14.800 --> 01:19.920
war is brewing, the cultural divide and the western hemisphere, the culture war is getting

01:19.920 --> 01:26.200
more intense. And at the same time our myths and narratives don't work anymore. The postmodern

01:26.200 --> 01:32.320
policies of deconstructions have for better or worse negated our way of reducing complexity.

01:32.320 --> 01:38.040
So where are we now? Is the west going to fall as Oswald Sprengler once put it? Is the

01:38.040 --> 01:43.080
chaos going to increase till we find a new way of life? Or is it as it ever was, men

01:43.080 --> 01:49.480
struggling to find meaning in a complex world? Can digital providers with the means to reconstruct

01:49.520 --> 01:55.200
the myth and narrative? And maybe more on the point, at what point does it become wiser

01:55.200 --> 01:59.600
to acknowledge that it's too late to stop anything and turn our efforts to surviving

01:59.600 --> 02:06.840
it? So Daniel, if you had to start to paint this broad painting, where we are right now,

02:06.840 --> 02:14.760
where are we now when you were to take up a systemic bird's-eye view of things?

02:15.760 --> 02:25.640
I tried to paint a brief, hopefully useful starting place picture. You were saying, you

02:25.640 --> 02:32.200
know, we're in a global crisis and you gave a few examples. I often use a term metacrisis

02:32.200 --> 02:38.000
that is not just looking at the fact that we have climate change and biodiversity loss

02:38.000 --> 02:42.480
and extinction of species in dead zones and oceans and topsoil loss and all those environmental

02:42.520 --> 02:49.800
issues, or that we have increasing fragility in supply chains or the problem of exponential

02:49.800 --> 02:55.160
growth on the financial system and linear materials economy, hitting fragility on planetary

02:55.160 --> 03:01.760
boundaries, or the AI risk, bio risk, cyber risk issues that new exponential technologies

03:01.760 --> 03:07.360
create, like all of these are possibly catastrophic risks. And we're in this interesting situation

03:07.360 --> 03:11.440
where the total number of catastrophic risks is increasing and the probability of them is

03:11.480 --> 03:16.000
increasing. And so rather than just see each of those as different separate ones, there are

03:16.000 --> 03:20.360
certain underlying drivers that we can look at that they had in common. Talk about the

03:20.360 --> 03:26.840
generator functions of catastrophic risk. And so we would say that we are at a unique point in

03:26.840 --> 03:31.560
history, something where Alexander and I definitely agree is that it's not just processes of the

03:31.560 --> 03:36.280
same thing always under the sun. Being able to extinct species at scale and genetically

03:36.280 --> 03:42.240
engineered new species and synthetic biology is a different thing than was true 2000 or 20,000

03:42.240 --> 03:51.760
years ago. And so the first truly existential tech we had in terms of technology enough that we

03:51.760 --> 03:57.720
could make choices that damage the habitability of the world was the nuclear bomb. And that was so

03:57.720 --> 04:04.000
recent in historical time, we built an entire world system to prevent using tech, that tech,

04:04.200 --> 04:07.440
and we had never done that before. Every tech we had, we always made an arms race to use as

04:07.440 --> 04:11.640
fast as we could. Now we built a whole world system that involved mutually assured destruction and

04:11.640 --> 04:17.560
the Bretton Woods monetary system and the UN IGO systems to ensure not doing that. While that

04:17.560 --> 04:23.280
succeeded in a way, it also drove all the catastrophic risks we're facing now and to more

04:23.280 --> 04:29.280
likely like let's have a monetary system that increases exponential GDP so everybody can have

04:29.280 --> 04:34.280
more without taking each other's stuff on linear supply chains that externalize cost to the

04:34.280 --> 04:39.440
environment pushing all the planetary boundary issues. And you can make mutually assured

04:39.440 --> 04:44.160
destruction on two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon, but you can't on lots and

04:44.160 --> 04:48.120
lots of non state actors all having access to different kinds of catastrophe weapons. So how

04:48.120 --> 04:52.280
do you deal with that? So we're in a situation where the post World War Two world is over,

04:52.280 --> 04:56.760
there's a lot more catastrophic risks. And those types of solutions don't work and we need new

04:56.760 --> 05:01.200
ones. What we'd say is that there's, so like whether we're talking about the risk from a

05:01.200 --> 05:08.240
particular kind of AI or bio or nuclear or climate change refugees leading to nuclear or

05:08.240 --> 05:12.760
whatever it is, there's the increasing catastrophe attractor, right? There's like an

05:12.760 --> 05:18.120
attractive basin defined by we can't manage our power well coordination failures creating

05:18.120 --> 05:21.720
increasing catastrophes. There's a thousand scenarios, but they're all kind of the catastrophe

05:21.760 --> 05:27.320
attractor. Then there's this other tractor that says, in order to manage those, we must be able

05:27.320 --> 05:32.880
to monitor and control adequately. And that looks like pretty powerful centralized control

05:32.880 --> 05:40.200
mechanisms, which mostly turn pretty dystopic. So we can make sure that nobody builds catastrophe

05:40.200 --> 05:44.760
weapons in their basement using tabletop crisper. If we have ubiquitous surveillance and extremely

05:44.760 --> 05:50.040
powerful control mechanisms, then that becomes pretty dystopic. So there's like catastrophes and

05:50.040 --> 05:54.160
dystopias as these two different attractors and exponential tech makes both more likely, you

05:54.160 --> 06:00.680
can run much more powerful top down systems using AI and IoT. You can also create a lot worse

06:00.720 --> 06:06.000
catastrophic dynamics with exponential tech. So we want a third attractor that is neither dystopic

06:06.000 --> 06:11.960
nor catastrophic. And that means that it has to have the capacity to check all of the power that

06:11.960 --> 06:16.160
could cause catastrophe on purpose or accident, but where that system that checks it must also have

06:16.200 --> 06:25.200
checks and balances and be oriented in a life that is somehow desirable. And so how do we make it

06:25.200 --> 06:30.360
through the metacrisis means make it through the catastrophes and the dystopias to some kind of

06:30.360 --> 06:35.920
third attractor? What are the criteria of that attractor? That would be a fine starting point of

06:35.920 --> 06:45.560
kind of where I see that we're at in the arc of history. And that the quote in the book of Roman

06:45.560 --> 06:52.160
something like the path to hell is wide and many of the path to heaven is narrow and steep. It's

06:52.160 --> 06:57.120
easy to come up with dystopian sci-fi because humans have been pretty nasty stewards of power

06:57.120 --> 07:02.120
historically and the idea of us having decentralized exponential power like there's just a lot of bad

07:02.120 --> 07:10.880
scenarios. The idea of exponential power AI and genetic engineering and whatever, going well with

07:10.880 --> 07:16.280
people like us running it requires some pretty significantly new thought. And so how do we come

07:16.280 --> 07:23.480
up with a positive future narrative that is not a naive silly one? I think this is the topic would

07:23.480 --> 07:27.000
be fun to have us explore today. That's my kind of initial frame.

07:30.480 --> 07:35.760
I can then add to that that the reason why I got really interested in Daniel's brain a few years

07:35.760 --> 07:40.840
ago was that I was very alone being a philosopher of technology for quite a long time. And it was

07:40.840 --> 07:45.320
really required. Obviously, we live in the middle of a technological revolution. Here was a guy who

07:45.320 --> 07:51.560
was even more a philosopher of technology than I was, which is great. So it's kind of shocking that

07:51.560 --> 07:55.200
this is actually probably the first recording of conversation between us because we've been friends

07:55.200 --> 07:59.920
for many years now and I highly respect Daniel's work. And I'm very excited about this conversation.

07:59.920 --> 08:06.080
So I just want to say that first. What I add to this is that I'm a narratologist. Well, here's a

08:06.080 --> 08:13.880
new word, right? Please recall that the 20th century was mostly used for deconstruction. You

08:13.880 --> 08:19.680
know, after the atomic bomb, August the 6th, 1945, the most important date in recent history for all

08:19.680 --> 08:25.240
of us on the planet. I agree completely here with Daniel. Let's use that date. There's a certain date

08:25.240 --> 08:31.160
there, August 6th, 1945. It helps us to locate ourselves historically. And after that date,

08:31.760 --> 08:36.600
deconstruction became the natural norm. It's just like we have to deconstruct all of history. We

08:36.600 --> 08:42.720
only begun that process. We have to deconstruct Western history of the world right now. That's

08:42.720 --> 08:47.000
happening. We have people over the world who realize that there's a myth about Asia that is

08:47.000 --> 08:51.600
completely incorrect. There's a myth about Africa that's completely incorrect. And also America

08:51.600 --> 08:56.760
is finally shifting. America is not European any longer. America is now the meeting place of the

08:56.760 --> 09:01.240
world populated by people from all over the world. And America needs just a new standard

09:01.240 --> 09:06.360
language of the world that we all use to communicate. So even America is shifting in the

09:06.360 --> 09:10.200
sense that America is becoming truly a global meeting place today. And that's what's really

09:10.200 --> 09:16.280
interesting here. So I do narratology. Narratology is more than deconstruction. It's also

09:16.280 --> 09:23.320
reconstruction. It's basically the philosophical search for the narratives that human beings tell

09:23.320 --> 09:28.600
about themselves. We are storytelling animals. We're storytelling flock animals. So we tell

09:28.600 --> 09:33.240
stories about ourselves all the time. And fundamentally, these stories have to be split

09:33.240 --> 09:38.440
into three different types of stories. So let me follow you into this one. The first one is

09:38.440 --> 09:43.320
precisely the one we're down here as an expert. It's what we call the logos. This is how reality

09:43.320 --> 09:47.640
actually operates and how we symbolically try to understand how the world operates. For example,

09:47.640 --> 09:52.840
mathematics, you know, when language tries to be exact, that's when we go into the logos.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.400
The second one is pathos. You know, every time somebody tells you do it once more,

09:57.400 --> 10:01.960
we would feeling like add the pathos, please, you're a human being, right? You're not a machine,

10:01.960 --> 10:08.200
you do, you do, you need to add the pathos to what you do. So pathos is the storytelling

10:08.200 --> 10:13.400
that's usually banned, banned from children's use. Just like I said that pornography, violence,

10:13.400 --> 10:19.000
all of that is located in the pathos. And the third one is the mythos. And the mythos is the

10:19.000 --> 10:25.560
only way for the other two to be combined. So our predicament as both Hegel and Nietzsche pointed

10:25.560 --> 10:31.160
out in the 19th century is that the only way for us to have some kind of narrative that we can share

10:31.160 --> 10:37.080
is to create a mythos. Not myth, but a mythos here. So these are the three basic stories and

10:37.080 --> 10:42.680
they are dialectically intertwined. You cannot focus on one of them rather than the other one.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.640
And then if you look at power and domination, it goes to say that power and domination goes

10:47.640 --> 10:53.480
into these three realms. So the logos is the symbolic order and the symbolic, it's more of

10:53.480 --> 10:57.960
the masculine side of things, if you allow us to say that, but it's more of the masculine side of

10:57.960 --> 11:02.360
things. And the logos, how the world actually operates, zeros and ones today, more than anything

11:02.360 --> 11:09.640
is the logos. And then that is logos is presented as knowledge, the power through knowledge,

11:09.640 --> 11:14.680
whoever has access to knowledge today would say data and data processing, whoever has control

11:14.680 --> 11:19.560
over the knowledge or dominates in the knowledge field has enormous power and influence. And that's

11:19.560 --> 11:25.000
of course, we need to start today. The other one is violence itself, who has the monocular violence

11:25.000 --> 11:29.960
of a specific territory, that state turn things like that. And that is the pathos. So that's

11:29.960 --> 11:34.920
the second realm. And the pathos we call the real order, the real order of things. So ultimately,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.840
the physical world out there, if you walk straight into a wall and hit your head,

11:39.560 --> 11:45.720
you just encounter the pathical world out there. We can fantasize all we like and we human beings

11:45.720 --> 11:49.640
fantasize individually and collectively all the time. But at the end of the day, our fantasies

11:49.640 --> 11:54.600
will be crushed and they will be crushed by what's called the pathos. So that's the second realm,

11:54.600 --> 11:58.920
the real one. The third one, the only one that can unite the other two is the imaginary order.

11:59.480 --> 12:05.240
Imaginary order is tied to the mythos. So we imagine the world. And this way it gets important.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.720
We have to have an imaginary that makes sense to us. We have to have a shared imagine if you're

12:09.720 --> 12:14.680
going to share your society. And that's where the crisis at. So what's happening right now,

12:14.680 --> 12:20.040
our proposal is that this is a paradigm shift in the sense that we're moving into the online world

12:20.040 --> 12:24.200
and the internet is taking over the world. And we're globalized because the internet itself

12:24.200 --> 12:28.760
goes towards globalization, whereas we human beings are very local in our attitude towards the world.

12:29.080 --> 12:34.760
So this does a paradigm shift. Why there's a metacrisis tied to the paradigm shift

12:34.760 --> 12:41.080
is that all these three narratives are in crisis at the same time. Daniel is the perfect guy in

12:41.080 --> 12:46.760
the world right now to list the reason why logos is in crisis. That's exactly what he's talking about.

12:46.760 --> 12:52.760
After 1945, we discovered that we're exploiting the world towards our own extinction. And that's

12:54.040 --> 12:57.080
not a small thing to say. That's exactly what we're doing. We could blow ourselves up with the

12:57.080 --> 13:01.320
bomb. We could also blow ourselves up in many other ways to just take more time. That's what

13:01.320 --> 13:07.160
the logos crisis at. The problem is the other two aspects are in crisis too. The pathos,

13:08.040 --> 13:13.160
the pathos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis in a very particular way.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.920
It's a crisis in the religious or the spiritual and therefore also political manner. Death has

13:18.920 --> 13:23.320
become the absolute. We now have an elite in the world today who believe they really will die when

13:23.320 --> 13:27.880
they die. That has never happened before in history. We have always excused ourselves

13:27.880 --> 13:33.320
with an afterlife or at least with a reincarnation. The reincarnation of the east of the afterlife of

13:33.320 --> 13:38.600
the west. We have always had those myths before. Now we can no longer have a myth and therefore we

13:38.600 --> 13:44.280
cannot have a myth that it's utopian or dystopian either. We have to accept that we die when we die

13:44.280 --> 13:48.600
and the only thing that can transcend us is children who inherit the earth after we're gone.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.720
We're into that mode now. We have an elite in the world that have come to accept that

13:53.720 --> 13:58.360
and they're dealing with it massively and it's not a small thing at all when it's dealt with

13:58.360 --> 14:02.520
collectively. This is like Nietzsche's The Last Man. That's where we're located right now. So there's

14:02.520 --> 14:08.920
a crisis in the mythos too. There's a crisis in storytelling. We can deconstruct as much as we

14:08.920 --> 14:13.640
like but if we don't reconstruct something valuable to us and have a new story, we're done.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.520
And the third one is the crisis in the pathos. This is the crisis of violence. This is the

14:18.520 --> 14:23.560
crisis of sexuality but this is also the crisis of nature itself that's now catching up with us.

14:23.560 --> 14:29.480
This is the crisis of the bomb. It's literally physical. This is the crisis of the climate.

14:29.480 --> 14:34.360
It's literally physical. Therefore, there's a crisis in the pathos too. So all the three

14:34.360 --> 14:39.240
different narratives are in crisis. All the three different narratives simultaneously have to be

14:39.240 --> 14:43.880
retold as a new shared narratology that makes sense to us. That's why there's a mental crisis.

14:45.720 --> 14:54.760
May I ask you to just clarify a bit for what has to happen in logos, in pathos, and mythos?

14:54.760 --> 14:59.480
Like is there something like what you would think of as necessary and sufficient criteria of the

14:59.480 --> 15:03.800
new logos, the new mythos, and the new pathos that converges towards the third attractor?

15:04.360 --> 15:12.040
Yeah, absolutely. The third attractor we call protopianism and I think it was Kelly Over at

15:12.040 --> 15:15.960
Wired who invented the term or maybe it's been around because it sounds a bit generic. But

15:16.520 --> 15:21.960
protopianism, when I came to East Asia and you travel there too down in a lot, like when I talk

15:21.960 --> 15:25.960
to the Japanese, the Korean, and the Chinese, it doesn't make sense to say anything today that

15:25.960 --> 15:29.960
they don't get or they don't subscribe to. And it certainly makes a lot of sense to listen to them

15:29.960 --> 15:36.120
and their history, because we share a world with them now. Protopianism makes sense to anybody in

15:36.120 --> 15:42.280
East Asia. The utopian dystopian dichotomy was always Western and we got it from Abrahamic

15:42.280 --> 15:46.920
religion. It doesn't make sense in India, it doesn't make sense in China or Japan, but the

15:46.920 --> 15:52.600
protopian perspective which is the incremental improvement and work towards optimization or

15:52.600 --> 15:58.680
processes makes sense. That makes sense globally. So I would start with saying that all these

15:58.760 --> 16:04.360
different narratives now have to be protopian. We need to get rid of the utopian, the drive towards

16:04.360 --> 16:08.040
the utopian and the dystopian, which is what you call the third attractor, which I think is brilliant.

16:08.040 --> 16:13.640
The third attractor is now required because it's the only credible global narrative we can have.

16:13.640 --> 16:19.240
And it goes for both the logos and the mythos and the pathos. They all have to be protopian.

16:19.240 --> 16:23.560
And you and I in one of our little night sessions over in California came up with the term that I

16:23.560 --> 16:30.120
love called symbiotic intelligence. AI is what the machines will do, but as long as we human

16:30.120 --> 16:34.440
beings are involved in a collaboration with the machines, I think it makes more sense to speak

16:34.440 --> 16:40.760
of an SI. An SI is an AI ultimately controlled by humans serving our interests, but that takes a lot

16:40.760 --> 16:45.800
of maturity from us as well to work with the symbiotic intelligence. But symbiotic intelligence

16:45.800 --> 16:51.000
is an intelligence that works towards optimization or process at all times. And of course,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.280
this is not an optimization of a process that's ultimately exploitative.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.760
That's what we use to term exploitation in our work all the time. We talk about resilience,

17:00.760 --> 17:06.440
sustainability, these things. The exploitative aspect has to be implemented within a protopian

17:06.440 --> 17:12.120
process, meaning that you have to give back what you just used. In that sense, you cannot exploit

17:12.120 --> 17:17.800
the world any longer because it's the end of the story. To employative means closed loop or real

17:17.880 --> 17:21.880
closed. Exactly. Employative is opposite to exploitative. So it's easy to understand. It's

17:21.880 --> 17:25.800
the opposite of that. We used the word for the past 20 years. And what's important here is that

17:25.800 --> 17:30.680
protopian ideals, meaning that if you're an artist, you go protopian. If you're an engineer, you go

17:30.680 --> 17:35.800
protopian. If you start a company, you should have a protopian company from day one. So the way to

17:35.800 --> 17:40.120
make incremental improvements on the world through your work, which is how you do technology,

17:40.120 --> 17:45.720
essentially. Once we've created the technology, it's there. And technology in itself is a pharma

17:45.720 --> 17:53.000
con. It can be good or bad. It can be Hiroshima. It can also be fusion. A pharma con. A pharma con

17:53.000 --> 17:57.960
means that a technology in itself is neutral. It depends on what we human beings deal with it.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.400
And in this sense, of course, atomic power is the perfect sample of a pharma con.

18:03.320 --> 18:08.120
So that's what technology itself should be neutral to us. And then we ask ourselves the

18:08.120 --> 18:11.320
question, how do we use that technology to the benefit of mankind longer?

18:11.560 --> 18:21.480
It was actually a funny point of intersection. And I wish that my schedule over the last week

18:21.480 --> 18:26.200
had been different. And I've got to read more of your recent work and share some things with you.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.680
We actually just published a paper with a conciliance project called Tech Is Not Values Neutral

18:31.720 --> 18:37.800
like a few days ago. So it's just funny to come to this point. It's maybe an interesting

18:37.800 --> 18:43.080
topic for us to discuss because it doesn't map to the logos, pathos, mythos perfectly,

18:43.080 --> 18:50.440
but the infrastructure, social structure, superstructure way of looking at the domains

18:50.440 --> 18:55.960
of civilization and the fact that psyches and cultures are directly affected by tech.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.240
And it's not just what values we bring to it determines if it has a good or bad use. It's that

19:02.040 --> 19:07.960
every technology is an extension of human choice making. It catches on because it confers power.

19:08.760 --> 19:13.320
And thus whoever uses it and gets more power usually ends up driving the beginning of a

19:13.320 --> 19:18.600
new arms race of some type that obligates other people to use it. That codes a pattern of human

19:18.600 --> 19:22.920
behavior to use the tech as opposed to not coding that pattern of human behavior affects human

19:22.920 --> 19:27.240
psyches, value systems, belief systems, everything. And then the distribution of that affects

19:27.960 --> 19:34.200
cultures and societies. So we call this psychosocial externalities rather than physical

19:34.200 --> 19:39.320
externalities. And so physical externalities, we know the pollution and the harm in the supply

19:39.320 --> 19:43.320
chain and whatever that occurs. So we have to go physically closed loop, meaning we're not using

19:43.320 --> 19:49.400
unrenewable physical resources or turning them into trash or pollution. We have to go psychosocial

19:49.400 --> 19:56.760
closed loop too. And it's not going to be closed loop in the same way, but it does mean forecast

19:56.760 --> 20:02.040
the psychosocial effects and internalize them into the design process. Because obviously

20:04.760 --> 20:09.960
something like the nature of the algorithm that optimizes for engagement, which in

20:09.960 --> 20:14.840
optimizes for outrage, which ends up polarizing a society or shortening attention spans like

20:14.840 --> 20:20.760
these are very real effects on psyches and society. So it's not fair to say tech is values

20:20.760 --> 20:28.680
neutral. Tech was built to advance certain values like ease and brevity and comfort and

20:28.680 --> 20:33.480
whatever, it advances those that affects other values and it does so at scale. And so if you

20:33.480 --> 20:38.120
don't actually think about what are the values that are worth valuing? And how do we build tech

20:38.120 --> 20:45.320
that enhances those? Then because the tech is so powerful, it will end up damaging them. And so

20:45.320 --> 20:50.440
you actually can't think about the evolution of culture independently from the techplex that

20:50.440 --> 20:57.320
ends up determining what wins behaviorally. I agree. So the point here is that engineers

20:57.320 --> 21:02.200
have no clue what they're doing historically. So like if you would have asked Gutenberg about

21:02.200 --> 21:06.360
the printing press in 1415, it was quite an event where the printing press arrived. I mean,

21:06.360 --> 21:10.760
they started printing Bibles quite quickly to start with. And that was his point. The point

21:10.760 --> 21:14.760
was that you should translate the Bible to local dialects around Europe so that Europeans could

21:14.760 --> 21:19.080
read the Bible and become all the good Catholics that he wanted them to be. Actually, he created

21:19.160 --> 21:24.120
the end of the Catholic Church. It's been growing gradually, but the whole question of the Catholic

21:24.120 --> 21:28.440
Church, and now it's just basically diminishing into nothing, started with Gutenberg. He was the

21:28.440 --> 21:32.840
killer of the Catholic Church. He just didn't know. So the problem is that engineers are usually

21:32.840 --> 21:38.920
historically speaking very unaware. So I just want to remove the guilt applied to them afterwards,

21:38.920 --> 21:42.920
like you don't even know what people do with you. I mean, Nietzsche couldn't know that Hitler would

21:42.920 --> 21:47.400
come along and Marx couldn't know that Stalin would come along. You can't blame people afterwards

21:47.480 --> 21:52.440
what people later are doing in the sense that we usually do. So my point is this, though, that

21:52.440 --> 21:56.360
there's a social responsibility for creating an environment where technology is created in the

21:56.360 --> 22:01.720
first place. The one thing we have learned is that we hardly change at all. Human beings are

22:01.720 --> 22:07.480
basically the same worthy five or 10,000 years ago in the very short span of the created civilization.

22:07.480 --> 22:12.600
What we do create is technology. The way I frame it is that I said, women give birth to children.

22:13.560 --> 22:18.760
Men envy women for giving birth to children. Men therefore give birth to technology.

22:19.400 --> 22:24.120
The problem is that if technology develops quicker than children do, which tends to do,

22:24.840 --> 22:30.920
it's only a question of time before technology kills the child unless you intervene. So that's

22:30.920 --> 22:37.000
essentially the history of civilization in five sentences in a very Freudian sense. So my point

22:37.000 --> 22:41.720
being calling technology value neutral is, of course, nothing is value neutral in the formal

22:41.720 --> 22:49.240
sense, but it is to point out that technologies are pharmaconic, usually by historical necessity,

22:49.240 --> 22:54.760
and then we can look at them. Today we know more, and today the loops of technological innovation

22:54.760 --> 23:01.000
are so tight and involve so many people that the pathos of the mythos are obviously now involved

23:01.000 --> 23:05.960
in the loop of the logos itself. We are really beginning to look at the word dialectically.

23:05.960 --> 23:10.200
We're really beginning to look at the word. These three narratives are now colliding one

23:10.200 --> 23:15.400
another. We cannot trust any one of them because as human beings we have to operate all three,

23:15.400 --> 23:20.760
and we have to reform all three at the same time, which is exactly why this is a meta crisis to solve.

23:21.720 --> 23:26.120
Yeah, we have to do all three at the same time, you and I totally agree on. We're not looking at a

23:26.920 --> 23:31.640
theory of change. We're looking at an ecosystem of theories of change, an ecosystem of projects that

23:32.360 --> 23:39.240
have a pro-topic direction to them, have a third attractor, attractive basin to them, and the desire

23:39.240 --> 23:48.040
for what is the comprehensive solution set or roadmap for humanity is based on the fallacy

23:48.040 --> 23:54.760
that a centralizing intelligence could do that thing. I think we think very much the same way

23:54.760 --> 23:58.760
about that. It's interesting. I want to try to tie a couple things together that you said.

24:00.440 --> 24:05.720
We're mentioning that Marx can't really be blamed first all and then etc. because people can't really

24:05.720 --> 24:11.880
forecast what's going to happen afterwards. Einstein and the Baum, great example. I think it's true that

24:13.160 --> 24:19.080
I was talking with a friend the other day about all of the hopeful projects that were going to make

24:19.080 --> 24:24.600
the world better that didn't happen that he was kind of traumatized by and where their hope in how

24:24.600 --> 24:30.440
good they would be was false. And I said, yeah, but you also need to equally factor all of the

24:31.240 --> 24:34.360
devastatingly bad things that people forecasted during that time that didn't happen as well,

24:34.360 --> 24:40.440
that the Cuban Missile Crisis didn't become World War III and Y2K didn't in the world and 2012 didn't

24:40.440 --> 24:46.680
and on and on. And that if you factor them both, people just suck at forecasting the future because

24:46.680 --> 24:50.040
it makes sense that we would. We can't get the weather right 10 days out like

24:50.040 --> 24:53.720
multiply embedded complex systems are hard, we're just not going to do that.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.880
So we have to get recursive intelligence processes that can do a little bit and increase the

24:57.880 --> 25:03.160
collective intelligence that can keep doing that. That said, I think there are some things we can do

25:04.520 --> 25:10.600
to forecast externalities much, much, much better than we ever have that are kind of low hanging

25:10.600 --> 25:15.560
and it's really worthwhile. And so one thing as you're mentioning that the engineers, I mean,

25:15.560 --> 25:18.840
I think the engineers have been profoundly competent in the domain that they were trained,

25:19.400 --> 25:25.080
but as soon as you understand that technology codes patterns of behavior that end up coding

25:25.080 --> 25:29.880
minds that then in mass code societies, of course, technologies have to be trained in social sciences

25:30.520 --> 25:37.400
and axiological design, what are the value sets that will emerge from the use of these technologies

25:37.400 --> 25:40.760
has to be a consideration doesn't mean you'll get it all right, but we need to work at it and then

25:40.760 --> 25:46.440
recursively work at it and improve the process as we go. So I think when you have bigger frameworks

25:46.440 --> 25:51.400
like that are superstructure and our collective definition of the good life and values, whatever

25:51.400 --> 25:56.040
our social structure or economics governance law and agreement fields and our infrastructure or

25:56.040 --> 26:01.000
techplex co influence each other so that you don't try to do sense making within what you do

26:01.000 --> 26:05.720
sense making across them. Just basic shit like that really helps, right? It really helps the

26:05.720 --> 26:12.200
forecasting. But one other thing I wanted to say is there's a very interesting thing right now where

26:12.200 --> 26:16.760
the arguments that we can't possibly forecast the future well enough ends up being a source of plausible

26:16.760 --> 26:23.320
deniability for people not even trying where it's in their vested interest not to. And the less

26:23.320 --> 26:28.520
wrong community had this blog post on is it mistake theory or conflict theory that's a very

26:28.520 --> 26:32.280
deal meaning the mistake theory or the problem is the result of shit we just couldn't have possibly

26:32.280 --> 26:36.360
known and the externalities are too complex or is it conflict theory meaning we actually wanted

26:36.360 --> 26:40.520
to cause that problem or we wanted to benefit and we didn't really care if we caused that problem.

26:40.520 --> 26:46.680
And of course it's some of both. But some of the argument in there is Michael Vassar and others

26:46.760 --> 26:53.640
commented is that the existence of the possibility of mistake theory serves as a plausible

26:53.640 --> 26:58.040
deniability cover for a bunch of conflict theory to hide itself and say oh we couldn't have possibly

26:58.040 --> 27:02.680
known. Oh bullshit you didn't try because it wasn't in your interest. Yeah I'm just thinking of like

27:02.680 --> 27:07.320
Instagram wouldn't they have known that they would cause like a massive psychiatric health

27:07.320 --> 27:12.680
crisis among teenage girls. It was quite obvious. You and I pointed that out from the very beginning

27:12.680 --> 27:16.520
like just like they couldn't know but they didn't want to hear it right because they were

27:16.520 --> 27:21.000
there was telling everybody at the time Facebook was starting or whatever it's going to do these

27:21.000 --> 27:26.120
things they're like shut up hippie and no it's not there's no possible way but of course the

27:26.120 --> 27:29.800
motivated reasoning is a problem right. Motivated reasoning is tricky. So here's the piece that I

27:29.800 --> 27:35.080
wanted to add which is there's a very perverse piece of kind of game theory at a consentive here

27:35.080 --> 27:41.720
that has to be bound which is that it is very disadvantageous and a market type dynamic for

27:41.720 --> 27:47.320
any individual or group to focus on what the possible risks might be and it's very of the

27:47.320 --> 27:51.000
thing that they would develop and it's very advantageous to just focus on the opportunities

27:51.000 --> 27:56.920
and benefits because if I do protracted risk assessment somebody else hits first mover advantage

27:56.920 --> 28:01.720
faster and if my protracted risk assessment says actually the field is too dangerous we

28:01.720 --> 28:04.920
shouldn't do it it's not going to stop the fucking thing the market is going to move

28:04.920 --> 28:09.480
the people who move fastest will privatize the benefits and then socialize the losses

28:10.040 --> 28:16.360
and so there's a focus to move fast break things socialize the losses nobody takes responsibility

28:17.000 --> 28:24.040
that perverse game theory keeps people from even trying to think well and when the worst

28:24.040 --> 28:29.000
harm you could do was add lead to gasoline which was pretty fucking bad right it it decreased

28:29.000 --> 28:33.480
the IQ of the planet by like a billion points and made people four times more violent it's like

28:34.280 --> 28:38.120
Jesus Christ that's a huge deal when you say humans have been about the same for 5000 years I'm

28:38.120 --> 28:42.840
like no man fucking just let it gasoline alone made us a billion IQ points stupider and four times

28:42.840 --> 28:47.080
more violent like that's a big deal and that was one of 50 million chemicals in the in the chemical

28:47.080 --> 28:54.760
database that it made but but when it comes to synthetic biology and general artificial intelligence

28:56.600 --> 29:00.440
by the time we're dealing with those types of externalities it is it's totalizing

29:01.320 --> 29:05.240
and so we actually have to do some fundamentally different types of coordination

29:06.040 --> 29:11.720
around how to think through the long term better using models like attractive basins and things

29:11.720 --> 29:14.840
where you don't have to get every detail of complex systems right but you can get general

29:14.840 --> 29:20.840
principles and where you disincentivize move fast and break things and this is actually

29:20.840 --> 29:25.480
things like to open up a new category of tech you actually have to open up these you have to get

29:25.480 --> 29:29.960
regulatory approval to open it up as opposed to regulate after the harms have already happened

29:31.560 --> 29:34.600
that's of course that bothers everyone because they don't trust states to regulate so we have

29:34.600 --> 29:39.240
to also restructure the state from scratch because the power to check the catastrophes creates

29:39.240 --> 29:44.040
dystopias unless you also have strong bindings on it but you have to face these things together

29:44.600 --> 29:49.240
yeah and that's where it gets interesting here with the narcology you just said the state here

29:50.040 --> 29:56.040
the state is in the imaginary realm it's not a logical rose in the imaginary realm so so we

29:56.040 --> 30:01.160
did inherit from religion and the gods and the forefathers and all that we know this idea of the

30:01.160 --> 30:05.960
state and that would be the king or you know with the priest and eventually that becomes the state

30:05.960 --> 30:11.560
we have today and the state is so far behind and the problem here of course is the other one

30:11.560 --> 30:17.000
is that if you have if you create a monopoly it will instantly go corrupt and become dysfunctional

30:17.000 --> 30:22.040
and we created states so far that are not competing one another at all they're local monopolies

30:22.040 --> 30:25.960
and this is of course the problem you got the market the market is incredibly efficient i can

30:25.960 --> 30:31.880
give an example of my team we just studied construction sites in east africa east africa is

30:31.880 --> 30:36.440
like wide open right now it wants to expand quickly it looks at china and india it doesn't care too

30:36.440 --> 30:40.440
much about regulation so this is the perfect place for a chinese construction company to

30:40.440 --> 30:44.760
be the shed of a french construction company with a bid for a construction in iroby because the

30:44.760 --> 30:49.160
french come there with a european attitude they've learned you know the hard way that we need to make

30:49.160 --> 30:52.840
an assessment a risk assessment before you start building and by the time they start the risk

30:52.840 --> 30:56.360
assessment the chinese are ready up and building the construction anyway because they don't care

30:56.360 --> 31:01.640
about the risk assessment so we still have this sort of this blatant aggressive form of capitalism

31:01.640 --> 31:06.680
running around the world and they know that we have exactly what you said we need to create

31:06.680 --> 31:12.200
a functioning container within which the market can operate with some certain rules and then people

31:12.200 --> 31:16.360
scream oh that's socialism and we need a bigger state and we know states can function any longer

31:16.360 --> 31:21.720
and the states are going incredibly corrupt slow and they no longer work this is again this is part

31:21.720 --> 31:28.120
of the imaginary order of crisis so it's in the imaginary order it's a crisis of religion and politics

31:28.120 --> 31:34.280
in a fundamental one now i like then to go back to what actually worked and i know you also you

31:34.280 --> 31:40.440
you tend to quote the silk group try it you tend to quote daoism buddhism is orastrism i do too i

31:40.440 --> 31:44.360
find very very little solace in christianity and islam when it comes to try to understand

31:44.360 --> 31:48.440
we're at right now i prefer these religions that have been around for thousands of years

31:48.440 --> 31:54.360
and they've been created along the trade routes so i go to the metaphor of the bazaar now how does

31:54.360 --> 31:59.640
a bazaar work well a bazaar has to be exploitative because it's going to be around for thousands

31:59.640 --> 32:05.400
of years it's probably in some kind of an oasis town along the trade route you put an old smart

32:05.400 --> 32:10.840
wise woman at the door you know you put that bitch at the door nobody gets in without her permission

32:11.640 --> 32:17.480
so you have a membrane and containers start with functioning membranes so there are rules

32:17.560 --> 32:22.920
how you conduct the trade in the bazaar otherwise the bazaar will not work it's not a free market

32:22.920 --> 32:28.200
it's not a free for all you can do whatever you like because then the bazaar falls apart so if

32:28.200 --> 32:32.360
you think of the system we're looking at as a kind of a bazaar that we need to create for the digital

32:32.360 --> 32:36.280
age it starts to make sense then we can have different bazaars that compete in one another

32:36.280 --> 32:41.080
but we have to have a central framework for all the bazaars of the world which is how we

32:41.080 --> 32:47.000
exploitatively use the world in that sense so that we don't completely go into collapse so the

32:47.000 --> 32:51.160
problem here is that we both on a global level have to have a network of bazaars and another

32:51.160 --> 32:56.280
local ever there are the bazaars but what I'm then proposing is that the bazaar looks to its own

32:56.280 --> 33:04.040
self-interest long time see it keeps itself alive as a container within which you can put the content

33:04.040 --> 33:09.320
and this is why the market will not work unless the market is regulated it has to start there

33:09.400 --> 33:13.800
so the markets themselves have to look at their own regulation otherwise we should just boycott

33:13.800 --> 33:17.960
the market not be part of it just say that I don't want to be in the bazaar at all unless it works

33:18.760 --> 33:22.760
unless unless it has a functioning membrane unless it takes responsibility for itself in

33:22.760 --> 33:27.080
relation to other bazaars it's not a trading place for me to be involved with it has to be

33:27.080 --> 33:33.240
something like that because we have a major a metacrisis of politics right now we know the

33:33.240 --> 33:37.400
states that we construct and no longer work and the only alternative out that seems to work right

33:37.400 --> 33:43.160
now interesting enough imitates egyptian dictatorship and it's called communist china

33:43.720 --> 33:47.400
they at least seem to have a sense of what we call a sensocracy where they're going how they

33:47.400 --> 33:51.800
will control everything to a central computer we also know that that won't work either so the

33:51.800 --> 33:57.080
question is how do we open a society that's free and open enough to stay creative and to stay open

33:57.080 --> 34:03.720
to bad news which dictatorships never do which exactly why they go extinct eventually and this

34:03.800 --> 34:10.040
is of course the central question ideologically speaking and it's a question of imaginary narrative

34:10.040 --> 34:14.680
it's in imaginary order that's the crisis there the reason that you're saying it's fundamentally

34:14.680 --> 34:19.000
imaginary and why the bazaar worked in the market didn't is the bazaar had a long-term

34:19.000 --> 34:24.600
survival interest in the market doesn't and that the long-term interest is in the imaginary realm

34:24.600 --> 34:29.400
there was some narrative that everyone the bazaar was a part of that was self-transcending so they

34:29.400 --> 34:34.840
wouldn't fuck the future to benefit themselves for some reason and that that's what's missing

34:34.840 --> 34:42.120
currently that's the mythos is what is it that has us not maximize short-term personal gain

34:42.920 --> 34:47.560
because there is some higher order transcendental narrative that we will have be a basis to find

34:47.560 --> 34:51.480
our behavior is that right yeah so if you're looking around the bazaar on a map this would

34:51.480 --> 34:56.360
you find interesting every bazaar it had the hospice it had the restaurant and the hotel

34:56.360 --> 35:02.360
it had the bath house in a clique which is also a social place it had a gym there was always a

35:02.360 --> 35:07.480
gym around the bazaar they called sarkhani the persians invented the gym 3 000 years ago

35:07.480 --> 35:12.280
where you go work out and make your body fit and then it has the bazaar and you need to probably

35:12.280 --> 35:17.400
go to the whorehouse which is another word for nightclub to socialize with people and see strangers

35:17.400 --> 35:21.560
and make friends with strangers and there's no better place than a nightclub or even a whorehouse

35:21.560 --> 35:25.480
if we're honest about it to make friends with a stranger they'd be absolutely naked in front

35:25.480 --> 35:29.480
of somebody which you are at a whorehouse and therefore you can make a trade the next day

35:29.480 --> 35:34.600
so the matriarch sitting at the front of the bazaar will make sure that she checks you done all

35:34.600 --> 35:38.920
these things now here's the most important thing though it wasn't my team in london that they

35:38.920 --> 35:44.440
discovered that every bazaar after you leave the bazaar you leave the town and go to the next

35:44.440 --> 35:50.440
town to trade you have to go up to a costog the costog is the origin of the monastery

35:51.320 --> 35:56.600
you literally have after you've done your traded bazaar you need to go to spiritual center and

35:56.600 --> 36:02.440
fix your mind this is where you go into what the Tao is called Tao or the Zoroastrian is called the

36:02.440 --> 36:07.800
Asha of the world you go into a relationship where you actually you go back into the logos you go back

36:07.800 --> 36:12.680
into reality as much as you possibly can including yourself and you readjust yourself your own

36:12.680 --> 36:18.760
thinking oh you did a bad deal in the bazaar get rid of it get over it move on come back with a

36:18.760 --> 36:24.680
constructive mindset and all these trade group religions are basically they bowled down the

36:24.680 --> 36:30.520
ethics to in what way are you constructively participating in the world in what way are you

36:30.520 --> 36:35.080
constructing or representing your tribe when you're out here traveling doing the trades

36:35.080 --> 36:39.960
in what way are constructed be supporting the community that just embraced you and welcomed

36:39.960 --> 36:44.440
just you could do your trade and what we are constructively moving on to the next community

36:44.440 --> 36:49.880
you're gonna enter so you can go into that bazaar and make more trade so the question here is that

36:49.880 --> 36:56.440
why do we miss out on the costog we separated religion from the rest of side and made it a

36:56.440 --> 37:01.080
private thing something you do on Sundays you go to church and show off yourself and of course that

37:01.080 --> 37:05.560
eventually ended up with us being cynical about religion like well I only go to church on Sunday

37:05.560 --> 37:10.040
it's only worth investment if it looks good so I can make more money on the Monday while

37:10.040 --> 37:17.160
exploiting the world so the costog is fundamental to interactions especially when it comes to

37:17.160 --> 37:21.400
larger populations than our own tribe as soon as you move into a larger public zone tribe

37:21.400 --> 37:25.960
we need to start containing ourselves in our behavior relationship to other people the costog

37:25.960 --> 37:30.520
eventually leads to the monastery traditions of all of Eurasia especially buddhism's are

37:30.520 --> 37:34.680
asked in the dullest monasteries and I think it really pays off for most people today to go and

37:34.680 --> 37:39.720
spend some time a year or two in the monastery and try to figure out what it means to meditate

37:39.720 --> 37:43.720
and contemplate every morning of your day to have a constructive mindset towards the world

37:43.720 --> 37:48.760
it has to it has to be his personal spiritual journey involved here and it was required at the

37:48.760 --> 37:53.800
bazaars it was required it was the first thing they would ask you the next time you come to

37:53.800 --> 37:58.920
oh did you go to the costog after did the train of bazaar the last stop you made otherwise you're

37:58.920 --> 38:05.000
not welcome otherwise you haven't done your work this became such an industry you even had to build

38:05.000 --> 38:11.640
costogs in mountains you know god hello tibetan buddhism you had to build in mountain where the

38:11.640 --> 38:16.760
monks themselves and the nuns themselves prepare themselves for all the heaven load that they had

38:16.760 --> 38:21.960
to go through with the traders and the costogs in the trading towns so it became like a spiritual

38:21.960 --> 38:32.200
industry but that's fine and we need one today as well so did the next bazaar require some kind of

38:32.920 --> 38:35.800
ticket or proof that you've been in the costog or they took your word for it

38:36.520 --> 38:42.120
no absolutely and again this is this is how you get your credibility you get your credibility

38:42.120 --> 38:46.520
because you've done the trade many times and yeah we can trust this god the way we do grading

38:46.520 --> 38:52.680
today this is the 5.0 okay and it also represents a community that is underrepresented inside the

38:52.680 --> 38:57.800
bazaar meaning it's got to sell us stuff we haven't seen it before oh that's quite exotic and interesting

38:57.800 --> 39:03.480
let him go in he will do fine but if he doesn't do fine if he's out competed about it he needs to

39:03.480 --> 39:08.920
go to the costog more than ever the next day to not take that looser mentality with him into the

39:08.920 --> 39:18.760
next trade it's very interesting i i not heard that story told that way um so there's a way that i

39:18.760 --> 39:27.240
think about that relative to the world today where it uh it seems like something has changed in scale

39:27.240 --> 39:31.880
in a way that crossed a threshold that changed in type or the same thing even in network wouldn't

39:31.880 --> 39:38.680
apply i'd like to ask this question and get your thought on it so you went to the market

39:39.400 --> 39:44.280
after talking about the state and then you said okay in the market there was something like law

39:44.280 --> 39:50.680
the woman at the front um had some kind of wisdom to be able to assess who you are some

39:50.680 --> 39:56.360
record of if you went to the costog or not some you know some indicators about you and then obviously

39:56.360 --> 40:01.640
she's probably connected to a network of people who are reporting on what people are doing inside

40:01.640 --> 40:07.960
and there's probably something like police and whatever right so uh if someone is stealing or

40:07.960 --> 40:12.360
doing false advertising or whatever it would be that would go against the um written or unwritten

40:12.360 --> 40:17.880
law of the thing then they get kicked out or something like that so there's something like

40:17.880 --> 40:23.320
rules and there's something like enforcement which is what defines the membrane and so acting on the

40:23.320 --> 40:31.240
inside requires participation with the rules one of the things that makes that work without

40:31.240 --> 40:39.720
being tyrannical is the smallness of scale yes and so unlike a massive police state um if the

40:40.440 --> 40:45.240
police in that thing started to get corrupt enough of the people could overthrow the police and

40:46.040 --> 40:53.800
there's no such thing as a person at a bazaar who can use personalized data micro targeted

40:53.800 --> 40:58.280
split tested advertising on me like they can just say I got the best shit and I can say what about

40:58.280 --> 41:02.120
these guys over here their shoes are cheaper and I can go touch them by myself right so there's not

41:02.120 --> 41:07.080
a radical asymmetry between billion dollar corporations and the purchaser it's like a dude on

41:07.080 --> 41:11.000
one side of the table selling stuff and a dude on the other side buying stuff there's not that much

41:11.000 --> 41:15.800
asymmetry between the police and the non-police and so the symmetry is part of what makes something

41:15.800 --> 41:20.440
like caveat and tour by or be where be reasonable or what makes something like the second amendment

41:20.440 --> 41:25.640
hey if we need to throw over the police we can deal with it a reasonable idea when you start to get

41:25.640 --> 41:31.640
to much more radical when you get to much more size if you want to have something like rule of

41:31.640 --> 41:37.480
law across that whole size a very big membrane then you get pretty radical asymmetries of power

41:37.480 --> 41:42.360
in a radical asymmetry of power you don't even have things like the ability to check the corruption

41:42.360 --> 41:47.960
on it or even consent as a valid idea because of things like a new influence what does consent mean

41:47.960 --> 41:52.360
if I don't have capacity to consent because the other agent is so much smarter than I am that they

41:52.360 --> 41:56.840
can manipulate me to do shit which is like cold dynamics but a cold dynamic is nothing compared

41:56.840 --> 42:01.880
to ai's on social media or whatever else doing stochastic terrorism and population centric warfare

42:02.520 --> 42:06.120
so I don't even need a monopoly of violence anymore I just need a monopoly of influence

42:06.760 --> 42:11.080
and the monopoly of influence can make people commit the violence I want or whatever it is

42:11.080 --> 42:16.680
so when you start dealing with those who control ai's and those who don't

42:17.960 --> 42:24.840
when you start to deal with that level of um asymmetry of information processing capacity

42:24.840 --> 42:32.200
voluntarism doesn't mean anything anymore the ability to uh because you cannot voluntarily consent

42:32.200 --> 42:35.720
in or not consent when you can't check all the stuff what does it mean for the people to be able

42:35.720 --> 42:39.560
to check the state if there's no way to process all the information because the state's using ai to

42:39.560 --> 42:45.400
process all the shit right um and how do the people deal with the if there is a policing force at all

42:45.400 --> 42:51.000
the levels of asymmetry of power so if you say okay fuck nation states we're just doing city

42:51.000 --> 42:55.080
states let's keep them smaller and let's always make sure that if anybody has an ai there's a

42:55.080 --> 42:59.400
competing ai so you at least have something of some metrical size that can compete with it

42:59.400 --> 43:04.440
well now we get this issue that let's just even take nation states we can go to city states but

43:04.440 --> 43:08.760
let's take something less than global governance anything less than global governance you still

43:08.760 --> 43:14.680
get global multicoller traps meaning a situation where if they're going to do the fucked up thing

43:14.680 --> 43:18.040
then we have to raise to do the fucked up thing or they be best right they're going to develop nukes

43:18.040 --> 43:21.880
we have to develop nukes they're going to develop ai weapons we have to develop ai weapons they're

43:21.880 --> 43:26.600
going to overfish the ocean well how do we stop them from overfishing the ocean if they have nukes

43:26.600 --> 43:30.920
and then they really need the fish for their population growth so if we don't overfish the

43:30.920 --> 43:36.600
ocean the fish are still going to go so we might as well race to overfish the ocean so those race

43:36.600 --> 43:40.600
to the bottom coordination failures are because you don't have a monopoly of violence to be able

43:40.600 --> 43:44.200
to enact rule of law which is why you want a global government that you don't want a global

43:44.200 --> 43:48.360
government because a monopoly of violence with no checks and balances become totally corrupt

43:48.360 --> 43:53.160
catastrophes dystopias so you want a global government that is not corrupt well that requires

43:53.160 --> 43:58.920
some magic right or really good design and i think that's where you and i are going to get so

43:59.480 --> 44:04.280
what i see is that the principles that we're operating at the bazaar were scale dependent

44:05.560 --> 44:10.360
and that as the scale gets larger you get fundamental breakdowns in some of those things

44:10.360 --> 44:15.720
when the scale gets large enough for instance that supply and demand have a radical asymmetry

44:15.720 --> 44:19.720
because even though in aggregate the total amount of demand total amount of supply is

44:19.720 --> 44:23.240
the same flow of dollars the supply is not coordinated the demand is not coordinated and

44:23.240 --> 44:27.720
the supply is coordinated right i don't have a labor union of all google users who work together

44:27.720 --> 44:31.240
and use ai to coordinate how they want to use google but google is the centralized corporation

44:31.240 --> 44:36.920
that actually has long perm planning and in org chart and again chart whatever so it's really

44:36.920 --> 44:42.760
google half a trillion dollar organization whatever using ai's against a single user or facebook or

44:42.760 --> 44:49.000
nike or whatever it is and they can employ radical behavior mod techniques so there's no

44:49.000 --> 44:54.760
longer authentic demand driving supply there's supply manufacturing bullshit demand based on one

44:54.760 --> 44:59.240
marshmallow stuff rather than two marshmallow and then say oh but the people want it after driving

44:59.240 --> 45:06.280
addiction and so when you have those types of asymmetries it's asymmetric warfare you don't

45:06.280 --> 45:11.080
have like the same principles that apply when there's symmetry like buyer beware like second

45:11.080 --> 45:14.760
amendment like what they just don't hold in the same way so you need a fundamentally different

45:14.760 --> 45:21.720
way of thinking how do we deal when there are competing interests across types of asymmetries

45:21.800 --> 45:27.160
of power that are totally unprecedented absolutely i agree totally here and i think you're not

45:27.160 --> 45:30.760
working on the same thing you're doing it on the technological level i'm doing it on the

45:30.760 --> 45:35.400
narratological level i'm writing a book and you can do the technical level without the narrative

45:35.400 --> 45:41.800
level no exactly exactly that's the point yeah so the the um the narratology i'm doing at the moment

45:42.600 --> 45:46.600
the reason why i got into this thing with the bazaar is of course the the whole the entire

45:46.600 --> 45:51.800
history of eurasia is being rewritten at the moment by asian historians many of them asian

45:51.800 --> 45:57.160
americans like chinese american indian american persian american historians and i have discovered

45:57.160 --> 46:02.680
that the entire history of asia is just a european 19th century fantasy it's completely incorrect it's

46:02.680 --> 46:07.960
just read the wrong way so that's exactly what we see these patterns and and the reason what we're

46:07.960 --> 46:13.320
doing is because asia's history is much older than europe's and that's the asset here we need we need

46:13.320 --> 46:19.160
deep history we need long history to to look at what systems work and what stories work over

46:19.160 --> 46:24.360
long periods of time and which stories failed and here's the interesting thing the it is that

46:24.360 --> 46:30.600
we're looking at units like empire which is older by the way than nation and look at these systems so

46:30.600 --> 46:35.800
what is an empire what is a nation what could it possibly be in what we would technology subscribe

46:35.800 --> 46:39.960
to an empire in what way can human beings subscribe to certain empire and in terms of the

46:39.960 --> 46:45.640
empire that were very loose they were full of dialectical conflicts and economies everywhere

46:45.640 --> 46:50.040
they were allowed they were certainly encouraged they didn't worry too much about a diversity of

46:50.040 --> 46:55.160
looks like we do today there were much more about diversity of talents and a diversity of opinions

46:55.160 --> 46:58.840
because the strengthens the system's long term so you want to have these sort of competitive

46:58.840 --> 47:03.160
environments we want to have them within certain containers that work and you discover when you

47:03.160 --> 47:08.840
do these formats that you don't need the police unless the size is big that's exactly my scale

47:08.840 --> 47:13.800
here is incredibly important we take to the tribal size somewhere between 1200 and 1500

47:13.800 --> 47:17.720
people quite naturally and anything smaller than that we're perfectly comfortable with

47:17.720 --> 47:23.160
we don't need a police force to be loyal to and even live and die for a community of say 1500

47:23.160 --> 47:27.880
people once it gets bigger than that that gets more problematic and that's why you need these

47:27.880 --> 47:32.600
sort of social systems and eventually even states or at least city states nations whatever

47:32.600 --> 47:38.520
for those things to work and they are required the question is on what level can people you know

47:38.520 --> 47:42.440
align this in what on what level can they for example vote for a politician that they would

47:42.440 --> 47:46.600
know and they say hi to industry well that's only to a certain level but that's absolutely

47:46.600 --> 47:50.600
minimum level you must work with because otherwise people don't trust people around them they don't

47:50.600 --> 47:54.840
trust the leaders their elders or whatever then you have to go all the way up to global that's

47:54.840 --> 48:00.600
the challenge here it's unavoidable there has to be some kind of least loose global you know

48:00.600 --> 48:05.640
collaboration here and some certain global rules we have to have a membrane for planet earth itself

48:06.520 --> 48:11.560
and at least after the atomic bomb in 1945 in the late 1950s we got the first pictures of

48:11.560 --> 48:15.800
planet earth from outer space we tend to forget how young these pictures are there's only like

48:15.800 --> 48:21.080
a little more than 50 years ago we finally saw this beautiful green blue planet where we live

48:21.080 --> 48:28.040
and we saw this huge cold dark space out there that we cannot relate to so at least we know we

48:28.040 --> 48:33.400
have the dia we have we have that narrative it's there and it's unavoidable I would even say that

48:33.400 --> 48:37.400
I challenge my students these days and say that the one thing I will take care of probably is to

48:37.400 --> 48:42.520
conquer outer space and you will not be involved and maybe that's a good place to start because the

48:42.520 --> 48:48.440
hubris we suffered from should have some kind of a price we need to pay so you remind the students

48:48.440 --> 48:53.480
that if we don't fix this planet which is the only place we know we can actually live in the

48:53.480 --> 48:59.560
universe then we're done so the planet has to be fixed it has to be fixed it's unavoidable as a question

48:59.560 --> 49:03.560
and this is the largest size I think we should allow ourselves to think to forget about our

49:03.560 --> 49:09.160
space but think of the satellites at least a space surrounding the planet creating the internet

49:09.160 --> 49:14.120
and what we then come to is of course the complexity has increased to higher levels than ever

49:14.840 --> 49:19.880
which are there for expect people to go absolutely bananas over the next 50 years that's our book

49:19.880 --> 49:23.800
digital libido by the way it's a very dark book because the first thing that will happen now so

49:23.800 --> 49:28.280
people will go absolutely bananas they will go for all kinds of conspiracy theories that will create

49:28.280 --> 49:32.280
the weirdest sects and cults you've ever seen they will lose themselves completely in these

49:32.280 --> 49:36.520
environments it will not be safe to be outside anybody can kill you for whatever reasons you don't

49:36.520 --> 49:41.240
know you know if anybody can order your murder you don't know who's going to kill you uh she

49:41.240 --> 49:46.760
says abe was killed in japan because somebody started making homemade guns in japan so japan

49:46.760 --> 49:51.800
has the same gun control problem that was america for that very reason so it becoming a very unsafe

49:51.800 --> 49:57.160
world very quickly now that's quite obvious so the question then is we then have to move quicker

49:57.240 --> 50:02.120
towards the global order it has to be very very loose it has to be very loose then the question

50:02.120 --> 50:08.680
the next question is what would its insocracy be like we need algorithms algorithms have bad

50:08.680 --> 50:12.680
reputation today because they're so bad today but they could be much much much better they could

50:12.680 --> 50:17.240
much better reflect the world how the world actually operates i call it the free and open

50:17.240 --> 50:22.040
algorithm to give it a positive spin is to get rid of those sort of manipulated algorithms

50:22.040 --> 50:26.760
corrupted algorithms and conformist algorithms that we have today we need to get rid of the

50:26.760 --> 50:33.080
manipulation the conformation and the corruption of current algorithms we need proper algorithms

50:33.080 --> 50:37.240
because algorithms is the only help we have with increased complexity try to understand the world

50:37.240 --> 50:41.160
better and leadership has to be based on proper algorithms that give you a fair view what the

50:41.160 --> 50:46.280
world looks like again back to the logos the conspiracy theories they want to avoid the logos

50:46.280 --> 50:50.600
as much as they can so jump between the pathos and the mythos which is incredibly dangerous to

50:50.600 --> 50:54.520
put a lot of people in that realm we need to go back to the logos and the algorithms are there to

50:54.520 --> 51:02.680
help us do that can you explain for me what you mean by the good algorithms that we need for leadership

51:02.680 --> 51:10.280
to work okay so if it's a new paradigm it will be chaotic at first now allow for chaos say an

51:10.280 --> 51:16.120
anarchy to establish itself first which is what the internet has been so far the old institutions

51:16.120 --> 51:21.160
that used to be powerful the old logos the old pathos and the old mythos and the institutions

51:21.160 --> 51:26.040
built on those old narratives will try to defend themselves all they can although they're done

51:26.760 --> 51:33.800
I call this the the the Versailles versus Paris uh dichotomy this is like 1789 in Paris so Versailles

51:33.800 --> 51:40.520
today is politics politics tries to manipulate the algorithms in political directions so the

51:40.520 --> 51:44.600
algorithms are not free and open they don't reflect you and don't reflect the kind of world you want

51:44.600 --> 51:50.200
to live in and need to live in then we got the corruption of money they used to put the ads

51:50.200 --> 51:54.360
on the side with the percent of the algorithms for you when you did your search now the ads are at

51:54.360 --> 51:59.560
the very top of the ads are increasing the infill trading the algorithm itself it becomes a corrupt

51:59.560 --> 52:03.480
algorithm because money is corrupting it and money should not be involved in creation of the

52:03.480 --> 52:09.080
algorithm at least for you personally we try to search the internet the third one is the conformation

52:09.080 --> 52:13.400
and that means the old established institutions hate the fact the world is splitting up in so

52:13.400 --> 52:18.840
many different directions and it's becoming so chaotic so the old institutions like academia

52:18.840 --> 52:23.480
like mass media you know television stations you know the old institutions they will all say that

52:23.480 --> 52:29.000
you must be more alike you must be more conformed and therefore conform it in itself as a value

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
precisely we need more people to you know to be more creative about solving these problems we try

52:35.000 --> 52:39.880
to conform everybody into the same pattern so these are the three fourths of the old institutions

52:39.880 --> 52:45.800
the way Versailles would attack the streets of Paris in 1789 by telling the streets of Paris off

52:45.800 --> 52:51.000
not realizing the people in the streets of Paris could read write or count which nobody in the

52:51.000 --> 52:55.640
nobility of Versailles could any longer therefore the streets of Paris finally came to the conclusion

52:55.640 --> 53:00.360
let's go to Versailles chop their heads off because the old institutions are useless to us these days

53:00.360 --> 53:04.840
because we can create the new institutions that could work of course that led to a bloodbath

53:05.560 --> 53:10.680
would you want to avoid what have a slow gradual decrease of the old institutions and want the

53:10.680 --> 53:15.320
new institutions to come into place and the new institutions to come into place must represent

53:15.320 --> 53:20.280
the logos the pathos and the mythos they must incredibly do that the different expertise

53:20.920 --> 53:26.040
that's why you and I are very very careful to not ever speak like in a sort of general sense

53:26.040 --> 53:31.320
we speak as the specialists we are even if we're considered to be generalists so I'm a

53:31.320 --> 53:37.880
narratologist I do storytelling uh John Seticfist and I have worked with this for the past 25 years

53:37.880 --> 53:41.800
you know he was a former scriptwriter I was a former music producer it makes sense to be

53:41.800 --> 53:46.120
become philosophers of narrative and narratology and we now want to move the whole the construction

53:46.120 --> 53:52.440
revolution of the 20th century into a reconstruction revolution of the 21st century which is fiendishly

53:52.440 --> 53:57.720
hard we call it narrative you call it culture in your work where is the digital culture

53:58.840 --> 54:03.400
digital is still a tale digital is hardly even happened yet we just know it's going to happen

54:03.400 --> 54:07.480
and digital is going to remember absolutely everything the way it's been programmed at least

54:07.480 --> 54:12.600
it's going to remember absolutely everything that happens so thankfully we have a data revolution

54:12.600 --> 54:18.360
in parallel with increased complexity and that data revolution should be the free and open algorithms

54:18.360 --> 54:22.520
that can help us to guide ourselves so we get a fair view how the world actually operates

54:23.400 --> 54:26.680
it's required and if that's how we're going to solve climate change at the end of the day

54:26.680 --> 54:31.240
you're not this working any longer you're actually providing proper data no climate change is

54:31.240 --> 54:36.920
happening here is the data the satellites provide the data this is the actual temperature in

54:36.920 --> 54:41.240
500 different places around the planet right now this temperature should be in July this temperature

54:41.240 --> 54:46.280
that's in July so you know the data at the end of the day convinces people finally to give up the

54:46.280 --> 54:50.600
resistance and realize the climate change is really happening and now it has to be worked on

54:50.600 --> 54:55.800
and that's sort of logical argument the logos once the logos comes into the picture it becomes

54:55.800 --> 55:00.360
a lot easier to convince more people this is actually happening you cannot escape this and

55:00.360 --> 55:05.800
along with this must be done before that we just did the guesswork we just did the storytelling

55:05.800 --> 55:13.240
just had fairy tales suddenly is real and this when the real on the logos when the real from

55:13.240 --> 55:18.760
the pathos to the logos comes into the picture when the undeniable facts are there we have more

55:18.760 --> 55:29.000
hope of getting things done than we did right before so I I generally agree that important

55:29.000 --> 55:33.880
deconstruction happened an important reconstruction of a different type a different dimensionality

55:33.880 --> 55:44.840
is needed when you identify rightly that all of the narratives had embedded power plays in them

55:46.280 --> 55:50.120
and you kind of deconstruct that you look at all the motivated reasoning that was involved

55:51.480 --> 55:57.960
in a way you actually heighten power to be the only game there is because there is no

55:58.920 --> 56:09.240
unifying basis of ability to form shared basis for choice making and so the ability to have

56:09.240 --> 56:14.600
epistemologies of is science and epistemologies of all ethics that work together better

56:15.240 --> 56:20.520
that are never adequate but we're continuously improving that identify their own perverse incentives

56:20.520 --> 56:25.000
and where the perverse incentives affect the nature of the motivated reasoning itself

56:25.960 --> 56:31.160
gives you something like whether you call it metamodern or whatever some capacity for

56:33.240 --> 56:39.960
shared choice making that is not just the game of power so I would very much like to go there

56:39.960 --> 56:44.600
I'd very much like to go into the relationship between what has to happen in culture or narrative

56:44.600 --> 56:50.200
or superstructure or like our shared values or shared meaning making to inform choice making

56:50.200 --> 56:56.040
and how that relates to tech but I think because you said a lot in there I think the place I'd like

56:56.040 --> 57:01.720
to start is when you said what happened between Paris and Versailles we want to do a slow version

57:01.720 --> 57:05.880
now so it's not so bloody and that the previous institutions are kind of holding on

57:08.120 --> 57:11.960
there's this story that like looks like the sovereign individual put forward

57:12.680 --> 57:18.360
that said changes in tech change social structures we know that changes in info tech

57:18.360 --> 57:23.480
specifically do right so Marvin Harris said the first argument McLuhan really went deep

57:23.480 --> 57:30.920
with the second argument and that you get a printing press and in feudalism and usher's in

57:30.920 --> 57:35.800
democracy and in Catholicism and usher's in you know Lutheranism and other things

57:35.800 --> 57:39.320
because the nature of everybody can have a newspaper and everybody can have a textbook is

57:39.320 --> 57:44.120
really different so you it's a democratizing force but it was tech affecting the social system so then

57:44.760 --> 57:48.680
the idea that the next we we got modern democracies based out of that

57:50.040 --> 57:55.160
the idea that the next major change in the information technology is the internet computation

57:55.160 --> 58:02.840
and then shared distributed computation and so now we can share value online by moving bits around

58:02.840 --> 58:07.320
in uh net space as opposed to just atoms around in physical space and we can find networks of

58:07.320 --> 58:12.040
affinity that are stronger than just the networks of geography so the nation state that was a

58:12.040 --> 58:17.000
geographically based thing to move atoms around will be progressively less useful than the net

58:17.000 --> 58:21.960
based move bits around thing and so you'll get these new emergent systems that kind of debase

58:21.960 --> 58:28.760
the old ones i think this is a good and partial insight i think there's a heap wrong with it

58:29.640 --> 58:35.400
and i want to hear your thoughts on one part of it because one specific part there's quite a lot

58:35.400 --> 58:40.120
the fact that we can move bits around and have that correspond to value doesn't mean we don't

58:40.120 --> 58:43.800
also still have to move atoms around or that the virtual world doesn't completely depend upon the

58:43.800 --> 58:49.480
physical world and if the virtual world depending upon the physical world is debasing the integrity

58:49.480 --> 58:54.120
of the foundational thing it depends upon there's a problem in that thing um so there's a bunch of

58:54.120 --> 58:59.000
things i have there a problem with it but one in particular we talked about how to have it be less

58:59.000 --> 59:04.680
bloody in the old institutions there was bloody overthrow of feudalism right the american revolutionary

59:04.680 --> 59:10.440
war is one of many there was a thing where the symmetry of power was such that the uprising

59:10.440 --> 59:15.960
army could deal with another army sometimes right within a standing army pitch forks could deal with

59:15.960 --> 59:26.040
swords sometimes um i don't see how the focus of how the old nation state institutional thing falls

59:26.840 --> 59:34.680
works very well with those who hold the nukes because there is no other force that overthrows

59:34.680 --> 59:41.080
that thing unless you talk about ai's i can capture it that's fine um outside of that we can see the

59:41.080 --> 59:45.960
ussr go through a complete economic socioeconomic collapse a collapse of the political economy

59:45.960 --> 59:50.280
and stay a world superpower and turn itself into something else because we got fucking nukes so

59:50.280 --> 59:55.560
back off like it's a so i'm curious how you think about that when you think about the transition

59:56.120 --> 01:00:07.160
of power and uh how hard it is to deal with that particular part of it well the old structure stays

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.680
it doesn't go away you know food was still incredibly important even when capitalism arrived

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.760
it just as food production wasn't the center of the economy any longer it became a marginal

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.520
part of the economy and so the same thing here uh the nukes are perfect cases but so far at least

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:27.720
they're not owned owned by corporate corporations corporations don't have the nukes yet so they're

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.280
stuck with like large nation states hopefully not too many of them too quickly because otherwise

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:38.120
the bomb is more of an acute problem the climate olivism so that served me an existential problem

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.560
right there and and i would say the institutions are still there and what you want to do is you

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.640
want to keep those institutions that says that okay if you those institutions still have the

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.040
problem the nuclear bomb so it's locked up for good and then we can see if we use nuclear energy

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:58.360
something better um in and again that means that let's not give google the bomb you know

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.160
that's that's the problem there whether that could still happen or not we don't know yet

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:11.320
and there's this is where it comes into we know from hegel that triads are stable and we need to

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.720
try it the problem with with digital the problem we call the nectocracy the problem with this new

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.200
sort of this sort of global power lead that rides on digital and happen to be the people

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.600
with the right talents the right motivation to be powerful and influential during digital

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.280
is that it's an entire new paradigm all together and obviously big tech is the first one of the

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:38.200
three nectocracies and it's the first one in the sense that the the the asset here is no longer

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.880
land or capital the asset here is data and because collecting and processing data is so

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.440
fundamentally different from collecting and processing money it requires a whole new set of

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.880
talents the money goes to those who have the data anyway meaning they can concentrate on the data

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.760
and the data processing and that's exactly big tech has done and then taught the rest of world

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:05.880
this is what we do so that is just the first of three necessary uh structures and it represents

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.560
the real in the sense that the data is the real here but that requires also symbolic order and

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.240
imaginary order to complement that and we don't have those yet the chinese have probably called

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.840
you the way they call me they're interested in guys like us at the moment but they have their

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.720
very definite plan what they want to do next which is to create what we called a sonsocracy

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.520
and the chinese idea of the sonsocrates is that increased complexity but also the possibility

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.320
of algorithms to control data flows and have an oversight over the increased complexity

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:44.440
requires at least for china and china's history to have one guy at the top so they go they don't

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.640
go for the persian model which i strongly propose which actually the us constitution was built on

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.080
which is that you install power sharing from day one into the system before the system kicks in

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.920
like in any bazaar you you you make sure that the power is split between three which none can

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.800
dominate the other two because if one dominates the other two will stand up against the third

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.720
therefore you have a split and this is the beauty of the us constitution and what has

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.160
kept the united states together since the 1700s precisely the constitution the constitution itself

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.000
is in an imperial order of persian origin and here's the difference the reason why the persians

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.920
didn't spend their entire fortune building pyramids and finally just killing their whole

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.840
civilization building pyramids was the persians knew dutching from egypt they didn't want that

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.520
they didn't want the pyramid constructions they didn't want the entire culture being obsessed

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.880
but feeding the dead which were the egyptians did right they wanted to feed the living so when

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.760
sorastical structures or asterism one of the trade group religions by the way it's very close to

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:51.800
buddhism and dalism when he did that 1700 before christ he said let's not do animal or human sacrifice

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.400
any longer it's just a waste of resources he was in the logos completely there are no gods

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.240
who pay any attention to sacrificing humans or animals this is ridiculous let's get over it

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.720
let's die when we die and let's transcend ourselves by having children who take over

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.600
the world from us when we die and therefore he enabled the very thought that there could be

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600
civilization this is the first time in human history somebody thinks what a civilization

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.560
could possibly be we could improve on the world everything doesn't have to be an eternal return

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.880
of the same as it is in paganism it is an eternal return of the same the seasons come and go the

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.640
world come and goes people live and die and they breathe and live and die but there can be an event

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.520
that's why our book is called pros and they could be an event and the event can change history forever

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.360
the event can be for good or bad depending on us humans it can be Hiroshima it can also be

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.480
future nuclear power that might save the world with you know affordable and and exploitative

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.800
energy forever you know it could be any of those things it depends on where we put our imagination

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.760
or put our efforts or work that's so raster's insight and therefore he constructs that even

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.200
event is possible and the fact that event is possible is what we take with us the problem

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:09.080
with our culture was that we started believing the event so strongly forgot about the process

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.280
this is the essential problem of western culture if eastern culture got too stuck in the process

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.000
didn't think the event properly then the problem with western culture is that we inherited from

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.960
the persians was the belief in the event that the persians always tied to the process we ignore

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.600
the process altogether and therefore we created religions that says if we exploit the world until

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.880
extinction comes god will come and save us and give us a new Jerusalem that's literally what

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.800
Christianity and Islam have been preaching for thousands of years and that is of course not

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.680
sustainable at all we're now discovering that we need both the process eternal return of the same

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.480
circular time and we need the event which is linear time we need to think the world both ways

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.800
and this is the beauty of power sharing power sharing reinforces that it says that there must

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:59.480
be split power from day one before you put the button on the ai it must understand the power

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.720
must display the chinese don't want that the chinese are terrified of it they go for the

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.880
egyptian model it says no we're just gonna have one fair at the very top and build a huge pyramid

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.920
and off we go and then we know what we're gonna do with the data and increasing and now when data

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.960
solutions become incredibly complex and incredibly expensive the chinese are going to excel at that

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.360
because it's exactly what they're doing at the moment they're creating a modern day egypt the

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.640
question is then can we especially america then create an alternative which is more like the persian

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.520
imperial model and i think building on the u's constitution is the beginning because the logos

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:40.600
the pathos and the mythos the three narratives are split the logos is the congress the pathos is the

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:47.320
precedent and of course the matriarchal bitch at the opening of the bazaar is the supreme court at

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.720
least it should be where the mythos is located so the you you have a narrative here that is balanced

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.000
dialectical it never arrives in one truth because the three different truths that can be spoken at

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.960
any given time depending on which of the three positions you take now we know that for a fact

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:09.720
it's a pragmatic solution to the overall problem of power and the narratives must be there from

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.600
all three angles therefore we must have a system that implements all three so my suggestion that

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.480
whenever you do with ai make sure it splits itself dialectically into these three posts

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.120
before it does anything else whereas the chinese are going for now we've got a one guy at the top

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.040
we're going to marry the aabic cmp and off we go and we have the pharaoh again

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.040
okay if i might ask a question because i was uh listening to this fascinating conversation

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:45.400
and one question arose and maybe daniel you can answer to this because we were talking about

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:51.960
you know conscious design of technologies and you know outcomes that we didn't expect

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:57.880
kind of ways we were talking about you know a third attractor in ecology you know of of new

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:05.640
narratives but at the same time um we know that we are uh storytelling beings you know we can't

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:12.360
really live without narratives and myths and stories except we go maybe in meditation and try to

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:19.640
get rid of that um but then at the same time we also know that events are way more random than

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.560
we think you know so we see that you know in the policies let's say how europe dealt with russia

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.880
nobody could foresee what is happening right now and so the the question really is like if you

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:39.080
have uh our urge to live with narratives and the randomness of future events so the it's it's

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.760
kind of a creator paradox or creator parallax so how do we create a better future and more functional

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:53.000
narratives if we know that the events are way more random than we think and that we can't really

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.840
foresee what kind of uh affects our decisions might have and so that that question is kind of

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:21.240
boggling me sure um it's funny because um a lot of people think about religion in terms of narrative

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.600
and there's probably a distinction that alexander would make between narrative and mythos but um

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.640
roughly i'll just say in terms of narrative and you're talking about the ability to forecast the

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.320
future of a certain kind of certainty about the future um and i i think one of the things

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.760
like religions that smith mixed bag because there was like good philosophy and then political

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.520
power plays that got mixed together because of course memes don't spread for no reason they

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.200
spread because someone's invested in spreading them and they so you you get like good kind of

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.880
gnostic and the scene and whatever thinking but then you get the council and i say i'm making the

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.520
bible and the crusades and they change the stuff to be supportive so like the throw the

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.920
religions out completely or believe them completely they are both silly right you've got a kind of look

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.120
at um which memes are true good and beautiful and which one's one war and coordinated people well

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.960
and the difference between those and um but if i think about the meaningful part of religion a

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.520
big part of it is how do we actually deal with the radical uncertainty of the world

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:32.600
and knowing that uh all the choices we make are going to be consequential not making choices

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.120
is still making a choice is consequential and i'm making every choice under partial information

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.880
and there is some stuff that is quite possibly affecting the situation that exists in the unknown

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:51.320
unknown set i don't even know that i'm not factoring it so how do i make progressively

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:58.440
competent rational decisions while holding the profound amount of uncertainty that we have to

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:04.600
have um so there's like a mature relationship to both certainty and uncertainty or anything

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.680
able to hold those together where you both get way more epistemic humility and way more epistemic

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:19.880
rigor at the same time um okay so that was just one thing so i don't think you get anything like

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.760
perfected prediction and i don't think it's even a good impulse like i don't think it arises from

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.920
a healthy place in people this is why so often when i start conversations with friends like

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.360
what happened earlier today about ethics i end up starting with heisenberg and gordel and tarski

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.400
and like the upper limits of no ability because what it means is i'm not going to get an ethical

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.480
system that's computable um that as gordel said my mathematics can be consistent or complete but

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.720
not both which means bound to incompleteness forever or what heisenberg showed about measurement

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:59.880
which is deeper than science upon which science rests is i get um i get indeterminism forever

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.880
right like a fundamental thing so that doesn't just mean throw up your hands and believe in

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.880
whatever god you want but it does mean that the impulse to certainty is an immature one

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:17.000
and the the unknowable set is larger it's a larger infinity than the knowable set is

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.840
and so like a healthy relationship with unknowability is part of spiritual maturity or cognitive

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:31.160
maturity or emotional maturity or probably all of those um and so then how do we make choices

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:38.440
in the presence of that um i don't want my narrative to tell me how it's all going to go

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:45.560
with high certainty i wanted to like help me orient to how to make good choices in the presence of

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:52.280
the uncertainty as well i think you guys had a conversation with mark uh the rabbi on here not

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.760
that long ago and he said something to me that i think might have been the best formalization of

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.440
ethics i have had ever heard he said that all fears of ethics are feathers of intimacy

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.840
because if you're in real intimate contact with any reality whether it's a tree or a forest or a

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:12.760
person the intimacy of the contact meaning you're you're not modeling them in some trolley problem

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:18.200
way you're actually really in contact with their sentience informs you everything you need to to

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:25.480
not harm it both the motivation and the sentiment the sensocracy in an embodied sense of it um so

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:34.120
the narrative that actually takes us into way more intimacy with the world um uh how we come to

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.520
progressively better knowing but we never think that the knowing is more true than it is which

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.680
becomes a false idol right um these are the things i i want a narrative a good a good religion to do

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.080
but just very pragmatically i think there's a lot of things we say we couldn't possibly predict that

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:59.080
are really fucking predictable and we're we're not trying or we're lying um or we're just applying

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:05.160
silly models there's places where we're applying silly models like engineers not factoring psychosocial

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.920
effects if they're not being trained in social sciences like that's just silly like we should

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.160
just do a better job of that but there are plenty of places where it's like oh we had no idea putin

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.880
and such and such really like nato aggresses on his border in every fucking way possible and he's

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.120
like dude fucking just don't just commit to not take ukraine and tornado and they're like no we're

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.000
not going to do it and they're like how much did we like the cuban missile crisis the idea of

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.560
russian bases that close it's like oh we had no idea who's going to do that really like just

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.160
what would you do in his position play the game theory a little bit so there's a bunch of places

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:44.040
where the unpredictability is bullshit um for things that are actually decently predictable um

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:50.600
and then there are places where it's like okay there's a radically complex thing i don't know

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.440
what's going to happen well that's where you have to do safe to fail probes is there some way

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.080
to be able to run an experiment here that is not consequential depending upon how it goes and if

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.960
there is no safe to fail probe they just don't do the thing yet right um so with a lot of ai and

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:10.760
biotech and i think those are the answers and then a lot of it just has to do with processes of

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:18.760
recursion so let's say i want to forecast how my new technology is going to affect people

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.480
so i think about what are the things this is going to enable that will actually be really

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.920
desirable as a result what behaviors are those people are going to do as a result how does that

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.880
affect their minds and psyches is it there's some super simple principles like if it's engaging their

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.840
attention it should make their attention spend better if it has an effect just there's some base

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.880
reality that it's engaging with it should enhance the base reality it engages with if it has choice

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.120
architectures that are designed to affect the choices people make i affect their intention it

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.000
should support their net intentionality and their sovereignty of local control like there are some

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.440
things like that that should be ubiquitous and they're just not um that could help to even have

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.960
sense making frameworks to think through oh we couldn't have guessed it would have done did you

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.520
even think about what it would do to attention or intention or polarization or anything like that

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.040
so we can just do a better job but there will be still be some stuff you don't predict right

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.200
so then you run an experiment and then you say oh wow i did this shit we didn't know so now you

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:18.680
turn that into the design process then you do a beta release and then you're watching for a bunch

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.800
of stuff including some shit that you don't know right you're watching for some stuff but you're

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.640
also just seeing let's just watch the people using it and the people around them and just see if

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.040
there's any weird new stuff that happens because that's how we deal with the unknown unknowns is that

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:36.280
we don't formalize what metrics too closely we just watch for weird stuff right and we didn't expect

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.760
that there'd be less time at the family dinner table that's worth noting so one of the things is

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:47.080
if i don't even know what to look for just do kind of broader spectrum observation and then say okay

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.400
let's see if we can find out why do some research on it and then internalize that into the design

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.600
and fix it again but that means that when you observe the thing and then you come up with a

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.160
new design whoever comes up with a new design has to have the authority to implement it not just oh

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.720
sorry that goes against our business model and we have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.360
so you have to create a business that has a collect or a corporation or whatever it is that has a

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:17.640
collective intelligence uh i mean excuse me that has a a type of intelligence that is oriented

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.400
to be able to forecast as much as it can and to recursively upgrade itself where mistakes were made

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.760
i think this ties nicely into our idea of the bazaar so there has to be some kind of new container

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.400
here that works and it's an alternative to the sort of the chinese fantasy of the sonocracy

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.440
that's more free and more open and therefore more sustainable more resilient and will last longer

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.680
the argument for the persian empire is not a moral one the argument is that the persian empire

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:53.160
lasted for 2200 years the gypsum empire repeatedly imploded and with a knot and only lasted for six

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.480
years it was over and done with so style then is it doesn't last that's the argument against

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:03.240
our lesson here resilient systems actually are pragmatic and and they realize that splitting

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.320
narrowcase and splitting power from the very beginning makes the system much more resilient

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.400
over time and and therefore it can work in the kind of environments moving into right now

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.680
this is something you said about splitting power and that you program that into the ai and this

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.440
seems extraordinarily problematic because um checks and balances on power yes we like that idea

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:29.880
so one you know as well as i do that ai is not being set up that way and it's moving really

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:39.240
fucking past so there's a reality to tend to here the other thing is that making uh similarly

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.840
powered ai is divided in an adversarial network is how you make both of them crazy fucking smart

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.360
right and so the reason that alpha go was able to defeat stockfish like it was standing still

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
was because you never programmed a single human game in it you made two computers

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.680
play each other a trillion times in three hours and so what that then does is say okay well this

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:07.320
system can check this system vice versa the two of those systems now in a or either of them in

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:14.360
combined capacity is so asymmetric to every human system true but but the the computer is

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.840
still only doing the logos at least i want to believe that so the pathos of the methods are

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.680
two realms left and if at least the computers are interesting in interacting with human beings

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.280
they don't go off into outer space and do their own thing as a technological intelligence

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.400
which probably should lead them to do is basically say you can have Mars on your own right please don't

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:39.400
kill us on earth right or something like that but if you think about at least at least so far

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.480
history has been about human beings and has been a human society we're talking about here

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:48.120
and natural logically speaking the computer cannot do the methods and the computer cannot

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.160
do the pathos it can only do the logos but it does the logos with incredible efficiency

01:19:53.160 --> 01:20:02.600
anything credible you seen have you seen dolly yet yeah the visual gpt3 visual audio gpt3 yeah um

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:10.760
so it's early right but uh will it be able to generate methods that are compelling for people

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.080
at a Turing test passing level totally will it be able to generate art that is evocative enough

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:21.720
that people experience catharsis i.e pathos sure so is it experiencing pathos or methods no

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.680
but can it do a thing that evokes it in fact maybe even split test for its ability to do that

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.880
progressively better on an asymptote sure now this is really fucked up and interesting right

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:37.640
yeah and considering how terrible the latest star wars script is if that was written by humans

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.040
then humans don't deserve to survive to be honest about it you know we need better artists than that

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:50.280
it's just so fucking crap so yeah um i think i think though we're moving to the other we're

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:56.440
moving into the third nautocracy the second one is the sense of cracks or whatever is collaborating

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.400
with the satellites and the data flows around the world to create the container so if you isolate

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.040
the container and think of the container what we usually call politics is separate from say

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:11.800
perverse in business and enterprise which is what we call it indeed so that those two are separated

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:17.160
we have the informational lists or the informationism which is which is essentially data and and

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.200
that's big tech today the second one is in socracy whatever places politics we know it has to be

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.840
sense of critic and if we don't save the planet to begin with since socracy will never even happen

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.680
so the socracy has a self interest in at least saving the planet to begin with the chinese

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.360
other model we need to catch up with them quickly and create a different model that i call more

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.960
personal the third one though is the third nautocracy is the artistic one this is the imaginary one

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:46.360
no this is the real one it's tied to the path so this is the artistic one because art like sex

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:52.760
and violence are actually tied to pathos so this is intensely human this is the intense this is

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.160
where sexuality violence is located this is where we're as far away from the machines themselves

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.400
as possible and this is where the symbiotic intelligence comes in for example if you're

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.600
going to write a really fantastic eight hour series that's going to spell spell by in the world

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.920
what you would do today is that you will collaborate with the ai you will do symbiotic

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.160
intelligence and practices as an artist and i think at the end of the day the machine on its

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.480
own doing it will be vastly inferior to what a human being can do with a machine i think for the

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.480
foreseeable future we're saved by the fact the symbiotic intelligence will be better than artificial

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:28.760
intelligence in all of these three narratives that i'm talking about and if that is the case which

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.320
otherwise why would you must be around you know but if that is the case then the the artistic

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:42.120
aspect is the really protopian one so the protopian it's not so much that in art it's not so much

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:46.360
that you're productive you incremental improve on something one step at a time like you do

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:53.880
for an engineer but protopiness and for an artist is just the the unbound exploration of the darkest

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:58.680
shadows and the most fascinating storytelling we could possibly have and you're telling it to

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.080
grown-ups you're not telling it to children in a fundamental sense like real art is challenging

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.200
you it's challenging you in a transformative way and it has to be the third aspect of an autocracy

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.480
and we will give away the third power to the people who with their machines are capable of doing that

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:18.680
this is where art is heading and i think again our term the unideveloped symbiotic intelligence

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.240
fits better here than artificial intelligence when it comes to doing these things i've wrote pop songs

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.600
for 25 years and i've heard machines writing pop songs and yes they sound generic and professional

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.640
but they sound like german pop songs like they sound like i just copied last week's number one

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.280
record and i make it a new record now we can hear what you copy it it's just too similar to what we

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.160
heard it's eerily boring right and so far at least the machines have not been able to come up with

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:48.920
anything else because machines always work in the past the curse of logos is that logos can only

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.440
work with data that already exists they can only write things that are similar to what we already

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:58.280
have but the idea to imagine a future that's radically different from anything we've ever seen

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:06.680
is still a very very human capacity only because one of the reasons that GPT-3 is passing the

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:15.400
Turing test now is because for many audiences and if you have GPT-3 created text in areas of subject

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.240
matter expertise and subject matter experts are looking at it they know it doesn't pass the Turing

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.920
test but for general chatbot functions it does but it's not because the AI has gotten that good

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:30.200
it's because most people's ability to be able to vet theory of mind or have deep conversation

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:35.480
has gotten so bad that there's like this like it's kind of funny that's like reclaim the quality of

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.280
the Turing tests by increasing human intelligence to be deserving of the term of general intelligence

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:46.120
that we can make the test a little harder the reason i bring it up is because so let's say we

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.960
have a symbiotic intelligence where we have a human using a transformer AI to generate stuff

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:58.920
and people like it well in the classic adversarial network type style i could then train another AI

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.240
on the output of that symbiotic intelligence and whatever the metric of win is pop chart

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.640
hips or whatever that is going to be judged by the demand consumption of by other humans

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.440
i just say beat it and of course now what it's trained to do is be able to identify the things

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.640
to do more of that and so of course it will like it'll be able to beat that if we can define it in

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.120
any narrow metrics because it's the same as beating us at starcraft or chess or go as soon as it can

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:30.440
define it as a finite game i don't think it can win at the infinite game but i also don't think

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.160
most humans are oriented to infinite games right now nor our economic systems or anything else

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.800
and so it's like i think the symbiotic intelligence would produce more meaningful things

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:46.280
if the depth of what it means to be human in the depth of the experience the depth of the pathos

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.520
and the methods that are not the logos is fully brought to both the creation of it and fully brought

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.680
to the appreciation of it by others which is now why this work in in culture and narrative is so

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.240
important because anything less than that if it's if it's consumers who want one marshmallow

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:06.040
hypernormal stimuli and producers who want to supply that know the AI will be the symbiotic

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.160
intelligence yeah and this is this goes for popular culture certainly and we're very dark in

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.480
digital libido so it gets not right that the vast majority of people will be sedated by popular

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.960
cultures probably manufactured machines because it's more efficient to do it that way but there

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.960
was something eerie about it the thing is that you might be fooled once but you're not fooled

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:29.640
several times over until you discover this eerie feeling that this is increasingly predictable

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:35.160
and it's increasingly flattering like the culture's fighting and this is the problem of popular

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.760
culture it might work for kids stories it might work for disney right but that's not art at all

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.840
and i think this is why we so strongly philosophically defend the concept of art

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.440
and we put that put it in the pathical narrative the mythical narrative yes can be mass produced

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.600
they can be manufactured by technological intelligence it's just you put the button on

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.160
the and it produces disney culture that's exactly the new star wars series that's why it's crap

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.800
because the script is so bad it's so predictably bad right because it just tries to flatter you

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:09.080
tries to fly it doesn't it doesn't challenge you it's not going to transform you at all real art

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.960
therefore has to be located next to sex and violence and we call the tantric realm in the

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.480
really grown up adult realm it challenges you fiercely otherwise it isn't art at all and it

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:25.800
challenged you to transform you the truly artistic experience is not just to kill time that's what

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.680
silicon valley and hollywood are trying to do they just try to kill time no real art is that you go

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.240
through transformative experience like a spiritual experience that transforms you you're a totally

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.160
different person when you come out of experience compared to who you were before in either direction

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:45.400
doesn't matter you changed you have gone through an event your life is no longer the repetition of

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:51.400
the same i don't see any machine being able to do anything remotely like that yet that's why art has

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:57.720
to get out of popular culture return to its own realm and go spiritual and that's why we put art

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.800
in the pathical narrative that's what's important in their ecology mythical narrative can be mass

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.000
produced yes that's popular culture but pathical narrative is an entirely different thing and i

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.880
would know because i was in the mythical narrative production when i was a pop song writer and pop song

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:18.440
producer i never tried to do jazz or opera i went to the opera and i enjoyed jazz because i didn't do it

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.160
i didn't do anything pathical i did mythical things but to then go into the pathical narrative

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.680
where i tried to be as a philosopher is fiendishly more challenging but it's absolutely required

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.440
and this is probably of all the three narratives the hardest one to nail because at the end of the

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:40.760
day we now live in the world where death is the absolute i am adamant i'm with a lot of thinkers

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:45.800
today to say that the problem with the west is that we banned everything that was out of our comfort

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:51.720
zone and we basically called it sin and at least in the east they realized that no sin is not going

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.560
to disappear so instead of creating pressure cookers that blow over all the time and cause

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:01.800
huge warfare and misery instead it's better to have it around but to have it around inside a container

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.560
and only those who can handle it can go there and handle that container they're the ones who

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:12.360
can have access to it that's the concept of tantra this is interesting sutra is the message the

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.040
narrative that makes people love their children so they want to survive that is the ultimate truth

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:23.240
of sutra sutra has a direction must be exactly that the opposite of the sutra is the tantra it's like

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.400
okay we don't know where this is going therefore we're containing it we're keeping it in some kind

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.440
of a laboratory and we can only access by people who can really go through it and that's where sex

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.560
and art and violence must be located that we must realize that these are factors of human life

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.400
and that's what we're working with as philosophers at the moment so i think it's important here to

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.840
make that distinction i don't see any machine even being remotely close to creating a credible

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:53.320
pathological narrative in the foreseeable future it's funny that you say that the elites now believe

01:29:53.320 --> 01:30:03.720
in death because in so many important ways i don't see that like the extreme life extension

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:09.080
movement radical life extension movement for radical biological extension is totally a holy

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:14.280
grail pursuit and then the biggest one of course and and the brain computer interface

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:20.840
pursued all the way up to the full digital consciousness singletarian we can all be

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.680
ai gods in a universe that we can fork infinitely remember how i told you daniel that engineers

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.720
don't know what they're doing because the engineers haven't talked to the priests this is the perfect

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.480
example to give exactly that they're going to create things that are not at all what they thought

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:40.200
they're going to create and so and whatever they're all going to be disappointed when they're dying

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.240
finally learn to die with some fucking grace and i think but i think the death escape has arrived

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.240
it has existed all along buddhist thoracists and Taoists always knew they would die when they die

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.480
and the question is what transcends you they always had that question that question around for

01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.200
thousands of years we just need to get rid of these childish religious that promises the afterlife

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.760
of the reincarnation because it was too hard to tell children that their parents had died right

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.160
it's just it's just death as the absolute has arrived i think it's a dominant story today

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.320
and i think these people who try to escape try to escape precisely because they find it hard to die

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:19.720
one of the things i really like about the invisible afterlife um i like the reincarnation

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:26.760
version better than heaven and hell version but i like that you can get narcissistic and even

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:33.080
sadistic people to do the right things for the wrong reasons um meaning if i don't want to reincarnate

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:42.360
badly and i can't hide the karma from god or from uh universal accounting system then even though

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.880
if i could hide it from the humans i'd fuck everybody over and get ahead and if death was

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:49.800
the end that'd be fine the fact that i can't hide it from the day of judgment or whatever it is

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:55.080
means now i have to do the right thing for my own prevention of suffering i think that was actually

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:59.640
brilliant and i think there were places where that obviously didn't work all that well in many

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:09.960
places but there were places where it did um how you create a system where even if someone uh if

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:20.520
someone's focus of self is too personal right too much narcissistic trait not enough empathy etc

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:25.800
they still are oriented to a system of ethics i think that's one of the things the system has

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.880
to do as a failsafe while it works to condition people who all have authentic intimacy where

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:36.200
emergent ethics can arise um i know it is time for us to wrap up and it's late one thing i was

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:41.960
going to say we should do next time that would be fun we opened a lot more threads and we closed

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:50.440
but that's good you started talking about um uh what ai won't get and will get in the future and

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:57.880
what the three different types of uh natocracies will be and i i think if we were to just kind of

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:04.760
give a vision like what is a positive vision for the not too distant future like you know 50 years

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:11.720
out or so that we can see that involves uh getting mythos pathos logos all meaningfully better right

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:16.680
that my terms might be getting some of the critical things that have to happen in infrastructure and

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.640
social structure and superstructure whatever um what is a vision that could happen that would be

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:28.040
a fun that'd be a fun place to go i totally agree uh so i just want to add that we also need a new

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.240
sutra a new story about how we're going to love our children therefore we want our children to

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.880
survive we need a new one so we can't go back to the old ones and and when it comes to the

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.080
belief in the afterlife that also ruined ancient egypt that's why ever since then we sort of suspected

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.920
that we will not live after we're dead so the afterlife was a very very destructive thought

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:52.440
in that sense when it was taken all the way through the ancient egyptians at least in the

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.160
first kingdom seriously believed that life after death was more important than life right here and

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:03.560
now ever since then well at least we've doubted it so uh i think those those i think once the gene

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.440
is out of the bottle historically in this sense that a certain tantra is now leaked into the sutra

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.840
and we can no longer pretend it's not there that's what i mean we cannot construct the system of

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.600
believing the afterlife we believe in reincarnation and longer we cannot even believe that we're

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.120
going to conquer outer space and live another planet because we're way too late to that race

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.520
ai will certainly beat us to it so ai will take bacteria away and go to other planets and we

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.080
won't even be part of the game that's more likely so we can look into that we can look into what

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.680
could possibly the new sutra be what could be the new story we could actually tell each other and

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:38.680
agree on and then at least the tantra itself we know it's around but it's hidden in containers

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:43.080
for the people who can actually absorb it and understand it and thankfully because it's tantra

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:49.320
so tied to complexity that we can only specialize on certain complexities like you and i honorably

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:54.200
do we're supposed to be generalists but nobody can be a generalist any longer that's impossible

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.760
we can only understand that that's impossible therefore we're more hegellian in the sense that

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:03.160
our absolute knowing is not that we know everything is that we know the limits of our own

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:08.360
knowledge and we thrive within that limit and that's exactly what we're promoting very pragmatic

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.400
ideas constantly we will learn from history like and it's moving quicker than ever it's more

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.440
important than ever to be pragmatic about history and to make due process before we make decisions

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.600
and start building things that's where you're an absolute the adamant anything else is completely

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:29.000
responsible from now on historically speaking so i would love to be more into that yes absolutely

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:35.080
all right this is fun alexander daniel thank you so much for taking the time i think it's

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:41.000
very late at your end daniel what is it two o'clock in the morning already yes thank you again

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.960
fascinating conversation i would love to do a second part where we have a look at the future

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:53.640
in 50 years it sounds super interesting um yeah thank you guys thank you tom for making the space

01:35:53.640 --> 01:36:00.600
and having us here and uh and alex for uh having the dialogue i it's funny because you and i think

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:08.200
about things that are so related and i think both try to um bring deep frameworks and they're such

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.960
different frameworks it was like such different schools of study that um uh i really enjoy it

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.920
because i get different insights and learn every time we talk thank you so much i'm on i'm over here

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:24.200
in europe and we have hegel and itcha you have the fantastic american pragmatists and our shared

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.320
friends layman pascal and saxstein are big fans of pers and james and these guys that is the other

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:34.680
tradition that i really really really think is fantastic and for anybody's interest in philosophy

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.760
you need to do your hegel and your nature and certainly your pho like you certainly need to do

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.640
the american pragmatist so that's the tradition you come from and i hear it in the way you speak

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.400
and the way you address issues that there's so much of american pragmatism coming through to you

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:52.520
and i should say this last thing i'm off to the borderland next week which is northern europe's

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.000
burning man so of course another thing that dad and i've been coming with both good old burners

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:02.920
we'll have a blast there i have some friends that are going to be going there and maybe i'll

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.040
connect you all and you can meet up there exactly speaking speaking of the pathical narrative

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.960
participatory culture is where it's at
