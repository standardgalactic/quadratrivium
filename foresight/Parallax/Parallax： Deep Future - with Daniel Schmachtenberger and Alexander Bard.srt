00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All right. Welcome to Parallax. I'm your host, Thomas Mark. With me today are Daniel Schmachtenberger

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,840
and Alexander Bart. Daniel Schmachtenberger is a social philosopher and founding member

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,760
of the Concilions Project aimed at providing public sense making and improving public sense

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,280
making and dialogue. Alexander Bart is amongst many other things, the philosopher, author

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,360
and futurologist. I'm very happy to bring you both together for the first time. So welcome

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:42,960
both of you. The goal and the idea of this conversation isn't short to kind of generate

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,080
a snapshot of where we are 2022, ideologically, politically, economically and technologically,

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,080
and where we are headed to the end of the decade. So where are we now in this time between

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,880
worlds and what are the possible and probable outcomes of our current trajectories? We are

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,240
facing a crisis while at the same time our institutions do not seem to fit or able to

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,800
solve these problems. It appears that the climate crisis unfolding right now and the

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,920
war is brewing, the cultural divide and the western hemisphere, the culture war is getting

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,200
more intense. And at the same time our myths and narratives don't work anymore. The postmodern

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,320
policies of deconstructions have for better or worse negated our way of reducing complexity.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,040
So where are we now? Is the west going to fall as Oswald Sprengler once put it? Is the

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,080
chaos going to increase till we find a new way of life? Or is it as it ever was, men

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,480
struggling to find meaning in a complex world? Can digital providers with the means to reconstruct

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,200
the myth and narrative? And maybe more on the point, at what point does it become wiser

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
to acknowledge that it's too late to stop anything and turn our efforts to surviving

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,840
it? So Daniel, if you had to start to paint this broad painting, where we are right now,

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,760
where are we now when you were to take up a systemic bird's-eye view of things?

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:25,640
I tried to paint a brief, hopefully useful starting place picture. You were saying, you

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,200
know, we're in a global crisis and you gave a few examples. I often use a term metacrisis

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,000
that is not just looking at the fact that we have climate change and biodiversity loss

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,480
and extinction of species in dead zones and oceans and topsoil loss and all those environmental

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,800
issues, or that we have increasing fragility in supply chains or the problem of exponential

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,160
growth on the financial system and linear materials economy, hitting fragility on planetary

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,760
boundaries, or the AI risk, bio risk, cyber risk issues that new exponential technologies

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,360
create, like all of these are possibly catastrophic risks. And we're in this interesting situation

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
where the total number of catastrophic risks is increasing and the probability of them is

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,000
increasing. And so rather than just see each of those as different separate ones, there are

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,360
certain underlying drivers that we can look at that they had in common. Talk about the

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,840
generator functions of catastrophic risk. And so we would say that we are at a unique point in

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,560
history, something where Alexander and I definitely agree is that it's not just processes of the

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,280
same thing always under the sun. Being able to extinct species at scale and genetically

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,240
engineered new species and synthetic biology is a different thing than was true 2000 or 20,000

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:51,760
years ago. And so the first truly existential tech we had in terms of technology enough that we

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,720
could make choices that damage the habitability of the world was the nuclear bomb. And that was so

39
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,000
recent in historical time, we built an entire world system to prevent using tech, that tech,

40
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,440
and we had never done that before. Every tech we had, we always made an arms race to use as

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,640
fast as we could. Now we built a whole world system that involved mutually assured destruction and

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,560
the Bretton Woods monetary system and the UN IGO systems to ensure not doing that. While that

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,280
succeeded in a way, it also drove all the catastrophic risks we're facing now and to more

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,280
likely like let's have a monetary system that increases exponential GDP so everybody can have

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
more without taking each other's stuff on linear supply chains that externalize cost to the

46
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,440
environment pushing all the planetary boundary issues. And you can make mutually assured

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
destruction on two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon, but you can't on lots and

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
lots of non state actors all having access to different kinds of catastrophe weapons. So how

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,280
do you deal with that? So we're in a situation where the post World War Two world is over,

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,760
there's a lot more catastrophic risks. And those types of solutions don't work and we need new

51
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,200
ones. What we'd say is that there's, so like whether we're talking about the risk from a

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,240
particular kind of AI or bio or nuclear or climate change refugees leading to nuclear or

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,760
whatever it is, there's the increasing catastrophe attractor, right? There's like an

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,120
attractive basin defined by we can't manage our power well coordination failures creating

55
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,720
increasing catastrophes. There's a thousand scenarios, but they're all kind of the catastrophe

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,320
attractor. Then there's this other tractor that says, in order to manage those, we must be able

57
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,880
to monitor and control adequately. And that looks like pretty powerful centralized control

58
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,200
mechanisms, which mostly turn pretty dystopic. So we can make sure that nobody builds catastrophe

59
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,760
weapons in their basement using tabletop crisper. If we have ubiquitous surveillance and extremely

60
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,040
powerful control mechanisms, then that becomes pretty dystopic. So there's like catastrophes and

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,160
dystopias as these two different attractors and exponential tech makes both more likely, you

62
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,680
can run much more powerful top down systems using AI and IoT. You can also create a lot worse

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,000
catastrophic dynamics with exponential tech. So we want a third attractor that is neither dystopic

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,960
nor catastrophic. And that means that it has to have the capacity to check all of the power that

65
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,160
could cause catastrophe on purpose or accident, but where that system that checks it must also have

66
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:25,200
checks and balances and be oriented in a life that is somehow desirable. And so how do we make it

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,360
through the metacrisis means make it through the catastrophes and the dystopias to some kind of

68
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,920
third attractor? What are the criteria of that attractor? That would be a fine starting point of

69
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:45,560
kind of where I see that we're at in the arc of history. And that the quote in the book of Roman

70
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,160
something like the path to hell is wide and many of the path to heaven is narrow and steep. It's

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
easy to come up with dystopian sci-fi because humans have been pretty nasty stewards of power

72
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,120
historically and the idea of us having decentralized exponential power like there's just a lot of bad

73
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,880
scenarios. The idea of exponential power AI and genetic engineering and whatever, going well with

74
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,280
people like us running it requires some pretty significantly new thought. And so how do we come

75
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,480
up with a positive future narrative that is not a naive silly one? I think this is the topic would

76
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,000
be fun to have us explore today. That's my kind of initial frame.

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,760
I can then add to that that the reason why I got really interested in Daniel's brain a few years

78
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,840
ago was that I was very alone being a philosopher of technology for quite a long time. And it was

79
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,320
really required. Obviously, we live in the middle of a technological revolution. Here was a guy who

80
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,560
was even more a philosopher of technology than I was, which is great. So it's kind of shocking that

81
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,200
this is actually probably the first recording of conversation between us because we've been friends

82
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,920
for many years now and I highly respect Daniel's work. And I'm very excited about this conversation.

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,080
So I just want to say that first. What I add to this is that I'm a narratologist. Well, here's a

84
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,880
new word, right? Please recall that the 20th century was mostly used for deconstruction. You

85
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,680
know, after the atomic bomb, August the 6th, 1945, the most important date in recent history for all

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,240
of us on the planet. I agree completely here with Daniel. Let's use that date. There's a certain date

87
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,160
there, August 6th, 1945. It helps us to locate ourselves historically. And after that date,

88
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,600
deconstruction became the natural norm. It's just like we have to deconstruct all of history. We

89
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,720
only begun that process. We have to deconstruct Western history of the world right now. That's

90
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,000
happening. We have people over the world who realize that there's a myth about Asia that is

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,600
completely incorrect. There's a myth about Africa that's completely incorrect. And also America

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,760
is finally shifting. America is not European any longer. America is now the meeting place of the

93
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,240
world populated by people from all over the world. And America needs just a new standard

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,360
language of the world that we all use to communicate. So even America is shifting in the

95
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,200
sense that America is becoming truly a global meeting place today. And that's what's really

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,280
interesting here. So I do narratology. Narratology is more than deconstruction. It's also

97
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:23,320
reconstruction. It's basically the philosophical search for the narratives that human beings tell

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,600
about themselves. We are storytelling animals. We're storytelling flock animals. So we tell

99
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,240
stories about ourselves all the time. And fundamentally, these stories have to be split

100
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,440
into three different types of stories. So let me follow you into this one. The first one is

101
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,320
precisely the one we're down here as an expert. It's what we call the logos. This is how reality

102
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,640
actually operates and how we symbolically try to understand how the world operates. For example,

103
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,840
mathematics, you know, when language tries to be exact, that's when we go into the logos.

104
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,400
The second one is pathos. You know, every time somebody tells you do it once more,

105
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,960
we would feeling like add the pathos, please, you're a human being, right? You're not a machine,

106
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,200
you do, you do, you need to add the pathos to what you do. So pathos is the storytelling

107
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,400
that's usually banned, banned from children's use. Just like I said that pornography, violence,

108
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,000
all of that is located in the pathos. And the third one is the mythos. And the mythos is the

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,560
only way for the other two to be combined. So our predicament as both Hegel and Nietzsche pointed

110
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,160
out in the 19th century is that the only way for us to have some kind of narrative that we can share

111
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,080
is to create a mythos. Not myth, but a mythos here. So these are the three basic stories and

112
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,680
they are dialectically intertwined. You cannot focus on one of them rather than the other one.

113
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,640
And then if you look at power and domination, it goes to say that power and domination goes

114
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,480
into these three realms. So the logos is the symbolic order and the symbolic, it's more of

115
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,960
the masculine side of things, if you allow us to say that, but it's more of the masculine side of

116
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,360
things. And the logos, how the world actually operates, zeros and ones today, more than anything

117
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,640
is the logos. And then that is logos is presented as knowledge, the power through knowledge,

118
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,680
whoever has access to knowledge today would say data and data processing, whoever has control

119
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,560
over the knowledge or dominates in the knowledge field has enormous power and influence. And that's

120
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,000
of course, we need to start today. The other one is violence itself, who has the monocular violence

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,960
of a specific territory, that state turn things like that. And that is the pathos. So that's

122
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,920
the second realm. And the pathos we call the real order, the real order of things. So ultimately,

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,840
the physical world out there, if you walk straight into a wall and hit your head,

124
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,720
you just encounter the pathical world out there. We can fantasize all we like and we human beings

125
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,640
fantasize individually and collectively all the time. But at the end of the day, our fantasies

126
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,600
will be crushed and they will be crushed by what's called the pathos. So that's the second realm,

127
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,920
the real one. The third one, the only one that can unite the other two is the imaginary order.

128
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,240
Imaginary order is tied to the mythos. So we imagine the world. And this way it gets important.

129
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,720
We have to have an imaginary that makes sense to us. We have to have a shared imagine if you're

130
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,680
going to share your society. And that's where the crisis at. So what's happening right now,

131
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,040
our proposal is that this is a paradigm shift in the sense that we're moving into the online world

132
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,200
and the internet is taking over the world. And we're globalized because the internet itself

133
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,760
goes towards globalization, whereas we human beings are very local in our attitude towards the world.

134
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,760
So this does a paradigm shift. Why there's a metacrisis tied to the paradigm shift

135
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,080
is that all these three narratives are in crisis at the same time. Daniel is the perfect guy in

136
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,760
the world right now to list the reason why logos is in crisis. That's exactly what he's talking about.

137
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,760
After 1945, we discovered that we're exploiting the world towards our own extinction. And that's

138
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,080
not a small thing to say. That's exactly what we're doing. We could blow ourselves up with the

139
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,320
bomb. We could also blow ourselves up in many other ways to just take more time. That's what

140
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,160
the logos crisis at. The problem is the other two aspects are in crisis too. The pathos,

141
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,160
the pathos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis. The mythos is in crisis in a very particular way.

142
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,920
It's a crisis in the religious or the spiritual and therefore also political manner. Death has

143
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,320
become the absolute. We now have an elite in the world today who believe they really will die when

144
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,880
they die. That has never happened before in history. We have always excused ourselves

145
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,320
with an afterlife or at least with a reincarnation. The reincarnation of the east of the afterlife of

146
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,600
the west. We have always had those myths before. Now we can no longer have a myth and therefore we

147
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,280
cannot have a myth that it's utopian or dystopian either. We have to accept that we die when we die

148
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,600
and the only thing that can transcend us is children who inherit the earth after we're gone.

149
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,720
We're into that mode now. We have an elite in the world that have come to accept that

150
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,360
and they're dealing with it massively and it's not a small thing at all when it's dealt with

151
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,520
collectively. This is like Nietzsche's The Last Man. That's where we're located right now. So there's

152
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,920
a crisis in the mythos too. There's a crisis in storytelling. We can deconstruct as much as we

153
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,640
like but if we don't reconstruct something valuable to us and have a new story, we're done.

154
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,520
And the third one is the crisis in the pathos. This is the crisis of violence. This is the

155
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,560
crisis of sexuality but this is also the crisis of nature itself that's now catching up with us.

156
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,480
This is the crisis of the bomb. It's literally physical. This is the crisis of the climate.

157
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,360
It's literally physical. Therefore, there's a crisis in the pathos too. So all the three

158
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,240
different narratives are in crisis. All the three different narratives simultaneously have to be

159
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,880
retold as a new shared narratology that makes sense to us. That's why there's a mental crisis.

160
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:54,760
May I ask you to just clarify a bit for what has to happen in logos, in pathos, and mythos?

161
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,480
Like is there something like what you would think of as necessary and sufficient criteria of the

162
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,800
new logos, the new mythos, and the new pathos that converges towards the third attractor?

163
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,040
Yeah, absolutely. The third attractor we call protopianism and I think it was Kelly Over at

164
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,960
Wired who invented the term or maybe it's been around because it sounds a bit generic. But

165
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,960
protopianism, when I came to East Asia and you travel there too down in a lot, like when I talk

166
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,960
to the Japanese, the Korean, and the Chinese, it doesn't make sense to say anything today that

167
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,960
they don't get or they don't subscribe to. And it certainly makes a lot of sense to listen to them

168
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,120
and their history, because we share a world with them now. Protopianism makes sense to anybody in

169
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,280
East Asia. The utopian dystopian dichotomy was always Western and we got it from Abrahamic

170
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,920
religion. It doesn't make sense in India, it doesn't make sense in China or Japan, but the

171
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,600
protopian perspective which is the incremental improvement and work towards optimization or

172
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,680
processes makes sense. That makes sense globally. So I would start with saying that all these

173
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,360
different narratives now have to be protopian. We need to get rid of the utopian, the drive towards

174
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
the utopian and the dystopian, which is what you call the third attractor, which I think is brilliant.

175
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,640
The third attractor is now required because it's the only credible global narrative we can have.

176
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,240
And it goes for both the logos and the mythos and the pathos. They all have to be protopian.

177
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,560
And you and I in one of our little night sessions over in California came up with the term that I

178
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,120
love called symbiotic intelligence. AI is what the machines will do, but as long as we human

179
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,440
beings are involved in a collaboration with the machines, I think it makes more sense to speak

180
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,760
of an SI. An SI is an AI ultimately controlled by humans serving our interests, but that takes a lot

181
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,800
of maturity from us as well to work with the symbiotic intelligence. But symbiotic intelligence

182
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,000
is an intelligence that works towards optimization or process at all times. And of course,

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,280
this is not an optimization of a process that's ultimately exploitative.

184
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,760
That's what we use to term exploitation in our work all the time. We talk about resilience,

185
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,440
sustainability, these things. The exploitative aspect has to be implemented within a protopian

186
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,120
process, meaning that you have to give back what you just used. In that sense, you cannot exploit

187
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,800
the world any longer because it's the end of the story. To employative means closed loop or real

188
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,880
closed. Exactly. Employative is opposite to exploitative. So it's easy to understand. It's

189
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,800
the opposite of that. We used the word for the past 20 years. And what's important here is that

190
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,680
protopian ideals, meaning that if you're an artist, you go protopian. If you're an engineer, you go

191
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,800
protopian. If you start a company, you should have a protopian company from day one. So the way to

192
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,120
make incremental improvements on the world through your work, which is how you do technology,

193
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,720
essentially. Once we've created the technology, it's there. And technology in itself is a pharma

194
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:53,000
con. It can be good or bad. It can be Hiroshima. It can also be fusion. A pharma con. A pharma con

195
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,960
means that a technology in itself is neutral. It depends on what we human beings deal with it.

196
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,400
And in this sense, of course, atomic power is the perfect sample of a pharma con.

197
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,120
So that's what technology itself should be neutral to us. And then we ask ourselves the

198
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,320
question, how do we use that technology to the benefit of mankind longer?

199
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:21,480
It was actually a funny point of intersection. And I wish that my schedule over the last week

200
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,200
had been different. And I've got to read more of your recent work and share some things with you.

201
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,680
We actually just published a paper with a conciliance project called Tech Is Not Values Neutral

202
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,800
like a few days ago. So it's just funny to come to this point. It's maybe an interesting

203
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,080
topic for us to discuss because it doesn't map to the logos, pathos, mythos perfectly,

204
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,440
but the infrastructure, social structure, superstructure way of looking at the domains

205
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,960
of civilization and the fact that psyches and cultures are directly affected by tech.

206
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,240
And it's not just what values we bring to it determines if it has a good or bad use. It's that

207
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,960
every technology is an extension of human choice making. It catches on because it confers power.

208
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,320
And thus whoever uses it and gets more power usually ends up driving the beginning of a

209
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,600
new arms race of some type that obligates other people to use it. That codes a pattern of human

210
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,920
behavior to use the tech as opposed to not coding that pattern of human behavior affects human

211
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,240
psyches, value systems, belief systems, everything. And then the distribution of that affects

212
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,200
cultures and societies. So we call this psychosocial externalities rather than physical

213
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,320
externalities. And so physical externalities, we know the pollution and the harm in the supply

214
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,320
chain and whatever that occurs. So we have to go physically closed loop, meaning we're not using

215
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,400
unrenewable physical resources or turning them into trash or pollution. We have to go psychosocial

216
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,760
closed loop too. And it's not going to be closed loop in the same way, but it does mean forecast

217
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,040
the psychosocial effects and internalize them into the design process. Because obviously

218
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,960
something like the nature of the algorithm that optimizes for engagement, which in

219
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,840
optimizes for outrage, which ends up polarizing a society or shortening attention spans like

220
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,760
these are very real effects on psyches and society. So it's not fair to say tech is values

221
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,680
neutral. Tech was built to advance certain values like ease and brevity and comfort and

222
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,480
whatever, it advances those that affects other values and it does so at scale. And so if you

223
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,120
don't actually think about what are the values that are worth valuing? And how do we build tech

224
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,320
that enhances those? Then because the tech is so powerful, it will end up damaging them. And so

225
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,440
you actually can't think about the evolution of culture independently from the techplex that

226
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,320
ends up determining what wins behaviorally. I agree. So the point here is that engineers

227
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,200
have no clue what they're doing historically. So like if you would have asked Gutenberg about

228
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,360
the printing press in 1415, it was quite an event where the printing press arrived. I mean,

229
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,760
they started printing Bibles quite quickly to start with. And that was his point. The point

230
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,760
was that you should translate the Bible to local dialects around Europe so that Europeans could

231
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,080
read the Bible and become all the good Catholics that he wanted them to be. Actually, he created

232
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,120
the end of the Catholic Church. It's been growing gradually, but the whole question of the Catholic

233
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,440
Church, and now it's just basically diminishing into nothing, started with Gutenberg. He was the

234
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,840
killer of the Catholic Church. He just didn't know. So the problem is that engineers are usually

235
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,920
historically speaking very unaware. So I just want to remove the guilt applied to them afterwards,

236
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,920
like you don't even know what people do with you. I mean, Nietzsche couldn't know that Hitler would

237
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,400
come along and Marx couldn't know that Stalin would come along. You can't blame people afterwards

238
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,440
what people later are doing in the sense that we usually do. So my point is this, though, that

239
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,360
there's a social responsibility for creating an environment where technology is created in the

240
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,720
first place. The one thing we have learned is that we hardly change at all. Human beings are

241
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,480
basically the same worthy five or 10,000 years ago in the very short span of the created civilization.

242
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,600
What we do create is technology. The way I frame it is that I said, women give birth to children.

243
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,760
Men envy women for giving birth to children. Men therefore give birth to technology.

244
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,120
The problem is that if technology develops quicker than children do, which tends to do,

245
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,920
it's only a question of time before technology kills the child unless you intervene. So that's

246
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,000
essentially the history of civilization in five sentences in a very Freudian sense. So my point

247
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,720
being calling technology value neutral is, of course, nothing is value neutral in the formal

248
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,240
sense, but it is to point out that technologies are pharmaconic, usually by historical necessity,

249
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,760
and then we can look at them. Today we know more, and today the loops of technological innovation

250
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:01,000
are so tight and involve so many people that the pathos of the mythos are obviously now involved

251
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,960
in the loop of the logos itself. We are really beginning to look at the word dialectically.

252
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,200
We're really beginning to look at the word. These three narratives are now colliding one

253
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,400
another. We cannot trust any one of them because as human beings we have to operate all three,

254
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,760
and we have to reform all three at the same time, which is exactly why this is a meta crisis to solve.

255
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,120
Yeah, we have to do all three at the same time, you and I totally agree on. We're not looking at a

256
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,640
theory of change. We're looking at an ecosystem of theories of change, an ecosystem of projects that

257
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,240
have a pro-topic direction to them, have a third attractor, attractive basin to them, and the desire

258
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:48,040
for what is the comprehensive solution set or roadmap for humanity is based on the fallacy

259
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,760
that a centralizing intelligence could do that thing. I think we think very much the same way

260
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,760
about that. It's interesting. I want to try to tie a couple things together that you said.

261
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,720
We're mentioning that Marx can't really be blamed first all and then etc. because people can't really

262
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,880
forecast what's going to happen afterwards. Einstein and the Baum, great example. I think it's true that

263
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,080
I was talking with a friend the other day about all of the hopeful projects that were going to make

264
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,600
the world better that didn't happen that he was kind of traumatized by and where their hope in how

265
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,440
good they would be was false. And I said, yeah, but you also need to equally factor all of the

266
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,360
devastatingly bad things that people forecasted during that time that didn't happen as well,

267
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,440
that the Cuban Missile Crisis didn't become World War III and Y2K didn't in the world and 2012 didn't

268
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,680
and on and on. And that if you factor them both, people just suck at forecasting the future because

269
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,040
it makes sense that we would. We can't get the weather right 10 days out like

270
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,720
multiply embedded complex systems are hard, we're just not going to do that.

271
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,880
So we have to get recursive intelligence processes that can do a little bit and increase the

272
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,160
collective intelligence that can keep doing that. That said, I think there are some things we can do

273
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,600
to forecast externalities much, much, much better than we ever have that are kind of low hanging

274
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,560
and it's really worthwhile. And so one thing as you're mentioning that the engineers, I mean,

275
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,840
I think the engineers have been profoundly competent in the domain that they were trained,

276
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,080
but as soon as you understand that technology codes patterns of behavior that end up coding

277
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,880
minds that then in mass code societies, of course, technologies have to be trained in social sciences

278
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:37,400
and axiological design, what are the value sets that will emerge from the use of these technologies

279
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,760
has to be a consideration doesn't mean you'll get it all right, but we need to work at it and then

280
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,440
recursively work at it and improve the process as we go. So I think when you have bigger frameworks

281
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,400
like that are superstructure and our collective definition of the good life and values, whatever

282
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,040
our social structure or economics governance law and agreement fields and our infrastructure or

283
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,000
techplex co influence each other so that you don't try to do sense making within what you do

284
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,720
sense making across them. Just basic shit like that really helps, right? It really helps the

285
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,200
forecasting. But one other thing I wanted to say is there's a very interesting thing right now where

286
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,760
the arguments that we can't possibly forecast the future well enough ends up being a source of plausible

287
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,320
deniability for people not even trying where it's in their vested interest not to. And the less

288
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,520
wrong community had this blog post on is it mistake theory or conflict theory that's a very

289
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,280
deal meaning the mistake theory or the problem is the result of shit we just couldn't have possibly

290
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,360
known and the externalities are too complex or is it conflict theory meaning we actually wanted

291
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,520
to cause that problem or we wanted to benefit and we didn't really care if we caused that problem.

292
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,680
And of course it's some of both. But some of the argument in there is Michael Vassar and others

293
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,640
commented is that the existence of the possibility of mistake theory serves as a plausible

294
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,040
deniability cover for a bunch of conflict theory to hide itself and say oh we couldn't have possibly

295
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,680
known. Oh bullshit you didn't try because it wasn't in your interest. Yeah I'm just thinking of like

296
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,320
Instagram wouldn't they have known that they would cause like a massive psychiatric health

297
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,680
crisis among teenage girls. It was quite obvious. You and I pointed that out from the very beginning

298
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,520
like just like they couldn't know but they didn't want to hear it right because they were

299
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,000
there was telling everybody at the time Facebook was starting or whatever it's going to do these

300
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,120
things they're like shut up hippie and no it's not there's no possible way but of course the

301
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,800
motivated reasoning is a problem right. Motivated reasoning is tricky. So here's the piece that I

302
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,080
wanted to add which is there's a very perverse piece of kind of game theory at a consentive here

303
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,720
that has to be bound which is that it is very disadvantageous and a market type dynamic for

304
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,320
any individual or group to focus on what the possible risks might be and it's very of the

305
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,000
thing that they would develop and it's very advantageous to just focus on the opportunities

306
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,920
and benefits because if I do protracted risk assessment somebody else hits first mover advantage

307
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,720
faster and if my protracted risk assessment says actually the field is too dangerous we

308
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,920
shouldn't do it it's not going to stop the fucking thing the market is going to move

309
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,480
the people who move fastest will privatize the benefits and then socialize the losses

310
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,360
and so there's a focus to move fast break things socialize the losses nobody takes responsibility

311
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,040
that perverse game theory keeps people from even trying to think well and when the worst

312
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,000
harm you could do was add lead to gasoline which was pretty fucking bad right it it decreased

313
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,480
the IQ of the planet by like a billion points and made people four times more violent it's like

314
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,120
Jesus Christ that's a huge deal when you say humans have been about the same for 5000 years I'm

315
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,840
like no man fucking just let it gasoline alone made us a billion IQ points stupider and four times

316
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,080
more violent like that's a big deal and that was one of 50 million chemicals in the in the chemical

317
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,760
database that it made but but when it comes to synthetic biology and general artificial intelligence

318
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,440
by the time we're dealing with those types of externalities it is it's totalizing

319
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,240
and so we actually have to do some fundamentally different types of coordination

320
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,720
around how to think through the long term better using models like attractive basins and things

321
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,840
where you don't have to get every detail of complex systems right but you can get general

322
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,840
principles and where you disincentivize move fast and break things and this is actually

323
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,480
things like to open up a new category of tech you actually have to open up these you have to get

324
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,960
regulatory approval to open it up as opposed to regulate after the harms have already happened

325
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,600
that's of course that bothers everyone because they don't trust states to regulate so we have

326
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,240
to also restructure the state from scratch because the power to check the catastrophes creates

327
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,040
dystopias unless you also have strong bindings on it but you have to face these things together

328
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,240
yeah and that's where it gets interesting here with the narcology you just said the state here

329
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,040
the state is in the imaginary realm it's not a logical rose in the imaginary realm so so we

330
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,160
did inherit from religion and the gods and the forefathers and all that we know this idea of the

331
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,960
state and that would be the king or you know with the priest and eventually that becomes the state

332
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,560
we have today and the state is so far behind and the problem here of course is the other one

333
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,000
is that if you have if you create a monopoly it will instantly go corrupt and become dysfunctional

334
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,040
and we created states so far that are not competing one another at all they're local monopolies

335
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,960
and this is of course the problem you got the market the market is incredibly efficient i can

336
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,880
give an example of my team we just studied construction sites in east africa east africa is

337
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,440
like wide open right now it wants to expand quickly it looks at china and india it doesn't care too

338
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,440
much about regulation so this is the perfect place for a chinese construction company to

339
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,760
be the shed of a french construction company with a bid for a construction in iroby because the

340
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,160
french come there with a european attitude they've learned you know the hard way that we need to make

341
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,840
an assessment a risk assessment before you start building and by the time they start the risk

342
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,360
assessment the chinese are ready up and building the construction anyway because they don't care

343
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,640
about the risk assessment so we still have this sort of this blatant aggressive form of capitalism

344
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,680
running around the world and they know that we have exactly what you said we need to create

345
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,200
a functioning container within which the market can operate with some certain rules and then people

346
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,360
scream oh that's socialism and we need a bigger state and we know states can function any longer

347
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,720
and the states are going incredibly corrupt slow and they no longer work this is again this is part

348
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,120
of the imaginary order of crisis so it's in the imaginary order it's a crisis of religion and politics

349
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,280
in a fundamental one now i like then to go back to what actually worked and i know you also you

350
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:40,440
you tend to quote the silk group try it you tend to quote daoism buddhism is orastrism i do too i

351
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,360
find very very little solace in christianity and islam when it comes to try to understand

352
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,440
we're at right now i prefer these religions that have been around for thousands of years

353
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,360
and they've been created along the trade routes so i go to the metaphor of the bazaar now how does

354
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,640
a bazaar work well a bazaar has to be exploitative because it's going to be around for thousands

355
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,400
of years it's probably in some kind of an oasis town along the trade route you put an old smart

356
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,840
wise woman at the door you know you put that bitch at the door nobody gets in without her permission

357
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,480
so you have a membrane and containers start with functioning membranes so there are rules

358
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,920
how you conduct the trade in the bazaar otherwise the bazaar will not work it's not a free market

359
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,200
it's not a free for all you can do whatever you like because then the bazaar falls apart so if

360
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,360
you think of the system we're looking at as a kind of a bazaar that we need to create for the digital

361
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,280
age it starts to make sense then we can have different bazaars that compete in one another

362
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,080
but we have to have a central framework for all the bazaars of the world which is how we

363
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,000
exploitatively use the world in that sense so that we don't completely go into collapse so the

364
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,160
problem here is that we both on a global level have to have a network of bazaars and another

365
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,280
local ever there are the bazaars but what I'm then proposing is that the bazaar looks to its own

366
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:04,040
self-interest long time see it keeps itself alive as a container within which you can put the content

367
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,320
and this is why the market will not work unless the market is regulated it has to start there

368
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,800
so the markets themselves have to look at their own regulation otherwise we should just boycott

369
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,960
the market not be part of it just say that I don't want to be in the bazaar at all unless it works

370
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,760
unless unless it has a functioning membrane unless it takes responsibility for itself in

371
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,080
relation to other bazaars it's not a trading place for me to be involved with it has to be

372
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,240
something like that because we have a major a metacrisis of politics right now we know the

373
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,400
states that we construct and no longer work and the only alternative out that seems to work right

374
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,160
now interesting enough imitates egyptian dictatorship and it's called communist china

375
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,400
they at least seem to have a sense of what we call a sensocracy where they're going how they

376
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,800
will control everything to a central computer we also know that that won't work either so the

377
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,080
question is how do we open a society that's free and open enough to stay creative and to stay open

378
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,720
to bad news which dictatorships never do which exactly why they go extinct eventually and this

379
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:10,040
is of course the central question ideologically speaking and it's a question of imaginary narrative

380
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,680
it's in imaginary order that's the crisis there the reason that you're saying it's fundamentally

381
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,000
imaginary and why the bazaar worked in the market didn't is the bazaar had a long-term

382
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,600
survival interest in the market doesn't and that the long-term interest is in the imaginary realm

383
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,400
there was some narrative that everyone the bazaar was a part of that was self-transcending so they

384
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,840
wouldn't fuck the future to benefit themselves for some reason and that that's what's missing

385
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:42,120
currently that's the mythos is what is it that has us not maximize short-term personal gain

386
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,560
because there is some higher order transcendental narrative that we will have be a basis to find

387
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,480
our behavior is that right yeah so if you're looking around the bazaar on a map this would

388
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,360
you find interesting every bazaar it had the hospice it had the restaurant and the hotel

389
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,360
it had the bath house in a clique which is also a social place it had a gym there was always a

390
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,480
gym around the bazaar they called sarkhani the persians invented the gym 3 000 years ago

391
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,280
where you go work out and make your body fit and then it has the bazaar and you need to probably

392
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,400
go to the whorehouse which is another word for nightclub to socialize with people and see strangers

393
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,560
and make friends with strangers and there's no better place than a nightclub or even a whorehouse

394
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,480
if we're honest about it to make friends with a stranger they'd be absolutely naked in front

395
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,480
of somebody which you are at a whorehouse and therefore you can make a trade the next day

396
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,600
so the matriarch sitting at the front of the bazaar will make sure that she checks you done all

397
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,920
these things now here's the most important thing though it wasn't my team in london that they

398
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,440
discovered that every bazaar after you leave the bazaar you leave the town and go to the next

399
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,440
town to trade you have to go up to a costog the costog is the origin of the monastery

400
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,600
you literally have after you've done your traded bazaar you need to go to spiritual center and

401
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,440
fix your mind this is where you go into what the Tao is called Tao or the Zoroastrian is called the

402
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,800
Asha of the world you go into a relationship where you actually you go back into the logos you go back

403
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,680
into reality as much as you possibly can including yourself and you readjust yourself your own

404
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,760
thinking oh you did a bad deal in the bazaar get rid of it get over it move on come back with a

405
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,680
constructive mindset and all these trade group religions are basically they bowled down the

406
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,520
ethics to in what way are you constructively participating in the world in what way are you

407
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,080
constructing or representing your tribe when you're out here traveling doing the trades

408
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,960
in what way are constructed be supporting the community that just embraced you and welcomed

409
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,440
just you could do your trade and what we are constructively moving on to the next community

410
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,880
you're gonna enter so you can go into that bazaar and make more trade so the question here is that

411
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,440
why do we miss out on the costog we separated religion from the rest of side and made it a

412
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,080
private thing something you do on Sundays you go to church and show off yourself and of course that

413
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,560
eventually ended up with us being cynical about religion like well I only go to church on Sunday

414
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,040
it's only worth investment if it looks good so I can make more money on the Monday while

415
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,160
exploiting the world so the costog is fundamental to interactions especially when it comes to

416
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,400
larger populations than our own tribe as soon as you move into a larger public zone tribe

417
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,960
we need to start containing ourselves in our behavior relationship to other people the costog

418
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,520
eventually leads to the monastery traditions of all of Eurasia especially buddhism's are

419
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,680
asked in the dullest monasteries and I think it really pays off for most people today to go and

420
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,720
spend some time a year or two in the monastery and try to figure out what it means to meditate

421
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,720
and contemplate every morning of your day to have a constructive mindset towards the world

422
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,760
it has to it has to be his personal spiritual journey involved here and it was required at the

423
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,800
bazaars it was required it was the first thing they would ask you the next time you come to

424
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,920
oh did you go to the costog after did the train of bazaar the last stop you made otherwise you're

425
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,000
not welcome otherwise you haven't done your work this became such an industry you even had to build

426
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,640
costogs in mountains you know god hello tibetan buddhism you had to build in mountain where the

427
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,760
monks themselves and the nuns themselves prepare themselves for all the heaven load that they had

428
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,960
to go through with the traders and the costogs in the trading towns so it became like a spiritual

429
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:32,200
industry but that's fine and we need one today as well so did the next bazaar require some kind of

430
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,800
ticket or proof that you've been in the costog or they took your word for it

431
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,120
no absolutely and again this is this is how you get your credibility you get your credibility

432
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,520
because you've done the trade many times and yeah we can trust this god the way we do grading

433
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,680
today this is the 5.0 okay and it also represents a community that is underrepresented inside the

434
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,800
bazaar meaning it's got to sell us stuff we haven't seen it before oh that's quite exotic and interesting

435
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,480
let him go in he will do fine but if he doesn't do fine if he's out competed about it he needs to

436
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,920
go to the costog more than ever the next day to not take that looser mentality with him into the

437
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:18,760
next trade it's very interesting i i not heard that story told that way um so there's a way that i

438
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:27,240
think about that relative to the world today where it uh it seems like something has changed in scale

439
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,880
in a way that crossed a threshold that changed in type or the same thing even in network wouldn't

440
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,680
apply i'd like to ask this question and get your thought on it so you went to the market

441
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,280
after talking about the state and then you said okay in the market there was something like law

442
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,680
the woman at the front um had some kind of wisdom to be able to assess who you are some

443
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,360
record of if you went to the costog or not some you know some indicators about you and then obviously

444
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,640
she's probably connected to a network of people who are reporting on what people are doing inside

445
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,960
and there's probably something like police and whatever right so uh if someone is stealing or

446
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,360
doing false advertising or whatever it would be that would go against the um written or unwritten

447
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,880
law of the thing then they get kicked out or something like that so there's something like

448
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,320
rules and there's something like enforcement which is what defines the membrane and so acting on the

449
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:31,240
inside requires participation with the rules one of the things that makes that work without

450
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:39,720
being tyrannical is the smallness of scale yes and so unlike a massive police state um if the

451
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,240
police in that thing started to get corrupt enough of the people could overthrow the police and

452
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,800
there's no such thing as a person at a bazaar who can use personalized data micro targeted

453
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,280
split tested advertising on me like they can just say I got the best shit and I can say what about

454
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,120
these guys over here their shoes are cheaper and I can go touch them by myself right so there's not

455
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,080
a radical asymmetry between billion dollar corporations and the purchaser it's like a dude on

456
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,000
one side of the table selling stuff and a dude on the other side buying stuff there's not that much

457
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,800
asymmetry between the police and the non-police and so the symmetry is part of what makes something

458
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,440
like caveat and tour by or be where be reasonable or what makes something like the second amendment

459
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,640
hey if we need to throw over the police we can deal with it a reasonable idea when you start to get

460
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,640
to much more radical when you get to much more size if you want to have something like rule of

461
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,480
law across that whole size a very big membrane then you get pretty radical asymmetries of power

462
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,360
in a radical asymmetry of power you don't even have things like the ability to check the corruption

463
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,960
on it or even consent as a valid idea because of things like a new influence what does consent mean

464
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,360
if I don't have capacity to consent because the other agent is so much smarter than I am that they

465
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,840
can manipulate me to do shit which is like cold dynamics but a cold dynamic is nothing compared

466
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,880
to ai's on social media or whatever else doing stochastic terrorism and population centric warfare

467
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,120
so I don't even need a monopoly of violence anymore I just need a monopoly of influence

468
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,080
and the monopoly of influence can make people commit the violence I want or whatever it is

469
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,680
so when you start dealing with those who control ai's and those who don't

470
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,840
when you start to deal with that level of um asymmetry of information processing capacity

471
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:32,200
voluntarism doesn't mean anything anymore the ability to uh because you cannot voluntarily consent

472
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,720
in or not consent when you can't check all the stuff what does it mean for the people to be able

473
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,560
to check the state if there's no way to process all the information because the state's using ai to

474
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,400
process all the shit right um and how do the people deal with the if there is a policing force at all

475
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,000
the levels of asymmetry of power so if you say okay fuck nation states we're just doing city

476
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,080
states let's keep them smaller and let's always make sure that if anybody has an ai there's a

477
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,400
competing ai so you at least have something of some metrical size that can compete with it

478
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,440
well now we get this issue that let's just even take nation states we can go to city states but

479
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,760
let's take something less than global governance anything less than global governance you still

480
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,680
get global multicoller traps meaning a situation where if they're going to do the fucked up thing

481
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,040
then we have to raise to do the fucked up thing or they be best right they're going to develop nukes

482
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,880
we have to develop nukes they're going to develop ai weapons we have to develop ai weapons they're

483
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,600
going to overfish the ocean well how do we stop them from overfishing the ocean if they have nukes

484
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,920
and then they really need the fish for their population growth so if we don't overfish the

485
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,600
ocean the fish are still going to go so we might as well race to overfish the ocean so those race

486
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,600
to the bottom coordination failures are because you don't have a monopoly of violence to be able

487
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,200
to enact rule of law which is why you want a global government that you don't want a global

488
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,360
government because a monopoly of violence with no checks and balances become totally corrupt

489
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,160
catastrophes dystopias so you want a global government that is not corrupt well that requires

490
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,920
some magic right or really good design and i think that's where you and i are going to get so

491
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,280
what i see is that the principles that we're operating at the bazaar were scale dependent

492
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,360
and that as the scale gets larger you get fundamental breakdowns in some of those things

493
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,720
when the scale gets large enough for instance that supply and demand have a radical asymmetry

494
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,720
because even though in aggregate the total amount of demand total amount of supply is

495
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,240
the same flow of dollars the supply is not coordinated the demand is not coordinated and

496
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,720
the supply is coordinated right i don't have a labor union of all google users who work together

497
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,240
and use ai to coordinate how they want to use google but google is the centralized corporation

498
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,920
that actually has long perm planning and in org chart and again chart whatever so it's really

499
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,760
google half a trillion dollar organization whatever using ai's against a single user or facebook or

500
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,000
nike or whatever it is and they can employ radical behavior mod techniques so there's no

501
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,760
longer authentic demand driving supply there's supply manufacturing bullshit demand based on one

502
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,240
marshmallow stuff rather than two marshmallow and then say oh but the people want it after driving

503
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,280
addiction and so when you have those types of asymmetries it's asymmetric warfare you don't

504
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,080
have like the same principles that apply when there's symmetry like buyer beware like second

505
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,760
amendment like what they just don't hold in the same way so you need a fundamentally different

506
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,720
way of thinking how do we deal when there are competing interests across types of asymmetries

507
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,160
of power that are totally unprecedented absolutely i agree totally here and i think you're not

508
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,760
working on the same thing you're doing it on the technological level i'm doing it on the

509
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,400
narratological level i'm writing a book and you can do the technical level without the narrative

510
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,800
level no exactly exactly that's the point yeah so the the um the narratology i'm doing at the moment

511
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,600
the reason why i got into this thing with the bazaar is of course the the whole the entire

512
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,800
history of eurasia is being rewritten at the moment by asian historians many of them asian

513
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,160
americans like chinese american indian american persian american historians and i have discovered

514
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,680
that the entire history of asia is just a european 19th century fantasy it's completely incorrect it's

515
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,960
just read the wrong way so that's exactly what we see these patterns and and the reason what we're

516
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,320
doing is because asia's history is much older than europe's and that's the asset here we need we need

517
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:19,160
deep history we need long history to to look at what systems work and what stories work over

518
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,360
long periods of time and which stories failed and here's the interesting thing the it is that

519
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,600
we're looking at units like empire which is older by the way than nation and look at these systems so

520
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,800
what is an empire what is a nation what could it possibly be in what we would technology subscribe

521
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,960
to an empire in what way can human beings subscribe to certain empire and in terms of the

522
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,640
empire that were very loose they were full of dialectical conflicts and economies everywhere

523
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,040
they were allowed they were certainly encouraged they didn't worry too much about a diversity of

524
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,160
looks like we do today there were much more about diversity of talents and a diversity of opinions

525
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,840
because the strengthens the system's long term so you want to have these sort of competitive

526
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,160
environments we want to have them within certain containers that work and you discover when you

527
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,840
do these formats that you don't need the police unless the size is big that's exactly my scale

528
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,800
here is incredibly important we take to the tribal size somewhere between 1200 and 1500

529
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,720
people quite naturally and anything smaller than that we're perfectly comfortable with

530
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,160
we don't need a police force to be loyal to and even live and die for a community of say 1500

531
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,880
people once it gets bigger than that that gets more problematic and that's why you need these

532
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,600
sort of social systems and eventually even states or at least city states nations whatever

533
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,520
for those things to work and they are required the question is on what level can people you know

534
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,440
align this in what on what level can they for example vote for a politician that they would

535
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,600
know and they say hi to industry well that's only to a certain level but that's absolutely

536
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,600
minimum level you must work with because otherwise people don't trust people around them they don't

537
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,840
trust the leaders their elders or whatever then you have to go all the way up to global that's

538
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,600
the challenge here it's unavoidable there has to be some kind of least loose global you know

539
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,640
collaboration here and some certain global rules we have to have a membrane for planet earth itself

540
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,560
and at least after the atomic bomb in 1945 in the late 1950s we got the first pictures of

541
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,800
planet earth from outer space we tend to forget how young these pictures are there's only like

542
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,080
a little more than 50 years ago we finally saw this beautiful green blue planet where we live

543
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:28,040
and we saw this huge cold dark space out there that we cannot relate to so at least we know we

544
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,400
have the dia we have we have that narrative it's there and it's unavoidable I would even say that

545
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,400
I challenge my students these days and say that the one thing I will take care of probably is to

546
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,520
conquer outer space and you will not be involved and maybe that's a good place to start because the

547
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:48,440
hubris we suffered from should have some kind of a price we need to pay so you remind the students

548
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,480
that if we don't fix this planet which is the only place we know we can actually live in the

549
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,560
universe then we're done so the planet has to be fixed it has to be fixed it's unavoidable as a question

550
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,560
and this is the largest size I think we should allow ourselves to think to forget about our

551
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:09,160
space but think of the satellites at least a space surrounding the planet creating the internet

552
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,120
and what we then come to is of course the complexity has increased to higher levels than ever

553
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,880
which are there for expect people to go absolutely bananas over the next 50 years that's our book

554
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,800
digital libido by the way it's a very dark book because the first thing that will happen now so

555
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,280
people will go absolutely bananas they will go for all kinds of conspiracy theories that will create

556
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,280
the weirdest sects and cults you've ever seen they will lose themselves completely in these

557
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,520
environments it will not be safe to be outside anybody can kill you for whatever reasons you don't

558
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,240
know you know if anybody can order your murder you don't know who's going to kill you uh she

559
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,760
says abe was killed in japan because somebody started making homemade guns in japan so japan

560
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,800
has the same gun control problem that was america for that very reason so it becoming a very unsafe

561
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,160
world very quickly now that's quite obvious so the question then is we then have to move quicker

562
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,120
towards the global order it has to be very very loose it has to be very loose then the question

563
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,680
the next question is what would its insocracy be like we need algorithms algorithms have bad

564
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,680
reputation today because they're so bad today but they could be much much much better they could

565
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,240
much better reflect the world how the world actually operates i call it the free and open

566
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,040
algorithm to give it a positive spin is to get rid of those sort of manipulated algorithms

567
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,760
corrupted algorithms and conformist algorithms that we have today we need to get rid of the

568
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,080
manipulation the conformation and the corruption of current algorithms we need proper algorithms

569
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,240
because algorithms is the only help we have with increased complexity try to understand the world

570
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,160
better and leadership has to be based on proper algorithms that give you a fair view what the

571
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,280
world looks like again back to the logos the conspiracy theories they want to avoid the logos

572
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,600
as much as they can so jump between the pathos and the mythos which is incredibly dangerous to

573
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,520
put a lot of people in that realm we need to go back to the logos and the algorithms are there to

574
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:02,680
help us do that can you explain for me what you mean by the good algorithms that we need for leadership

575
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:10,280
to work okay so if it's a new paradigm it will be chaotic at first now allow for chaos say an

576
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,120
anarchy to establish itself first which is what the internet has been so far the old institutions

577
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:21,160
that used to be powerful the old logos the old pathos and the old mythos and the institutions

578
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,040
built on those old narratives will try to defend themselves all they can although they're done

579
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:33,800
I call this the the the Versailles versus Paris uh dichotomy this is like 1789 in Paris so Versailles

580
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:40,520
today is politics politics tries to manipulate the algorithms in political directions so the

581
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,600
algorithms are not free and open they don't reflect you and don't reflect the kind of world you want

582
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:50,200
to live in and need to live in then we got the corruption of money they used to put the ads

583
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,360
on the side with the percent of the algorithms for you when you did your search now the ads are at

584
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,560
the very top of the ads are increasing the infill trading the algorithm itself it becomes a corrupt

585
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,480
algorithm because money is corrupting it and money should not be involved in creation of the

586
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,080
algorithm at least for you personally we try to search the internet the third one is the conformation

587
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,400
and that means the old established institutions hate the fact the world is splitting up in so

588
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,840
many different directions and it's becoming so chaotic so the old institutions like academia

589
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,480
like mass media you know television stations you know the old institutions they will all say that

590
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:29,000
you must be more alike you must be more conformed and therefore conform it in itself as a value

591
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
precisely we need more people to you know to be more creative about solving these problems we try

592
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,880
to conform everybody into the same pattern so these are the three fourths of the old institutions

593
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,800
the way Versailles would attack the streets of Paris in 1789 by telling the streets of Paris off

594
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,000
not realizing the people in the streets of Paris could read write or count which nobody in the

595
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,640
nobility of Versailles could any longer therefore the streets of Paris finally came to the conclusion

596
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,360
let's go to Versailles chop their heads off because the old institutions are useless to us these days

597
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,840
because we can create the new institutions that could work of course that led to a bloodbath

598
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,680
would you want to avoid what have a slow gradual decrease of the old institutions and want the

599
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,320
new institutions to come into place and the new institutions to come into place must represent

600
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,280
the logos the pathos and the mythos they must incredibly do that the different expertise

601
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,040
that's why you and I are very very careful to not ever speak like in a sort of general sense

602
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,320
we speak as the specialists we are even if we're considered to be generalists so I'm a

603
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:37,880
narratologist I do storytelling uh John Seticfist and I have worked with this for the past 25 years

604
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,800
you know he was a former scriptwriter I was a former music producer it makes sense to be

605
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,120
become philosophers of narrative and narratology and we now want to move the whole the construction

606
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:52,440
revolution of the 20th century into a reconstruction revolution of the 21st century which is fiendishly

607
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,720
hard we call it narrative you call it culture in your work where is the digital culture

608
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,400
digital is still a tale digital is hardly even happened yet we just know it's going to happen

609
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,480
and digital is going to remember absolutely everything the way it's been programmed at least

610
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,600
it's going to remember absolutely everything that happens so thankfully we have a data revolution

611
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:18,360
in parallel with increased complexity and that data revolution should be the free and open algorithms

612
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,520
that can help us to guide ourselves so we get a fair view how the world actually operates

613
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,680
it's required and if that's how we're going to solve climate change at the end of the day

614
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,240
you're not this working any longer you're actually providing proper data no climate change is

615
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,920
happening here is the data the satellites provide the data this is the actual temperature in

616
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,240
500 different places around the planet right now this temperature should be in July this temperature

617
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,280
that's in July so you know the data at the end of the day convinces people finally to give up the

618
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,600
resistance and realize the climate change is really happening and now it has to be worked on

619
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,800
and that's sort of logical argument the logos once the logos comes into the picture it becomes

620
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,360
a lot easier to convince more people this is actually happening you cannot escape this and

621
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,800
along with this must be done before that we just did the guesswork we just did the storytelling

622
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:13,240
just had fairy tales suddenly is real and this when the real on the logos when the real from

623
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,760
the pathos to the logos comes into the picture when the undeniable facts are there we have more

624
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:29,000
hope of getting things done than we did right before so I I generally agree that important

625
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,880
deconstruction happened an important reconstruction of a different type a different dimensionality

626
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:44,840
is needed when you identify rightly that all of the narratives had embedded power plays in them

627
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,120
and you kind of deconstruct that you look at all the motivated reasoning that was involved

628
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,960
in a way you actually heighten power to be the only game there is because there is no

629
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:09,240
unifying basis of ability to form shared basis for choice making and so the ability to have

630
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,600
epistemologies of is science and epistemologies of all ethics that work together better

631
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,520
that are never adequate but we're continuously improving that identify their own perverse incentives

632
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,000
and where the perverse incentives affect the nature of the motivated reasoning itself

633
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,160
gives you something like whether you call it metamodern or whatever some capacity for

634
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:39,960
shared choice making that is not just the game of power so I would very much like to go there

635
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,600
I'd very much like to go into the relationship between what has to happen in culture or narrative

636
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:50,200
or superstructure or like our shared values or shared meaning making to inform choice making

637
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:56,040
and how that relates to tech but I think because you said a lot in there I think the place I'd like

638
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,720
to start is when you said what happened between Paris and Versailles we want to do a slow version

639
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,880
now so it's not so bloody and that the previous institutions are kind of holding on

640
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,960
there's this story that like looks like the sovereign individual put forward

641
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,360
that said changes in tech change social structures we know that changes in info tech

642
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,480
specifically do right so Marvin Harris said the first argument McLuhan really went deep

643
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,920
with the second argument and that you get a printing press and in feudalism and usher's in

644
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,800
democracy and in Catholicism and usher's in you know Lutheranism and other things

645
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,320
because the nature of everybody can have a newspaper and everybody can have a textbook is

646
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,120
really different so you it's a democratizing force but it was tech affecting the social system so then

647
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,680
the idea that the next we we got modern democracies based out of that

648
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:55,160
the idea that the next major change in the information technology is the internet computation

649
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:02,840
and then shared distributed computation and so now we can share value online by moving bits around

650
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,320
in uh net space as opposed to just atoms around in physical space and we can find networks of

651
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,040
affinity that are stronger than just the networks of geography so the nation state that was a

652
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:17,000
geographically based thing to move atoms around will be progressively less useful than the net

653
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,960
based move bits around thing and so you'll get these new emergent systems that kind of debase

654
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,760
the old ones i think this is a good and partial insight i think there's a heap wrong with it

655
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,400
and i want to hear your thoughts on one part of it because one specific part there's quite a lot

656
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,120
the fact that we can move bits around and have that correspond to value doesn't mean we don't

657
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,800
also still have to move atoms around or that the virtual world doesn't completely depend upon the

658
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,480
physical world and if the virtual world depending upon the physical world is debasing the integrity

659
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,120
of the foundational thing it depends upon there's a problem in that thing um so there's a bunch of

660
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:59,000
things i have there a problem with it but one in particular we talked about how to have it be less

661
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,680
bloody in the old institutions there was bloody overthrow of feudalism right the american revolutionary

662
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,440
war is one of many there was a thing where the symmetry of power was such that the uprising

663
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,960
army could deal with another army sometimes right within a standing army pitch forks could deal with

664
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:26,040
swords sometimes um i don't see how the focus of how the old nation state institutional thing falls

665
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:34,680
works very well with those who hold the nukes because there is no other force that overthrows

666
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:41,080
that thing unless you talk about ai's i can capture it that's fine um outside of that we can see the

667
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,960
ussr go through a complete economic socioeconomic collapse a collapse of the political economy

668
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,280
and stay a world superpower and turn itself into something else because we got fucking nukes so

669
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,560
back off like it's a so i'm curious how you think about that when you think about the transition

670
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:07,160
of power and uh how hard it is to deal with that particular part of it well the old structure stays

671
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,680
it doesn't go away you know food was still incredibly important even when capitalism arrived

672
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,760
it just as food production wasn't the center of the economy any longer it became a marginal

673
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,520
part of the economy and so the same thing here uh the nukes are perfect cases but so far at least

674
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,720
they're not owned owned by corporate corporations corporations don't have the nukes yet so they're

675
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,280
stuck with like large nation states hopefully not too many of them too quickly because otherwise

676
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,120
the bomb is more of an acute problem the climate olivism so that served me an existential problem

677
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,560
right there and and i would say the institutions are still there and what you want to do is you

678
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,640
want to keep those institutions that says that okay if you those institutions still have the

679
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,040
problem the nuclear bomb so it's locked up for good and then we can see if we use nuclear energy

680
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:58,360
something better um in and again that means that let's not give google the bomb you know

681
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,160
that's that's the problem there whether that could still happen or not we don't know yet

682
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:11,320
and there's this is where it comes into we know from hegel that triads are stable and we need to

683
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,720
try it the problem with with digital the problem we call the nectocracy the problem with this new

684
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,200
sort of this sort of global power lead that rides on digital and happen to be the people

685
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,600
with the right talents the right motivation to be powerful and influential during digital

686
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,280
is that it's an entire new paradigm all together and obviously big tech is the first one of the

687
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:38,200
three nectocracies and it's the first one in the sense that the the the asset here is no longer

688
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:43,880
land or capital the asset here is data and because collecting and processing data is so

689
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,440
fundamentally different from collecting and processing money it requires a whole new set of

690
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,880
talents the money goes to those who have the data anyway meaning they can concentrate on the data

691
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,760
and the data processing and that's exactly big tech has done and then taught the rest of world

692
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:05,880
this is what we do so that is just the first of three necessary uh structures and it represents

693
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,560
the real in the sense that the data is the real here but that requires also symbolic order and

694
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,240
imaginary order to complement that and we don't have those yet the chinese have probably called

695
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,840
you the way they call me they're interested in guys like us at the moment but they have their

696
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:25,720
very definite plan what they want to do next which is to create what we called a sonsocracy

697
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:32,520
and the chinese idea of the sonsocrates is that increased complexity but also the possibility

698
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,320
of algorithms to control data flows and have an oversight over the increased complexity

699
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:44,440
requires at least for china and china's history to have one guy at the top so they go they don't

700
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,640
go for the persian model which i strongly propose which actually the us constitution was built on

701
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,080
which is that you install power sharing from day one into the system before the system kicks in

702
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:00,920
like in any bazaar you you you make sure that the power is split between three which none can

703
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,800
dominate the other two because if one dominates the other two will stand up against the third

704
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,720
therefore you have a split and this is the beauty of the us constitution and what has

705
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:15,160
kept the united states together since the 1700s precisely the constitution the constitution itself

706
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:21,000
is in an imperial order of persian origin and here's the difference the reason why the persians

707
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,920
didn't spend their entire fortune building pyramids and finally just killing their whole

708
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,840
civilization building pyramids was the persians knew dutching from egypt they didn't want that

709
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,520
they didn't want the pyramid constructions they didn't want the entire culture being obsessed

710
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,880
but feeding the dead which were the egyptians did right they wanted to feed the living so when

711
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,760
sorastical structures or asterism one of the trade group religions by the way it's very close to

712
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:51,800
buddhism and dalism when he did that 1700 before christ he said let's not do animal or human sacrifice

713
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:57,400
any longer it's just a waste of resources he was in the logos completely there are no gods

714
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:03,240
who pay any attention to sacrificing humans or animals this is ridiculous let's get over it

715
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,720
let's die when we die and let's transcend ourselves by having children who take over

716
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,600
the world from us when we die and therefore he enabled the very thought that there could be

717
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,600
civilization this is the first time in human history somebody thinks what a civilization

718
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,560
could possibly be we could improve on the world everything doesn't have to be an eternal return

719
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:27,880
of the same as it is in paganism it is an eternal return of the same the seasons come and go the

720
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,640
world come and goes people live and die and they breathe and live and die but there can be an event

721
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,520
that's why our book is called pros and they could be an event and the event can change history forever

722
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:44,360
the event can be for good or bad depending on us humans it can be Hiroshima it can also be

723
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,480
future nuclear power that might save the world with you know affordable and and exploitative

724
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,800
energy forever you know it could be any of those things it depends on where we put our imagination

725
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,760
or put our efforts or work that's so raster's insight and therefore he constructs that even

726
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,200
event is possible and the fact that event is possible is what we take with us the problem

727
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,080
with our culture was that we started believing the event so strongly forgot about the process

728
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:14,280
this is the essential problem of western culture if eastern culture got too stuck in the process

729
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,000
didn't think the event properly then the problem with western culture is that we inherited from

730
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,960
the persians was the belief in the event that the persians always tied to the process we ignore

731
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,600
the process altogether and therefore we created religions that says if we exploit the world until

732
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,880
extinction comes god will come and save us and give us a new Jerusalem that's literally what

733
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,800
Christianity and Islam have been preaching for thousands of years and that is of course not

734
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:42,680
sustainable at all we're now discovering that we need both the process eternal return of the same

735
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,480
circular time and we need the event which is linear time we need to think the world both ways

736
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,800
and this is the beauty of power sharing power sharing reinforces that it says that there must

737
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:59,480
be split power from day one before you put the button on the ai it must understand the power

738
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,720
must display the chinese don't want that the chinese are terrified of it they go for the

739
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,880
egyptian model it says no we're just gonna have one fair at the very top and build a huge pyramid

740
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:12,920
and off we go and then we know what we're gonna do with the data and increasing and now when data

741
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,960
solutions become incredibly complex and incredibly expensive the chinese are going to excel at that

742
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,360
because it's exactly what they're doing at the moment they're creating a modern day egypt the

743
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:27,640
question is then can we especially america then create an alternative which is more like the persian

744
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,520
imperial model and i think building on the u's constitution is the beginning because the logos

745
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:40,600
the pathos and the mythos the three narratives are split the logos is the congress the pathos is the

746
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:47,320
precedent and of course the matriarchal bitch at the opening of the bazaar is the supreme court at

747
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:53,720
least it should be where the mythos is located so the you you have a narrative here that is balanced

748
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,000
dialectical it never arrives in one truth because the three different truths that can be spoken at

749
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,960
any given time depending on which of the three positions you take now we know that for a fact

750
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,720
it's a pragmatic solution to the overall problem of power and the narratives must be there from

751
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:14,600
all three angles therefore we must have a system that implements all three so my suggestion that

752
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,480
whenever you do with ai make sure it splits itself dialectically into these three posts

753
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,120
before it does anything else whereas the chinese are going for now we've got a one guy at the top

754
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,040
we're going to marry the aabic cmp and off we go and we have the pharaoh again

755
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:38,040
okay if i might ask a question because i was uh listening to this fascinating conversation

756
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:45,400
and one question arose and maybe daniel you can answer to this because we were talking about

757
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:51,960
you know conscious design of technologies and you know outcomes that we didn't expect

758
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,880
kind of ways we were talking about you know a third attractor in ecology you know of of new

759
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:05,640
narratives but at the same time um we know that we are uh storytelling beings you know we can't

760
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:12,360
really live without narratives and myths and stories except we go maybe in meditation and try to

761
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:19,640
get rid of that um but then at the same time we also know that events are way more random than

762
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:25,560
we think you know so we see that you know in the policies let's say how europe dealt with russia

763
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,880
nobody could foresee what is happening right now and so the the question really is like if you

764
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:39,080
have uh our urge to live with narratives and the randomness of future events so the it's it's

765
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:46,760
kind of a creator paradox or creator parallax so how do we create a better future and more functional

766
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:53,000
narratives if we know that the events are way more random than we think and that we can't really

767
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,840
foresee what kind of uh affects our decisions might have and so that that question is kind of

768
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:21,240
boggling me sure um it's funny because um a lot of people think about religion in terms of narrative

769
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:26,600
and there's probably a distinction that alexander would make between narrative and mythos but um

770
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,640
roughly i'll just say in terms of narrative and you're talking about the ability to forecast the

771
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,320
future of a certain kind of certainty about the future um and i i think one of the things

772
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,760
like religions that smith mixed bag because there was like good philosophy and then political

773
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,520
power plays that got mixed together because of course memes don't spread for no reason they

774
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:56,200
spread because someone's invested in spreading them and they so you you get like good kind of

775
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,880
gnostic and the scene and whatever thinking but then you get the council and i say i'm making the

776
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,520
bible and the crusades and they change the stuff to be supportive so like the throw the

777
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,920
religions out completely or believe them completely they are both silly right you've got a kind of look

778
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:14,120
at um which memes are true good and beautiful and which one's one war and coordinated people well

779
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,960
and the difference between those and um but if i think about the meaningful part of religion a

780
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,520
big part of it is how do we actually deal with the radical uncertainty of the world

781
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:32,600
and knowing that uh all the choices we make are going to be consequential not making choices

782
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:38,120
is still making a choice is consequential and i'm making every choice under partial information

783
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:45,880
and there is some stuff that is quite possibly affecting the situation that exists in the unknown

784
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:51,320
unknown set i don't even know that i'm not factoring it so how do i make progressively

785
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:58,440
competent rational decisions while holding the profound amount of uncertainty that we have to

786
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,600
have um so there's like a mature relationship to both certainty and uncertainty or anything

787
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,680
able to hold those together where you both get way more epistemic humility and way more epistemic

788
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:19,880
rigor at the same time um okay so that was just one thing so i don't think you get anything like

789
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:24,760
perfected prediction and i don't think it's even a good impulse like i don't think it arises from

790
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,920
a healthy place in people this is why so often when i start conversations with friends like

791
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,360
what happened earlier today about ethics i end up starting with heisenberg and gordel and tarski

792
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,400
and like the upper limits of no ability because what it means is i'm not going to get an ethical

793
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:47,480
system that's computable um that as gordel said my mathematics can be consistent or complete but

794
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,720
not both which means bound to incompleteness forever or what heisenberg showed about measurement

795
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:59,880
which is deeper than science upon which science rests is i get um i get indeterminism forever

796
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,880
right like a fundamental thing so that doesn't just mean throw up your hands and believe in

797
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,880
whatever god you want but it does mean that the impulse to certainty is an immature one

798
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:17,000
and the the unknowable set is larger it's a larger infinity than the knowable set is

799
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,840
and so like a healthy relationship with unknowability is part of spiritual maturity or cognitive

800
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:31,160
maturity or emotional maturity or probably all of those um and so then how do we make choices

801
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:38,440
in the presence of that um i don't want my narrative to tell me how it's all going to go

802
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:45,560
with high certainty i wanted to like help me orient to how to make good choices in the presence of

803
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:52,280
the uncertainty as well i think you guys had a conversation with mark uh the rabbi on here not

804
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,760
that long ago and he said something to me that i think might have been the best formalization of

805
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,440
ethics i have had ever heard he said that all fears of ethics are feathers of intimacy

806
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,840
because if you're in real intimate contact with any reality whether it's a tree or a forest or a

807
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:12,760
person the intimacy of the contact meaning you're you're not modeling them in some trolley problem

808
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,200
way you're actually really in contact with their sentience informs you everything you need to to

809
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:25,480
not harm it both the motivation and the sentiment the sensocracy in an embodied sense of it um so

810
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:34,120
the narrative that actually takes us into way more intimacy with the world um uh how we come to

811
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,520
progressively better knowing but we never think that the knowing is more true than it is which

812
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:44,680
becomes a false idol right um these are the things i i want a narrative a good a good religion to do

813
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:51,080
but just very pragmatically i think there's a lot of things we say we couldn't possibly predict that

814
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:59,080
are really fucking predictable and we're we're not trying or we're lying um or we're just applying

815
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:05,160
silly models there's places where we're applying silly models like engineers not factoring psychosocial

816
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,920
effects if they're not being trained in social sciences like that's just silly like we should

817
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,160
just do a better job of that but there are plenty of places where it's like oh we had no idea putin

818
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:19,880
and such and such really like nato aggresses on his border in every fucking way possible and he's

819
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:24,120
like dude fucking just don't just commit to not take ukraine and tornado and they're like no we're

820
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,000
not going to do it and they're like how much did we like the cuban missile crisis the idea of

821
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,560
russian bases that close it's like oh we had no idea who's going to do that really like just

822
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,160
what would you do in his position play the game theory a little bit so there's a bunch of places

823
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:44,040
where the unpredictability is bullshit um for things that are actually decently predictable um

824
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:50,600
and then there are places where it's like okay there's a radically complex thing i don't know

825
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,440
what's going to happen well that's where you have to do safe to fail probes is there some way

826
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,080
to be able to run an experiment here that is not consequential depending upon how it goes and if

827
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:05,960
there is no safe to fail probe they just don't do the thing yet right um so with a lot of ai and

828
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,760
biotech and i think those are the answers and then a lot of it just has to do with processes of

829
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:18,760
recursion so let's say i want to forecast how my new technology is going to affect people

830
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,480
so i think about what are the things this is going to enable that will actually be really

831
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,920
desirable as a result what behaviors are those people are going to do as a result how does that

832
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,880
affect their minds and psyches is it there's some super simple principles like if it's engaging their

833
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,840
attention it should make their attention spend better if it has an effect just there's some base

834
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,880
reality that it's engaging with it should enhance the base reality it engages with if it has choice

835
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,120
architectures that are designed to affect the choices people make i affect their intention it

836
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:51,000
should support their net intentionality and their sovereignty of local control like there are some

837
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,440
things like that that should be ubiquitous and they're just not um that could help to even have

838
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,960
sense making frameworks to think through oh we couldn't have guessed it would have done did you

839
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,520
even think about what it would do to attention or intention or polarization or anything like that

840
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,040
so we can just do a better job but there will be still be some stuff you don't predict right

841
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,200
so then you run an experiment and then you say oh wow i did this shit we didn't know so now you

842
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:18,680
turn that into the design process then you do a beta release and then you're watching for a bunch

843
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,800
of stuff including some shit that you don't know right you're watching for some stuff but you're

844
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,640
also just seeing let's just watch the people using it and the people around them and just see if

845
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,040
there's any weird new stuff that happens because that's how we deal with the unknown unknowns is that

846
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:36,280
we don't formalize what metrics too closely we just watch for weird stuff right and we didn't expect

847
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,760
that there'd be less time at the family dinner table that's worth noting so one of the things is

848
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:47,080
if i don't even know what to look for just do kind of broader spectrum observation and then say okay

849
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,400
let's see if we can find out why do some research on it and then internalize that into the design

850
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,600
and fix it again but that means that when you observe the thing and then you come up with a

851
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,160
new design whoever comes up with a new design has to have the authority to implement it not just oh

852
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,720
sorry that goes against our business model and we have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit

853
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:10,360
so you have to create a business that has a collect or a corporation or whatever it is that has a

854
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:17,640
collective intelligence uh i mean excuse me that has a a type of intelligence that is oriented

855
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,400
to be able to forecast as much as it can and to recursively upgrade itself where mistakes were made

856
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:32,760
i think this ties nicely into our idea of the bazaar so there has to be some kind of new container

857
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,400
here that works and it's an alternative to the sort of the chinese fantasy of the sonocracy

858
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:42,440
that's more free and more open and therefore more sustainable more resilient and will last longer

859
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,680
the argument for the persian empire is not a moral one the argument is that the persian empire

860
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:53,160
lasted for 2200 years the gypsum empire repeatedly imploded and with a knot and only lasted for six

861
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,480
years it was over and done with so style then is it doesn't last that's the argument against

862
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:03,240
our lesson here resilient systems actually are pragmatic and and they realize that splitting

863
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,320
narrowcase and splitting power from the very beginning makes the system much more resilient

864
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,400
over time and and therefore it can work in the kind of environments moving into right now

865
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,680
this is something you said about splitting power and that you program that into the ai and this

866
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:22,440
seems extraordinarily problematic because um checks and balances on power yes we like that idea

867
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:29,880
so one you know as well as i do that ai is not being set up that way and it's moving really

868
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:39,240
fucking past so there's a reality to tend to here the other thing is that making uh similarly

869
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:44,840
powered ai is divided in an adversarial network is how you make both of them crazy fucking smart

870
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:50,360
right and so the reason that alpha go was able to defeat stockfish like it was standing still

871
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
was because you never programmed a single human game in it you made two computers

872
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,680
play each other a trillion times in three hours and so what that then does is say okay well this

873
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,320
system can check this system vice versa the two of those systems now in a or either of them in

874
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:14,360
combined capacity is so asymmetric to every human system true but but the the computer is

875
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,840
still only doing the logos at least i want to believe that so the pathos of the methods are

876
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:24,680
two realms left and if at least the computers are interesting in interacting with human beings

877
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,280
they don't go off into outer space and do their own thing as a technological intelligence

878
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:33,400
which probably should lead them to do is basically say you can have Mars on your own right please don't

879
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:39,400
kill us on earth right or something like that but if you think about at least at least so far

880
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,480
history has been about human beings and has been a human society we're talking about here

881
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:48,120
and natural logically speaking the computer cannot do the methods and the computer cannot

882
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,160
do the pathos it can only do the logos but it does the logos with incredible efficiency

883
01:19:53,160 --> 01:20:02,600
anything credible you seen have you seen dolly yet yeah the visual gpt3 visual audio gpt3 yeah um

884
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:10,760
so it's early right but uh will it be able to generate methods that are compelling for people

885
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,080
at a Turing test passing level totally will it be able to generate art that is evocative enough

886
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:21,720
that people experience catharsis i.e pathos sure so is it experiencing pathos or methods no

887
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,680
but can it do a thing that evokes it in fact maybe even split test for its ability to do that

888
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,880
progressively better on an asymptote sure now this is really fucked up and interesting right

889
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:37,640
yeah and considering how terrible the latest star wars script is if that was written by humans

890
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:42,040
then humans don't deserve to survive to be honest about it you know we need better artists than that

891
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:50,280
it's just so fucking crap so yeah um i think i think though we're moving to the other we're

892
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:56,440
moving into the third nautocracy the second one is the sense of cracks or whatever is collaborating

893
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,400
with the satellites and the data flows around the world to create the container so if you isolate

894
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:06,040
the container and think of the container what we usually call politics is separate from say

895
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:11,800
perverse in business and enterprise which is what we call it indeed so that those two are separated

896
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,160
we have the informational lists or the informationism which is which is essentially data and and

897
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,200
that's big tech today the second one is in socracy whatever places politics we know it has to be

898
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,840
sense of critic and if we don't save the planet to begin with since socracy will never even happen

899
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,680
so the socracy has a self interest in at least saving the planet to begin with the chinese

900
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,360
other model we need to catch up with them quickly and create a different model that i call more

901
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:39,960
personal the third one though is the third nautocracy is the artistic one this is the imaginary one

902
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:46,360
no this is the real one it's tied to the path so this is the artistic one because art like sex

903
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:52,760
and violence are actually tied to pathos so this is intensely human this is the intense this is

904
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:57,160
where sexuality violence is located this is where we're as far away from the machines themselves

905
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,400
as possible and this is where the symbiotic intelligence comes in for example if you're

906
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:06,600
going to write a really fantastic eight hour series that's going to spell spell by in the world

907
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,920
what you would do today is that you will collaborate with the ai you will do symbiotic

908
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,160
intelligence and practices as an artist and i think at the end of the day the machine on its

909
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,480
own doing it will be vastly inferior to what a human being can do with a machine i think for the

910
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:23,480
foreseeable future we're saved by the fact the symbiotic intelligence will be better than artificial

911
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:28,760
intelligence in all of these three narratives that i'm talking about and if that is the case which

912
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:35,320
otherwise why would you must be around you know but if that is the case then the the artistic

913
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:42,120
aspect is the really protopian one so the protopian it's not so much that in art it's not so much

914
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,360
that you're productive you incremental improve on something one step at a time like you do

915
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:53,880
for an engineer but protopiness and for an artist is just the the unbound exploration of the darkest

916
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,680
shadows and the most fascinating storytelling we could possibly have and you're telling it to

917
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:03,080
grown-ups you're not telling it to children in a fundamental sense like real art is challenging

918
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,200
you it's challenging you in a transformative way and it has to be the third aspect of an autocracy

919
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:13,480
and we will give away the third power to the people who with their machines are capable of doing that

920
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,680
this is where art is heading and i think again our term the unideveloped symbiotic intelligence

921
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,240
fits better here than artificial intelligence when it comes to doing these things i've wrote pop songs

922
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:28,600
for 25 years and i've heard machines writing pop songs and yes they sound generic and professional

923
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,640
but they sound like german pop songs like they sound like i just copied last week's number one

924
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:38,280
record and i make it a new record now we can hear what you copy it it's just too similar to what we

925
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:43,160
heard it's eerily boring right and so far at least the machines have not been able to come up with

926
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:48,920
anything else because machines always work in the past the curse of logos is that logos can only

927
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,440
work with data that already exists they can only write things that are similar to what we already

928
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:58,280
have but the idea to imagine a future that's radically different from anything we've ever seen

929
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:06,680
is still a very very human capacity only because one of the reasons that GPT-3 is passing the

930
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:15,400
Turing test now is because for many audiences and if you have GPT-3 created text in areas of subject

931
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,240
matter expertise and subject matter experts are looking at it they know it doesn't pass the Turing

932
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:24,920
test but for general chatbot functions it does but it's not because the AI has gotten that good

933
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:30,200
it's because most people's ability to be able to vet theory of mind or have deep conversation

934
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:35,480
has gotten so bad that there's like this like it's kind of funny that's like reclaim the quality of

935
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:40,280
the Turing tests by increasing human intelligence to be deserving of the term of general intelligence

936
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:46,120
that we can make the test a little harder the reason i bring it up is because so let's say we

937
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:51,960
have a symbiotic intelligence where we have a human using a transformer AI to generate stuff

938
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:58,920
and people like it well in the classic adversarial network type style i could then train another AI

939
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:05,240
on the output of that symbiotic intelligence and whatever the metric of win is pop chart

940
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:09,640
hips or whatever that is going to be judged by the demand consumption of by other humans

941
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:14,440
i just say beat it and of course now what it's trained to do is be able to identify the things

942
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:19,640
to do more of that and so of course it will like it'll be able to beat that if we can define it in

943
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:24,120
any narrow metrics because it's the same as beating us at starcraft or chess or go as soon as it can

944
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:30,440
define it as a finite game i don't think it can win at the infinite game but i also don't think

945
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,160
most humans are oriented to infinite games right now nor our economic systems or anything else

946
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:39,800
and so it's like i think the symbiotic intelligence would produce more meaningful things

947
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:46,280
if the depth of what it means to be human in the depth of the experience the depth of the pathos

948
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:50,520
and the methods that are not the logos is fully brought to both the creation of it and fully brought

949
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:56,680
to the appreciation of it by others which is now why this work in in culture and narrative is so

950
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:01,240
important because anything less than that if it's if it's consumers who want one marshmallow

951
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:06,040
hypernormal stimuli and producers who want to supply that know the AI will be the symbiotic

952
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:11,160
intelligence yeah and this is this goes for popular culture certainly and we're very dark in

953
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,480
digital libido so it gets not right that the vast majority of people will be sedated by popular

954
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:19,960
cultures probably manufactured machines because it's more efficient to do it that way but there

955
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,960
was something eerie about it the thing is that you might be fooled once but you're not fooled

956
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:29,640
several times over until you discover this eerie feeling that this is increasingly predictable

957
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:35,160
and it's increasingly flattering like the culture's fighting and this is the problem of popular

958
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,760
culture it might work for kids stories it might work for disney right but that's not art at all

959
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,840
and i think this is why we so strongly philosophically defend the concept of art

960
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,440
and we put that put it in the pathical narrative the mythical narrative yes can be mass produced

961
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:54,600
they can be manufactured by technological intelligence it's just you put the button on

962
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,160
the and it produces disney culture that's exactly the new star wars series that's why it's crap

963
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:03,800
because the script is so bad it's so predictably bad right because it just tries to flatter you

964
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:09,080
tries to fly it doesn't it doesn't challenge you it's not going to transform you at all real art

965
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,960
therefore has to be located next to sex and violence and we call the tantric realm in the

966
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:19,480
really grown up adult realm it challenges you fiercely otherwise it isn't art at all and it

967
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:25,800
challenged you to transform you the truly artistic experience is not just to kill time that's what

968
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,680
silicon valley and hollywood are trying to do they just try to kill time no real art is that you go

969
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:35,240
through transformative experience like a spiritual experience that transforms you you're a totally

970
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,160
different person when you come out of experience compared to who you were before in either direction

971
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:45,400
doesn't matter you changed you have gone through an event your life is no longer the repetition of

972
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:51,400
the same i don't see any machine being able to do anything remotely like that yet that's why art has

973
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:57,720
to get out of popular culture return to its own realm and go spiritual and that's why we put art

974
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,800
in the pathical narrative that's what's important in their ecology mythical narrative can be mass

975
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:07,000
produced yes that's popular culture but pathical narrative is an entirely different thing and i

976
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,880
would know because i was in the mythical narrative production when i was a pop song writer and pop song

977
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:18,440
producer i never tried to do jazz or opera i went to the opera and i enjoyed jazz because i didn't do it

978
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,160
i didn't do anything pathical i did mythical things but to then go into the pathical narrative

979
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:28,680
where i tried to be as a philosopher is fiendishly more challenging but it's absolutely required

980
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:34,440
and this is probably of all the three narratives the hardest one to nail because at the end of the

981
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:40,760
day we now live in the world where death is the absolute i am adamant i'm with a lot of thinkers

982
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,800
today to say that the problem with the west is that we banned everything that was out of our comfort

983
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:51,720
zone and we basically called it sin and at least in the east they realized that no sin is not going

984
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,560
to disappear so instead of creating pressure cookers that blow over all the time and cause

985
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:01,800
huge warfare and misery instead it's better to have it around but to have it around inside a container

986
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,560
and only those who can handle it can go there and handle that container they're the ones who

987
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:12,360
can have access to it that's the concept of tantra this is interesting sutra is the message the

988
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:18,040
narrative that makes people love their children so they want to survive that is the ultimate truth

989
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:23,240
of sutra sutra has a direction must be exactly that the opposite of the sutra is the tantra it's like

990
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,400
okay we don't know where this is going therefore we're containing it we're keeping it in some kind

991
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,440
of a laboratory and we can only access by people who can really go through it and that's where sex

992
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:37,560
and art and violence must be located that we must realize that these are factors of human life

993
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,400
and that's what we're working with as philosophers at the moment so i think it's important here to

994
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,840
make that distinction i don't see any machine even being remotely close to creating a credible

995
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:53,320
pathological narrative in the foreseeable future it's funny that you say that the elites now believe

996
01:29:53,320 --> 01:30:03,720
in death because in so many important ways i don't see that like the extreme life extension

997
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:09,080
movement radical life extension movement for radical biological extension is totally a holy

998
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:14,280
grail pursuit and then the biggest one of course and and the brain computer interface

999
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,840
pursued all the way up to the full digital consciousness singletarian we can all be

1000
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:26,680
ai gods in a universe that we can fork infinitely remember how i told you daniel that engineers

1001
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:31,720
don't know what they're doing because the engineers haven't talked to the priests this is the perfect

1002
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,480
example to give exactly that they're going to create things that are not at all what they thought

1003
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:40,200
they're going to create and so and whatever they're all going to be disappointed when they're dying

1004
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:45,240
finally learn to die with some fucking grace and i think but i think the death escape has arrived

1005
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:51,240
it has existed all along buddhist thoracists and Taoists always knew they would die when they die

1006
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:55,480
and the question is what transcends you they always had that question that question around for

1007
01:30:55,480 --> 01:31:00,200
thousands of years we just need to get rid of these childish religious that promises the afterlife

1008
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:04,760
of the reincarnation because it was too hard to tell children that their parents had died right

1009
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,160
it's just it's just death as the absolute has arrived i think it's a dominant story today

1010
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:13,320
and i think these people who try to escape try to escape precisely because they find it hard to die

1011
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:19,720
one of the things i really like about the invisible afterlife um i like the reincarnation

1012
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:26,760
version better than heaven and hell version but i like that you can get narcissistic and even

1013
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:33,080
sadistic people to do the right things for the wrong reasons um meaning if i don't want to reincarnate

1014
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:42,360
badly and i can't hide the karma from god or from uh universal accounting system then even though

1015
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,880
if i could hide it from the humans i'd fuck everybody over and get ahead and if death was

1016
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,800
the end that'd be fine the fact that i can't hide it from the day of judgment or whatever it is

1017
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:55,080
means now i have to do the right thing for my own prevention of suffering i think that was actually

1018
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,640
brilliant and i think there were places where that obviously didn't work all that well in many

1019
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:09,960
places but there were places where it did um how you create a system where even if someone uh if

1020
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:20,520
someone's focus of self is too personal right too much narcissistic trait not enough empathy etc

1021
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,800
they still are oriented to a system of ethics i think that's one of the things the system has

1022
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,880
to do as a failsafe while it works to condition people who all have authentic intimacy where

1023
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:36,200
emergent ethics can arise um i know it is time for us to wrap up and it's late one thing i was

1024
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,960
going to say we should do next time that would be fun we opened a lot more threads and we closed

1025
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:50,440
but that's good you started talking about um uh what ai won't get and will get in the future and

1026
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:57,880
what the three different types of uh natocracies will be and i i think if we were to just kind of

1027
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:04,760
give a vision like what is a positive vision for the not too distant future like you know 50 years

1028
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:11,720
out or so that we can see that involves uh getting mythos pathos logos all meaningfully better right

1029
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:16,680
that my terms might be getting some of the critical things that have to happen in infrastructure and

1030
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:21,640
social structure and superstructure whatever um what is a vision that could happen that would be

1031
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:28,040
a fun that'd be a fun place to go i totally agree uh so i just want to add that we also need a new

1032
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:33,240
sutra a new story about how we're going to love our children therefore we want our children to

1033
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:37,880
survive we need a new one so we can't go back to the old ones and and when it comes to the

1034
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,080
belief in the afterlife that also ruined ancient egypt that's why ever since then we sort of suspected

1035
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,920
that we will not live after we're dead so the afterlife was a very very destructive thought

1036
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,440
in that sense when it was taken all the way through the ancient egyptians at least in the

1037
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:57,160
first kingdom seriously believed that life after death was more important than life right here and

1038
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:03,560
now ever since then well at least we've doubted it so uh i think those those i think once the gene

1039
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,440
is out of the bottle historically in this sense that a certain tantra is now leaked into the sutra

1040
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:12,840
and we can no longer pretend it's not there that's what i mean we cannot construct the system of

1041
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,600
believing the afterlife we believe in reincarnation and longer we cannot even believe that we're

1042
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,120
going to conquer outer space and live another planet because we're way too late to that race

1043
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:24,520
ai will certainly beat us to it so ai will take bacteria away and go to other planets and we

1044
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,080
won't even be part of the game that's more likely so we can look into that we can look into what

1045
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,680
could possibly the new sutra be what could be the new story we could actually tell each other and

1046
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:38,680
agree on and then at least the tantra itself we know it's around but it's hidden in containers

1047
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:43,080
for the people who can actually absorb it and understand it and thankfully because it's tantra

1048
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:49,320
so tied to complexity that we can only specialize on certain complexities like you and i honorably

1049
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:54,200
do we're supposed to be generalists but nobody can be a generalist any longer that's impossible

1050
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:58,760
we can only understand that that's impossible therefore we're more hegellian in the sense that

1051
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,160
our absolute knowing is not that we know everything is that we know the limits of our own

1052
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,360
knowledge and we thrive within that limit and that's exactly what we're promoting very pragmatic

1053
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:13,400
ideas constantly we will learn from history like and it's moving quicker than ever it's more

1054
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:18,440
important than ever to be pragmatic about history and to make due process before we make decisions

1055
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,600
and start building things that's where you're an absolute the adamant anything else is completely

1056
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:29,000
responsible from now on historically speaking so i would love to be more into that yes absolutely

1057
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:35,080
all right this is fun alexander daniel thank you so much for taking the time i think it's

1058
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:41,000
very late at your end daniel what is it two o'clock in the morning already yes thank you again

1059
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,960
fascinating conversation i would love to do a second part where we have a look at the future

1060
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:53,640
in 50 years it sounds super interesting um yeah thank you guys thank you tom for making the space

1061
01:35:53,640 --> 01:36:00,600
and having us here and uh and alex for uh having the dialogue i it's funny because you and i think

1062
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:08,200
about things that are so related and i think both try to um bring deep frameworks and they're such

1063
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:13,960
different frameworks it was like such different schools of study that um uh i really enjoy it

1064
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:18,920
because i get different insights and learn every time we talk thank you so much i'm on i'm over here

1065
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:24,200
in europe and we have hegel and itcha you have the fantastic american pragmatists and our shared

1066
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:29,320
friends layman pascal and saxstein are big fans of pers and james and these guys that is the other

1067
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:34,680
tradition that i really really really think is fantastic and for anybody's interest in philosophy

1068
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,760
you need to do your hegel and your nature and certainly your pho like you certainly need to do

1069
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,640
the american pragmatist so that's the tradition you come from and i hear it in the way you speak

1070
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:47,400
and the way you address issues that there's so much of american pragmatism coming through to you

1071
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:52,520
and i should say this last thing i'm off to the borderland next week which is northern europe's

1072
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:57,000
burning man so of course another thing that dad and i've been coming with both good old burners

1073
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:02,920
we'll have a blast there i have some friends that are going to be going there and maybe i'll

1074
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:08,040
connect you all and you can meet up there exactly speaking speaking of the pathical narrative

1075
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,960
participatory culture is where it's at
