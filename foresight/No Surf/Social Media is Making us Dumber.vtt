00:00.000 --> 00:01.300
Do you know how many continents there are?

00:01.300 --> 00:01.800
No.

00:01.800 --> 00:03.200
Who fought in the Civil War?

00:03.200 --> 00:04.000
I don't know.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.500
Do you know what 3 times 3 times 3 is?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.200
No.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.800
Who the president was before Trump?

00:07.800 --> 00:08.500
No.

00:08.500 --> 00:13.000
The average individual today spends around 7 hours a day on the internet

00:13.000 --> 00:16.300
with almost 3 of those hours spent on social media.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.300
The latest figures suggest that by the end of this year alone

00:19.300 --> 00:23.300
we will have spent upwards of 12 and a half trillion hours online.

00:23.300 --> 00:27.600
The effects of a society that's terminally online are starting to show.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.000
Debate and discussion are dead, replaced with Twitter threads.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.800
Political discourse reads like a Reddit forum.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.900
In a world with information available at our fingertips,

00:36.900 --> 00:40.000
the average person is becoming more and more uninformed,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.400
opting to read clickbait headlines that distort our view of the world and of each other.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.700
This begs the question, is social media making us dumber?

00:47.700 --> 00:52.600
This is Eric Fransen, professor of computer science at KTH University.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.500
His research focuses on short-term memory and methods of neurological impairment.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.700
He says that,

00:58.700 --> 01:02.300
a brain exposed to a typical session of social media browsing

01:02.300 --> 01:05.500
can easily become hobbled by information overload.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.400
The problem begins in a system of the brain known as working memory.

01:09.400 --> 01:14.800
Working memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.800
But it's also a limited resource.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.800
At any given time, the working memory can carry up to 3 or 4 items.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.200
And when you try to store many things in your working memory,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.800
you get less good at processing information.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.400
The constant distractions we are experiencing make it impossible to work or study.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.700
Take for instance the average TikTok session where videos are typically under a minute long.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.300
Users scroll through hundreds of videos destroying their short-term memory

01:39.300 --> 01:42.700
which can only focus on a handful of items at a time.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.000
Imagine this issue compounded over weeks, months, and years,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.700
chipping away at our brain's capacity to process information,

01:50.700 --> 01:53.200
making us a shell of our former selves.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.600
And the results are finally starting to show on a societal scale.

01:56.600 --> 02:25.500
They used to say you're an average of the five people you surround yourself with.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.300
That saying is outdated.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.000
Social media is now what you spend the most time with

02:30.000 --> 02:33.300
and it's influencing how we think on a massive scale.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.900
They don't call them social media influencers for no reason, do they?

02:36.900 --> 02:41.200
So this begs the question, how exactly does it influence us?

02:41.200 --> 02:45.300
As human beings, we require observation of our surroundings to build mental models

02:45.300 --> 02:47.500
and understand the world around us.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.000
Therefore, whoever owns what we see owns what we think.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.400
Social media companies do this by distorting our view of the public square.

02:55.400 --> 03:01.400
Take, for instance, Twitter, where the top 10% of tweeters are responsible for 80% of tweets,

03:01.400 --> 03:07.700
where users are on average younger, more formally educated, and wealthier than the average American.

03:07.700 --> 03:11.000
Is this truly representative of society at large?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.500
Of course not, but it's designed to seem that way.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.400
It produces something called the herd mentality,

03:17.400 --> 03:21.800
where people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.600
For instance, if everyone on your feed seems to be doing something,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.600
well, chances are you will too.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.200
Can't believe they caught me lacking.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.200
Huge ceiling tile is gone.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.200
View board pens have been finessed.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.200
Was able to stop a kid from taking this though.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
Stay...

03:44.800 --> 03:49.900
This was the devious licks trend, which caused pandemonium over schools in the US.

03:49.900 --> 03:54.500
Students began stealing from their school and posting it under the hashtag devious licks,

03:54.500 --> 03:56.700
amassing millions of views.

03:56.700 --> 04:02.100
The algorithm pushed this because its main purpose is to increase engagement and keep you on the app.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.500
Millions of dollars worth of property damage later,

04:04.500 --> 04:10.200
and after rounds of negative publicity, TikTok finally removed the hashtag but the damage was done.

04:10.200 --> 04:16.500
This proves that millions of people can be pushed to do something just by having it show up repeatedly in their feeds.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.600
No wonder why we are losing the ability to be creative and critically think.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.500
If everything we do is simply what we've seen on social media,

04:23.500 --> 04:26.900
are we truly unique or simply carbon copies of what's trending?

04:26.900 --> 04:33.700
There are even services available that allow you to purchase likes and followers on TikTok, Reddit, and many other social media platforms,

04:33.700 --> 04:37.700
leading many to question how organic these trending pages are, if at all.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.100
Comparison is the thief of joy,

04:40.100 --> 04:45.200
and in this attention economy, all we ever do is compare because that's what these apps promote.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.000
Think about it.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.300
When's the last time you've seen the TikTok algorithm promote a healthy lifestyle filled with purpose and meaning,

04:51.300 --> 04:53.700
rather than vanity and avarice?

04:53.700 --> 04:56.900
In fact, according to TikTok's own internal documents,

04:56.900 --> 05:04.500
they instructed moderators to suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform,

05:04.500 --> 05:07.500
reducing a human being to our most primal of instincts.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.700
Looks.

05:08.700 --> 05:13.000
Social media is causing body dysmorphia at record rates never seen before.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.900
Apps like Facetune, which are used to enhance photos, are exploding on the App Store, garnering hundreds of millions of downloads.

05:19.900 --> 05:27.800
In fact, Facetune recently raised $130 million from investors after 90% growth in their user base during lockdowns.

05:27.800 --> 05:34.000
The constant push for unrealistic and frankly impossible beauty standards is causing many to feel depressed and anxious,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.400
pushing them towards plastic surgery, which is booming like never seen before.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.500
All this is destroying people's self-esteem, causing them to hate themselves and their genetics,

05:43.500 --> 05:48.000
reducing us to a lifestyle of eat, sleep, and scroll, day in and day out,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
wasting our life force enriching and envying others while doing nothing to improve ourselves.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.400
Imagine a life without social media, a life filled with purpose and meaning,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.700
a life where we're free from the constant competition and envy,

06:00.700 --> 06:06.000
a life that we can have simply by turning off our screens and returning to the way we've always lived.
