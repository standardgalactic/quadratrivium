1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Do you know how many continents there are?

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:01,800
No.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,200
Who fought in the Civil War?

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,000
I don't know.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Do you know what 3 times 3 times 3 is?

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,200
No.

7
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Who the president was before Trump?

8
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,500
No.

9
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,000
The average individual today spends around 7 hours a day on the internet

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,300
with almost 3 of those hours spent on social media.

11
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,300
The latest figures suggest that by the end of this year alone

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,300
we will have spent upwards of 12 and a half trillion hours online.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,600
The effects of a society that's terminally online are starting to show.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,000
Debate and discussion are dead, replaced with Twitter threads.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Political discourse reads like a Reddit forum.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,900
In a world with information available at our fingertips,

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,000
the average person is becoming more and more uninformed,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,400
opting to read clickbait headlines that distort our view of the world and of each other.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,700
This begs the question, is social media making us dumber?

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,600
This is Eric Fransen, professor of computer science at KTH University.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,500
His research focuses on short-term memory and methods of neurological impairment.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,700
He says that,

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,300
a brain exposed to a typical session of social media browsing

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,500
can easily become hobbled by information overload.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,400
The problem begins in a system of the brain known as working memory.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,800
Working memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
But it's also a limited resource.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
At any given time, the working memory can carry up to 3 or 4 items.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
And when you try to store many things in your working memory,

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
you get less good at processing information.

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,400
The constant distractions we are experiencing make it impossible to work or study.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,700
Take for instance the average TikTok session where videos are typically under a minute long.

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,300
Users scroll through hundreds of videos destroying their short-term memory

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,700
which can only focus on a handful of items at a time.

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,000
Imagine this issue compounded over weeks, months, and years,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,700
chipping away at our brain's capacity to process information,

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,200
making us a shell of our former selves.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,600
And the results are finally starting to show on a societal scale.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:25,500
They used to say you're an average of the five people you surround yourself with.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,300
That saying is outdated.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,000
Social media is now what you spend the most time with

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,300
and it's influencing how we think on a massive scale.

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,900
They don't call them social media influencers for no reason, do they?

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,200
So this begs the question, how exactly does it influence us?

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,300
As human beings, we require observation of our surroundings to build mental models

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,500
and understand the world around us.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,000
Therefore, whoever owns what we see owns what we think.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Social media companies do this by distorting our view of the public square.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Take, for instance, Twitter, where the top 10% of tweeters are responsible for 80% of tweets,

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,700
where users are on average younger, more formally educated, and wealthier than the average American.

51
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,000
Is this truly representative of society at large?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,500
Of course not, but it's designed to seem that way.

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,400
It produces something called the herd mentality,

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,800
where people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,600
For instance, if everyone on your feed seems to be doing something,

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
well, chances are you will too.

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Can't believe they caught me lacking.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Huge ceiling tile is gone.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
View board pens have been finessed.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Was able to stop a kid from taking this though.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Stay...

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,900
This was the devious licks trend, which caused pandemonium over schools in the US.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,500
Students began stealing from their school and posting it under the hashtag devious licks,

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,700
amassing millions of views.

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,100
The algorithm pushed this because its main purpose is to increase engagement and keep you on the app.

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,500
Millions of dollars worth of property damage later,

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,200
and after rounds of negative publicity, TikTok finally removed the hashtag but the damage was done.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,500
This proves that millions of people can be pushed to do something just by having it show up repeatedly in their feeds.

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
No wonder why we are losing the ability to be creative and critically think.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,500
If everything we do is simply what we've seen on social media,

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,900
are we truly unique or simply carbon copies of what's trending?

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,700
There are even services available that allow you to purchase likes and followers on TikTok, Reddit, and many other social media platforms,

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
leading many to question how organic these trending pages are, if at all.

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,100
Comparison is the thief of joy,

75
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,200
and in this attention economy, all we ever do is compare because that's what these apps promote.

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Think about it.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,300
When's the last time you've seen the TikTok algorithm promote a healthy lifestyle filled with purpose and meaning,

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,700
rather than vanity and avarice?

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
In fact, according to TikTok's own internal documents,

80
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:04,500
they instructed moderators to suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform,

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
reducing a human being to our most primal of instincts.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
Looks.

83
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,000
Social media is causing body dysmorphia at record rates never seen before.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,900
Apps like Facetune, which are used to enhance photos, are exploding on the App Store, garnering hundreds of millions of downloads.

85
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,800
In fact, Facetune recently raised $130 million from investors after 90% growth in their user base during lockdowns.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,000
The constant push for unrealistic and frankly impossible beauty standards is causing many to feel depressed and anxious,

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,400
pushing them towards plastic surgery, which is booming like never seen before.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,500
All this is destroying people's self-esteem, causing them to hate themselves and their genetics,

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,000
reducing us to a lifestyle of eat, sleep, and scroll, day in and day out,

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
wasting our life force enriching and envying others while doing nothing to improve ourselves.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Imagine a life without social media, a life filled with purpose and meaning,

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,700
a life where we're free from the constant competition and envy,

93
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,000
a life that we can have simply by turning off our screens and returning to the way we've always lived.
