0	1300	Do you know how many continents there are?
1300	1800	No.
1800	3200	Who fought in the Civil War?
3200	4000	I don't know.
4000	5500	Do you know what 3 times 3 times 3 is?
5500	6200	No.
6200	7800	Who the president was before Trump?
7800	8500	No.
8500	13000	The average individual today spends around 7 hours a day on the internet
13000	16300	with almost 3 of those hours spent on social media.
16300	19300	The latest figures suggest that by the end of this year alone
19300	23300	we will have spent upwards of 12 and a half trillion hours online.
23300	27600	The effects of a society that's terminally online are starting to show.
27600	31000	Debate and discussion are dead, replaced with Twitter threads.
31000	33800	Political discourse reads like a Reddit forum.
33800	36900	In a world with information available at our fingertips,
36900	40000	the average person is becoming more and more uninformed,
40000	44400	opting to read clickbait headlines that distort our view of the world and of each other.
44400	47700	This begs the question, is social media making us dumber?
47700	52600	This is Eric Fransen, professor of computer science at KTH University.
52600	57500	His research focuses on short-term memory and methods of neurological impairment.
57500	58700	He says that,
58700	62300	a brain exposed to a typical session of social media browsing
62300	65500	can easily become hobbled by information overload.
65500	69400	The problem begins in a system of the brain known as working memory.
69400	74800	Working memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication.
74800	76800	But it's also a limited resource.
76800	80800	At any given time, the working memory can carry up to 3 or 4 items.
80800	83200	And when you try to store many things in your working memory,
83200	85800	you get less good at processing information.
85900	90400	The constant distractions we are experiencing make it impossible to work or study.
90400	95700	Take for instance the average TikTok session where videos are typically under a minute long.
95700	99300	Users scroll through hundreds of videos destroying their short-term memory
99300	102700	which can only focus on a handful of items at a time.
102700	107000	Imagine this issue compounded over weeks, months, and years,
107000	110700	chipping away at our brain's capacity to process information,
110700	113200	making us a shell of our former selves.
113200	116600	And the results are finally starting to show on a societal scale.
116600	145500	They used to say you're an average of the five people you surround yourself with.
145600	147300	That saying is outdated.
147300	150000	Social media is now what you spend the most time with
150000	153300	and it's influencing how we think on a massive scale.
153300	156900	They don't call them social media influencers for no reason, do they?
156900	161200	So this begs the question, how exactly does it influence us?
161200	165300	As human beings, we require observation of our surroundings to build mental models
165300	167500	and understand the world around us.
167500	171000	Therefore, whoever owns what we see owns what we think.
171000	175400	Social media companies do this by distorting our view of the public square.
175400	181400	Take, for instance, Twitter, where the top 10% of tweeters are responsible for 80% of tweets,
181400	187700	where users are on average younger, more formally educated, and wealthier than the average American.
187700	191000	Is this truly representative of society at large?
191000	194500	Of course not, but it's designed to seem that way.
194500	197400	It produces something called the herd mentality,
197400	201800	where people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.
201800	205600	For instance, if everyone on your feed seems to be doing something,
205600	207600	well, chances are you will too.
207600	210200	Can't believe they caught me lacking.
210200	213200	Huge ceiling tile is gone.
213200	216200	View board pens have been finessed.
216200	219200	Was able to stop a kid from taking this though.
219200	220200	Stay...
224800	229900	This was the devious licks trend, which caused pandemonium over schools in the US.
229900	234500	Students began stealing from their school and posting it under the hashtag devious licks,
234500	236700	amassing millions of views.
236700	242100	The algorithm pushed this because its main purpose is to increase engagement and keep you on the app.
242100	244500	Millions of dollars worth of property damage later,
244500	250200	and after rounds of negative publicity, TikTok finally removed the hashtag but the damage was done.
250200	256500	This proves that millions of people can be pushed to do something just by having it show up repeatedly in their feeds.
256600	260600	No wonder why we are losing the ability to be creative and critically think.
260600	263500	If everything we do is simply what we've seen on social media,
263500	266900	are we truly unique or simply carbon copies of what's trending?
266900	273700	There are even services available that allow you to purchase likes and followers on TikTok, Reddit, and many other social media platforms,
273700	277700	leading many to question how organic these trending pages are, if at all.
277700	280100	Comparison is the thief of joy,
280100	285200	and in this attention economy, all we ever do is compare because that's what these apps promote.
285200	286000	Think about it.
286000	291300	When's the last time you've seen the TikTok algorithm promote a healthy lifestyle filled with purpose and meaning,
291300	293700	rather than vanity and avarice?
293700	296900	In fact, according to TikTok's own internal documents,
296900	304500	they instructed moderators to suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform,
304500	307500	reducing a human being to our most primal of instincts.
307500	308700	Looks.
308700	313000	Social media is causing body dysmorphia at record rates never seen before.
313000	319900	Apps like Facetune, which are used to enhance photos, are exploding on the App Store, garnering hundreds of millions of downloads.
319900	327800	In fact, Facetune recently raised $130 million from investors after 90% growth in their user base during lockdowns.
327800	334000	The constant push for unrealistic and frankly impossible beauty standards is causing many to feel depressed and anxious,
334000	338400	pushing them towards plastic surgery, which is booming like never seen before.
338400	343500	All this is destroying people's self-esteem, causing them to hate themselves and their genetics,
343500	348000	reducing us to a lifestyle of eat, sleep, and scroll, day in and day out,
348000	353000	wasting our life force enriching and envying others while doing nothing to improve ourselves.
353000	357400	Imagine a life without social media, a life filled with purpose and meaning,
357400	360700	a life where we're free from the constant competition and envy,
360700	366000	a life that we can have simply by turning off our screens and returning to the way we've always lived.
