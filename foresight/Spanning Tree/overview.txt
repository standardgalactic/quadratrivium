1. **Deleting Keys in B Trees**: When we try to delete a key from a node in a B tree, but the resulting number of keys is below the minimum threshold, we cannot simply remove the key because it might lead to violating the B tree property that each parent node must act as a separator between its child nodes.

2. **Handling Shortage of Keys**: To resolve this issue, if a node has fewer keys than the minimum after deletion, we need to borrow from one of its sibling nodes. Specifically:
   - If the sibling is full or already has fewer keys due to previous deletions, we merge the node with its sibling, doubling the capacity of both nodes and preserving the B tree properties. This might cause a cascade of merges up the tree if the parent node also ends up with too few keys after this merge.
   - If the sibling has enough space (i.e., it's not at minimum capacity), we take the smallest key from the right sibling (or the largest key from the left sibling) and insert it into our node to make room, effectively borrowing from its sibling. This key becomes the new separator between the merged nodes.

3. **Deletion in Non-Leaf Nodes**: If we need to delete a key that is not in a leaf node, we face an additional challenge because the key also serves as a separator for two subtrees. In this case:
   - We identify a new separator by either taking the largest value from the left subtree or the smallest value from the right subtree. This new separator must be greater than all keys in the left subtree and smaller than all keys in the right subtree.
   - After identifying the new separator, we proceed with the deletion as if the key to be deleted was in a leaf node, but remembering that the new separator now plays the role of the deleted key.

4. **Maintaining B Tree Properties**: Throughout the deletion process, we must ensure that:
   - Each node maintains at least the minimum number of keys.
   - Each non-root node is the root of a subtree and has all its keys less than or greater than its parent's key.
   - The tree remains balanced, with heights roughly equal from the root to the leaves.

5. **Overall Efficiency**: B trees are designed to be efficient for both insertions and deletions by allowing nodes to split and merge as needed. This flexibility ensures that the tree can handle a wide range of data without significant performance degradation, making B trees a popular choice for database indexing and file systems.

In summary, deleting keys in a B tree involves carefully handling cases where the node from which the key is deleted or a subsequent node along the path to the root ends up with fewer keys than the minimum required. This is managed through borrowing from sibling nodes, merging nodes, and identifying new separators when necessary, all while preserving the B tree's properties and maintaining its balance and efficiency.
