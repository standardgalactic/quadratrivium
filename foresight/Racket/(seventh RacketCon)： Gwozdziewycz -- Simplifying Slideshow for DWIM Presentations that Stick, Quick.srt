1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our next and final talk, this is Andrew Goshevitz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
He's impressed that I could pronounce his name.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
After only two hours of practice.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He's going to tell us about slideshow.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now we've seen lots of talks.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Those of us who write talks with slideshow, we recognize them all.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's various telltale signs.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But some people haven't written their talks in slideshow.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I can only assume it's because it isn't simple enough.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Perhaps Andrew is going to help us with this problem.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's welcome him.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Keep talking. Automatically.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, there.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Eat the mic.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Eat the mic.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So I'm Andrew.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's kind of the phonetic.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you haven't seen the 12 letters that make up my name,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and you look at it, there it is.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I work on a time series database and monitoring system at Heroku.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We just go.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't really like go.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But okay.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I've dabbled with Lisp, a common Lisp scheme,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
closure probably since about 2005 or so.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And I've written a lot of stuff,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but none of it's ever really been, you know,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
it's never really stuck.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So a couple of jobs ago,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I did manage to get a closure app in production,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but it was decommissioned maybe six months after I left.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, but I often ask myself why,

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
like why do people not understand why I like Lisp so much?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Any flavor.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And, you know, do people believe it's not practical?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do people, are people so hard to change?

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are, am I just horribly unsuccessful at marketing?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, where are the marketing people?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are there any marketing people in the room?

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, okay.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then there's the reactions that you get when you talk about it.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lots of something, something parentheses, you know.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So then there's the claims like this,

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which are totally on the money, you know,

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but maybe we should pick racket instead.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That would be pretty awesome, right?

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the success of closure proves

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that parentheses blindness is a thing, you know.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
People can overlook parentheses.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And it proves that given the right set of conditions,

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
a Lisp can actually thrive in production and, you know, and work.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And, you know, it can overcome the barriers to adoption.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I have to ask myself, what are racket's barriers to adoption?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are my barriers to adoption?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why am I not writing real programs in racket yet?

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And, you know, when you think about it,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you think about the established code bases that are out there.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They don't really work well with racket.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A Ruby code base doesn't work with racket.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A Go code base doesn't work with racket.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's an established norm.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If someone does a project in Rails,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
then the next project is going to be in Rails

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
because they already have the leverage of that.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And there's already this established bias against Lisp to begin with.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I've started taking a second avenue towards my own personal adoption,

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which I hope helps in the workplace as well.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I think some of you got it.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But if you didn't get it, this is the Manhattan subway.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They recently added a second avenue line.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I'm slowly using a racket to create sharp tools, you know?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And, you know, if I need a script for text processing,

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll just go to racket.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think maybe it does, but maybe not.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It would be pretty cool if it did.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Maybe your next project will is a better awk.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I definitely use it for a desktop calculator.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I asked on the list recently about diagramming.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've got some interesting answers.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm really looking at exploring what we can do with that next.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There's already data analysis tools and plot 2D,

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
R-like experience type stuff.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Interested in thinking about how I can incorporate that into some of the stuff I do.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's rash, of course.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm kind of an e-shell guy myself.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Some bash.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But I think rash is super interesting.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then, you know, for the documentation that I'm supposed to be writing,

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think I should just be using Scribble.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thinking about, like, diagramming and things like that as part of Scribble would just be amazing.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I'm going to try that next week.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, racket already has great tooling.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I mean, there's no way to deny that.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can already do so much today that I need to do.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And the ecosystem is evolving.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The community is growing.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's books coming out.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Beautiful racket is great.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've heard of a new book about web programming and racket that's coming out soon.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it's maybe just an e-book.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Things are just super looking up.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So preparing presentations is hard.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I'm a principal engineer at work,

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
so that kind of means that I'm supposed to know what's going on, I guess.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think maybe opinion leader would be a little bit more apt of a title,

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but, you know, whatever.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I choose to give internal talks and talk about what it is that's happening,

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
what I'm thinking about.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And sometimes, you know, even in a meeting,

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I need to quickly come up with something to present, you know,

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
just quickly do that, which isn't always easy.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And it'd be nice to do that with a lot of fuss.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So when I typically prepare a presentation,

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I kind of write out what it is I want to say,

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and then, you know, spend way too much time

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
thinking about how do I turn that into slides.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so I thought Racket has slideshow.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Maybe that can help.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And so a quick story about that.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So in May, I signed up for a talk at San Diego DevOps,

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
which was, at the time, a local meetup for me.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I procrastinated on slides until just hours before, as one does.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And then I chose to do it in slideshow.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The laughter says so much.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ironically, this is a JPEG, or this is a PNG, not a GIF.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So slideshow is immensely powerful.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You've seen numerous examples of that today.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The fact that we were rendering video live in slideshow

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is amazing early this morning.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's powering this presentation right now,

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but it's certainly not simple.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I kind of like to think of it as more like hypercard light

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for experts, which is kind of ironic.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So I decided that maybe I could do something about that,

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
make the base case, make the simple case simpler.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And so I am introducing two slideshows, simple.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's really not much more than a read syntax

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that implements a slideshow module.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But who cares?

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It runs just like you would a normal slideshow presentation.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It even supports, you know, all of the things that slideshow supports.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It largely does what I mean without frustration.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So it's inspired by this tool sent by The Suckless Project.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If anybody has heard of that,

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think I've seen DWM use today.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's pretty good, slideshow simple that is.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's pretty good for the Takahashi method, which is slides like this.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know, like short slides that are one or two words long.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Lots of them.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm on slide 63.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Some Takahashi presentations are probably 500 slides in 40 minutes.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who knows?

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I mean, that's kind of crazy.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I like to think of slideshow simple as a tool for writing slideshows

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that are Takahashi inspired.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So we get a little more, a few more tricks.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So we've got numbered lists.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We've got bulleted lists.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Images of cats because no presentation is complete without one.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We get quotations.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Longer paragraphs kind of just do what I mean.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Just thanks to slideshow.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And sometimes, you know, you want to just borrow Robbie's slides.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So this is the closing slide from his ICFP 2014 talk.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is probably the only slide that I could find

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that didn't require about seven libraries.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This relies only on picked.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you, Robbie.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And so you can do that here.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The syntax, it's just plain text.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
One slide per paragraph, a line oriented.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And what that means is that the first couple of characters

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
tell you exactly what the slide is going to be.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The comments become speaker notes and they're Unix style.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Prefixing a line with a backslash allows you to quote

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and escape the initial characters.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So you can do an image with this.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So this is just bang and then the path to the image.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That list, it looks exactly like the list that I showed you before,

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but this is the syntax for a list.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Bulleted lists are that way.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you want to quote Wayne Gretzky, you can do that.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
With, you know, alligator equal or greater than

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
or whatever you want to call them.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then this is the same syntax we saw for Robbie's slide.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And you can kind of just embed arbitrary racket there.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So it makes simple slideshows trivial,

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
relatively frustration free on the average case.

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And that's what I'm going for.

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In fact, it's frustration free enough that I wrote

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the first version of this presentation with slides

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in mail.app in my bed before, you know, before I went to sleep.

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
E-mailed it to myself and it executed just fine.

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I think it's the case that tools exist to reduce barriers

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and make our lives simpler.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I've been making tools in racket and I think it makes a lot of sense.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's an existing ecosystem of really high quality

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and functional foundational libraries to leverage

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and build upon like slideshow, like picked, like racket gooey.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And since we all need tools to do our jobs, it only seems, you know,

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it only seems to be the case that if we start writing tools

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in racket, make people start using them,

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
maybe they'll start uncovering the reasons why they don't like

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Glysp, maybe we'll reduce their biases and start adopting

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
racket a little bit more in work.

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So I hope you'll give it a try.

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hope I've inspired you to figure out how you can utilize

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
racket to improve your life, reduce your barriers

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
at home, in the workplace, wherever you need to do things.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I just want to say thanks to the racket community.

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thanks for people for having me.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This has been great.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm really excited to be a part of this community.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thanks.

220
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Before we take questions, can you show the source to your duck?

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I was hoping you'd ask that.

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That was actually...

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So while he's catting the talk, we can queue up

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
another question, so just a minute.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Here, why don't I...

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh wait, that's probably not what I wanted to do.

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is why you need rash.

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is why I need rash, but more importantly,

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
it's easier to do when you're not holding a microphone.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So as you can see, there's the speaker notes

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that are right in there.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm immediately tempted to make it more complex

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
by having some syntax for say, repeat the slide from it out,

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but that's how we got where we are.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's take a real question now.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There's some duplication of that.

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There is one slide where I was telling the story.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, obviously, yeah, here it is.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So I wanted to kind of do the reveal,

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
which Racket has, or Slideshow has a nice way to do that.

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This doesn't, but it's just copy and paste, no big deal.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Question here.

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, so the question is...

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I could, that might actually work.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The question is, what did I choose to leave out?

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And the stuff that I left out is all of the stuff

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that I wouldn't need to use or wouldn't want to use

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
if I was preparing for a presentation

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
an hour before the presentation, right?

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Which, I mean, if I really need that,

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
then I probably shouldn't be preparing a presentation

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
an hour before.

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Another question?

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So the question is, does Slideshow

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
simple have standard cat, like standard fish?

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, but if we get something in Racket that, you know,

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
draws a cat, maybe there is one,

260
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
if there's a fish, maybe there's a cat,

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but I don't remember ever seeing one,

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
then you could do it the same way that I just did

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
the shocked face.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So we could probably make that simpler, too,

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
if we really, really wanted to.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Sounds like he wants a poor request.

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's take one more question in the back.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is there a way to configure things?

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, that sounds complicated.

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All right, on that note, let's thank Andrew one more time.
