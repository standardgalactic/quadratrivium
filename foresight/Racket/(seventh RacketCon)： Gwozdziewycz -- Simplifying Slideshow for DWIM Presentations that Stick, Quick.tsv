0	4000	Our next and final talk, this is Andrew Goshevitz.
4000	8000	He's impressed that I could pronounce his name.
8000	11000	After only two hours of practice.
11000	13000	He's going to tell us about slideshow.
13000	15000	Now we've seen lots of talks.
15000	18000	Those of us who write talks with slideshow, we recognize them all.
18000	20000	There's various telltale signs.
20000	24000	But some people haven't written their talks in slideshow.
24000	27000	And I can only assume it's because it isn't simple enough.
27000	30000	Perhaps Andrew is going to help us with this problem.
30000	33000	Let's welcome him.
39000	41000	Can you hear me?
41000	43000	Good.
43000	45000	Keep talking. Automatically.
45000	47000	Yes, there.
47000	48000	What?
48000	49000	Eat the mic.
49000	50000	Eat the mic.
50000	51000	Okay.
51000	52000	All right.
52000	55000	So I'm Andrew.
56000	58000	That's kind of the phonetic.
58000	61000	If you haven't seen the 12 letters that make up my name,
61000	64000	and you look at it, there it is.
64000	69000	So I work on a time series database and monitoring system at Heroku.
69000	71000	We just go.
71000	73000	I don't really like go.
73000	76000	But okay.
76000	80000	And I've dabbled with Lisp, a common Lisp scheme,
80000	84000	closure probably since about 2005 or so.
84000	86000	And I've written a lot of stuff,
86000	89000	but none of it's ever really been, you know,
89000	91000	it's never really stuck.
91000	95000	So a couple of jobs ago,
95000	98000	I did manage to get a closure app in production,
98000	102000	but it was decommissioned maybe six months after I left.
102000	105000	So, but I often ask myself why,
105000	109000	like why do people not understand why I like Lisp so much?
109000	111000	Any flavor.
112000	117000	And, you know, do people believe it's not practical?
117000	122000	Do people, are people so hard to change?
122000	126000	Are, am I just horribly unsuccessful at marketing?
126000	128000	Like, where are the marketing people?
128000	130000	Are there any marketing people in the room?
130000	132000	No, okay.
132000	136000	And then there's the reactions that you get when you talk about it.
137000	143000	Lots of something, something parentheses, you know.
143000	145000	So then there's the claims like this,
145000	147000	which are totally on the money, you know,
147000	149000	but maybe we should pick racket instead.
149000	152000	That would be pretty awesome, right?
152000	157000	So the success of closure proves
157000	160000	that parentheses blindness is a thing, you know.
160000	163000	People can overlook parentheses.
163000	165000	And it proves that given the right set of conditions,
165000	171000	a Lisp can actually thrive in production and, you know, and work.
171000	176000	And, you know, it can overcome the barriers to adoption.
176000	179000	So I have to ask myself, what are racket's barriers to adoption?
179000	181000	What are my barriers to adoption?
181000	185000	Why am I not writing real programs in racket yet?
185000	187000	And, you know, when you think about it,
187000	190000	you think about the established code bases that are out there.
190000	193000	They don't really work well with racket.
193000	196000	A Ruby code base doesn't work with racket.
196000	200000	A Go code base doesn't work with racket.
200000	202000	There's an established norm.
202000	204000	If someone does a project in Rails,
204000	207000	then the next project is going to be in Rails
207000	211000	because they already have the leverage of that.
211000	217000	And there's already this established bias against Lisp to begin with.
217000	222000	So I've started taking a second avenue towards my own personal adoption,
222000	225000	which I hope helps in the workplace as well.
225000	227000	And I think some of you got it.
227000	230000	But if you didn't get it, this is the Manhattan subway.
230000	233000	They recently added a second avenue line.
233000	241000	So I'm slowly using a racket to create sharp tools, you know?
241000	246000	And, you know, if I need a script for text processing,
246000	250000	I'll just go to racket.
250000	252000	I think maybe it does, but maybe not.
252000	254000	It would be pretty cool if it did.
254000	260000	Maybe your next project will is a better awk.
260000	263000	I definitely use it for a desktop calculator.
263000	266000	I asked on the list recently about diagramming.
266000	268000	I've got some interesting answers.
268000	273000	I'm really looking at exploring what we can do with that next.
273000	277000	There's already data analysis tools and plot 2D,
277000	279000	R-like experience type stuff.
279000	284000	Interested in thinking about how I can incorporate that into some of the stuff I do.
284000	286000	There's rash, of course.
286000	288000	I'm kind of an e-shell guy myself.
288000	290000	Some bash.
290000	293000	But I think rash is super interesting.
293000	296000	And then, you know, for the documentation that I'm supposed to be writing,
296000	299000	I think I should just be using Scribble.
299000	306000	Thinking about, like, diagramming and things like that as part of Scribble would just be amazing.
307000	309000	So I'm going to try that next week.
309000	311000	So, racket already has great tooling.
311000	314000	I mean, there's no way to deny that.
314000	318000	I can already do so much today that I need to do.
318000	320000	And the ecosystem is evolving.
320000	322000	The community is growing.
322000	324000	There's books coming out.
324000	326000	Beautiful racket is great.
326000	332000	I've heard of a new book about web programming and racket that's coming out soon.
332000	334000	I think it's maybe just an e-book.
334000	337000	Things are just super looking up.
337000	340000	So preparing presentations is hard.
340000	343000	And I'm a principal engineer at work,
343000	347000	so that kind of means that I'm supposed to know what's going on, I guess.
347000	352000	I think maybe opinion leader would be a little bit more apt of a title,
352000	354000	but, you know, whatever.
354000	358000	And I choose to give internal talks and talk about what it is that's happening,
358000	360000	what I'm thinking about.
361000	364000	And sometimes, you know, even in a meeting,
364000	368000	I need to quickly come up with something to present, you know,
368000	372000	just quickly do that, which isn't always easy.
372000	375000	And it'd be nice to do that with a lot of fuss.
375000	378000	So when I typically prepare a presentation,
378000	381000	I kind of write out what it is I want to say,
381000	384000	and then, you know, spend way too much time
384000	387000	thinking about how do I turn that into slides.
387000	392000	And so I thought Racket has slideshow.
392000	394000	Maybe that can help.
394000	397000	And so a quick story about that.
397000	402000	So in May, I signed up for a talk at San Diego DevOps,
402000	405000	which was, at the time, a local meetup for me.
405000	411000	And I procrastinated on slides until just hours before, as one does.
411000	414000	And then I chose to do it in slideshow.
417000	421000	The laughter says so much.
421000	425000	Ironically, this is a JPEG, or this is a PNG, not a GIF.
425000	429000	So slideshow is immensely powerful.
429000	432000	You've seen numerous examples of that today.
432000	436000	The fact that we were rendering video live in slideshow
436000	440000	is amazing early this morning.
440000	443000	It's powering this presentation right now,
443000	445000	but it's certainly not simple.
445000	449000	I kind of like to think of it as more like hypercard light
449000	454000	for experts, which is kind of ironic.
454000	459000	So I decided that maybe I could do something about that,
459000	461000	make the base case, make the simple case simpler.
461000	467000	And so I am introducing two slideshows, simple.
467000	470000	It's really not much more than a read syntax
470000	475000	that implements a slideshow module.
475000	478000	But who cares?
478000	483000	It runs just like you would a normal slideshow presentation.
483000	488000	It even supports, you know, all of the things that slideshow supports.
488000	492000	It largely does what I mean without frustration.
492000	496000	So it's inspired by this tool sent by The Suckless Project.
496000	498000	If anybody has heard of that,
498000	503000	I think I've seen DWM use today.
503000	507000	And it's pretty good, slideshow simple that is.
507000	511000	It's pretty good for the Takahashi method, which is slides like this.
511000	515000	You know, like short slides that are one or two words long.
515000	516000	Lots of them.
516000	518000	I'm on slide 63.
518000	523000	Some Takahashi presentations are probably 500 slides in 40 minutes.
523000	524000	Who knows?
524000	526000	I mean, that's kind of crazy.
526000	534000	I like to think of slideshow simple as a tool for writing slideshows
534000	537000	that are Takahashi inspired.
537000	541000	So we get a little more, a few more tricks.
541000	543000	So we've got numbered lists.
543000	544000	We've got bulleted lists.
544000	548000	Images of cats because no presentation is complete without one.
548000	551000	We get quotations.
551000	555000	Longer paragraphs kind of just do what I mean.
555000	557000	Just thanks to slideshow.
557000	564000	And sometimes, you know, you want to just borrow Robbie's slides.
564000	571000	So this is the closing slide from his ICFP 2014 talk.
571000	575000	This is probably the only slide that I could find
575000	578000	that didn't require about seven libraries.
578000	580000	This relies only on picked.
580000	582000	Thank you, Robbie.
583000	586000	And so you can do that here.
586000	589000	The syntax, it's just plain text.
589000	592000	One slide per paragraph, a line oriented.
592000	595000	And what that means is that the first couple of characters
595000	598000	tell you exactly what the slide is going to be.
598000	603000	The comments become speaker notes and they're Unix style.
603000	609000	Prefixing a line with a backslash allows you to quote
609000	612000	and escape the initial characters.
612000	615000	So you can do an image with this.
615000	619000	So this is just bang and then the path to the image.
619000	623000	That list, it looks exactly like the list that I showed you before,
623000	626000	but this is the syntax for a list.
626000	629000	Bulleted lists are that way.
629000	632000	If you want to quote Wayne Gretzky, you can do that.
633000	638000	With, you know, alligator equal or greater than
638000	640000	or whatever you want to call them.
640000	645000	And then this is the same syntax we saw for Robbie's slide.
645000	649000	And you can kind of just embed arbitrary racket there.
649000	652000	So it makes simple slideshows trivial,
652000	655000	relatively frustration free on the average case.
655000	658000	And that's what I'm going for.
658000	661000	In fact, it's frustration free enough that I wrote
661000	664000	the first version of this presentation with slides
664000	669000	in mail.app in my bed before, you know, before I went to sleep.
669000	672000	E-mailed it to myself and it executed just fine.
672000	676000	So I think it's the case that tools exist to reduce barriers
676000	679000	and make our lives simpler.
679000	683000	I've been making tools in racket and I think it makes a lot of sense.
683000	687000	There's an existing ecosystem of really high quality
687000	692000	and functional foundational libraries to leverage
692000	699000	and build upon like slideshow, like picked, like racket gooey.
699000	703000	And since we all need tools to do our jobs, it only seems, you know,
703000	707000	it only seems to be the case that if we start writing tools
707000	710000	in racket, make people start using them,
710000	714000	maybe they'll start uncovering the reasons why they don't like
714000	718000	Glysp, maybe we'll reduce their biases and start adopting
718000	722000	racket a little bit more in work.
722000	724000	So I hope you'll give it a try.
724000	729000	I hope I've inspired you to figure out how you can utilize
729000	734000	racket to improve your life, reduce your barriers
734000	738000	at home, in the workplace, wherever you need to do things.
738000	742000	And I just want to say thanks to the racket community.
742000	745000	Thanks for people for having me.
745000	746000	This has been great.
746000	748000	I'm really excited to be a part of this community.
748000	749000	Thanks.
749000	760000	Before we take questions, can you show the source to your duck?
760000	761000	Yeah, absolutely.
761000	763000	I was hoping you'd ask that.
763000	767000	That was actually...
767000	771000	So while he's catting the talk, we can queue up
771000	775000	another question, so just a minute.
775000	780000	Here, why don't I...
780000	784000	Oh wait, that's probably not what I wanted to do.
784000	786000	This is why you need rash.
786000	790000	This is why I need rash, but more importantly,
790000	793000	it's easier to do when you're not holding a microphone.
793000	797000	So as you can see, there's the speaker notes
797000	799000	that are right in there.
799000	804000	I'm immediately tempted to make it more complex
804000	808000	by having some syntax for say, repeat the slide from it out,
808000	810000	but that's how we got where we are.
810000	812000	Let's take a real question now.
812000	814000	There's some duplication of that.
814000	817000	There is one slide where I was telling the story.
817000	820000	Yeah, obviously, yeah, here it is.
820000	827000	So I wanted to kind of do the reveal,
828000	831000	which Racket has, or Slideshow has a nice way to do that.
831000	836000	This doesn't, but it's just copy and paste, no big deal.
836000	838000	Question here.
838000	844000	Yeah, so the question is...
844000	847000	I could, that might actually work.
847000	850000	The question is, what did I choose to leave out?
850000	854000	And the stuff that I left out is all of the stuff
854000	857000	that I wouldn't need to use or wouldn't want to use
857000	861000	if I was preparing for a presentation
861000	863000	an hour before the presentation, right?
863000	867000	Which, I mean, if I really need that,
867000	870000	then I probably shouldn't be preparing a presentation
870000	872000	an hour before.
872000	876000	Another question?
876000	879000	No.
879000	882000	So the question is, does Slideshow
882000	886000	simple have standard cat, like standard fish?
886000	890000	No, but if we get something in Racket that, you know,
890000	892000	draws a cat, maybe there is one,
892000	894000	if there's a fish, maybe there's a cat,
894000	896000	but I don't remember ever seeing one,
896000	898000	then you could do it the same way that I just did
898000	900000	the shocked face.
900000	903000	So we could probably make that simpler, too,
903000	905000	if we really, really wanted to.
905000	907000	Sounds like he wants a poor request.
907000	909000	Let's take one more question in the back.
909000	912000	Is there a way to configure things?
912000	915000	No, that sounds complicated.
918000	921000	All right, on that note, let's thank Andrew one more time.
