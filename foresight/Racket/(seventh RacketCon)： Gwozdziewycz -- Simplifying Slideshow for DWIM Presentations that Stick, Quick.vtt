00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Our next and final talk, this is Andrew Goshevitz.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
He's impressed that I could pronounce his name.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
After only two hours of practice.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
He's going to tell us about slideshow.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Now we've seen lots of talks.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Those of us who write talks with slideshow, we recognize them all.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
There's various telltale signs.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
But some people haven't written their talks in slideshow.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And I can only assume it's because it isn't simple enough.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Perhaps Andrew is going to help us with this problem.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's welcome him.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Can you hear me?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Good.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Keep talking. Automatically.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes, there.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Eat the mic.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Eat the mic.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
All right.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
So I'm Andrew.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
That's kind of the phonetic.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
If you haven't seen the 12 letters that make up my name,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
and you look at it, there it is.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
So I work on a time series database and monitoring system at Heroku.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
We just go.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't really like go.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
But okay.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And I've dabbled with Lisp, a common Lisp scheme,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
closure probably since about 2005 or so.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And I've written a lot of stuff,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
but none of it's ever really been, you know,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
it's never really stuck.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So a couple of jobs ago,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I did manage to get a closure app in production,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
but it was decommissioned maybe six months after I left.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
So, but I often ask myself why,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
like why do people not understand why I like Lisp so much?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Any flavor.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
And, you know, do people believe it's not practical?

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Do people, are people so hard to change?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Are, am I just horribly unsuccessful at marketing?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Like, where are the marketing people?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Are there any marketing people in the room?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
No, okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And then there's the reactions that you get when you talk about it.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Lots of something, something parentheses, you know.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
So then there's the claims like this,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
which are totally on the money, you know,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
but maybe we should pick racket instead.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
That would be pretty awesome, right?

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
So the success of closure proves

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
that parentheses blindness is a thing, you know.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
People can overlook parentheses.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
And it proves that given the right set of conditions,

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
a Lisp can actually thrive in production and, you know, and work.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And, you know, it can overcome the barriers to adoption.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So I have to ask myself, what are racket's barriers to adoption?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
What are my barriers to adoption?

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Why am I not writing real programs in racket yet?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And, you know, when you think about it,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
you think about the established code bases that are out there.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
They don't really work well with racket.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
A Ruby code base doesn't work with racket.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
A Go code base doesn't work with racket.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
There's an established norm.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
If someone does a project in Rails,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
then the next project is going to be in Rails

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
because they already have the leverage of that.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
And there's already this established bias against Lisp to begin with.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
So I've started taking a second avenue towards my own personal adoption,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
which I hope helps in the workplace as well.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And I think some of you got it.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But if you didn't get it, this is the Manhattan subway.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
They recently added a second avenue line.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
So I'm slowly using a racket to create sharp tools, you know?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And, you know, if I need a script for text processing,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I'll just go to racket.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I think maybe it does, but maybe not.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It would be pretty cool if it did.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Maybe your next project will is a better awk.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I definitely use it for a desktop calculator.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I asked on the list recently about diagramming.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I've got some interesting answers.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm really looking at exploring what we can do with that next.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
There's already data analysis tools and plot 2D,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
R-like experience type stuff.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Interested in thinking about how I can incorporate that into some of the stuff I do.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
There's rash, of course.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm kind of an e-shell guy myself.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Some bash.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
But I think rash is super interesting.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And then, you know, for the documentation that I'm supposed to be writing,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I think I should just be using Scribble.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Thinking about, like, diagramming and things like that as part of Scribble would just be amazing.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So I'm going to try that next week.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So, racket already has great tooling.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I mean, there's no way to deny that.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I can already do so much today that I need to do.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And the ecosystem is evolving.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
The community is growing.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
There's books coming out.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Beautiful racket is great.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I've heard of a new book about web programming and racket that's coming out soon.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I think it's maybe just an e-book.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Things are just super looking up.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
So preparing presentations is hard.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And I'm a principal engineer at work,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
so that kind of means that I'm supposed to know what's going on, I guess.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I think maybe opinion leader would be a little bit more apt of a title,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
but, you know, whatever.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And I choose to give internal talks and talk about what it is that's happening,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
what I'm thinking about.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
And sometimes, you know, even in a meeting,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I need to quickly come up with something to present, you know,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
just quickly do that, which isn't always easy.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And it'd be nice to do that with a lot of fuss.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So when I typically prepare a presentation,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I kind of write out what it is I want to say,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and then, you know, spend way too much time

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
thinking about how do I turn that into slides.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And so I thought Racket has slideshow.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Maybe that can help.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And so a quick story about that.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
So in May, I signed up for a talk at San Diego DevOps,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
which was, at the time, a local meetup for me.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And I procrastinated on slides until just hours before, as one does.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
And then I chose to do it in slideshow.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
The laughter says so much.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Ironically, this is a JPEG, or this is a PNG, not a GIF.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
So slideshow is immensely powerful.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
You've seen numerous examples of that today.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
The fact that we were rendering video live in slideshow

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
is amazing early this morning.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
It's powering this presentation right now,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but it's certainly not simple.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I kind of like to think of it as more like hypercard light

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
for experts, which is kind of ironic.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
So I decided that maybe I could do something about that,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
make the base case, make the simple case simpler.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
And so I am introducing two slideshows, simple.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's really not much more than a read syntax

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
that implements a slideshow module.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
But who cares?

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
It runs just like you would a normal slideshow presentation.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
It even supports, you know, all of the things that slideshow supports.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
It largely does what I mean without frustration.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So it's inspired by this tool sent by The Suckless Project.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
If anybody has heard of that,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I think I've seen DWM use today.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
And it's pretty good, slideshow simple that is.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
It's pretty good for the Takahashi method, which is slides like this.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
You know, like short slides that are one or two words long.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Lots of them.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm on slide 63.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Some Takahashi presentations are probably 500 slides in 40 minutes.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Who knows?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I mean, that's kind of crazy.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
I like to think of slideshow simple as a tool for writing slideshows

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
that are Takahashi inspired.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
So we get a little more, a few more tricks.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
So we've got numbered lists.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
We've got bulleted lists.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Images of cats because no presentation is complete without one.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
We get quotations.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Longer paragraphs kind of just do what I mean.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Just thanks to slideshow.

09:17.000 --> 09:24.000
And sometimes, you know, you want to just borrow Robbie's slides.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
So this is the closing slide from his ICFP 2014 talk.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
This is probably the only slide that I could find

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
that didn't require about seven libraries.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
This relies only on picked.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Thank you, Robbie.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And so you can do that here.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
The syntax, it's just plain text.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
One slide per paragraph, a line oriented.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And what that means is that the first couple of characters

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
tell you exactly what the slide is going to be.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
The comments become speaker notes and they're Unix style.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
Prefixing a line with a backslash allows you to quote

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
and escape the initial characters.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So you can do an image with this.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
So this is just bang and then the path to the image.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
That list, it looks exactly like the list that I showed you before,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
but this is the syntax for a list.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Bulleted lists are that way.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
If you want to quote Wayne Gretzky, you can do that.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
With, you know, alligator equal or greater than

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
or whatever you want to call them.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
And then this is the same syntax we saw for Robbie's slide.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
And you can kind of just embed arbitrary racket there.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
So it makes simple slideshows trivial,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
relatively frustration free on the average case.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
And that's what I'm going for.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
In fact, it's frustration free enough that I wrote

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
the first version of this presentation with slides

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
in mail.app in my bed before, you know, before I went to sleep.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
E-mailed it to myself and it executed just fine.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
So I think it's the case that tools exist to reduce barriers

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
and make our lives simpler.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
I've been making tools in racket and I think it makes a lot of sense.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
There's an existing ecosystem of really high quality

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
and functional foundational libraries to leverage

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
and build upon like slideshow, like picked, like racket gooey.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And since we all need tools to do our jobs, it only seems, you know,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
it only seems to be the case that if we start writing tools

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
in racket, make people start using them,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
maybe they'll start uncovering the reasons why they don't like

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Glysp, maybe we'll reduce their biases and start adopting

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
racket a little bit more in work.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So I hope you'll give it a try.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
I hope I've inspired you to figure out how you can utilize

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
racket to improve your life, reduce your barriers

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
at home, in the workplace, wherever you need to do things.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
And I just want to say thanks to the racket community.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Thanks for people for having me.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
This has been great.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm really excited to be a part of this community.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Thanks.

12:29.000 --> 12:40.000
Before we take questions, can you show the source to your duck?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, absolutely.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I was hoping you'd ask that.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
That was actually...

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
So while he's catting the talk, we can queue up

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
another question, so just a minute.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Here, why don't I...

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh wait, that's probably not what I wanted to do.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
This is why you need rash.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
This is why I need rash, but more importantly,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
it's easier to do when you're not holding a microphone.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
So as you can see, there's the speaker notes

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
that are right in there.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm immediately tempted to make it more complex

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
by having some syntax for say, repeat the slide from it out,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
but that's how we got where we are.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's take a real question now.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
There's some duplication of that.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
There is one slide where I was telling the story.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, obviously, yeah, here it is.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
So I wanted to kind of do the reveal,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
which Racket has, or Slideshow has a nice way to do that.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
This doesn't, but it's just copy and paste, no big deal.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Question here.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, so the question is...

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I could, that might actually work.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The question is, what did I choose to leave out?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
And the stuff that I left out is all of the stuff

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
that I wouldn't need to use or wouldn't want to use

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
if I was preparing for a presentation

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
an hour before the presentation, right?

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Which, I mean, if I really need that,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
then I probably shouldn't be preparing a presentation

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
an hour before.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Another question?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
No.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
So the question is, does Slideshow

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
simple have standard cat, like standard fish?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
No, but if we get something in Racket that, you know,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
draws a cat, maybe there is one,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
if there's a fish, maybe there's a cat,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
but I don't remember ever seeing one,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
then you could do it the same way that I just did

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
the shocked face.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
So we could probably make that simpler, too,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
if we really, really wanted to.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Sounds like he wants a poor request.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Let's take one more question in the back.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Is there a way to configure things?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
No, that sounds complicated.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
All right, on that note, let's thank Andrew one more time.
