1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
Well, welcome everyone. It's lovely to see so many people from all around the world and

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,000
it's really an enormous pleasure to introduce tonight's speakers. I'm keen to get out of

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,960
the way as quick as I can tonight, not to steal their time. Just briefly to say who

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,280
we are and what the context of this event. Perspectiva recently celebrated its seventh

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,280
birthday. We're a charity based in London and we play with our elevator pitches and

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,880
they change over the years. But the essence of it is that we're interested in the relationship

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,880
between three kinds of world. The inner world of the human being, the psyche, the soul,

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,960
the spirit is very important to us. We see it as something sort of culturally neglected,

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,560
something we need to understand better. But we also want to have that in conversation

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,000
with complex systems at scale, the economy, politics, technology and so on. And we're

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,560
interested in how all of this plays out in society and contexts like this when we're

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,760
trying to navigate together what's going on and make sense of the world. So our tagline

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,520
is systems, souls and society as a way of covering the kinds of relationship we're

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,800
trying to make sense of. And that's reflected in our public conversations like this one.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
But we're also a publisher and although we won't announce all the details now, we do

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,880
have some very good news about a significant ramping up of our publishing arm next year

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,320
based on a grant that we earned and this year just passed. So watch the space for further

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,080
perspective of books to explore these themes in greater detail. And we also can announce

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,480
that in June we have the Realization Festival perspective or co-founders of that with St

20
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,200
Giles House. That's right at the end of June. And we have already confirmed to speaker

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,880
Ron Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. And there are other things to share. We have

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,120
a perspective of a community you can find online. And we do have a sub-stack if you're

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,720
interested in our writing and we publish ourselves but also bringing other people to share the

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,200
space with us. So do check out perspective of a sub-stack. And if you want to support

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,000
us as a charity, not least at Christmas, do consider becoming a paid subscriber. That

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,320
really helps a lot. So, well, Ian and Alastair are people I know personally, but let me just

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,480
share who they are to the outside world. First of all, Ian is, I think, one of not many people

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,960
who can reasonably be called polymath. And he has a background as a literary scholar

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,800
and not just, you know, read a few books but actually taught literature for seven odd years

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,520
I believe. So a really deep grounding in the humanities subsequently became more interested

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:54,520
in science for a period of time and later became a neuropsychiatrist, to put it technically

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,520
correct, I think. And that led to, over the years, to him realizing one big thing, one

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,760
really big idea that I've jokingly called the McGillchrist maneuver, but it's based

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,120
on the hemispheric hypothesis, an understanding of the different hemispheres of the brain,

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,280
not so much what they do but how they are and what follows for how they attend to the

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,800
world and the world that's brought into being as a result and everything that follows from

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,400
that. And we're very, very proud to publish his book, The Matter With Things. If you don't

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,640
have it already, it's a mammoth two-volume book but very highly recommended and I hope

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
tonight's event at least doesn't discourage you from buying it and hopefully, you know,

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,000
send you on your way. Alastair is, well, I know him most recently as someone who took

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,640
my son's fishing and I share that with all candor because it gets to the heart of the

42
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,560
man, I think. He wanted them younger generation, he knew they were coming through Scotland,

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,800
we were not so far away. He wanted to show them where the food came from, took them out

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,080
on his boat. The delight in my son's was off the charts and it's a sort of testament

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,320
to Alastair's grounded spirituality that he's very much interested in questions of

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,000
meaning and purpose and the sacred but at the same time extremely earthbound, giving a great

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
deal of his time, energy and attention and brilliant mind to significant issues of land reform

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,520
and protecting those who can't always protect themselves, speaking up for those who are in

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,000
poverty and fighting on their behalf. So an extraordinary mind and heart and it's really

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,720
an enormous pleasure to bring these two wonderful people together. And tonight, we are technically

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000
part of the series, Attention as a Moral Act, which this is now the ninth chapter of that. However,

52
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,200
I've given complete permission, not that they needed it, to speak about whatever they wanted to

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,000
and I know that over the last few days, since we decided on this event quite last minute,

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,760
only about a week ago, there's been some sending of books across Scotland on both parties

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,600
and they're both studying each other's work. So I want to leave it to them to follow the

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,240
conversation. The title is First Principles and Second Sight and I'll leave it to them to decide

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,280
where to go with that. And whoever feels most moved to speak first, you're welcome to do so.

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
I will join you again in about an hour. Take care and forward to listening. Over to you, Alastair and Ian.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Will I listen? Here we are. Here we are at last, which is wonderful. And you've got a,

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm drinking the fine telescope, but I think you're drinking a little known whiskey called the

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:48,320
Hera. I wanted to say we're allowed to do this. But my daughter, who is a clinical new psychologist

62
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,320
you might be interested to know, she sent me a bottle of the Hera, which you'll see,

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,800
one that is newly produced in the house. So I will have a small drop of this while we are

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:14,800
talking. Let's not go wild. Very much to you, Alastair, and to our listeners too.

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:23,680
So I wanted to, I mean, I didn't make this title, I think Jonathan did, but it occurred to me as I

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,760
was reading your work that it had something quite interesting to say about the Scottish mind, because

67
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,000
in your book, I found that you quoted, I can't remember the name of the man,

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:45,840
Pharah, who said that there was a Caledonian antizygie, which is a lovely word. Sizzigie means

69
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,560
a coincidence of opposites, and he could have got away with that really. But there is something about

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,280
the scots that is puzzling. You know, my dad was a scot, and he was a very down-to-earth sort of

71
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,080
scot. And he said the thing about the scots is they're very hardworking, they're very precise,

72
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
they're very down-to-earth, they make great engineers and doctors and so on.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,960
And yes, that's true in a way, but there's another completely different side to the scots,

74
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,120
isn't there? And that's the bit that encompasses second sight. So they do nice to do this split,

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,400
and it occurred to me, perhaps you'd like to pick me up on this or not, but there's something here

76
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,320
that reminds me of my feeling about the Germans, that they're both, you know, magnificently precise

77
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,080
and make very good engineers, but they were also really the first romantic.

78
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,640
Well, what a way to plunge in. If I might say, first of all, for people who don't know

79
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,960
your book in double volumes, I mean, look at the sickness of that, nearly 1600 pages of that,

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:57,200
with things. You're deeply wrestling with that problem as a philosopher. I'm not coming at it

81
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:05,920
as a philosopher, I'm coming at it more from a poetic perspective and a culturally rounded

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,240
perspective, an experiential perspective. What you were doing in the 1600 pages, which I should say,

83
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
I've only skimmed, I've only had it for a couple of days, I've just skimmed it.

84
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,760
You're very badly behaved because there are some chapters to which you gave no conclusions.

85
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:33,920
I had to presume that they are inconclusive. I only gave conclusions to the first part,

86
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,440
because it's science, and I wanted people who weren't comfortable with the science

87
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,920
just to get the drift. Anyway, yeah. What you're doing is you're putting so many

88
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,320
strands together, you're coming at it from a new psychiatric basis, which is fascinating.

89
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,120
You're also going into the philosophy of time, into wave motion, physics, the whole shebang.

90
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,320
You're doing so in a way that gives a wonderful grounding in these disciplinary areas for people

91
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,800
who haven't got it. The person who came to mind, as I was reading you, was Clarence Glacken,

92
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:21,200
Tracy's and the Rhodian show. When I was a student at Aberdeen in our first year geography classes,

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,840
that was one of the set books. It's often been remarked that Glacken, who said that it was when

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:35,200
the shipwrecked soldiers came ashore on roads, and he saw geometric patterns on the sand, knew

95
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,800
that this must be a sign that there were human beings here, because who else could make geometric

96
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,960
patterns on the sand? And it's often been said that Glacken was one of the last of the scholars

97
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,000
who could really pull together an immense interdisciplinary perspective and bring it

98
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,280
to bear in the matters of the world. And that, it seems to me, he wasn't the last, but you're doing

99
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,720
that here. Now, I hugely congratulate you for what you were doing, but you asked me there about the

100
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:18,080
Caledonian anti-sissigy, A-S-E-I-S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y anti-sissigy. It's a philosophy's gift to scrabble.

101
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,120
And basically, this was an idea that Professor G. Gregory Smith came up with in his book,

102
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Scottish Literature, published in 1919, in which he said there were two moods in the Scottish psyche.

103
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,080
On the one hand, as your father just said, there is the engineer, the mathematician, the accountant.

104
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:49,360
On the other hand, there is this crazy world, as he puts it, where you are tossed in the horns

105
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,120
of Earthland, the imaginal world. And I think in many respects, what he is describing there

106
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,200
is what you describe when you speak of the left and right hemisphere, the left hemisphere,

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,480
the mechanic, the engineer, the doctor, etc., the right hemisphere, the artist, the musician,

108
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,760
the one who is away with the fairies. You could see it that way, but of course,

109
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,480
as you and I know, the fairies are not to be taken lightly, so that it's not a matter of

110
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,720
being somehow scooped up into some unrealistic fantasy. I believe that there's something

111
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,480
in the Scottish psyche, and you have more than I have because you grew up here, but I know stories

112
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:50,400
of and have had some experiences of people making unbelievably unlikely prophecies that turned out

113
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:58,400
to be entirely true. They were able to see things here, and my partner is of Scottish descent,

114
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,960
and she has her head screwed on, don't think otherwise, but she has the most amazing

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,760
capacity for a second sight, which she takes very much in her stride, but it is something

116
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,280
that is very real, I think, and we only don't recognise it because if you stop believing in

117
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,480
something and stop attending to it, you don't see it anymore. The faculty for seeing it withers,

118
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,600
you can't do it anymore. We need to ask, why is this important? Because here we are,

119
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,600
we've got 500 odd people on here just now, and we're diving straight into the fairies in the

120
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,440
second sight, which most philosophers would not take incredibly. Most philosophers would think

121
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,520
we are off the wall in this, and why are we taking it so importantly? That we're talking about first

122
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,160
principles and second sight. We're talking here about epistemology. In the warm-up here, I said to

123
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,920
you that right beside me here, I didn't have a plan, this is just on the shelf, I have the Institute

124
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,360
of Metaphysics by the Professor of Moral Philosophy at St Andrews University, he was writing this

125
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:25,040
in 1875, and Beria invented the word epistemology, which is about the theory of what knowledge is

126
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,640
and how knowledge is structured. How do we know what we think we know? What is the meaning that

127
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,960
gives meaning to meaning? Is there any sense in what we say, these kind of questions? And we're

128
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,240
diving straight into second sight here. You're speaking to me from Taliske House in Sky, I have

129
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,040
here, this was planned, a book recently published in Sky by Steve Taylor, the seer,

130
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,840
Visions, Dreams and Prophecy, I Love Sky and the Heprides. Now I know two of the now deceased seers,

131
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,760
or I knew two of them in here, two of them are good friends of mine, Norman McLeod of Bridgehouse

132
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
and Harris, and Taukel McLeod of Grim Shadow, the next village to me in the Isle of Lewis. So I've

133
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,640
sat with these people and had first hand accounts of their seership. Why does this matter? Because

134
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,360
if we are concerned with first principles, what is real? What is reality? Anomalous phenomena,

135
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,680
like these telepathic, clairvoyant type, precognitive phenomena, are of huge importance,

136
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,400
and they may not appear to, to many of the people listening to us just now, because of how they

137
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,800
might be situated culturally. But as you've already indicated Ian, if you are living in an

138
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:53,360
indigenous culture, such as those of the Heprides, then you cannot not be aware of it. No, you cannot

139
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,040
not be aware. And so you've got to factor this, you can either deny your own culture, and indeed

140
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,520
deny you, as you've just indicated, deny your own reality. Or, well then you're in a state of denial.

141
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,680
We're talking about very, really, when I was 18, I had failed my first year of physics

142
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,400
at Aberdeen University, I had to reset it, and sitting there swatting in my father's,

143
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,760
well, surgery, because the doctor's house and the surgery were united then, so I was sitting in

144
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,400
the, you know, in our surgery house at Glenmore in North Lawson Lewis. And my father was ill,

145
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,880
he was away in Rigmore, he was in hospital there, and my mother had driven off from the car to go

146
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,680
to Stornoway, seven miles away, she went there nearly every day, this was not unusual, and she

147
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,040
was going to go and fly over to Inverness and visit him in Rigmore. And about 10 minutes after

148
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,800
she left, there's me sitting studying my physics texts, and I look up, only to see my father's

149
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:15,520
beloved whippet dog, Sheba, who he had rescued from abuse, jump up out of the ditch, run it for

150
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:25,120
several, and smack into a passing fan and killed outright. I ran out, I told the driver, I'd seen

151
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,440
it, there was nothing he could do just to drive on, and I did what any rural child would have done

152
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,560
in that age, I went to the buyer, the cowshed, I got a hessian sack and a spade, placed Sheba's

153
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,880
limp body into it, and walked out to the moor to dig a hole and start burying her.

154
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,000
And I would say, although that I was 18, I psychologically regressed. I needed my mother

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,920
to be there, so that she could tell my father, because this was before, this was 1976, summer of

156
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,880
1974, the summer of 1974, I needed my mother to be there, so that she could pass the news,

157
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
because she couldn't just pick up a mobile phone and tell my dad in a hospital in those days.

158
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,080
And I'd no sooner got the whole dog. When my mother's car reappeared at high speed

159
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,800
over the brow of the hill, I ran towards it, she screeched to a halt, she got out looking white as

160
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:36,480
a ghost and shouted at me, what's the matter? I said, the dog's dead. She said, thank goodness,

161
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,680
I thought it might have been a child, she thought it might have been me or my sister.

162
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
She doubled back, managed to catch the plane to Inverness, got into Rakemoor, said to my dad in

163
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,600
his hospital bed, Ian, I've got bad news for you. I know he said it's Sheba, isn't it?

164
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,360
How did you know she said it? He said, because all last night, I kept on being awake,

165
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:10,160
walking up by Sheba, jumping up on my bed and pouring me. Now, Ian, when I tell that story in

166
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,720
Lewis, or if you told that story in Sky, people would tell you another couple of stories just

167
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,040
like it, quite likely some of it experienced themselves. And this is where what you writing

168
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:31,440
about time, you culminating with that, what is it, 114 pages or something chapter on the sacred

169
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,040
is so important because you're opening the ground for these things.

170
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,080
Well, I see them as separate really, but connected, if you know what I mean.

171
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:56,880
I have very little experience of paranormal phenomena directly. But I am quite clear that

172
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,720
there is a realm of the sacred and it is that that perhaps this in some ways bridges in many

173
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,560
people's lives. I mean, I sometimes say whenever original people in Australia say that they can hear

174
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
the voices of ancestors, that they can see things happening hundreds of miles away, which turn out

175
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,560
to be true, who are we to say that they can't do these things. And again, I think it's atrophy

176
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,960
of a faculty which we have taught ourselves not to use. Richard Dawkins, a man of whom you've no

177
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,400
doubt heard, has a dogma that children wouldn't normally think in terms of anything to do with

178
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,880
the sacred or the religious or particularly the paranormal, except it was drummed into them by

179
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,800
our culture. But the reality, which is, you know, I quote the scientific evidence for this is that

180
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,600
children when they're little automatically do think in these terms, and they only stop doing

181
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,560
when they go to school and find that it's no longer considered smart to talk like that.

182
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,800
So I think that's interesting. And a couple of other things that care to me. One is that you

183
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,360
in sending our initial exchange of emails, you weren't mind my mentioning that you said

184
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,960
that Johnson and Boswell when they were up here sort of mocked this. And I don't

185
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
to didn't remember that at all. In fact, I thought it was rather the opposite that they

186
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,080
had exactly the cast of mind that the proper scientific person should have, which is open,

187
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,440
there may be something here, and they would be interested in hearing more, but they weren't sure.

188
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,920
And they certainly weren't dismissive. And they were very impressed by the stories that they heard.

189
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,720
One story that I can tell, but then perhaps we can move on from second sight to more to do with

190
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,000
the more general sense of the sacred is, well, there are some things that are a bit too personal

191
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,800
to mention, but they're absolutely riveting. But one is from my partner, who was at the opera in

192
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,240
London, I think with her husband, and saw a friend that she knew who was in France,

193
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,920
who is there and said, what are you doing here? And I don't remember the rest of the conversation.

194
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,840
But the next day she got news from France that he had died. And I mean, she's not

195
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,800
my partner, given to seeing things as it were, or I mean, she's a very, very rational down to earth

196
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,440
person. And I find that people who have this faculty don't make a big thing out of it. They

197
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,280
take it along with their rationality. And I wish we were able to have this balanced way, this

198
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,360
sissigie of these two things, which complement one another. I remember in also reading something

199
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,000
I just want to mention that you told in part of your book about, I think you had a bus of 18

200
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,400
archaeologists and engineers you brought from Glasgow, Edinburgh, I can forget where,

201
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,920
and you were in the Chossacks, I think, I mean, you've got this wrong. And there was a big question

202
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:09,280
with a last about going out at a certain time, because this was the fairest time, the twilight,

203
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:17,680
the gloaming. And you went to a sheen, which is a kind of holy place for where you see fairies.

204
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,200
And you were there in your sleeping bag, and you looked out and you saw, well, you should perhaps

205
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,800
tell it, but you saw this disc of light that was close to the ground, and was coming down the path,

206
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,000
it was moving along the path, as though it were sort of walking almost, and came to you and went

207
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,880
back into the sheen. So I thought that was, let me say, at least very interesting and not to be

208
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,840
just dismissed. Well, I've had your two or three experiences like that, which I've written about

209
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,360
at various points, you're talking about my book, Portia's Pilgrimage, the book where I really go

210
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,120
into the nature of the spiritual and the spiritual embodied in the land. And what interests me about

211
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:15,840
these experiences is that this opens us up to the nature of imagination. And the question that I

212
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,840
address in Portia's Pilgrimage, do we merely have imaginations? Or are we moving in imagination?

213
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:32,160
Are we moving in cosmic imagination? And this is where you're writing, where you open a pathway

214
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:41,200
to profound interconnectedness in your analysis of time, and how it interacts with how you see the

215
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,760
right hemisphere of the brain is very relevant. Why does this matter? It matters because it's

216
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,120
about our relationality together. It raises the question whether we're parts of one another.

217
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,960
Yes, and when you have time to read my book, if you ever have time to read my book at Greater

218
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,680
Lank, you'll see that one of my grounding, in fact, probably the central message, is that everything

219
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,000
exists in relation, that relations are prior to the things that are related, which is why there

220
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,440
was a problem with things, because things are secondary to the relations that they exist in,

221
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
the network that they exist in. So I very much agree with that. And I think the important point

222
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,000
about imagination is one that you make using, I think, a now customer distinction between the

223
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,920
imaginary and the imaginal. But I would say that there is nothing fantastic about the imagination.

224
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,320
Words of some courage to very important figures for me intellectually made the big distinction

225
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,120
between fantasy and imagination. And fantasy takes you away from reality, but imagination

226
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,120
takes you into the depth of reality, so that you really see it. And I think what you're seeing and

227
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:10,720
what you're describing in Lewis is that meaning of the word imagination, not a fantasy world,

228
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,400
but a world more real than the one we imagined is the only real one.

229
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:26,400
And I'm thinking here, I recently read Henri Corbaill's work alone. So he was a great French

230
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:34,000
Islamist. And he's writing about the scholar Ibn Arabi. And he has this wonderful line that prayer

231
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:42,640
is the supreme act of the creative imagination. Yes, I love that. Creative and he capitalizes

232
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:52,240
creative imagination. That we pray to God or pray for God, God prays for us all in a oneness.

233
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,600
But before we dig into that further, can I ask you the question that fascinates me? Because

234
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:05,120
I spent a number of hours with your books, giving it, as I say. But I kept on wondering,

235
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,880
what is motivating you here? Because, I mean, you've reached the top of your career

236
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,640
in conventional neuropsychiatric terms and so on. You're clearly well positioned as a philosopher.

237
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,000
And yet the longest chapter in your book, over 100 pages, ends up being on the sacred,

238
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,160
which is the risky ground. What is motivating you? What experiences have you had that opens

239
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,320
you to the importance of this? Well, I don't know. I mean, I can describe experiences,

240
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,280
but really, I think what motivates me is something rather unusual and probably prejudicial to a career,

241
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,280
which is the truth. I mean, it sounds grand to say that. But I think the thing that we have most

242
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,760
importantly lost in our lives is any sense of truth. We now believe and say the most absurd

243
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,120
things that have ever been said by moderately intelligent human beings. We have lost track

244
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,160
of truth. Even in science, we are now being constrained by all kinds of things. You can't

245
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:16,080
say this, you mustn't do that. We are losing truth. And I wanted to be truthful to the reality. I was

246
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,840
trying to get that. This is my life's work, this book. And I was begged by philosophers who read

247
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,560
my book, not to write a chapter on the sacred, because he said the philosophy in these books is

248
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,000
very interesting. And it can be taken seriously. But if you write about the sacred, nobody will

249
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
take it seriously. And yet in many ways, what I'm writing about leads rationally to, I wanted to

250
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,160
take people who couldn't countenance any idea of the sacred or the divine, perfectly reasonable

251
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,920
position for many people nowadays, take them by the hand and show them things that are scientific

252
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,840
and that are reasonable and bring them by stages to a place where they could accept it or see it.

253
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,680
And one of the things I feel very much about this kind of neck of the woods is something

254
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,480
I can't put my finger on to do with the sacred, whether or not one sees it as specifically to do

255
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:18,480
with a religion or not is another matter. But in the very natural world here, which called to me to

256
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,960
come and live here, is something very, very special. People who come here say there is something,

257
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,120
there is a new man, there is a feeling, there is, I don't know what they call it, but there's a sort

258
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:39,280
of something that speaks. And I think that, and you can't deny that, I think, unless you willfully

259
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,760
blot it out. And I often ask myself the question, perhaps you can reflect a bit on this. Why did

260
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,360
those Celtic saints have to come so far to find peace and solitude? After all, in those days,

261
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,360
it was before Easy Jet, you didn't have to go too far from Londinium a few miles to find total

262
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,600
peace and seclusion. So what drove them through wildness, through adverse climate, through taking

263
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,440
their precious books on little coracles across the water, pushing on and on towards the outer rim

264
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,160
of the known world? What were they doing? Well, Sinterdammnen in his biography of St.

265
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Colomber, written a century after Colomber's death, around about 697, I think it was, he

266
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,880
testifies to that, he testifies to people coming from far and wide to go out in small books and

267
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,840
find little scaries, little rocks in the sea, where they could sit and be alone with God and nature

268
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:47,200
and pray for the world. You said about coming to telescope where you are just now, and I would

269
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,160
imagine it's probably a glass of telescope whiskey that you've got with your written also,

270
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,360
certainly have it in your cupboard. What else could it be? I actually did a naughty little bit

271
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,520
of homework here, because I dug out a poem by the Isle of Vassie poet, Sauli McLean, Samuel McLean.

272
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, talk about deep ecology. I dug out one of Sauli's poems called Tyon Beaches.

273
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:26,720
It's from his poems for Emma, who is the wife of Kuhulun, his mythical muse, his figure of love.

274
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,920
And I just need to explain some place meanings here. Telesca meaning the sloping rock,

275
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,880
the north, coming into the garlic there. Who are the story points? I know the bit you're going to

276
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:54,160
read. The bit of the reddish rock, the picture being painted here, is of the sloping rock and

277
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,000
then down on the sea, these two rocks and beside them there's the white sea churning in. Now listen

278
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,240
to this, you know what I'm going to read. Wonderful lines, but only read the first

279
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
stanza, because we haven't got time for the whole poem.

280
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,360
Don't worry, it's already a short bit. And pre-Charlie, is that how you pronounce it?

281
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,400
Pre-Charlie? Pre-Charlie?

282
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:27,520
Looks like an animal here. If we were in Telesca on the shore where the great white mouth opens

283
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:41,200
between two hard jaws, ruin and clash, and the bitter roar, I would stand beside the sea, renewing

284
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:51,920
love in my spirit while the ocean was filling Telesca Bay forever. I would stand there on the

285
00:31:51,920 --> 00:32:02,320
bareness of the shore until Prishul bowed his stallion head until the rocks are worn away.

286
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,800
That is the place we are living. That is the integration of people, poetry and nature.

287
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,880
It's mind-blowingly beautiful. I mean the poem, we mustn't give the impression the place is,

288
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,000
otherwise the place will be overrun by tourists, which we could never do.

289
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,120
You know, the other thing that I think is very relevant is that haunting line with which

290
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:43,280
he begins a poem about Halle, the ruined village there, and he begins,

291
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:52,880
time the deer is in the woods of Halle. And the interesting thing is, I hadn't really picked up

292
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:01,680
until reading you, actually, that the word deer and wild are one of the same in fear, meaning

293
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,760
the wildness and the deer. And the deer, you know, here I am, I'm sitting underneath the

294
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,880
fairy on the Christmas tree, and I'm sitting at the foot of the sheen, the fairy tale, as I talk

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,560
to you, metaphorically speaking, and the deer is a cattle of the fairies. Dr John McKinnis,

296
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:29,520
there's Michael Newton's book of film. Oh, too high up. You know, in his essay on the Supernatural

297
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,280
in the Gallic World, he says that fairy is a metaphor for the imagination. So in other words,

298
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,440
fairy is an indigenous way of talking about what you call my hemisphere.

299
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,120
Well, it's being open to whatever is listening and being honouring of whatever comes to you,

300
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,000
not constantly saying, but I know better, it's like this, I already know this, I'm going to put it

301
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,880
in my box of knowledge. And it's getting away from that that is in our world so difficult,

302
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:08,000
it's getting back to all that is meant by Jung's unconscious mind in which the powerful

303
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,360
symbols. And the thing about them is that once they're made explicit, they lose their power.

304
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:23,440
So they it's a deeply implicit, unexplicit knowledge. And that is why it will always seem

305
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,400
lacking or fantastic to somebody who's determined to dismiss it. And as Johnson himself said,

306
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,560
for those who want to be skeptical, there are many reasons and he lists them, but he also

307
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,200
beautifully says that there are other reasons for standing back from that position as well.

308
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,720
He was so wonderfully unpredictable man, he was in fact, in some ways, the first romantic,

309
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,000
the first appreciator of Shakespeare. And he was also a rational thinker, a very down-to-earth man,

310
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,360
he managed to bridge these worlds we're talking about. And I'm honoured that he came and stayed

311
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,560
in my house. And it's not many people. He came out two nights in your house. He did. And he just

312
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,440
slept in what was then called the Low Bedroom, which is now my library. And as I say, not many

313
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,520
people can say that Dr. Johnson slept in that library. So you put me right on that because I

314
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,160
had picked up that Johnson was a bit incredulous. And what he says basically is that some people

315
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,120
are incredulous about it. But as you rightly corrected me, he himself was very open to what

316
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,840
he was seeing there. And to his reflection on Martin Martin, who wrote about 40 pages on the

317
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,040
second site. Can we take this to a slightly different level? Because one of the feelings

318
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,640
that I had reading or skimming your book Ian, is that it was as if there was a gradually

319
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:55,600
sloping swimming pool going into unfathomably deep water at the deep end. And you were taking

320
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,080
you a reader in each of your chapters by the hand and leading them round to the deep end

321
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,240
and saying this is actually real. This is where you swim. This is where you swim. This is where you

322
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,240
learn to dive. This is where you even perhaps learn to breathe underwater. Is that... Well, thank you

323
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:24,480
for saying that. I think that's exactly what I hoped. So I'm delighted, thrilled that you feel that.

324
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,400
But I feel that you're taking people to the same place just by a different means, a more

325
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,400
narrative and more poetic means. I mean, after all, one of the things that is so central to your

326
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:46,640
work, I mean, the title Soil and Soul itself tells us is this link, two links, really. One is between

327
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,480
the earth and whatever is above and beyond it. And the other is to the sense of the place,

328
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,600
the importance of place. And that's something we've been taught no longer to feel an allegiance

329
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:08,560
to a place. It's not fashionable. It doesn't fit with the post industrialized society where we were

330
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,320
all uprooted and taken away from our culture and thrown into a hugamugga world in a city

331
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,880
where we had to reinvent meaning because those meanings had been left behind deep in the places

332
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,240
that we came from. And you know, one of the things that staggered me when I was writing The Master

333
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:37,040
and his emissary was to discover that animals such as rats bond as much with their nest as they do

334
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:45,200
with their mother. So their nest is like their mother. I mean, that's pretty important. And your

335
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,120
work unveils this what's there in this landscape. I found myself and you mentioned this concept,

336
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:57,360
which I hadn't heard of. I will get the pronunciation probably wrong. Is it Keanalas?

337
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,840
Keanalas, yes, a deep yearning, a kind of homesickness for place, a yearning, a longing for your

338
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,080
place of belonging. And you know, all the cultures that have not been uprooted and

339
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,480
deracinated and thrown around the world have this feeling. And it's not just a useless yearning.

340
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,680
It's a sense of connection, a longing, which literally means a stretching out of yourself

341
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,880
from someplace that you wish to be close to again. See if Lewis writes very well about this.

342
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,520
Well, you know from soil and soil that my best known work is just land reform.

343
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,240
And my involvement in the 1990s was the organization that brought egg. And I mean,

344
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
you will look out your window. Can you see it from where you are?

345
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,840
Not, no, it's from the other end of the island, but I can.

346
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,360
You've probably got rum, but the mountains have rum just blocking.

347
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,160
You can see rum. You can see rum if you're up on the lights.

348
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,080
Just behind, just behind. I know.

349
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,440
So to me, I suppose having drawn up in the Isle of Lewis and having experienced real life

350
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,680
communities of place. And then as a young man, when I was 22, being sent by voluntary service

351
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,080
overseas to Papua New Guinea and finding exactly the same cultural understanding of community

352
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,600
in Papua New Guinea, as we had in Lewis, to the extent it helped me understand my own home

353
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:24,560
place properly for the first time. You know, you don't see the water till it steps into a different

354
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:35,280
water. That experience opened me to this work with people in place, which I think

355
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,520
is germane to our modern environmental predicament, that we have become de-racinated,

356
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,680
or as Anthony Gooden's sociologist puts it, disembedded from the place of our embeddedness.

357
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,440
And so one of the practical applications of the kind of work I'm doing and that you're doing

358
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,440
is the ways in which it can help to re-embed us.

359
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,880
We need to be re-embedded. We need seriously to be re-embedded in place and in time. These are

360
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,440
the two things that are most important in where we are in this world. And I don't mean that they

361
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,040
should confine us, but in fact, they liberate us into this other world that we're talking about.

362
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,440
It's through them that we find the greater, the eternal, the whatever. We don't do it by turning

363
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,600
our backs on place and time, but by inhabiting them. And it's the continuity of time, i.e. those

364
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,880
who came before us and those who will come after us, and the continuity of place that have been

365
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:45,120
disrupted for us and have made us, I don't know what to say, pilgrims wanderers, people who are

366
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:55,360
fleeing from their own being. The theory on top of my free hands be down just a very book.

367
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,800
And here's what they do as time is. And there is a wonderful line early on in the time is

368
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,640
where Socrates, I think it is, defines time as being a moving image of eternity,

369
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:19,520
a moving image of eternity. And when I first read that at the age of 20, early 20s, it kind of blew

370
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:27,760
my mind because it is so much the sense of time that you get in Hebridean religious people. We're

371
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,360
talking here of free church, free church of Scotland, those sort of people that are the

372
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,800
indigenous people of the communities. Earlier, I mentioned the retired policeman now passed away,

373
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,640
Norman the Loud of Bridgehouse of Harris, and he wrote, I forget my single page of notes for

374
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,920
tonight, so I could quote him exactly. But I've got him quoted in Poachers Pilgrimage, where I

375
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,720
discussed my meeting with him, in which he's describing to me the vision, the second site

376
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,960
vision he had of events in the Falkland war several weeks before they happened. And eventually,

377
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,520
he was so afflicted with the second site, that he prayed to God to have it taken away from him.

378
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,440
And as Steve Taylor in this book that I mentioned here, there's got a whole chapter on Norman says,

379
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,440
and indeed, as Norman's own daughter told me, when she came to a talk I gave in Brunbecula

380
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,880
a few years ago, that was successful. He was then relieved of the predicament of seeing what was

381
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,960
going to happen to people before it happened. But Norman said, yeah, isn't it interesting,

382
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,960
isn't it? Because Norman said to me, he was criticizing a book by Ludovic Kennedy in which

383
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,680
Oh, yes, yes, I read that bit, yes, yes, yes. But carry on, yes, yes.

384
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,360
And, you know, Kennedy was poo-hooing the idea of God. And this is what Norman said to me, he said,

385
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:04,560
my God, Alastair, it's a high and lofty one who inhabits us eternity. His name is holy.

386
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,680
Now, there you have hepody in metaphysical religion who inhabits us eternity.

387
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,240
I mean, it's all there, really, in that. And this sense of, you know, these things that are

388
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,960
double edged slightly, the high and mighty, the awe-inspiring, and the thing that can also inspire

389
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,600
Melancholy, or Kianlas, how have you pronounced it? Kianlas.

390
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,080
That seems absolutely core to the feeling one has here of

391
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,040
contacting something very profound. And without the sort of tinge of the Melancholy or whatever,

392
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:56,400
there wouldn't be the depths of it. And I'm wondering if you and I both, it turns out,

393
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,880
as I discovered, as far as I can tell, anyway, from my brief reading of you, that we both

394
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:10,800
embrace Panentheism, not Pantheism. And the important, you pointed out in what you had

395
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,920
to say about that, I have things to say about it in my work, but you pointed out that in some ways

396
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:27,760
that perhaps explains how so much that seems to our eyes to be painful, destructive, whatever,

397
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,320
is also taken up into the realm that has meaning, that has ultimate meaning. And I think that is

398
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,680
a way I would very much embrace with you. Yeah.

399
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean, this is why Hebridean people, for those who don't know, the Hebrides are islands like

400
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,680
Skye, where Ian is speaking from, and the Isle of Lois, where I grew up and had my primary

401
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,120
connections with. The Hebridean people have really experienced hardship in the past.

402
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,560
They've had, you know, in an extreme environment, terrible losses in the first and second World War,

403
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,720
because there were such competent mariners and practical people.

404
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,680
Sorry about that, Ian, it looks like we've just lost Alastair.

405
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,080
He might be trying to come back on in. I might ask Jonathan if he wants to step in.

406
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,280
Well, yes, yes, I was hoping to talk about some other things with the...

407
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,520
Don't worry, he'll be back. He'll be back. Yeah, yeah, I'll play temporary substitute.

408
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,600
I was struck there for a second. I know this is not literally what Alastair said,

409
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,960
but it sounded awfully like for a minute he was saying the right hemisphere is a fairy,

410
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,120
but I want, just for a second there was, you know, were you really saying that?

411
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,600
No. I'm not saying that. I know you're not saying that. I know I think everyone listening

412
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,320
knows you're not saying that. Just I guess we keep an eye out for him entering the room up there.

413
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,240
Yes, yes, of course. What I was curious to understand, Ian, better was what not everyone

414
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,400
watching may know, and even Alastair, because he hasn't had so much time with the books yet,

415
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,920
may not know. In the second volume of the matter with things, although the sacred comes right

416
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,800
at the end, it doesn't come out anymore. There is a sort of cumulative argument that

417
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,240
includes rethinking many metaphysical principles from the nature of time,

418
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,640
the perception of value, sort of cosmological purpose, the nature of the world, and so on.

419
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,200
Can you talk us through just a little bit what that story is, how you end up at the sacred,

420
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,640
and a lot of people want to go straight there, but I feel in some ways even more interesting

421
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,800
is how you bridge the scientific premise to, you know, fill that out towards the sacred.

422
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,800
I suppose it offers two things. One is it shows that it's not disconnected from, but actually

423
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,880
consequent on. Hello, Alastair, and understand, I'll just finish answering Jonathan's question,

424
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,120
but consequence on a reimagining that we which we must make in any case of what we think our

425
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:22,480
reality to be. And I suppose the other thing is that it offers a way of bringing people who might

426
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,600
not be entirely close to the possibility of the divine, but don't as yet experience it

427
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,280
to coming to a place where they can find something that resonates. So that's really it, yes, yes.

428
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,600
I will take my leave again momentarily, but just to say that part of the book,

429
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:46,000
the first phase of the second volume for me is my favorite part, just for those who are

430
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,200
watching or interested. I can disappear for a second to let them carry on for another 10 minutes.

431
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,280
Alastair, I wanted to ask you, unless you have something pressing, but I wanted to use the

432
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,720
bit of time we've got left to talk about wildness. I don't know if you like the poem

433
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,120
Gerard Mandy Hopkins, but he wrote wonderfully about wildness and wilderness and how important

434
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,680
it is to us. And I don't think we understand this. We think that as long as there is land,

435
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:24,320
it's okay. But it being wild, untamed, undominated by the human spirit is very,

436
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,400
very important. And there's almost nowhere left in these islands where this is true. There are

437
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,880
bits of sky and bits of the outer hebrides. And you probably know something that really,

438
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,720
I think it's so awful that everybody watching this should write to their MPs or raise it in public

439
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,880
is that a Danish company who have bought parts of sky are going to erect enormous wind farms on

440
00:48:50,880 --> 00:49:00,400
sky, dethroning the last really great place of wildness in this part of the world, or one of

441
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:07,440
them anyway. And this is a crime. It's not something that any human being should be contemplating.

442
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,480
If it costs more to put them in the sea, then do so. Or it might even mean that we become less

443
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,560
dependent on electricity altogether. But to destroy the beauty of these wild places

444
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,520
is an unforgivable sin in my view. I feel very strongly about it, I can probably tell.

445
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,600
Well, am I back on? Can I just say that what cut me off there is that although I had my phone

446
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,480
supposedly switched off, so somebody was able to get through, ironically, who is from the Isle of

447
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,560
Harris, one of the men in the Galgale Trust, a local organisation here in Government,

448
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,320
who wrestles profoundly with alcohol, with ill health, a wonderful man, a wonderful man,

449
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,880
who can burst into garlic song at a moment's notice. So that was the Isle of Harris. They must

450
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:07,600
have known we had to have a whiskey on the second site. Well, I hope it doesn't come on again and

451
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:20,320
fool me off. Can I engage your considerable prestige, imagination and energy in helping us

452
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,560
fend off this disaster? Or perhaps it's too late. But it is really.

453
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:33,040
Okay. So basically, my view is that terrestrial wind farms, as distinct from one's far out to see,

454
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,840
should only be where the local community decides that it wants to have them under its control

455
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,480
for its benefit. Like you have the Point and Sandwick Trust in the Isle of Lewis,

456
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,040
putting a million pounds a year into the community, whereas if it were the commercial

457
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,520
one, it would only get 45,000 pounds a year or something like that. So that is my position

458
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,520
on wind farms. The situation we're caught in just now is that the urban world is saying, well,

459
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,320
we need to get carbon free energy. So we'll go to places like the Highlands and Islands. We're not

460
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,880
going to have it from nuclear. So we'll go to places like the Highlands and Islands and we'll

461
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:17,760
we'll wire it down from there. And the problem I have with that, Ian,

462
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,640
is that if you destroy the beauty of nature, which in my view is this is doing, it is turning

463
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,760
a natural landscape into a mechanical landscape, if you destroy the beauty of nature on that scale,

464
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,280
because some of those sky turbines will be standing two thirds of the height of the Cullen,

465
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,960
the highest mountains and sky from the platform level that they'll be on. If you destroy that,

466
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,040
you start to destroy people's capacity to appreciate beauty and to care about anything

467
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:56,640
that really matters in this world. And destroy their access to awe and wonder, and thus erode

468
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,400
their imagination and destroy part of their vitality. It is a really, really serious thing.

469
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,920
It's as serious as it gets, in my view. So there we are. I just want to say that because so much

470
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,960
of what you write about and what you alerted me to is this importance in the folklore here

471
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,480
of the wild, how they too, you know, it's often said, oh, only kind of educated, romantic people

472
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,240
like you see this, but actually the ordinary people of sky and of these places also see that

473
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,760
wildness as crucial. But let me put a caveat in here, because a lot of my work this year has

474
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,160
been engaged with Community Land Scotland. You'll find two of my papers if you go into their website.

475
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,440
And the whole rewilding thing, well, again, wealthy people, what we call the green layers,

476
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,160
are buying up vast areas of Scotland to rewild them so that they can sell the carbon and maybe

477
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,680
later on the biodiversity uplift credits on it. And the problem that we have with this,

478
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,960
is that it is taking control of place out of the hands of local communities

479
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,560
by permanently buying it up for a purpose that the layer was parachuted in.

480
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:17,040
I'm sure you know that I wouldn't be speaking for that. And life is complicated. And one has to,

481
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,080
yeah, well, that's a quite different issue, frankly, from the one I'm talking about,

482
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,480
which is the deliberate destruction and violation of the few places of natural

483
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,480
wildness and beauty that we have left. I think that is appalling. And so I'm not talking here

484
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:40,160
about the rewilding by green landlords from elsewhere. But there are many sides to most

485
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:49,040
questions, but some are so clear that we really ought to be doing something to defend our world.

486
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,160
Well, I think you have to have what I would call ecological restoration alongside the people.

487
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,440
Many of these places were cleared of their people historically.

488
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,200
Exactly.

489
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,400
Young people cannot buy places to live in a place like Scotland.

490
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,360
I know, I know.

491
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,880
Because second homers and what have you, price them out of the market.

492
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:16,800
How do you pull that together? At the deepest level, you pull it together by reactivating

493
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,920
imaginative potential. I've been working this past month on an SE for Dark Mountain Journal,

494
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,880
which I have titled A Sermon to the English on Land Reform. And it's set out in the structure

495
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,520
of a traditional Scottish sermon. It'll be out in Dark Mountain Journal, I think probably around

496
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,360
Easter time. And it's basically suggesting to the English what they need to do to achieve what

497
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:48,720
we're doing in Scotland was now about 3% of our land and community land trust, so 500 community

498
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,720
land trust. But that comes from the artists and musicians. It comes from the poets. It comes from

499
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:02,000
the songwriters. It comes from the visual artists who inspire a vision, your right hemisphere.

500
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:09,520
Inspire a vision of what the future can be so that we remember what has been dismembered.

501
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,600
We revision how the future could be. And then we do the political and practical left hemisphere

502
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:23,520
work of reclaiming how to bring it into being. And we're in a perilous political time just now

503
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:30,080
because these massive amounts of money and the desperate imperative of action and climate change

504
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,920
is powering up forces, which in my view are recolonizing our land and should have no place

505
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,120
in modern Scotland. And you're so right that it is also important that this is to do with

506
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:49,360
a cohesive community and a cohesive society. But I don't think that speculators from other

507
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:56,080
countries coming in and the Chinese are behind the dispoliation of many Greek islands. They put

508
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,520
money into it and these unutterably beautiful and sacred landscapes are destroyed. Anyway,

509
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,800
there we are. I'm not arguing here that we don't need green energy, we do, but we have to do it

510
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:15,200
in a different way. Yeah. Thank you both so much. I'm here to usher in the next phase of the evening

511
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,520
to bring in the, you know, feeding the 5,000, but it's going to say feeding the 500, but it's

512
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,920
about that. And I want to ask a couple of things, partly to give people time to write their questions.

513
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,080
Because of the numbers here, choosing people from the audience is far from straightforward.

514
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,160
So we'd much prefer if you could please write your question. The chat is now reopening.

515
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,240
And we have colleagues who will be looking at those questions and choosing among them.

516
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,640
It's not as simple as first come, first serve. We're trying to get a range of viewpoints,

517
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,680
a range of kinds of people. And we're trying to kind of keep in mind what's been asked before.

518
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,320
So if we don't pick your question, please don't take offense. It's not personal.

519
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,920
I'm really glad with where you ended up in a way. I know it was a bit tense,

520
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,920
but it's sort of interesting because I began introducing Perspectiva in terms of systems,

521
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,480
souls, and society. And you kind of got there at the end because, you know, if you begin with

522
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,280
second sight and premonitions and possibly the paranormal and the sacred and you, but you come

523
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,920
around to, you know, a real live political issue in a beautiful place with contested values and

524
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,000
competing economic logics and so on. And for me, this is really in some ways where it's at.

525
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,360
It's the challenge of how do you navigate these different things? So the question is,

526
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,200
first of all, for Alastair, and I have a slightly different one for Ian, although you can both answer

527
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:52,000
them both. I'll say you invoke imagination. And I know Ian would be a big fan of imagination in

528
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,240
general as well. But I wonder sometimes if people expect too much of imagination. If it

529
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,680
if it's always assumed to be filled with goodness, because there's also dark imagination. There's also

530
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,360
the imagination of those who long for world domination and so on. What is it in the nature

531
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,880
of imagination that gives you hope? Or rather, what what forms of imagination need to be brought

532
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,400
into being such that they're actually beneficent and positive and not destructive?

533
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,800
Tell me more about what it is that gives you faith and imagination.

534
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,640
I think that as Henri Corbass says in his book on Ibn Arabi, it must be grounded in the divine.

535
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,840
Hebridean people take God very seriously. They take God as a matter of fact, a matter of experience.

536
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:51,280
In Bernard Shaw's play, Joan of Arc, which is somewhere behind me, like, don't turn around

537
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:58,560
to get it. No, no. We know it. We know it. With my fairy god. You see, what a wonderful fairy I've got.

538
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:06,720
Her inquisitor says to her, how do you know that the voices of God that you hear

539
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,720
are not just your imagination? And Joan says, but that is how God speaks to us.

540
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,080
That is how God speaks to us. So on your question about dark imagination, I would say

541
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,920
that if imagination, if I work with imagination, if our work of art and of intellect

542
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,240
is not grounded in the God space, if it is not grounded ultimately in prayer,

543
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,400
we must be very careful. Otherwise, as many native peoples will tell you,

544
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:49,040
the gift or charism can very easily turn toxic and poison both its processor and those around it.

545
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,320
So I would say that if we are working with imagination, Jonathan,

546
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,360
consider starting from a place of prayer, consider starting from a place of offering

547
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:06,800
yourself and your works to that which will serve what the Russian Orthodox call the fellow Kalia,

548
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,440
the love of beauty, the divine beauty, our relationship with each other.

549
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,960
Thank you, Alastair. Ian, do you want to come in on that? I've got a direct question for you as well.

550
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:24,240
Yeah, well, I would say, I think Corrid said something like that the imagination is the

551
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:32,240
repetition in the finite mind of the infinite I am. So he's really saying the same thing that it is

552
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,320
the way in which God speaks, but you're right that it can be perverted as all things in the

553
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,720
human realm can be perverted. And I don't want to go there now because it would take us too long,

554
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,400
but I would stand up for the idea that there is a drive which wishes to thwart and pervert,

555
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,320
and that it's what is traditionally meant by evil. I think it is a real thing that has power

556
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:06,720
in human doings. And people think I'm mad, but I defend myself on another day. But that's what

557
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,840
I would say about it. So Ian, it's up to the follow up question to that. And this is the last one

558
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,800
I'll ask. My sense is that very few people will think you're mad, but some might find you coy

559
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,480
in the sense that we had a moment there. Well, we had a moment there where we were

560
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:35,120
alighting between the paranormal and the sacred. And I understand with your scientific background

561
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,520
and due caution about misinformation and being misunderstood and so on, I fully respect and

562
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:48,160
understand that to keep things grounded and real and yet open as well at the same time. And we've

563
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,800
had this kind of conversation before. But it's intriguing for me that as we're talking about

564
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,640
fairies and you're joking with Alistair about fairies, I think there must be some people in the

565
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:03,440
audience who are like, what are they? Are they really saying they're fairies? And on second

566
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,280
sight and premonition, are we actually, is it okay now in a public conversation for reputed people

567
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,800
to entertain these possibilities? I'm just saying, is that indeed the case?

568
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,320
Well, fairies and second sight are perhaps not the same thing. And it depends exactly what you

569
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:31,760
mean by fairies, not as they're commonly imagined, but more messengers perhaps from another realm,

570
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:39,600
such as angels were thought to be. Although I'm not conflating the two, I have to answer so quickly,

571
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:49,120
I can't really make the niceties I want. But my view on second sight and the paranormal is exactly

572
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:56,720
that of my hero, Johnson, which he ended up saying, I came away not entirely convinced,

573
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,520
but willing to believe. He listened to the evidence, he was interested in the evidence,

574
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,520
he asked more questions, he didn't dismiss it, he thought there's probably something here,

575
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,120
I don't know quite what it is. And that's, it's not coinage, it's, I think, a natural

576
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,360
discrimination between types of issues about which one can be relatively certain and those

577
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:25,120
that one can't. Right. Okay. Thank you very much. So listen, can I just say, Johnson, you know,

578
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:30,560
there's a huge amount, I mean, that's just three I could reach just now. There's Ted Cowan, the

579
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,440
late professor of Scottish history at Glasgow University with Lizanne Henderson and Scottish

580
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,520
fairy belief. In Scottish scholarship, this has taken very seriously because it is understood

581
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:48,320
as being about ways of seeing into and talking about the imagination. It's like it's a symbolic

582
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:55,360
way of speaking about things. Okay. I appreciate that and I appreciate both of you

583
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,880
being both open about it and discerning and discriminating about it. We have some great

584
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,120
questions. If it's better to hear from the person if possible, so we're going to try this initially

585
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,120
and if it doesn't work out, I'll just read them out. But first of all, Catherine Lord, do you

586
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,680
want to try and raise your hand and if we can find you, we'll unmute you. Hello. Okay, that's

587
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:22,720
have your question. Thank you. Yes, I'm interested in how we educate children and the implications of

588
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,640
the seeing in whole ways and seeing with our imagination and what we do with our children's

589
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,280
schools. And I'm just interested in how you feel maybe our education system might need to change

590
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,000
so that we don't take, stop us being able to see things in with our right hemisphere.

591
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:48,720
Well, naturally, I feel very strongly about that. And I've talked many times about how I think

592
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,720
education in this country and in the West generally could be reformed. I think the loss of the

593
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:02,160
humanities, the prevalence of only STEM subjects is disastrous. And I think that education is about

594
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,800
awakening a mind that is seeking, not about sating a mind with information and then checking

595
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,760
whether it can be regurgitated. I think teachers should be freed up to talk about,

596
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean, not go wild, but to talk about the things that really interest them. That was how I was

597
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,200
educated. And it worked because the spark came to me, if you like, that was right hemisphere

598
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,680
speaking to right hemisphere. So I think all those things really in brief. Thank you, Ian. Appreciate it.

599
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,320
I would come in at that. Here's what you're kippling puck of pooks. He'll just hand it down to me by

600
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:43,920
the Christmas tree fairy. You know, it's fascinating because what's going on in the first chapter of

601
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,880
this book and kippling's mother was one of the McDonald's sisters, four sisters who had their

602
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,400
family roots in sky. What's going on there is that puck appears when the when the children say

603
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,360
by oak and thorn and ash or something like that, puck appears, he's the last fairy in English,

604
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:06,160
England, because he says the English have frightened the rest of us away. And he says,

605
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,320
I too will go when the trees are all gone. What does he do to reconnect the children,

606
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,000
but he reactivates their imagination. Okay, he starts telling them their history. It's a very

607
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,280
robust your history as you'd expect from a writer of the empire, not the kind of thing you'd read

608
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,480
to children today, perhaps. But that is what's so fascinating. He starts telling stories. So in

609
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:37,440
answer to the question of question, I would say the way you reactivate imagination in children is

610
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:48,000
story, is beauty, is creativity. Yes, I'd just like to say though that I'm

611
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,880
certainly I don't can't speak for others, but I'm not saying that rigor, clarity, logic, and all these

612
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,480
things are not important. They're under taught actually these days, children are indoctrinated

613
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,120
rather than taught how to think on both sides of a question. So I'm not saying that I'm just

614
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:11,600
saying that we need to get back into the curriculum, imagination, narrative, myth, poetry, music,

615
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:17,520
drama, all the rest. Yes, history, our own history above all, but history of other places too.

616
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,960
Thank you, Ian and Alistair. And thanks for the question Catherine. Caroline Thompson,

617
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,560
if you could please raise your hand and let yourself be known. We'll try and unmute you.

618
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,640
And while you're getting ready, if Anne-Louise Wolters can also do the same. But first of all,

619
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:44,400
Caroline, if we can find you. Hi, hi. Thank you so much for answering my question. I'm a composer

620
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:53,520
and I write music. And I always feel people appearing in my music who has recently died or

621
01:07:54,080 --> 01:08:00,640
people who I'm very interested in while I'm writing. And since you are both like the

622
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:10,000
heart and ratio in the philosophy and poetry, I was thinking, maybe you could have a poetic

623
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,800
discourse about how people who died in front of my music and where the music comes from anyhow.

624
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:25,120
So that's a bit broad. Yeah, I know. It's it's a bit of a complicated profession.

625
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,280
Yeah, I don't want to either of you want to take it on?

626
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,280
Well, I'll kick off if you like. I mean, of course, immediately I thought of

627
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,840
Elgar's Enigma Variations, which were pieces of music inspired by people some of whom had

628
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,480
recently died. But I don't think that's what you're talking about. I mean, I think that

629
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,200
the question where these things come from is very interesting. But the answer seems to be that they

630
01:08:53,200 --> 01:09:00,240
do not certainly originate in our conscious mind. They come through us in some sense. How far away

631
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:06,480
that that thing originates, I don't know, from my consciousness. But it certainly comes through

632
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,240
my unconscious mind. And I think it comes to all artists in that way. And it's probably something

633
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:17,600
bigger than ourselves that we don't appreciate that is speaking to us in forms. So I mean,

634
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:25,120
that's really what I would briefly say. I have a whole chapter on creativity, by the way,

635
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:32,320
in the matter of things. Yeah. Alastair? Well, just I know that when I'm writing,

636
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:43,280
and I really start tripping out. It's like, I don't cry easily, but a few tears will come to

637
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:51,440
my eyes. And it's just like, I'm immersed in something. And I'm telling it as it is, Ian

638
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:57,840
talked about the importance of truth. Truth with a capital T is so important, because

639
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,160
in the Greek, the word, the Greek New Testament, the word truth, Elysia, also means reality.

640
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:16,720
In the Sanskrit, the word truth, Satya, your Gandhi Satya Graha, truthfuls. Also, as Gandhi

641
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:22,960
points out, means realityfuls. So we're talking here about real creativity. We're not talking

642
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:30,240
about narcissistic art, egotistic art. We're talking about real creativity is about being

643
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:38,640
receptive to listening to cosmic truth. And allowing that to come through in whatever our art or in

644
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:46,000
Ian's case with his book is intellectual creativity. It is trying to give expression to

645
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,920
honouring that honouring that. Thank you. Thank you. A little shade of something that Jonathan

646
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,480
and I mentioned, I'll just say this quickly, which was that sometimes there is also a slight

647
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:06,720
dark side to this. My own experience of the diamond that works in me when it does is that

648
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:13,360
it's pretty ruthless. I don't really care about my health or happiness. Yeah. Yeah. Ask my wife

649
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:20,480
the same question. I mean, Ian, I was giving you a talking but becky and an old woman came up

650
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:27,840
afterwards and said to Viren, my wife, are you his wife? Viren said yes. And the old woman said

651
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:36,800
he must be very hard to live with. Surely not. Okay. Caroline, I'm just trying to get through

652
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,640
a few more questions just to respect the audience. So Caroline, I think you're unmuted now if you

653
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:52,560
want to ask a question. Yeah. Your discussion of Sianolas was about the place of longing,

654
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:03,280
and it kind of made me remember the concept of thin places and that idea that in those sacred

655
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:11,120
places, spiritual places, you are very close, like a hair breath away from the divine. Do you

656
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:16,640
have any comments on that? Am I getting close to what you were referring to? Absolutely is what

657
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,880
I thought. So I don't mean to jump in ahead of you again, Aleister, but I mean, that is exactly

658
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,920
what I mean. That's what people say when they come here. This is one of the thin places. It is.

659
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,640
It absolutely is. And the other world is closer here, and no wonder therefore one can hear,

660
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,480
feel, and see things that the noise of the city drowns out. Thank you very much. And then we have

661
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:46,160
a question from our old friends. No, no, no. George McLeod of the Iowa community.

662
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,240
One of George's things was George's big question, what's the matter? And he said matter is the

663
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:03,680
matter. It is when we forget that the divine is incarnate in matter. That's when we have to

664
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,960
ask what's the matter, because we've forgotten that incarnation. You may have forgotten that I asked

665
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,760
what's the matter with things. Yeah, just to briefly remind us the meaning of your title,

666
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,800
the matter with things, because that appears to be pertinent. Since you're saying there's

667
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,600
something going wrong that needs sorting out, what's the matter? And there's a lot of the

668
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,000
matter is to do with our privileging of a kind of very debased idea of matter, devoid of any

669
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,520
imminent spirit, simply lumpen matter, and our belief that the world is composed of things.

670
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,080
It isn't. It's relational, and things have secondarily emerged from a web of relations.

671
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,360
Okay, wonderful. Thank you for that quick answer. Rupert Reid, our old friend, Rupert Reid, come

672
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:57,440
and give us a question. Good evening, both. Yeah, so I wanted to pick up on Ian's remarks about how

673
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,880
we are disconnected, estranged from truth in this civilization. And I wanted to suggest

674
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:11,520
that while that's completely true, there's also a tendency which is opposite, maybe equal,

675
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,000
that's what I'm kind of asking, which is of an enormous hunger for truth that you can sense here

676
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,200
tonight in the audience, but also in the two of you. For me, one of the ways this has come through

677
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:28,960
very strongly in recent years is in the absolute determination in the climate movement to break

678
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,880
through in a new way by truth-telling and not staying in the normal confines of a sort of

679
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,520
conservative risk analysis of where we are at. So if there's a question, the question would be,

680
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,120
I'd love to invite you both to comment on, well, firstly, whether you agree. And secondly, if so,

681
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,520
how do we enable this second tendency, the tendency of the love for the truth and the

682
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,560
authentic, to overtake the first tendency which Ian was so powerfully mentioning?

683
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,440
You go ahead, Alistair.

684
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,080
I missed the very last, because we're getting lots of captions coming up over my transcripts,

685
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,760
I'm very deaf, I missed your very last point of your question. Could you just repeat it?

686
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,360
So the very last point was how do we strengthen the tendency to

687
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:19,760
for the truth, the love of truth, to disconnect from it? Yeah.

688
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:29,040
You be truthful. You make an ethic of trying to be truthful. It's very difficult. We're in a

689
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,320
culture where we are all expected to tell little white lies because they help to lubricate our

690
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:45,360
relationships. Well, bugger that. That starts to distort. It's the whiskey speaking.

691
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,920
It's very difficult. It's very difficult. And with, you know, I don't think any of us always

692
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:01,840
succeed. But you really work being truthful. You work on being honest. I had a dream last night

693
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,440
about this. I had a nightmare last night. I woke up about three in the morning.

694
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,560
I was at the end of our house, the surgery in Louisbus. I was standing by the road. And there

695
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,120
was, it was dark. It was pitch black. And what we would call a poor Trojan, a poor soul, a very

696
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:24,400
simple man in the village who used to wander from house to house, was standing there. And he

697
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:33,280
pointed out across the moors. And he said to me, there's a madman raging out in the moor over there.

698
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,440
And I went back into the house. I started locking all the doors to my father's medicine square and

699
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:45,920
all the rest of it. And there was a sense of discretion, this fear coming in over me and a

700
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:53,920
sense of that the madman was out to get what my father, the doctor, represented and the national

701
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,800
health service. And then I woke up and for a while I was lying in bed spooked. But when I woke up

702
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,040
this morning, it all fell into place, Ian, in terms of the questions you've been raising about the

703
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:13,120
dark side of the creatives. Because who was the madman out in the wilds? The madman was your

704
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:19,760
right hemisphere. The madman was what the doctor's surgery and medicine and the NHS cannot control.

705
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:26,640
And the dream was saying, don't forget the madman, that is, madman is part of me.

706
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:34,720
Yes, I well, if you see the truth, the truth is facing that the truth is acknowledging that.

707
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:42,000
Okay, no, I get what you're saying there, but I don't want anyone who to run away with the idea

708
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,320
that I think that the right hemisphere has anything to do with madness, the left hemisphere is much

709
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:53,760
closer to that, or with just a fairy not fairy nonsense, it's a it's our truth telling organ,

710
01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:01,440
actually. And I go into that for great length in the first part of the book. What I would say

711
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:09,040
in our answer to you, Rupert, is that you don't have to teach a hungry person to love food.

712
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,840
And people are starved of truth and they know it. And that's why there's a hunger for people to buy

713
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,080
an incredibly long book which aims to help them on a journey. And from the messages I get from

714
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:27,040
people all over the world of all ages, they don't feel they've been let down on that. They feel

715
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,280
they have been taken somewhere that has made a difference to how they think. So that's really

716
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,240
what I'd say. I've just finished reading that hideous strength by C.S. Lewis. I don't know if

717
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,240
you've read it, it's quite a good book really. And it really is about how when people see something

718
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:50,960
desperate happening and destroying everything beautiful and imaginatively rich, they eventually

719
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,520
the falseness crumbles. I hope that we'll live to see that happen. Thank you both.

720
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,360
Thank you both. And thank you, Rupert, for the question. Just in the interest of time, Gary Hoover,

721
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,520
I'm going to slightly paraphrase your question, which is a great question. In effect, Gary is

722
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,360
arguing, and I've noticed the same thing, that many describe the modern world in terms of an

723
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:21,200
anthropogenic extinction event, that the world as we know it is ending, typically ecologically,

724
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:28,160
but sometimes technologically. And this may or may not be an accurate scientific prognosis,

725
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:35,600
but it's limited, sort of reductionistic and technical in its perception. There are other

726
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,480
ways of framing this in terms of, I don't know, apocalypse, Armageddon, or something more imaginal

727
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:47,360
or this kind of thing. How would you see it both sort of scientifically and more spiritually?

728
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,040
How would you describe the state of the world and the predicament that we're in?

729
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:58,560
And I'll go with that. Alistair first, please. I don't think we're going to, as human beings,

730
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,040
become extinct. Many other species are already becoming extinct because of their actions.

731
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:10,000
I don't think we're going to become extinct as some people make out. I think the challenge of

732
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:17,440
these times is to take in the suffering of the world that we are all participants in creating

733
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:26,000
and to use this as a wake-up call to building community and creating beauty or being open to

734
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,880
the creation of beauty through us. In my most recent book on climate change, Riders and a

735
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,200
Storm, I've written two books on climate change, but the most recent one, the final two chapters

736
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:43,920
are about community land trusts in Scotland, because that is where on the ground I see beauty

737
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:50,400
being recreated, both with nature and in human nature. And that is something we can all do,

738
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,680
you know, whether we're in an urban context, like I am here in governing Glasgow or in the

739
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:01,520
Hebrides or whatever, we can all work on our relationships with each other and our

740
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:08,320
relationships with nature, making beauty, making love. It's not rocket science, it's just about

741
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:13,360
sharing, making a meal, cooking, sharing a book, having a chat like this tonight.

742
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,880
Thank you, Ian. How about our things?

743
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:23,200
Well, I guess I'm also interested just in your sense of how bad things are,

744
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,800
like, you know, the state of the world.

745
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,480
Well, I would say, first of all, I meant everything that Alistair said there,

746
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,400
those words could have come from my lips. I do think things are very bad. I think it's possible

747
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,320
to use various techniques we have of soothing ourselves and thinking that it's probably not

748
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:46,560
all that bad. And it may not be that bad because prediction is an imprecise art.

749
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:55,600
We usually are not entirely accurate in our predictions. And science and imagination

750
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:03,600
need to be in dialogue. Science alone cannot really tell us what's wrong with the world we're in

751
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,760
or where it's going next. Imagination has possibly more to say about that, but the facts that science

752
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:15,520
can give us, when it can give us facts that we can rely on, which is not as often as people think,

753
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:22,640
is very valuable. And you know, my whole epistemology, Alistair, in the second part of my book,

754
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,280
is that we need to bring together science and reason with intuition and imagination,

755
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:32,240
that none of these is dispensable, and we need to bring them all to bear. I think if we do,

756
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,040
we see both that things are very bad. And in my view, that there is the possibility for something

757
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,000
unforeseen to happen, which is a revolution in the human spirit. And that may sound all

758
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,640
very well when we're facing these practical problems. But actually, the practical problems

759
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:56,080
won't be solved by simply practical solutions. They also need to be coupled to a renewal of a

760
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:04,000
spiritual dimension to our lives. And I think the signs that that is very much craved by the young

761
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:11,680
and the old now, and that this is a sign of hope, and that also just to say, because you said something

762
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,880
like we can all play a part, this is hopeful for everyone, because people say, oh, what can I do?

763
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,200
I'm so small, the world's so big. And by the way, our world is so small. Look at the size of the

764
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:25,840
cosmos. That's got nothing to do with meaning. That is the left hemisphere's way of thinking,

765
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:32,480
measuring. But actually, how big is love? How big is the divine? How big is the sacred? And they're

766
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,600
all in here, and they can all begin from here, and you can unleash them, you can grow them.

767
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,480
And that is what we can all begin that work tonight, not even tomorrow morning.

768
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,800
Yeah, I mean, if this was an auditorium, applause with breakout at this point. Listen,

769
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:01,440
thank you. We've reached our 101 minute mark. And I'm very grateful to you both. I'm grateful

770
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:07,600
for the audience questions. I would encourage those who've enjoyed the chat during the Q&A

771
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:14,640
to save it. There is a way of doing that whereby you look for the dot dot dot sign, the ellipsis,

772
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,880
and click on that, and it usually lets you save the chat. That will give you access to any links

773
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:25,680
that were given there. And I'd also encourage you to search out Alastair's books, particularly the

774
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,520
ones he mentioned, Writers on the Storm and Climate Change, I very much recommend.

775
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:36,560
Poacherous Pilgrimage and Soil and Soul. For Ian, of course, the matter with things,

776
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,320
particularly highly recommended. And if you want to check out Perspectiva,

777
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,440
we've also given our link to the website. Here we have a sub-stack which you're welcome to join.

778
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,680
And if you become a paid subscriber, there will be perks forthcoming for those who do so.

779
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:58,960
Thank you very much. The other thing you need is the email for the fairy on the top of Alastair's

780
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,600
Christmas tree. You'll find all the books that you need at the very moment you need them.

781
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,480
Yeah, if you want the books at hand, I'll get that contact information for the Christmas tree

782
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,680
fairy later, Alastair. But for now, I wish you all a thank you. And you can just briefly unmute to

783
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,440
say bye. It's going to be a bit cacophonous, but let's enjoy the merriment for a second.

784
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,600
If we can do that, guys, if not, then we just have to enjoy the silence.

785
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,800
Thank you. Bye.
