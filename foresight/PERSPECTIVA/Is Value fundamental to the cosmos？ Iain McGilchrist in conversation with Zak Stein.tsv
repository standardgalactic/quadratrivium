0	9480	Welcome, everyone, to this second event. It's good to see you all. I'm Jonathan Ryerson.
9480	15880	I'm chief executive and co-founder of Perspectiva. Perspectiva is a publisher, and we're very
15880	21160	proud to publish Ian's book. This is the second volume of the Matter of Things, Matter
21160	27000	with Things here. Perspectiva has other things, too, though. We're a charity based in London,
27000	31640	and our general emphasis is on trying to reimagine the world from first principles, giving people
31640	36560	permission to do that, social and intellectual permission, and encouragement to rethink the
36560	42320	world. We see this as a necessary kind of work that we have to do today. That brings
42320	46440	with it certain events, and we have an annual festival. We have a European network called
46440	53960	Emerge. We have a methodology we call the anti-debate, and we're in the business of creating
53960	58880	some course material that we hope to start sharing with you all soon. So watch this space
58880	62440	for further developments on Perspectiva, and in the chat, maybe Michael can just share
62440	69400	our website if anyone's interested to know a little bit more about us. I wanted to say
69400	75160	a few things before Zach and Ian speak, and then I'm going to disappear in the digital
75160	80720	sense of no longer being on your screen. The first is to thank, the tonight's event is
80720	87040	free, and that's partly because we were given a grant to help bring Ian's work to more public
87040	92560	attention and to inquire more deeply into the material in the matter with things. So
92560	98360	I'm very grateful to the inspiration incubator, particularly Nikki and Max, which has made
98360	103200	it possible for these events to be free. And there are going to be, there's already been
103200	110040	one, this is the second, there's going to be double figures events. We don't yet know
110120	116520	if it's 10 or 12 or 15, but we're going to be in that sort of magnitude of events, because
116520	121440	there's a lot to discuss in Ian's book, and because we want to do something a little bit
121440	130880	different. In essence, Ian's work sort of came to public attention around 2011, some
130880	138400	13 or 12 or so years ago. And since then, as Ian, as someone who's followed his work
138400	144640	closely, the wonderful thing is that it's coming to public attention, the big idea, the main idea,
144640	150280	the hemispheric hypothesis. But that's been a good decade now, a good decade of questions
150280	154640	clarifying what exactly Ian means, what's the difference in the right and left hemisphere,
154640	159280	how does it play out in the world? And there's still a place for that. There's a lot of people
159280	163840	catching up with the significance of that and why it's a world changing insight when you
163840	170800	understand properly what Ian's saying. But it's also true that Ian has moved along and deepened
170800	177720	the inquiry and in a more specific way, applied his understanding to particular areas. And they
177720	182800	need greater attention on their own terms. So in this seminar series, there's a kind of presumption,
183400	188880	although we will reiterate and restate the argument as we go, we're trying to move beyond, let's
188960	195360	say McGilchrist 101. We're trying not to be simply, this is the main thesis. Can I ask you again
195360	199360	about that, please? We're trying to assume a level of understanding and engagement with the work
199360	203440	that allows us to move it on. And when I say move it on, I mean move it on philosophically,
203440	208960	to really understand more deeply what's being said. But I also mean move it on kind of
210720	217040	in a more quasi-applied or proto-applied sense, because there's a lot of risk in rushing too
217040	222240	quickly to understand what might follow for Ian's work. But there's also a need to
222240	227120	begin to figure out what it means for each of us in our personal and professional and even political
227120	234240	lives. And with that in mind, the first event was trying to frame the purpose of the series as a
234240	240000	whole. And that was called Attention as a Moral Act. And I also introduced what I called the
240000	244560	McGilchrist Maneuver. And there's a little blog post about what the McGilchrist Maneuver is,
244560	252320	I think, and that can be shared in the chat too. And that's a way of trying to get people to
253040	260320	orient towards how we begin to think about the places where Ian's work makes sense in the public
260320	266000	realm. What value it might have for civil society rethinking things. And we're continuing that
266000	271280	tonight. And just so you know, as a little bit of a preamble, we have future events relating to
271280	278080	sanity and imagination. So we're trying to zoom in on particular issues that are dealt with in
278080	285600	great depth in Ian's books. But which are also of a sort of have a degree of salience and relevance
285600	291040	and tangibility in the real world. We don't want to be in the simple business of because Ian says
291040	295840	X, we should do Y, because Ian would be the first to say that's not how it is. But we are interested
295840	300640	in the shift of perception that arises from Ian's work, and how that begins to look in different
300640	307840	contexts and in different thematic areas. And tonight, we're on a really big one. Values.
309040	313040	Value. And this is one of the things I want Ian and Zach to help clarify for us. Because
313040	317840	when I was reread, by the way, if any of you are wondering about the reading material for tonight,
317840	323360	or what's to read after tonight to sort of cover the ground again, chapter 26 in the second volume
323360	329840	of the matter with things is particularly relevant to what you're about to hear. And it's Ian will
330400	336160	go into it in more depth, but it's a philosophical take on where what value is, where it comes from,
336160	342160	why it matters, and the extent to which it can be perceived directly. And the reason I think I
342160	349840	wanted to inquire into this question is because values are mentioned everywhere. If you're working
349840	356160	in a sort of civil society space as I am, everyone's speaking about trying to work on values for
356160	361120	campaigning. There's a values and frames company that think about messaging to try and get particular
361120	367520	values encoded in the language you use. Political strategy is full of tapping into implicit values.
368400	373120	In the commercial world, the world of commercial ethics, if you order food from, for example,
373120	381040	waitrose in the UK, you hear that they have their chicken, eggs, and milk come from farmers who
381040	386000	share our values. And then of course, if you're working in the business world or the finance world,
386000	389920	you hear a lot about the value proposition of something and the bottom line being about
389920	395600	shareholder value. So this word value kind of permeates society in lots of different ways.
396320	401120	But it's used maybe without adequate reflection to really understand what's going on.
403600	407680	I'd like one of the things for Ian and Zach to clarify is this sort of distinction between
407680	411680	value singular and values plural. I hope that will come up at some point in the discussion.
411680	417200	And also kind of what I sense is a kind of big transcendent sense of value, almost value as
417200	421440	equivalent with Dower or God or something like that. And then a kind of value that's something
421440	425520	to do with truth, beauty, and goodness, and maybe love and maybe meaning and purpose,
425520	430080	the kind of fundamental values. And then there's sort of derivative values like pleasure and maybe
430080	435520	integrity and things like that. I'm curious to understand the kind of reverberations of those
435520	440720	things and the connections between them. With that said, it's a great pleasure to introduce
440720	445280	both of our speakers. Now, Ian, I think, goes pretty much without saying for the audience here.
446160	452800	He is Inter Alia, the author of The Master and His Emissary and The Matter with Things. He's a
452800	461040	well-known polymathic scholar and public speaker. Zach Stein may be a little less known,
461040	467120	but for those who do know him, it's hugely exciting to give him a chance to speak with Ian.
467120	474240	I have known Zach now for about four to five years, and we went to the same graduate school,
474240	478480	although my sense of talking with Zach is always that I've heard of the books that he's actually
478480	483520	read. That's usually my feeling of encountering Zach. He's a very studious, very early diet fellow,
484240	488640	really engages very deeply with all the material that he touches. So when he speaks,
488640	493280	he speaks with a great deal of authority because it comes from a lot of study and consideration.
494240	502320	He is, among many, many other things, one of the co-founders of the Civilization Research Institute.
502960	508880	He is working on a lot of different books, but I happen to know as publisher that he has a manuscript
508880	512080	in preparation that relates to metaphysics, which is one of the reasons I thought he was
512080	517280	particularly well placed to talk with Ian tonight. He's also a philosopher of education,
517280	521520	and he's written several essays for Perspectiva, which you can again,
521520	526080	we'll share with you in the chat in due course. So I think that's all for me,
526080	532400	if I haven't forgotten anything. I hope I've made sense of a thank you to our main sponsors,
533760	537920	why we're having this series at all, why tonight's event matters most, and why our
537920	543920	speakers are great. And with that, I can disappear for 45 to 50 minutes and let you enjoy Ian and
544000	550320	Zach's company. I'll see you later on. Bye-bye. Thank you, Jonathan.
551360	560960	Thank you, Jonathan. It's a pleasure to talk, never spoken before, so it's kind of
560960	568640	interesting to have a first conversation, so publicly. Jonathan mentioned that I'm working
568640	574640	on a book on metaphysics. I have a training in cognitive developmental psychology as a
574640	578640	neo-Pijadian, and so when I encountered work, it was actually like
580400	584880	that experience of someone saying something that I almost completely agreed with,
585760	593840	where there was just this complete absorption of the book and both volumes and the prior work.
594640	602400	And what was interesting to me was that in my own experience and in the branches of psychology
602400	608480	that I explored and philosophy that I explored, value was a given. And so the skepticism and
608480	613280	cynicism about value that I encountered in postmodernism and even some forms of modernism
613920	618880	was actually kind of like I didn't understand it. But I also encountered people who didn't
618880	625600	understand value as a given. So when I got to the places in your work where it was clear that
625600	630800	there were hemispheric dominance patterns that were expressing themselves across these different
630800	635760	philosophical positions and even in the personalities of the people who are holding them,
636800	644960	lights went off. And so I'm just kind of thanking you for your work before I get into it.
645680	649520	No, thank you very, very much. I hope the lights went on as well.
654480	662560	Yes, anyway. No, thank you very much. And yes, I look forward to talking about these things.
663520	667200	Perhaps I should just begin, unless you've got a question lined up. Have you got a question
667200	678400	lined up? I had a prompt, which was page 1122. And so this is the second volume. This is the
678400	684240	chapter on value. You say something and it's just a simple sentence, but it's very, very profound,
684240	692080	which is that you're placing value as equally primordial with time, space, matter, and motion,
692160	697600	and consciousness. And so this is when you think about what is the universe? What is reality?
698320	703840	Time, space, matter, motion, sure, everyone kind of buys that consciousness. You can get people to
703840	710400	do that. Placing value as equally primordial to those elements of cosmos is part of the work
710400	715760	that I'm doing in metaphysics at the Center for Enduroism with Gaffney and Wilbur. And it's
715760	721920	core to the work that I was doing as a psychologist, as a Piagetian, where he was in part with
721920	726800	moral judgment and Kohlberg. What they were looking at was value-ception, was the ability of the
726800	733920	organism itself to perceive the field of value. Kohlberg was a moral realist. He believed that
734880	740560	you equilibrated your moral judgment to a moral reality the way you equilibrate your
740640	747280	socio, excuse me, your sensory motor intelligence to gravity. Gravity exists. So you operate on
747280	753840	gravity as a kid, and you learn to work and navigate space and time with your body.
754400	758640	Kohlberg's basically saying, and you do a similar thing with moral reality, with the field of value.
759360	767520	You learn from it. It's not a simple instruction. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the
767520	774240	philosophical lineage that has always held that as true. Because my sense is that most humans in
774240	780000	most cultures, with most philosophies and worldviews and religions, held this as true. It's only mostly
780000	786320	recently in modernity. That default position has been a value cynicism or value skepticism.
787200	793840	And so I wonder if you could kind of underline that point that, yes, value is life, time, matter,
794560	798320	motion, really primordial, constitutive of universe.
800880	809040	Yes. Well, I believe it to be so. I felt that people would, and I'm glad you have that reaction,
809040	813680	think, goodness, you've talked about all these things that everyone agrees are constitutive of
813680	819600	the cosmos. But now you're talking about things like value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred,
819600	824480	which are my last three chapters. And I left them to that point, because I thought that if
824480	830960	people understood enough about what I said earlier about the more commonly accepted foundations of
830960	836480	reality, they would probably see why I would consider these things also as foundational.
839920	846320	The chapter is called value, not values, as Jonathan pointed out, because
846880	854320	I'm not really talking in this chapter about which particular every day values we might consider to
854320	861360	be the more important ones. I think there is a discussion to be had about values, but often
861360	868160	values boils down to objectives. And that objective is often economic, as Jonathan pointed out.
869440	875520	And I don't think values are objectives exactly. An objective is something that in the
876080	881840	left hand is where you target, you find a line to go to it and achieve it. Whereas what I'm talking
881840	889920	about is something that is, I believe, impossible to do without. I mean, it's not an invention,
889920	897760	it is something that is there in the ground of our being. We don't, I think, a very important
897760	905040	starting point is I don't believe that we invent values and paint them onto reality in order to
905040	912240	cheer ourselves up, but that we actually discover values. They are there for the discovery. We either
912240	918400	respond to them or we don't. And perhaps that would take us too far from this discussion,
918400	924800	which hasn't even got going on value yet. But I do argue that the purpose of life,
925440	930800	the reason the cosmos brings into being something quite so counterintuitive as life
931680	941520	with all its problems is that it is the ability to bring forth in that cosmos something that can
941520	949040	respond to these primordial values. So I think I start by saying something like,
949040	954720	so consciousness is not what life brings, because I've suggested in a previous chapter that
954720	960560	consciousness is everywhere in the universe, and that's becoming not an unusual point of
960560	965600	view. It's, of course, very widely been accepted for thousands of years, particularly in the east,
965600	973920	but it's now being accepted much more in the mainstream of analytic Anglo-American philosophy.
974480	981040	But the idea of value is, I think there are a number of aspects to it, really. And perhaps
981040	986320	if I just say something about what I take it that we generally believe in, something about
986320	991680	what I am going to argue or what I do argue there, that would help. There are about half
991680	997360	a dozen of them, and one I've mentioned, which is this idea that we don't invent but discover it.
998400	1005520	And related to that is that it is not a cognitive derivation. It is not something that we look at
1005520	1012160	life and then we attach certain sort of things and we call those values. But we have this ability
1012160	1016880	to be in touch with something which is an ontological primitive. And we do it through what
1017520	1022640	you've already mentioned, this concept of value-ception, which I believe is a translation
1023280	1030960	from the German of Max Schäler, who invented a word in German, which didn't until he made it up
1030960	1038640	exist, which is Warnähmung, no, sorry, Warnähmung is perception, but Wertähmung, which is valuing.
1038640	1045760	And so Wertähmung is really a version of Warnähmung, which is a perfectly straightforward
1045760	1051360	German word for perception. But the link with perception is interesting, because when we perceive
1051360	1060640	things, we don't take in a piece of data passively. We're not like receptive plates that absorb
1060640	1070000	data and then do a calculation on it and have a response. We immediately, as it were, get an idea
1070000	1077760	of what it is that we're dealing with here. And in fact, we go to meet it, which is another
1077760	1086400	interesting idea. So it's disclosed in a precognitive take on the Gestalt of what we're seeing. It's
1086480	1093520	not calculated. And this is particularly important when it comes to my understanding of morality
1093520	1102320	itself, of goodness. It's now been for a long time normal within the mainstream of Western
1102320	1111280	academia to consider that anyone who espouses another view of morality than utilitarianism
1111360	1117200	must be making a fundamental mistake. But utilitarianism is exactly the kind of morality
1117200	1122960	that is made simply out of making a calculation of what results from it. And that perhaps brings
1122960	1128400	sharply into focus what I'm talking about. It's not about a result. It's not about
1129360	1137440	a calculation towards a known goal. It is something that evokes in us a reverberative
1137440	1144000	relationship. So it calls to us and it calls to us from in front. So it is in that sense rather like
1145280	1151520	a final cause rather than efficient cause. Most of our thinking is to do with an efficient cause,
1151520	1156880	which is what pushes us from behind. The thing that makes us do something in the way that one
1156880	1161760	would make a machine do something. I know you know all this, but I'm just saying it for everyone's
1161760	1170880	benefit. Whereas a final cause is a cause that brings you to do something because you have a
1170880	1175760	relationship with it. It's not a self-generated concept, but it is another. And that's a very
1175760	1180720	important part of what I'm saying. And there are just a couple of things more to say and then I'll
1180720	1188960	hand back to you. One is that this makes it something that is not determined, but is free.
1188960	1196880	We can choose to respond or not. And we can choose what we believe actually fulfills each
1196880	1205040	of these values. So I mentioned that there are goals or objectives or targets or things we like
1205040	1213040	to do. And which ones we decide are beautiful, good or true is another conversation, an important
1213040	1219200	one. But I'm talking here about the very fact of the being, beauty, goodness and truth at all.
1220720	1228480	And the last point I'd like to make is that utilitarian thinking, which is in fact the value
1228480	1237040	of the left hemisphere, that of utility, means that values are designed to make us do something
1237040	1243760	that is evolutionarily beneficial. So beauty is just a way of making us choose the right mate
1243760	1252960	or whatever. The idea of truth is just something that's made up by a powerful hierarchy to
1252960	1258800	dragoon people into following it. And perhaps goodness is in the same league. Now what I'm
1258800	1267200	saying is that truly understood, properly understood, these values are fulfilled in
1267200	1274320	being responded to in themselves, not for any further purpose beyond that. So if I leave it at
1274320	1282480	that as a sort of laying out my stall, you can now pick it apart. No, I think it's like I said,
1282560	1289280	I agree with so much of what you're saying. And it's one of the things that I think clarifies the
1289280	1295680	nature of value as you're trying to express it as a basic property of the cosmos. Something I write
1295680	1302880	about in this work that Jonathan was speaking to, it is that it pre-exists the human, right?
1302880	1306720	Because if you're a postmodernist, you take value as a social construction, then there's basically
1306720	1313760	nothing until the human emerges and then we create value systems and we use them to oppress
1313760	1322720	people or whatever you do with that. But the take here is that actually no, life emerged to respond
1322720	1328800	to value which pre-existent. So I think Whitehead spoke of the appetite of the cosmos,
1328800	1334640	that the cosmos had an appetite that it wanted something, that it moved towards something.
1334640	1339920	And so that the evolutionary process responds to value makes it teleological.
1341680	1345520	It also means that there's a dimension in biological evolution
1347280	1355120	that is responding to the same field of real value that we are responding to. And that's, I think,
1356000	1360640	again, a position that humans have believed before, like I think of natural law theory. It's not a
1360640	1366000	great instance of it, but natural law is a case of that. And I think of religious systems where
1366800	1372720	the ordering of the cosmos, you participated in it as a microcosm, so that there was this
1372720	1381680	continuity of value across life and human and divine. So it's interesting that the power of
1381680	1390880	the left hemisphere to reify a worldview that is so much a minority position respective to
1391680	1398240	most of human thought is one of the things that strikes me. Because again, there's something
1398240	1403200	about socialization or early childhood education or the nature of the things that get the left
1403200	1408480	hemispheric dominance put in place. There's a type of person that hasn't been domesticated
1408480	1414320	to that by the educational system. It's not clear why that occurs. And for them, arguments about value
1414320	1419360	as I'm making here seem, actually, they like them. Makes you feel good. You feel like you're at home
1419360	1424480	in the universe. Like the things you care about actually matter to the universe. And then there's
1424480	1431040	another personality type, let me say, which is deeply skeptical, cynical of that view. In fact,
1431040	1434800	anything that would make you feel at home in the universe is probably proof that it's not science.
1434800	1439920	Right. And you think that would make you feel comfortable thinking about
1441680	1448320	the emergence of human value from biological evolution would be odd. So I guess I'm
1449600	1453120	Yeah, please. No, I'm just kind of that's, that's, of course,
1454640	1459840	a case of Petiti Open Kipi, isn't it? I mean, it seems like it must be wrong because
1459920	1466640	science starts from the standpoint that of course, all this has to be viewed as objectively alien to
1466640	1473440	us. And so it discovers that it is curious enough alien, you know, after after much looking for things
1473440	1480960	that it has ruled out from the start, like purpose and real values, it finds that these things can't
1480960	1486240	exist. Or if you hold that they do exist, you can't be being scientific. Well, I mean, I've tried to
1486240	1491920	argue from science and philosophy for these very concepts themselves.
1492560	1498160	Yeah. And it's there, you can see it in the science if you read it from a different angle.
1500640	1505600	Can I mention Darwin, because people will, you know, we're talking about evolution, you
1505600	1511760	raised biology. And one of the things that I love about Darwin, apart from anything else,
1511760	1521200	is that he was motivated in his study by beauty. And that in his earlier writings, beauty is already
1523040	1532000	beauty or beautiful occurs on one in six of his pages. But in his final writings, it occurs in
1532000	1538640	on average, every other page he uses the term beauty or beautiful, he's constantly referring to it.
1538640	1545920	And twice he puzzles over it. Because he says, it's all very well to say that birds choose a mate
1545920	1551760	because they find them beautiful. And that of course, in itself suggests that it doesn't just
1551760	1562320	arise with us, with us humans. But the existence of beauty itself remains a mystery. I mean,
1562320	1569280	what that that observation addresses is given the existence of beauty, how can it be made useful to
1569280	1575360	evolution? But it doesn't answer the question, how does beauty come about? And what does it lie in?
1576240	1580640	Yeah, it's interesting. Darwin also writes a lot about love. And I bet they co-occur with beauty.
1581440	1584800	It's dynamic of allurement and attraction in the animal kingdom.
1584800	1586480	Not as much. But yes, yes.
1586480	1591840	Yeah. And the the plentitude of nature in the creation of beautiful things, because it's not
1591920	1596080	just that the bird is beautiful to the other bird, it also appears beautiful to us, which
1596080	1600960	seems it seems extravagant. Like, why would it be that the human nervous system responds so
1600960	1610640	immediately to completely these things? This is a point I make. I mean, why is it that the
1610640	1614960	things that birds and animals find beautiful? We also find beautiful, even though they have no
1616480	1620880	relevant. I mean, the fact that a bird has certain colors doesn't or a plant. In fact,
1622160	1628480	a plant that is poisonous may be very beautiful. So it's not a matter of, you know, being evolution
1628480	1634480	really beneficial. It just is beautiful. And another thing is trees, the shape of trees,
1634480	1639600	the shapes of trees are intrinsically beautiful to humans that have been commented on since
1639600	1646880	time immemorial. But there's nothing about the shape of a tree that can in any sense be attractive
1646880	1653600	from a propagation of the species point of view. Of course, they need insects. But don't tell me
1653600	1661200	insects are going around going, that Elm is just exquisite. And why would my nervous system evolve
1661200	1667360	to be appreciative of the beauty of the tree and indeed, indeed, and it certainly is. And so that
1667360	1673600	notion of kind of like moving the utilitarian calculus down into evolutionary explanation,
1673600	1678080	and therefore believing that something that's here, like my whole body and mind involved for
1678080	1685120	this very narrow function is in fact incorrect. That if value exists and life responds to value,
1685120	1691520	then it's reasonable that we optimized actually biologically, neurologically for love, beauty,
1692240	1698240	or a whole host of values that we actually have the ability to respond to. And so value
1698240	1706640	perception, this gets to a question. Value is like a skill. Like value can be trained. And when
1706640	1712000	you think of the aesthetic perception, I had training as exactly, it was a music, it was a
1712000	1718800	music actually where I, I so desperately wanted to have certain albums in my possession, and to
1718800	1723600	like expose myself to such a beautiful thing specifically jazz and Indian classical music.
1724560	1730560	Whereas why? When I take a working job at a coffee shop specifically to get money just to buy these
1730560	1736960	things. So the intrinsic value and the impression. So this question, oh yeah,
1737760	1744000	how do you build value perception? Why is it that our schools, for example, seem to inhibit it,
1744000	1748960	that the culture seems to actually create the opposite, where things that happen,
1749840	1754560	where things that happen are perceived as having value is one way of even describing the commodity
1754560	1764480	form itself, that you perform a trick. Yes, yes, yes. The exchange value overriding the actual
1764480	1772720	use value as it were. So yeah, how do we get better value perception? How do we get confused?
1773360	1781280	Yeah. Yes, it's a very interesting question because like so many things, it's not black
1781280	1791200	and white in that value section can only exist once it's been trained. But it's also true that
1791200	1799680	it can be trained, but it is intrinsic. So I think children without any instruction find certain
1800240	1808400	things beautiful and certain animals, for example, beautiful. And they also find some ugly. And this
1808400	1813200	is an important point to make because something that might be said is, well, you know, you find all
1813200	1817280	these beautiful things in nature just because we're trained that whatever is natural is beautiful.
1817280	1823840	Absolutely not. Although most of nature manages to remain extremely beautiful, there are certainly
1823840	1831120	lots of things in nature that are just plain ugly. And in the book, I'm afraid I draw attention to the
1831120	1839520	rather unattractive features of the shoe build stalk, I seem to remember. There it is, it's an
1839520	1845680	entirely natural bird creation, but it's not a very attractive one, I think to most people.
1845680	1851360	So I think they're intrinsic and also goodness. I mean, goodness is obviously culturally determined
1851360	1856800	to a point. But this can be exaggerated. I mean, there are very few cultures in the world
1856800	1868720	where it's considered good to murder and rape. In fact, beauty too is far more culturally universal
1868720	1876080	than is made out by people who want to impress on us that it's simply made up. Most Eastern
1876080	1883280	peoples, Chinese and Japanese, for example, find no problem whatever in enjoying the works of art in
1883280	1889520	Western works of art in our museums, coming to the plays of Shakespeare, we find no problem at all
1889520	1899440	in going to in the beauty of their art and their culture. So and interestingly, it's also true that
1899440	1907520	things can be found that quite specifically mean things that are intrinsic. So for example,
1907520	1915920	certain intervals and shapes and melodies in an Indian raga can be understood by Norwegians who
1915920	1920720	know nothing about Indian music. If they're asked to say, what is it that this is expressing,
1921360	1928000	they are remarkably similar to what an Indian listener trained would say that was being expressed.
1928000	1936240	So I mean, that's a scientifically verified result. So I think it's like so many things
1936240	1944160	that you can have a basic understanding of something. But what we can do is help it to
1944160	1949360	flourish and grow in beneficial directions. And this is a little bit like anything that grows,
1949360	1958960	a plant. A plant can grow and will grow anyway. But a gardener can actually make plants thrive more
1958960	1965280	and can make them grow to another shape or to another size or to another color. So there is a
1965280	1971680	way in which whatever is there can be trained by us. But that doesn't mean that it's made up by us.
1972560	1979600	I believe that Goethe is right when he says that everything properly considered and appreciated
1979600	1986240	by us calls out in us the faculty with which we can appreciate it. And so for example,
1986800	1992080	you talked about music, and I imagine your experience is the same as mine, that when one
1992080	1997520	starts learning to love music, one loves certain things that one perhaps still loves, but one
1997520	2003760	can't necessarily immediately respond to other things that as one learns more and more, the faculty
2003760	2009040	in us to appreciate them grows. And the deepening of value, one way to think about human development,
2009840	2015120	the human development is just that maturation, if you will, is this deepening of creation of
2015120	2022240	more and more value. And it's not, it's not the making up more things to care about. It's the
2022320	2027680	getting deeper in touch with reality. It's actually deepening to this field of value.
2028560	2034080	And again, from a human development perspective, it does seem that it's a disposition that is deeply
2034080	2044560	rooted values. And that a lot of what occurs is just the absence of support for that skill and
2044560	2050640	things that counteract it, which is to say anti-value. So preference, like preference
2050720	2056640	falsification is the root of advertising. And advertising suffuses our environment. So there's
2056640	2063440	a intentional thing in our culture to actually disrupt the ability to truly perceive value.
2063440	2069040	So it's a thing that we need to think about, like how do we protect ourselves from being confused
2069040	2076240	and then sit and appreciate how does that actually work? Even just the ability to hold
2076240	2083120	attention for a long period of time is necessary for certain levels of appreciation of value and
2083120	2092640	beauty. Which is another reason why attention is a moral act, as we have called this series,
2092640	2098640	which is a phrase that I think I use in both the master and his emissary and the master of things.
2099360	2104480	Yeah. Yeah. So I'm right there. But the implication also, another implication,
2104560	2111440	kind of a question is, so therefore, if we really downgrade value exception,
2111440	2118400	like let's say value collapses at the center of culture, which is what you could say is occurring,
2118400	2127280	that we've kind of burnt off the fumes of pre-modernity and we're running out of
2128080	2137360	center of value and even the ability to then perceive value. That's very dangerous. Like if
2137360	2143760	part of what evolution has been is adapting us to perceive and relate to value. If we cut off
2143760	2152000	that ability, then we become evolutionarily non adaptive, which means we go extinct. So another
2152080	2157200	place that this work that I'm doing is the relationship between value and existential
2157200	2162720	risk and civilization on the rise, which is that the patterns you're pointing to
2164240	2168720	are actually deep generator functions of existential risk. If you will, let me drop
2168720	2174320	into that. Okay. I'm saying like the inability to see the simplification of problem to narrow
2174320	2180480	metric. This characterization of a complex thing as a complicated thing that could be fixed,
2180480	2185920	but actually you can't. All those characteristics are things that are
2186880	2193360	leading us to a point in civilization that is treacherous. There's an urgency,
2193360	2199520	I see it as an educational urgency, to figure out how to rebalance the hemisphere. And that's
2199520	2206720	why I'm focusing on value exception. What can we actually do to allow ourselves to perceive
2206720	2210400	what's actually valuable again? Because we're clearly very confused about what value is.
2210400	2213360	If we've been brought to a place where our civilization is about to self-destruct,
2214160	2220480	and AI is a great example. The core of the AI risk is the alignment problem, which is a value
2220480	2226320	alignment problem. So that's me kind of saying help us save civilization, Ian.
2228160	2231360	How do we learn to perceive value again so that we know?
2232240	2241360	Thanks. Yes, I can't remember who it is, but you can probably tell me in Silicon Valley who said
2241360	2246560	that, yes, the way AI is going will probably render us extinct, but it'll be very good for
2246560	2253280	the economy in the meantime. And that perhaps sums up the left hemisphere's approach to these
2253280	2259920	things. It only understands power, control, utility, and as a sort of subset of that pleasure,
2259920	2264080	which is assumed to be what these things give. Although, by the way, they don't.
2265760	2272480	People who have as much power as you can conceivably imagine lead unhappy, anxious lives.
2272480	2282320	But there we are. I can tell you for free as a psychiatrist. But yes, how do we get back on
2282320	2286640	course? Well, partly, of course, you won't be surprised to hear me say that
2288400	2294720	even below the fixing of values is this business of the hemisphere balance, because you mentioned
2294720	2301920	there the idea of a complicated machine that can be fixed versus a complex system, which is
2301920	2309120	the difference being that a complex system is intrinsically indeterminate. It is intrinsically
2309120	2317280	free. It is intrinsically not controllable. It is intrinsically able to move in a way that we
2317280	2324800	can't actually program. So that is, that is a kind of slap in the face to the those who hold
2324800	2331280	this left hemisphere view that we can make ourselves all powerful. And to me, the most
2331280	2336960	heinous thing that has happened in the last 200 years, or perhaps even since the enlightenment,
2336960	2343920	is this belief that we can control everything, that we have power. And if only we could have
2343920	2349840	humility enough to understand how little we know, how little we really understand what we're dealing
2349840	2357920	with, and how helpless we will be in the face of things that we are now setting loose, and then
2358800	2366640	if it might not be too late to do something about it. So regaining some sense of humility and
2366640	2373040	awe before what it is we're seeing, respect for these things, not the whole idea that we
2373040	2380560	make them all up, of course, is a version of this idea that we are the creators of everything we
2380560	2390720	see. We are the creators of all that we experience. Excuse me, we are not. We are the receivers,
2390720	2398720	we are the grateful or should be grateful recipients of some enormous gift that we only
2398720	2406400	partly understand. And we have a responsibility to respond to that. That's the root of
2406400	2411680	responsibility is this idea you have to respond to something. And that that something is calling
2411680	2422160	to us to behave in a different way. So obviously, one of the things I would say is that we need to
2423200	2430160	open up the minds of those who are both now in control and will control our futures
2430880	2438240	to the idea of we don't understand this, we don't know what it is, but let us find the good in it,
2438240	2443920	the beautiful in it, and what is true about it. Because at the moment, I don't think there's ever
2443920	2451280	been a period since recorded time that I know of when truth has been so profoundly
2451280	2458160	travested. And with the development of AI, it's going to be almost impossible for education,
2458160	2465200	for the law, for politics to function if we don't know whether something is a video clip that is
2465200	2472000	made up by a computer showing a politician saying things he never said. When we get to that, and how
2472000	2477680	do we know that the children or the young people we're teaching have really understood anything
2477680	2484960	if they can generate an essay that will satisfy an examiner. And it's going to negate all the
2484960	2491040	things on which a civilization is built. And what a civilization is for is to guarantee that we are
2491040	2497200	better at seeing the beautiful, the good, and the true, which to me are with the sacred, which
2497200	2506160	goes above it, is the most important value of all. Yeah, and this is one of the central risks that
2506160	2511520	people don't see in terms of catastrophic risk, is the true collapse of culture and truth at this
2512640	2518960	in value. Because what occurs there is basically, I'm not going to steal Benito Roy's thunder,
2518960	2524320	but basically it's a schizophrenic break at the level of culture where the entire culture gets
2524320	2533680	out of touch with the ability to perceive value. And AI is the thing that could perpetrate that
2533680	2540560	break. I wonder too, though, about the relationship between depression and the hemispheres and
2540560	2544480	traumatic experience in the hemispheres. So part of me is like, okay, you think you can control the
2544480	2550960	world, and you kind of pretend you can for a while until it slaps you in the face and something
2551520	2556160	occurs that forces your identity to reorient. Because I'm thinking like, what is the actual human
2556160	2565040	development process when someone actually reorients their basic hemispheric dominance pattern?
2565040	2570880	Maybe that's too simple a way to think. But I wonder if, you know, at various points in history
2570880	2580640	where we seem to step in and speak from, you know, the master, more times, sometimes after
2580640	2586720	very hard lessons were learned. And so I'm wondering if one of the things that will reawaken the
2586720	2592560	perception of value is actually the occurrence of catastrophe and tragedy?
2593280	2601280	Yes, I think that's right. And I wouldn't cast it myself in terms of depression, trauma and the
2601280	2608160	hemispheres. Because that's just too complicated. I mean, I think there's something in it. And you
2608160	2616960	know that I devote a whole chapter in the matter of things to showing what the correspondences are
2616960	2622320	between a left hemisphere dominated picture of the world and a right hemisphere deficient
2622320	2629920	picture of the world. And that of the subject of schizophrenia. So that is very much like
2629920	2635120	left hemisphere overdrive. And it's been commented before I drew these parallels by people like
2635120	2639760	Louis Sass, that something seems to be happening to our culture, which is rather like what happens
2639760	2645040	in schizophrenia. And of course, schizophrenia is a very distressing condition, which often
2645040	2652480	does lead individually to suicide. I believe that we are actually pursuing our own suicide
2652480	2658320	very rapidly at the moment, we're disemboweling our culture and destroying all the good in it.
2658320	2665600	We are disemboweling and destroying the beauty and the the vibrance of nature. And we've turned
2665600	2672160	our backs on the sacred and the divine and said that these are just childish fantasies,
2672160	2678480	whereas they're probably the most important realities that they're not easy to find for us
2678480	2684000	now. So I don't disrespect somebody who can't find them and can't see what is meant by them.
2684880	2688480	And indeed, I think that the talk about them is quite problematic. And no doubt,
2688480	2694480	I'll talk to someone else in another session about that. But nevertheless, I think these values are
2694480	2699520	hugely important to me are losing them. It might be worth just mentioning, because I think it's
2699600	2707760	something helpful to me, I found, which is Schäler's pyramid of values. I'm talking here,
2708480	2716720	not about Schiller, but Schäler, Max Schäler, S-C-H-E-L-E-R, who was an early 20th century
2716720	2722720	German phenomenological philosopher, said by Heidegger to be the brightest philosopher in Europe
2722720	2730720	of his generation. And he wrote about values in a way that Heidegger himself didn't,
2730720	2735680	nor actually did, Victor Constantine to the same extent. Although in culture and value,
2735680	2741520	I find he writes beautifully about these things. But in any case, Max Schäler had a pyramid of
2741520	2748720	values, a hierarchy, and at the bottom were those of use, i.e. utility and pleasure,
2748720	2759440	and then somewhat above that were what he called the labents, that are the values of life. And he
2759440	2767360	meant by these things like generosity and courage and magnanimity and loyalty. And then above that
2767360	2773200	came effectively what he called the geistige, that are meaning either the intellectual, the spiritual
2774080	2780080	values, which are, I believe, beauty, goodness, and truth, principally. And other values that you
2780080	2786800	might mention are effectively derivative from either beauty, goodness, or truth, that we value
2786800	2792320	them because we think they are either good, or we think they're beautiful, or we think they're true.
2792320	2797840	And then on the top of this pyramid was the sacred. And what I suggest is that in our own time,
2797840	2802480	we have inverted this pyramid so that the left hemisphere's value is at the top,
2803760	2810000	that of utility, and the other ones are said to be simply in service utility. That is the vision
2810640	2817280	of the materialist reductionists who until recently have held the floor in the universities.
2817280	2822480	That, thank goodness, is changing. There is a wonderful move of foot I see in philosophy,
2822480	2831600	I see in biology, that people see that this very simplistic, mechanistic vision is gone.
2831600	2839200	It's over. It just doesn't work. Yeah, thank you for all that. That was intriguing. I'd been saying
2839200	2845440	for some time that we were dealing with basically a suicidal culture that was running and overdrive
2845440	2852560	down into those patterns. So it's like this from getting too much into that. But your enumeration
2852560	2861360	there of the hierarchy of values gets into Jonathan's point about values versus value,
2861360	2867600	and is there some structure to the organization of first principles and first values? Like the
2867600	2872800	core of the work that I'm doing at the differential wisdom is that enumerating first
2872880	2878960	principles and first values from a perspective of continuity with evolution itself, so that
2878960	2884720	there are some values which are periphery, which occur locally, and then there are other values
2884720	2889760	which are so core that we can actually say that we share them with like animals, and that we share
2889760	2897920	them perhaps with cells. That value pre-exists us, then there's a continuity of value that we
2897920	2906240	participate in. And so things like harmony. Like harmony is expressed very early in physics,
2907040	2913600	where you either get to land or you do not work. And if you think of multicellular organisms
2914480	2919760	or complex organisms, a lot of what's occurring there is complex systems of
2919760	2926880	interest, harmonious things. Humans start to use speech, they start to try to name values,
2926880	2933200	and you get something like justice or fairness as a continuation of this dimension of. So that's
2933200	2941520	some of the thing we're doing there. What emerges is that there's a paucity of language of evaluation
2941520	2946960	in our culture. So this is Charles Taylor makes, he talks about languages of strong
2946960	2953840	evaluation, being the core of the culture together. And that means a language of shared value. We
2953840	2961360	talk about a universal grammar of value is absent. We kind of have a grammar to talk about
2961360	2966000	mathematics and science and all of these other things, but when we get together and we try to
2966000	2973920	have a conversation about value, our tongues are tied. And especially when we've got our culture.
2973920	2981040	So there's this need to create some new languages of value, I think.
2981840	2989440	How much do you think that depends on the level at which one is talking about value?
2990080	2997360	And I've sort of set up a kind of an idea of certain values such as beauty, goodness and truth.
2997360	3007200	And it would almost make no sense to say up to a point about these things. We just do think beauty
3007200	3013520	is good. We do think goodness is good. We do think the truth is good. It's almost a tautology.
3014160	3020560	But if you start talking about the values that we hold as a society and one may go back to
3021200	3027920	the call of the French Revolution. And these sound like a very good start.
3028560	3033040	But immediately one finds oneself and this is where one might get tongue tied and there might be
3033040	3040160	conflicts is but what exactly do we mean by these things and in what context and how much and for whom.
3040800	3048640	So liberty is on the face of it highly desirable and I certainly wouldn't admire a culture in
3048640	3056000	which there was no liberty. But obviously utterly untrammeled liberty is anarchy and restraints and
3056000	3063920	constraints within reason are very important and we have mature societies able to balance
3063920	3071120	those things. And you know it's true of egality and fraternity. You know what exactly does one
3071120	3076960	mean by them? Are they always necessarily good in all contexts or do we have to finesse them?
3076960	3083680	And I think that's what I would think is the difficulty about values themselves.
3084400	3086240	Perhaps the only way in which one can
3088560	3094240	resurrect the good sense of values is in fact by looking at societies that have been stable
3094240	3100160	for a long time and produced that harmony that you thank you for mentioning that because I think
3100160	3105920	it's terribly important and it's not only a very important idea in physics but also as you point
3105920	3116400	out in biology and also of course it was foundational in Greek thinking you know from Pythagoras onwards.
3116400	3121280	And some of those things you can see like it's a yes and you can hear it.
3123520	3126960	Yeah so it's just it's a remarkable and suffuses I remember this quote by
3127600	3132320	Whitehead again where he says you know the circle haunts the universe like a ghost and what he was
3132320	3138720	talking about was just the presence of universals amongst the flux. And so harmony is harmony kind
3138720	3144960	of haunts evolution at all stages and we yearn for it like in our in our societies we want
3144960	3152400	harmony and it's interesting that. And what Harmony points out is it's all in relations.
3152960	3159760	It's not unison it's relations between things but beautiful and generous relations that work
3159760	3167920	together to produce only good and beautiful sound. So you know we talk about other species
3167920	3172880	and humans and one and you talked about how harmony seems to be very much a kind of human
3172880	3180960	conception I think you hinted that at any rate I hope I'm not misquoting you. But it is also true
3180960	3188000	that you know birds sing but in essence they sing competitively but only humans can sing
3188080	3195280	in harmony and attune their voices to one another. So this is I mean there's so much
3195280	3200320	that one can regret about humanity but the trouble with this is that it leads to a kind of
3200320	3207920	disparagement of everything that humanity can be and we need to preserve the ideal of what a human
3207920	3215360	being and a human life and a human society can be what its meaning is at the same time as being
3215360	3221600	highly critical of many of the things that it's now interpreted as involving and this comes down
3221600	3227680	to my basic point and the reason I wrote the matter of things is that we no longer understand
3227680	3232240	what a human being is what the world is and what we're hearing it for.
3233280	3239200	And that's very unfortunate. That's very unfortunate. I believe in the in the Master's
3239200	3245040	Emissary you cited that research that the vocal cords were more developed before the
3245600	3249840	language centers so the very first humans communicated mostly through song basically
3249840	3257840	that there was this kind of even state where there was this harmonic vocalization of somewhat
3257840	3263280	sapient you know bipedal creatures who were basically singing together before they were speaking
3263280	3269040	and that the function of language the function of language to be denotative and descriptive
3270400	3273680	piggybacked on the use of the vocal cords for basically harmony.
3276000	3281920	Well you know I mean this is I have to rely here quite a lot on anthropologists
3282720	3287440	but there is a prominent school of anthropologists who certainly believe this even my than being one
3287440	3295040	of the most best known exponents of it but what I think is nice is that there is very good
3298480	3305840	if you like paleo anatomical reasons for believing that this is the case and from the examination
3305840	3312320	of animals that their ability to vocalize and so on the nature of their skulls and their ribcages
3312880	3319040	too much to explain now but it's in the Master and his Emissary but what I love about it is that
3319040	3327440	it inverts this assumption that of course all the business is done with language and music is just
3327440	3334800	some frivolous exaptation of language but actually it turns out that the science is on the side that
3334800	3340560	music comes first and that language is a useful exaptation of music.
3341120	3346000	Exactly that's the idea and were we being stopped was that a bell to intervene Jonathan?
3346000	3353120	No no it's just that I'm part of my um hopelessly a tech world there's a grandfather clock sitting
3353120	3360480	just in the next house so it was just yeah. I am ready to I am ready to come in like but carry on for
3360480	3366320	now. Yeah I mean it's just a very it's a very deep point about what society ought to be like
3366320	3371520	in things that in fact we listen. It's a knell that summons us to heaven or to hell sorry no
3372640	3376000	sorry it's like carry on. It's a very pivotal moment in the conversation now.
3378240	3384880	So the point is both that we misunderstand theoretically the function of language thinking
3384880	3389920	that its primary function is denotative and descriptive when in fact there's a deeper
3389920	3396880	function which is the resonance that allows for between us. As someone who's done some clinical
3396880	3401200	work when you listen to someone speak you're often not listening to what they say you're
3401200	3407040	listening to the tone and tenor and anxiety or absence of anxiety and the prosody and the
3407040	3413520	pace of their speech and all the musical tones basically not the content and in fact the mismatch
3413520	3419040	between content and that underlying musicality is a sign to pay attention to so it's just
3419040	3424800	interesting to think that in fact we something as basic as language we're not we're missing the
3424800	3430480	hemispheres are allowing us to misunderstand suddenly and that you know harmony suffuses
3432080	3439360	this organism and it is resonates with it and yeah the chanting and the music
3440000	3443840	and then the notion that in the human the value of harmony becomes aware of itself
3444480	3451040	and so we actually arrange and this is the kind of an interesting note that runs through a couple
3451040	3457280	of places in the matter of things that there's a something that occurs with the human as an
3457280	3462400	evolutionary emergent where value and consciousness become aware of themselves in ways that they were
3462400	3469760	not previously and this is a big I think that's a really important point and it goes back to my
3469760	3476720	idea which I think is absolutely constant with my understanding of whitehead which is that whatever
3476720	3487920	we mean by god the creative force logos li burta whatever it may be and that is bringing the cosmos
3487920	3495200	into being and the cosmos is bringing it further into being so that each is unfolding and discovering
3495280	3502400	more of its potential in this dynamic relationship it's not a story of a static something that just
3502400	3509680	is or of two static some things but of a twofold relationship in which something is ever more
3509680	3515120	coming into being that seems to be at the center of creation and if there's one thing one can say
3515120	3520480	about the cosmos it is that it is creative in this way that is one of the primary values if
3520480	3528320	like of the cosmos is simply to make things happen to differentiate out of an enormously
3530000	3540480	potential unity all that that potential means when it's unfolded and then to refold it again into a
3540480	3546080	now enriched unity which then carries on this process it's an alternation and of course this
3546080	3553360	is very much in keeping with david bone's idea of the implicit order the explicit order and then
3553360	3559760	being re unfolded into the implicit yeah we speak of evolving evolving value or evolving eternal
3559760	3568880	value yes yes that yes to think about it and in the cabalester tradition there's a saying that
3568880	3575680	there's more god to come which is basically i i didn't know that if you if you can give me the
3575680	3580640	reference to that because i'm very keen on the cabala and i've never heard that but i argue of
3580640	3588560	course that the cabala actually sees that um you know that whatever is the ground of being ends off
3588560	3593760	is actually coming into being yeah now that's the root of this work because it's the collaboration
3593760	3599920	with rabbi gaffney and ken wilber both esotericists and gaffney's gaffney's command of the cabalistic
3599920	3605040	literature you know and and it's part of the through line of the matter with things is the
3605040	3611760	line back through shelling uh you know through bohem to the renaissance basically christian
3613360	3619520	and metaphysics has to be implicit there which is of this is the where god invests in the
3619520	3625520	cosmos the ability to basically further the divine to create new god and so as something
3625520	3633360	like harmony falls or beauty evolves um the intensification of the value evolves forever
3633360	3640960	and we participate in that self-aware you're creating a value so it's a it's a kind of we
3640960	3646160	either participate in it or fail to do so and that is the tragedy that at the moment we're
3646160	3654080	failing to do you say right thank you second ian if you i mean i i'm aware that you guys can talk
3654080	3660160	for hours further and uh i hope you will at some point and i'm very glad you've met and i i feel
3660160	3664560	very validated by the decision to bring you together and i hope it's the first of many
3664560	3672480	conversations because i'm aware that you're um you share depths um and common interests that are uh
3672720	3678480	uh are are sometimes esoteric and are sometimes extremely difficult but of fundamental importance
3678480	3683920	and um you know you're both first principles thinkers in a way that the world currently needs
3683920	3689120	so i'm very grateful to to have you here and bring you together but i'm also conscious we have 330
3689120	3696160	odd people um some of whom are keen to ask you things um i will before i'll ask you something
3697120	3703680	myself first but just to allow the audience to sort of warm up i am keen as a point of
3703680	3709760	principle in these sessions that we try and ask a question about what's just being spoken of
3710560	3718720	um not to revert back to the gochus 101 as i say um of course uh you may have you may have more
3718720	3722480	fundamental queries but it would be good because you've just shared something together that we
3722480	3730720	that we focus on what we've heard um with that in mind i am feeling significantly clearer about
3730720	3738400	my sort of quam inquiry earlier vis a vis the mapping of the relationship between
3739120	3745280	value values and and so on um but i'm also curious about something that is sort of
3746160	3751120	point related to that and it came up last in the last session too for all the bashing of the
3751120	3756000	left hemisphere and and i know you you you're quite famous for saying that the left hemisphere is your
3756000	3760640	second favorite hemisphere um and that it's you know it's one to be loved and cherished and it
3760640	3766640	shouldn't be you know knocked down i i i feel this work that i feel responsible for and the
3766640	3771440	perspective is engaged in of working with first principles thinkers like yourselves
3772320	3775920	trying to make sense of what they're really saying philosophically about the nature of
3775920	3784960	reality and our capacity to know it maybe love it um relate to it there is a certain um dignified
3784960	3791440	beautiful role for the left hemisphere in taking a few moments as emissary just to get clear about
3791440	3797440	what exactly the master's saying right absolutely and that's why when i occasionally feel almost
3797440	3804000	guilty like when i part of me has a kind of weird socio epistemic guilt about trying to map these
3804000	3808720	things mentally in a kind of cartography because i feel shouldn't i just be presencing
3808720	3812720	shouldn't i just be with this shouldn't i be playing some music or doing some art here
3812720	3816240	instead i'm trying to sort of craft out with these words in a bubble chart how they link
3816240	3821040	together and i think no surely it's not that nonetheless what i was trying to get at is that
3821040	3828240	you you mentioned shellers hierarchy or or rather structure thereof of the sacred giving rise to
3828240	3833840	sort of fundamental truth beauty and goodness and then you make mention of this more derivative
3833840	3842640	values um and that's useful but what i what i was left wondering is if value is primordial
3842640	3848880	and pre-human and in some sense something that life is for for us to be in relationship with
3848880	3854640	as you argue in the book you go on to have a chapter on the sacred but help me out here with
3854640	3859600	the distinction not between values plural and the sacred but values singular and the sacred
3860160	3864480	how can we make a distinction between them that's useful to make sense of what's being said here
3866160	3873680	first of all i should just comment that shaler doesn't imply that um the sacred gives rise to
3873680	3881280	the next lower line of the pyramid and so on down to utility and he simply says that there is a
3881280	3889520	hierarchy of values and that um some are simply more important than others they are more central
3889520	3898720	if you like to the business of leading a fulfilled human life and what i would say my answer to it
3898720	3903440	also touches on what you've just said about the importance of the left hemisphere that it's good
3903440	3910400	that it should um as it were question and and try and make clearer to itself what it is that the
3910480	3914960	master is talking about but it has to do so knowing that at the end of the day whatever it
3914960	3920240	can come up with for short of whatever it is the master is saying so the process is useful in that
3920240	3924880	things come out of it but at the end of the day it's not going to have an equivalent map and say
3924880	3929760	ah i've got the master's message now and it's all this because that would automatically be wrong
3929760	3938160	so having said that and what i think we can see is that the sacred is something that is dark
3938960	3948480	um it's the mystics talk about it as a kind of visible darkness a light that's so bright that in
3948480	3957040	fact for us it is invisible and penetrable or unknowable now if that is the case what happens
3957040	3964720	is that when it passes through a prison we can then perhaps begin to see it it it the light is
3964720	3972640	somehow um softened felted and the prison through which that light of the sacred comes is the one
3972640	3980480	that generates in my view beauty goodness and truth that these are manifestations of it that
3980480	3988000	the creation can respond to and that are its principal lures that are calling to us to to to
3988000	3995360	go to it does that help i mean it's beautiful before i can decide whether it has utility in the
3995360	4001600	sense of helping um so already i'm feeling the feeling the right sort of relative importance
4001600	4007040	of things um it does help and i don't it doesn't need to be pristine there was a moment i i shared
4007040	4013920	this with zack prior to the call um many of you will know uh george lackoff and his work on sort of
4014000	4021520	the representation of um concepts predict being embodied and sort of often often grounded
4021520	4027040	in metaphors of the body so you know an idea is big for an idea is big for example or um
4027840	4034560	you can um you know you can play with notions of of something being a long shot you know and
4034560	4038320	there's these sort of expressions which get at the idea that the way the mind organizes itself
4038320	4043600	conceptually is through these spatial metaphors and i found myself having a moment reading your
4043600	4049680	chapter 26 where i was going okay so you've got this value that's sort of primordial and
4050320	4056800	pre-human and fundamental and then you have love which comes up and you speak about the
4056800	4060480	relationship between love and then you have meaning and you have purpose and not just
4060480	4066960	any old purpose but cosmological teleological purpose and and i'm trying my mind to actually
4066960	4072640	see this in space so i had this moment of sort of you know um whatever that's called
4072640	4077120	edictic imagery or whatever that word is for this sort of thing in your mind and i was trying to
4077120	4081120	sort of right trying to picture that in my mind and i suddenly realized how absurd the whole thing
4081120	4087680	was in the sense that i couldn't possibly capture it because it somehow was as you say
4088880	4094720	always going to be an inadequate representation of what was actually being described and it was
4094720	4098960	very useful it was almost it was a it was a sort of micro spiritual experience of sorts because
4098960	4105680	there was a definitely a sense of these fundamental features of the universe love truth beauty goodness
4105680	4111360	value the sacred meaning purpose there's a lot of them right it's a family and and and you've said
4111360	4116000	before the vis-a-vis the mogulcus maneuver just as the one as many the many as one so it's not true
4116000	4119600	that they're all the same there and there's one sense the same and another sense they're not
4120160	4124960	and when you try and hold that in your mind and actually see how they map together is if it was
4124960	4131440	some kind of flowchart the only answer is a kind of laughter because it doesn't really work and it's
4131440	4136320	a liberation in some ways that it doesn't work and yet there's still a part of me that's a little
4136320	4143840	bit uneasy and i'm curious if anyone else feels that way well and if Zach or Zach or Ian has anything
4143840	4147600	to comment before other people come in i'll start looking at people's questions now while you're
4147600	4154480	answering that okay well i i'd just like to respond since well it's your point is it is
4154480	4162320	aimed at what i've been saying i suppose and i i i agree with that that idea that there seem to be
4163360	4172240	a family of these things but another way of looking at it is that i didn't put love in as a value
4173200	4182880	because i think love is the grounding the nature of being whatever and the sacred is our sense of
4184080	4192480	that ground of being and you could say that that ground of being and call it god whatever
4192480	4202800	one wants to call it but the ultimate essence of of the creation of of the cosmos is itself
4202800	4209280	purposeful that it in general it generates automatically not as an extra thing not as a
4209280	4216720	sort of subsequently now i'm going to have a purpose but it is purposive love is purposive
4216720	4227760	it is ultimately aimed towards something that it's it's directed it is relational automatically
4227760	4233520	but i wouldn't again make relation another separate thing the trouble is that we're so
4234880	4241440	in hoc to things and i almost called this book there are no things because it isn't a thing
4241440	4246960	truth and beauty and goodness but what we're really trying to adumbrate is the nature of this
4247680	4256000	loving core that is in itself true that is in itself beautiful what it does is automatically
4256000	4262560	good although that is something that theologians could dispute for is it good because god automatically
4262560	4267760	goes there or does god go there because it's good you know and so forth but what i'm really
4267760	4274080	saying in brief is that these are different unfoldings of a single element the multiplicity is
4274080	4281840	the many strands that do nothing to um in any way imperil the integrity of the whole but in fact
4281840	4289280	enhance it okay the closest the closest thing would be like a field right so we speak of a field
4289920	4296640	there's a unified field of value but it's not featureless yes basic property by field would be
4296640	4301600	eros we talk about eros so we talk about cosmorodic humanism in which eros is the foundational
4302400	4307680	field root of value but then all of these values differentiate out but some have existed
4307680	4315760	since the big bang and others are more or more recent but yeah they're not things and therefore
4315760	4320400	when you flow chart them and even when you try to sequence them in a strict way you can't
4321200	4328240	um the left hemisphere will do that at lower moral stages of development but maturity as
4328240	4334400	deepening into value perceptions sees inevitable value conflict and again it's not a harmonious
4334400	4340400	picture in its totality whitehead speaks about the the intensification of polarities not about
4340400	4346320	everything getting better but about the intensification of the polarities and dynamics of
4346320	4355280	values all co-evolving in tension right erotic kind of like basically self-disclosure
4356080	4366000	so erotic self-disclosure okay um i i i'm very good in a flash yeah yeah the questions the questions
4366000	4373680	are very good um and we'll come to them very quickly moving swiftly along so um i'm conscious that
4373680	4377120	we may not get through all of them but we're going to try and get to the best ones at least
4377120	4383200	i'm also conscious that for many who are of a philosophical mindset um some of this discussion
4383200	4389440	will have been delicious and um exactly the kind of their staple diet if you like but for others
4390000	4396400	we're more practical mindset perhaps less philosophically um you know adept it can seem
4396400	4400240	a little abstract so i have a really good question here which is principally for zack actually although
4400240	4404800	i'm sure you will have thoughts on it and because i happen to know that zack has written a great
4404800	4408640	deal about propaganda and thought about it at length and written about it on the conciliants
4408640	4414560	project website and we're in a time of intense propaganda zack the question here is from kevin
4414560	4419760	cotwas if i've said that correctly and he just says can you talk about the weaponization of value
4419760	4428560	in propaganda and uh i'm sure he has thoughts too but if you could begin yeah i mean a few things
4428560	4434320	to say there one and i mentioned already that preference falsification being the foundation
4434320	4437680	of advertising just clarify what you mean by that because i didn't quite get at the first
4437680	4444080	falsification when you think you value something but you actually don't truly value it you've kind
4444080	4452960	of been tricked into valuing it sometimes through coercion sometimes through uh tricks of psychology
4452960	4460320	so so it's like preference falsification is the goal of psychology excuse me of advertising
4460320	4464240	advertising was one of the main places where psychology was operationalized after world war
4464240	4472480	two coming out of large-scale propaganda programs that were built during the cold war and so you're
4472480	4478800	looking at a science of persuasive communication and if everything we're saying is true about the
4478800	4484320	intrinsic nature of value and the way the human nervous system responds to value then if i'm trying
4484320	4489360	to get you to do something and i'm a psychologist and i know that then the first thing i do is
4489360	4497040	manipulate your value systems and your value preferences so without even speaking about
4497040	4506800	propaganda just staying on advertising we can see that the saturation of that kind of persuasive
4507440	4512720	to the point of being coercive style of communication uh is one of the things that
4512720	4519520	has undermined our ability to perceive actual value right so that's the idea that if you're
4520080	4523280	if you're succeeding as an advertiser you're not just getting them to value what
4523840	4529280	you want them to value like coca-cola right like why did we drink coca-cola right it's actually bad
4529280	4535600	for you but people really want to drink coca-cola the main reason you want to drink coca-cola is
4535600	4540080	because of advertising and they're incredibly they've been doing it for decades and they're very
4540080	4546320	good at it it's very subtle so the making you want something making you perceive value but it's not
4546320	4550160	actually value just to play devil's advocate for coca-cola here i feel like i'm on the bbc or
4550160	4553920	something trying to be impartial i mean all all know how that goes but i was going to say it's
4553920	4557760	not just caffeine and sugar don't i just want the caffeine and sugar and some some some sweeteners
4559760	4563760	yes but that's again part of the falsification of value what you want is to feel good
4565840	4571520	what you actually want is to feel good and the falsification of value goes right down into
4571520	4578000	your actual body and limbic system and so like when so when we sent our boys over there with
4578000	4583200	world war two they were not in a position to position to really know geopolitically what was
4583200	4587600	going on they were in a position to have been told what was going on right and they fought for
4587600	4594560	their country with love with full flux of value as a result of propaganda and again propaganda
4595600	4599840	is very complex to discuss because there's a thin line between propaganda and education
4600480	4608240	and it becomes the evil twin of education is propaganda both of them piggyback on value
4608240	4615040	section both of them deploy strategies of getting you to value something right that's what i was
4615040	4620160	going to ask you zach that's why your question to ian earlier about how one begins to cultivate,
4620160	4626000	refine, develop the capacity for value section is culturally critical almost a matter of
4626000	4632640	civilizational survival and it doesn't just apply sort of in the classroom but you it also applies
4632640	4639360	more in the front line of culture influencing our everyday activity and then because values
4640240	4647040	are values they are also explicitly thematized reflectively by propagandists so like the culture
4647040	4656160	wars are a result of both sides trying to create conflict around value and values so to get that
4656160	4660960	one of the things that makes it hard to talk about values is that they've been subject to
4662640	4668880	in the united states to a kind of internal informational civil war where just like in the
4668880	4674560	30 years war the different visions of heaven and hell and other things were used by propagandists
4674560	4679280	to get the Protestants and the Catholics to really fear and hate one another similarly
4680720	4686560	digital propaganda is working us into a frenzy mostly along these value fall lines which are
4686560	4692880	identified and then cleaved and like salt is thrown on the wound and they're they're trying
4692880	4701120	to make value conflict as polarized and difficult as possible so there's tons to say but because
4701520	4705840	I know you have yeah you have no lack of things to say on propaganda and for those who are interested
4705840	4710800	if you go to the conciliants project there is I believe three very considered early day essays
4710800	4716080	on propaganda that Zach's written there maybe Michael if you can put that in the chat if you
4716080	4722480	can find it but it is there um Ian any thoughts on propaganda before we come on to other things
4722480	4730160	I think I think Zach covered it perfectly and I agree with him over and I thought the point about
4730160	4735280	education and propaganda being evil twins and sometimes being confused with one another
4735840	4741760	particularly important at the moment right I agree um this is quite a more refined sort of
4741760	4746240	philosophical question but a pretty important one because I've fallen into this trap myself
4747200	4753200	it's by Andrew M Davies or Davis sorry much of this conversation has bounced between aesthetic
4753280	4760720	and moral value a lot of bouncing whitehead makes the claim that moral order is merely
4760720	4766720	certain aspects of aesthetic order here aesthetic order is wider and deeper than moral value
4767280	4771200	how do you understand the here's the question how do you understand the relationship between
4771200	4777360	aesthetic and moral order is one more ontologically primitive than the other so it's an eight
4777360	4782160	and a plus for the question there Andrew what's the answer is that can Ian do you want to go first
4783600	4790640	yes okay um it's a good question and it's one that I do um tackle a bit in in the in the uh
4790640	4800640	at least in in this chapter I think um beauty is a difficult one because you know I'm I'm a great
4800640	4807440	admirer of Keats but he did die when he was 26 and he was a poet um he wasn't on oath as a
4807440	4813280	philosopher as it were when he said that beauty is truth truth beauty this is all you know and
4813280	4820880	all you need to know um if it were as simple as that we wouldn't have two quite distinct terms
4820880	4828160	and the questioner wouldn't have used them um nor would whitehead have thought that these words
4828160	4834960	were worth preserving because I can think of things that are beautiful and definitely not good and I
4834960	4840560	can think of things that are good that are definitely not beautiful unless you I mean it's
4840560	4846800	always open to somebody to so twist the meaning of a word that it will now encompass but in the way
4846800	4853760	we normally use them they're different um so it causes caused me more trouble than anything to be able
4853760	4861040	to um deal with these and it's interesting that whereas moral values seem much more distinctly
4861040	4870240	carved up between the right and left hemispheres as David Hecht at UCL says um the um the right
4870240	4878160	hemisphere basically deals in in good and and the left in in what is morally bad I mean that that
4878160	4885600	that's that's his words um or a paraphrase of them and and um so it's much easier whereas with the
4885600	4890560	with the matter of beauty both hemispheres do get involved with it and do contribute to it
4890560	4897840	although to go into the niceties of it I would take us too too long and too far I don't agree
4897840	4905920	in short um with whitehead on this particular point um uh Andrew uh knows that I'm a great white
4905920	4913680	hedion um but on this one I just can't really agree with it because it seems to me that in a way
4914320	4922160	we value beauty because ultimately it is good but we don't value good ultimately because it's
4922160	4931040	beautiful I that's the way I see it maybe that's a product of my um modern western european education
4931040	4936960	and a degree of Protestantism in the background that I've overlaid heavily with other strands
4936960	4942880	but I don't know that's my take on it what do you say is that I mean I'm not sure either but I think
4942880	4949040	about just the big three the good the true and the beautiful having been differentiated for quite a
4949040	4954720	long time uh so there's something to the value of that differentiation that in modernity they became
4954720	4962320	disassociated and you know you had science running running hegemonic over the over the good and the
4962320	4968560	true um but I also think of Kant and the structure of the three critiques right and then at the end
4968560	4975440	Kant basically is saying that you know it reduces down to this very complex form of aesthetic judgment
4976080	4980800	which is which is more than just the judgment of beauty it's also the ability to perceive the
4980800	4986400	teleological to basically to perceive value per se would be my reading of the third critique
4986960	4994320	in which case there is something that is neither of those three that's more deep so if I think
4994320	5000480	about the sacred I think sometimes that's just an intensification of all three at once and that
5000480	5007520	there's something like a deeper field of allurement or arrows that is primary to the emergence of
5007520	5013760	even the differentiation of those three and there's a story that um Weber tells and Habermas
5013760	5019600	tells about the differentiation of those value spheres after their pre-modern synthesis that
5019600	5027360	there was a time when they were merged in the idea of the sacred uh that slowly they were differentiated
5027360	5033200	out uh Habermas talks about the linguistification of the sacred and the differentiation out of those
5033200	5040880	three and then eventually the asymmetry that emerged with uh the unbounded rationality of
5040880	5045600	modernity so that's me not really answering the question but talking about what I know about the
5045600	5053840	person um like what if I could just quickly um come back for a couple of things um the first
5053840	5061280	is that your um invocation of Kant shows perfectly what I mean by what one can achieve by redefining
5061280	5068080	what one means by beauty and because if you call this aesthetic then you are enlarging the meaning
5068080	5072640	beyond what most people normally use it to mean in order you know like Humpty Dumpty you're allowed
5072720	5077840	to do that but then have you really achieved anything by applying this particular term to it
5078800	5084240	and and the other is just to say that I think your illumination that the sacred is all the
5084240	5088400	three of these combined it's just perfect because this is what I was saying about the light being
5088400	5094480	differentiated through colored glass um but when the the colors are separated one doesn't call red
5094480	5105440	blue you know but nonetheless in the light they are together right and it occurs to me Zach um
5105440	5109200	and I know Ian you know Daniel Schmackenberger as well a little bit but Daniel has said in
5109200	5113280	a couple of his talks I've heard him say I don't know whether he still holds to this philosophically
5113280	5117920	but it's a very elegant line he says I wouldn't really care about goodness and truth if it wasn't
5117920	5124320	for beauty that was his way of putting it it was something about the charm and sort of um
5125040	5131200	intuitive elegance and attraction of beauty was sort of primary that it sort of drew you and you
5131200	5136880	know this is how I understand his claim and there was something about beauty that that was the prior
5136880	5142160	motivation to to look at goodness and truth I'm not saying it's right I'm not saying it's exactly
5142160	5145680	of how he means it but for what it's worth he said it and I find it quite quite an elegant
5147680	5152000	a proposition or provocation to to think about but Ian you've already answered adequately why
5152000	5158160	that might not be the whole story and likewise that yes and I want to get to some other questions
5158160	5165040	and I can see we still have let's see quite a few more Michael do you want to take a shot um and ask
5165040	5174320	it yourself yep yep I'm happy to Jonathan thanks for that um yeah so I guess my question stands
5174320	5182240	from the fact that I feel this view that is being put forth here that value is ontologically
5182240	5189360	fundamental if that was to take hold more broadly in society and culture I feel it could be very very
5189360	5200400	powerful like a very very powerful view to transform our way of relating to life um and I guess and
5201360	5205760	you know before I ask this question I'm aware that it might be my left hemisphere grasping
5205760	5210640	after certainty but I'm wondering and this is really for both of you Zach and Ian
5212000	5217520	how likely is it do you think that in time the the evidence for this will become more and more
5217520	5225200	compelling like do you see that the new scientific findings um will start to make a compelling case
5225200	5230160	for the fact that that we can actually quite convincingly say no value is ontologically
5230160	5238160	fundamental um Zach you mentioned about how we see maybe um in biology values that seem to be
5239120	5245680	existence existent out with any need for human beings to exist um so I'm kind of thinking in
5245680	5257680	those terms um yeah I'll leave out that and I have something to say first and then then use that
5257680	5267120	yeah sure go ahead um well as I always say prediction is is a fool's game but I don't
5267120	5273360	think that science will ever answer this question or shed a great deal of light on it it's a
5273360	5278960	philosophical question of a kind that science is not really equipped to answer I would say
5279920	5283600	and you know that's no disrespect to science but there are certain places
5283600	5291040	science won't take us profitably I think though that it may become more vivid to us when the
5291760	5300560	over sophisticated over technical over scientific way of conceiving ourselves has been blown away
5301360	5311360	by a collapse um some kind of cataclysm that will lead to suffering and here I
5312880	5320800	go back to something that I think uh Zach um was I think getting at when he talked about
5321440	5327520	or hinted at the idea that suffering might actually enable us to see certain things
5328080	5334480	that otherwise we wouldn't and I do think that in a paradoxical way but then you know that I
5334480	5342640	profoundly believe in the coincidence of opposites that the um the way in which things will get better
5342640	5352240	is actually by getting worse that in doing that our our vision will become clearer our responses
5352240	5359040	will become more natural and we will see what matters and that that which matters to us and
5359040	5365600	which will enable us to survive will to be to be able to trust people and to achieve something
5365600	5372240	which really exemplifies goodness truth and beauty and I you might say but in circumstances of
5372240	5379040	dereliction would beauty matter and in the book I emphasize that the earliest human artifacts that
5379040	5388000	we know about are are beautiful and seem as um what was he called the chap who did 100 the
5388000	5393760	history of the world in 100 objects suddenly forgotten his name Neil um the the director
5393760	5399600	of the British Museum for heaven's sake what was he called I don't know anyway well anyway
5400400	5404480	you surely know about the history of the world in 100 objects anyway no yeah yeah yeah but not the
5404480	5411280	author no no okay I mean he's very well known but his name suddenly gone but anyway he he said
5411280	5417040	one of the things that he noticed was that when we first started making things the simplest you
5417040	5422640	know hand actors we required them to be beautiful as much as we required them to be of utility
5424880	5432080	right and I quote a a consultation on a school in Mexico where the parents in a very poor area
5432080	5436160	were going to be gifted with a school and they were asked what above all they would value in
5436160	5439760	that school and the first thing they said was that they wanted it to be beautiful
5442000	5448400	yeah I mean the return the return to value at the core of culture is inevitable if cultures
5448400	5457120	to survive that's one almost uh like a a symptom of the state of our civilization is the degree to
5457120	5465280	which we are removing value from the center of culture and what's interesting is that uh the
5465280	5472960	native disposition of the human is to respond to value still so we haven't been completely dehumanized
5472960	5478960	yet and there's evidence to show that like during natural disasters and when other things occur people
5478960	5485120	spontaneous spontaneously do heroic things they spontaneously collaborate that the number of
5485120	5489600	people who go completely sociopathic and actually much smaller than you'd think that our spontaneous
5489600	5495680	action under complete adrenal overload is basically to respond to immediate value and save that baby
5495680	5500560	and get this person water and just do what needs to be done so there's a fallback position of the
5500560	5508800	human nervous system that's involved to respond to basic value so I'm isn't green and paxton have
5508800	5514320	also demonstrated much to their surprise that the default position for us is to be honest
5514400	5519200	and that lying is actually stressful and difficult not that we are naturally deceitful
5520000	5525760	so I think these things are really important that you you've just said sorry and just just that we
5525760	5532400	have a few minutes left and I I've been brought to task and quite rightly for the genuine balance
5532400	5538800	in the questions and it was entirely because I hadn't seen askable questions um but I believe
5538800	5545120	there's one from clear I can't see you clear very easily on the screen but if you're there please
5546320	5550000	let it be known to us with a hand up and that will make it easier to find us
5550000	5553600	have find you I know what your question was roughly but it would be better if you can ask it in your
5553600	5560160	own voice it's early morning here and it's in Wellington New Zealand um and welcome
5560320	5570560	me thank you no it just sparked my attention was that um when you were saying I'm a PhD student
5570560	5580240	and I'm I'm I'm dealing um with these topics and um I've very much focused on the idea that you
5580240	5587680	know of the paradigm shift to make consciousness fundamental to matter um and you know um matter
5587680	5593440	as secondary and consciousness as primary I'm looking at that issue um and then you said that
5593440	5600160	value is fundamental and I thought well how many things can be fundamental and if value and consciousness
5600160	5606320	are both fundamental um what's the relationship between the two of them and are the other um
5606320	5613520	qualities that are can be defined as fundamental good question and perhaps I could just have a
5613520	5621520	quick stab at that um uh I myself hold that consciousness is an ontological primitive and
5621520	5629680	that matter is an aspect of consciousness um but it seems to me that consciousness is intrinsically
5629680	5635840	relational that um consciousness is always consciousness towards or consciousness of
5636400	5642640	something else and therefore immediately comes into the question the nature of this
5642640	5650720	relationship and if it if there is a relationship um and maybe if one would say that it is intrinsic
5650720	5656320	and here I'm not multiplying entities but just saying these are other facets that one can talk
5656320	5661920	about about love love is intrinsically relational it is intrinsically beautiful it is intrinsically
5662000	5671040	good it's intrinsically true when it is a true love so that these things are I mean we get tied up
5671040	5676960	in in linguistic knots but it's not that there are a whole cupboard full of entities and we come back
5676960	5683040	to my point that there's a problem when we verify things whereas all we're really alluding to is
5683040	5690160	different qualities of this primal whatever it is that's would be my answer
5692320	5698880	Zach thank you Zach it's a very deep question um and as I alluded to before you know I would take
5698880	5707200	consciousness matter time space motion value as differentiations from an underlying field
5707200	5712560	which I would characterize probably as being a field of value if I had to pick one of them
5714000	5719680	which is interesting that again the basic root of the cosmos is like a desire like an
5719680	5728400	appetite like a wanting to be and so and then once you get after those the question is there's
5728400	5732400	some more fundamental set is one of the things that we're working on a limited set of first
5732400	5737920	principles and first values that would characterize cosmic evolution basically from the beginning
5738560	5742640	which we can either choose to self-consciously align with these first principles and values
5742640	5749280	of the cosmos or not and this is the view of cosmorodic humanism as we're articulating it recently
5750160	5755200	so I'm not clear how to I don't it's kind of above my philosophical pay grade to make the final
5755200	5760080	decision about about those fundamental categories but I but I do think like if I
5760800	5765520	that the list that Ian gave where you add consciousness and value to matter time space
5765520	5773600	and motion that's a very important basic list and the addition of value is just
5773600	5778400	one of the most important philosophical moves that that can be made in our culture today because
5778400	5783440	people kind of buy consciousness they're kind of even physicists are willing to buy consciousness
5783440	5790320	but the idea that the universe matters and has a purpose and that the universe responds to value
5790320	5796320	is intrinsically valuable is a little bit like that so the addition is just so critical I believe
5797360	5804400	and puts the press on puts the press on the the hardcore left view reductionist view it puts them
5804400	5812960	into a corner okay thank thank you Zach is that a good enough response to the question yes I will
5812960	5818880	ponder that but the the only thing is I was thinking is that matter time space of all three
5818880	5825520	dimensional activities or qualities and I'm just you know I always thought things like
5825520	5835520	consciousness value beyond maybe three dimensions so that's again a deep question Ian I have the
5835520	5840160	same similar experience while shifting between these things in the second volume yes that there's
5840560	5845680	there are different kinds of things going on that are all fundamental yes you're asking
5846560	5853920	a very deep question and my attempt to answer it very briefly will not be satisfactory but
5854880	5858640	what I would what I would say at the moment is this that
5862640	5868640	I believe that matter is a phase of consciousness that could be considered secondary to consciousness
5868640	5874160	or could just be a way in which consciousness can manifest under certain circumstances
5874160	5879120	its reason for doing so is to provide two things that consciousness can't which is
5879680	5884640	a degree of permanence and a degree of resistance and the degree of resistance and permanence up
5885520	5891520	related to one another and why resistance is important to creation would take me a long time
5891520	5897760	but it's a thing I deal with in the book and once you've got matter and it cannot
5898720	5905440	we cannot talk about anything material at all or imagine it without the need for time and space
5905440	5912000	so when people tell me that by some mathematical jiggery-poetry they find equations in which time
5912000	5917680	disappears I would say well you've just cut the rug from under science and indeed philosophical
5917680	5923120	discourse because without the existence of time we can't say anything know anything and we can't
5923120	5930560	rely on anything that we empirically experiment with and so we get into knots because of the
5930560	5937680	limitations of our language but also of our consciousness we're limited beings let's enjoy it
5937680	5944240	and let's celebrate it and but what we have is glorious and it's up to us to you know respond
5944240	5950640	well to what we've been given thank you Ian it's a great thought to end on being limited beings
5950640	5956960	time is one of our limitations and we were trying perspective or trying to be disciplined
5956960	5961600	about our 100 minute events 100 minute 100 minute moments we're thinking of calling them we're
5961600	5967760	still working on it internally but really glad that you've all shared this one with us and
5969120	5974160	there will be further events coming up we will have one in two weeks like I say we're not
5974240	5977840	quite certain who the mystery guest is but it's one of two people we're currently clarifying
5977840	5984000	that in the next couple of days that will become clear and and this will carry on for several
5984000	5990400	weeks and we the event is free and Perspectiva is a charity but if you've enjoyed this event and you
5990400	5995120	want to support our work please go to our website and there is a donate button there if you feel
5995120	6000240	like giving it additionally to allow us to carry on doing this kind of event carry on publishing
6000240	6008240	this kind of work and all that remains for me to say really is a very deep heartfelt thank you
6008960	6016960	to Ian McGillchrist and Zachary Stein thank you very much both of you thank you to David
6016960	6022240	and thank you for those who put questions in the chat if it could be saved and sent to me later
6022240	6028800	I'd like to see them because I'm very interested in new light on what I'm trying to illuminate myself
6029760	6034480	yes and yes thanks a lot for the questions and we'll hopefully see most of you again soon and
6036240	6042480	I think over and out thanks a lot take care and see you again soon
