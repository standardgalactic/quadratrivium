WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
Okay, welcome everybody to this evening's anti-debate.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.600
As you know, I'm Jonathan Rouson, I'm Director of Prospectiva and the anti-debate process

00:35.600 --> 00:40.560
has been funded by the John Templeton Foundation to give us two years to create this thing.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.140
And we're currently a few months into that, so what you're about to observe is a kind

00:44.140 --> 00:48.120
of toddler rather than a fully fledged adolescent or adult.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.840
It's something in the process of creation, but let me say a little bit at the beginning

00:51.840 --> 00:57.520
before we start about why we're doing it and what it's about.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
It has its place.

00:58.520 --> 01:04.680
The debate can be beautiful, edifying, it's often a spectacle, a clash, entertaining,

01:04.680 --> 01:09.640
it's often very enlivening, it's done well, it can even be informative.

01:09.640 --> 01:16.000
But sadly, the way the world is today, there's many structural incentives towards polarization

01:16.000 --> 01:22.080
built into the way we get our information, not just our papers, but the channels we watch,

01:22.080 --> 01:27.320
the social media feeds that we have algorithmically being done to us, means that on any given

01:27.320 --> 01:32.440
issue we're less likely to see it in the round and more likely to see it in a way that reinforces

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
our biases.

01:33.440 --> 01:39.280
So we're in a phase of history where divergence and bifurcation and disagreement is actually

01:39.280 --> 01:46.240
being compounded and exacerbated by the systems and structures that prevail.

01:46.240 --> 01:53.280
And this is a big deal because democracies or even any functioning form of government

01:53.280 --> 01:59.760
that includes people relies on a capacity to discuss adequately what's going on.

01:59.760 --> 02:05.160
It relies on a sense-making process, if you like, a meaning-making process.

02:05.160 --> 02:10.680
And debate was the sort of high end of what it was like to observe a culture talking to

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
itself.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.920
So there will be a future for debate.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.640
It's not that we're against all forms of it, but we do think there's a case for trying

02:16.640 --> 02:18.880
to develop something radically new.

02:18.880 --> 02:26.480
I would say that the key idea to grasp here is that whereas debate is primarily about opposing

02:26.480 --> 02:32.000
views in which the center of inquiry is somehow in the middle of the room and people are trying

02:32.000 --> 02:34.280
to figure out who's winning, which side am I on?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.680
That's sort of debate classically conceived.

02:37.520 --> 02:44.040
But we live in a time where we're all exposed to things that we struggle to make sense of,

02:44.040 --> 02:46.760
moments where we can't quite agree with ourselves.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.040
Our values don't always align with our actions.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.720
Our ideas don't always chime with our values.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.000
And a lot of what the anti-debates are getting at is that internal struggle.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.800
And it's a struggle you'll see between us on stage, probably, but it's also one we want

02:58.800 --> 03:00.520
you to experience, too.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.120
It's about finding your own inner center in a relationship.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.240
So what are we trying to achieve at the end of it?

03:05.240 --> 03:08.280
It's not some beautiful middle position in which everyone can agree on.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.600
It's not some consensus verdict.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.480
It's a deeper felt sense of your relationship to the issue of hand.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.320
And another beauty is that we don't know what the issue is yet.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.320
We're about to find out.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
Thank you.

03:19.320 --> 03:41.400
I'm going to ask my colleagues here to spend a moment now just going into themselves and

03:41.400 --> 03:51.400
asking for a provisional question that feels it matters right now, that feels maybe a little

03:51.400 --> 03:56.560
bit uncomfortable, maybe a little bit pregnant with possibility.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.080
Would you like to get us going with a provisional question?

04:01.080 --> 04:04.440
Is this a moment in history?

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
Maybe we shouldn't be striving so much.

04:05.440 --> 04:10.440
If I could put it more bluntly, it's like, should we feel guilty about not being able

04:11.440 --> 04:14.440
or what is this consternation?

04:14.440 --> 04:18.440
Elizabeth, how are you feeling about what you're hearing in relation to your question about

04:18.440 --> 04:20.440
is fear ever useful?

04:20.440 --> 04:22.440
It feels related, but it does feel quite separate.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.440
Or rather, it feels like there's a hearing or a polarity here.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.440
And they're related because they're about, oh, who do we be?

04:29.440 --> 04:32.440
What is the state of being we should be seeking?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.440
What's come to meaner now?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.440
Is masculinity the problem?

04:36.440 --> 04:42.440
I just worry that a lot of the conversations we've been having feel quite abstract, maybe.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.440
And I think I don't mean to pose this question so that we can find the bogeyman and blame

04:48.440 --> 04:53.440
something, but I feel like we need something tangible to unpack and to look at.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.440
How are you guys doing with this now as well, in particular?

04:56.440 --> 05:00.440
There's something about my question, which would definitely include this question.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.440
There's no question of that.

05:03.440 --> 05:08.440
So I'm certainly not attached to my way into the problem.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.440
I think that's another way into the same problem.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.440
And I'm going to ask, first of all, for a show, a question for Indra's question,

05:15.440 --> 05:19.440
is this a moment in history asking us to step up?

05:19.440 --> 05:21.440
And then let's, oh, we've got a couple here as well.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
OK, thank you.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.440
So let's now get a show of hands.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.440
Is masculinity the problem?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
Show of hands.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.440
OK.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.440
So is masculinity the problem we will go with?

05:31.440 --> 05:37.440
Would anyone in the room just like any kind of clarifications about the question?

05:37.440 --> 05:42.440
I mean, I guess people have at least a start of 10 on what masculinity is.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.440
Mina, are you happy with the way that the question is framed, as you originally framed it?

05:46.440 --> 05:47.440
Yeah.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.440
The question stems from the many discussions that we've been having.

05:51.440 --> 06:00.440
So is it the problem for many of the big challenges of the 21st century?

06:01.440 --> 06:07.440
My sense is that there's sort of two things that are really causing a lot of the problems,

06:07.440 --> 06:15.440
whether it's the climate emergency or polarization, poverty and inequality, those kinds of things.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.440
But one is the kind of the economic model that we have.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
It's completely unsustainable.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
We are exploiting our planet.

06:23.440 --> 06:29.440
We're exploiting ourselves in order to sustain the economic model that reigns.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.440
And then there's the kind of the model of social, of relationship,

06:35.440 --> 06:40.440
not just social relations between humans, but relationship with ourselves individually,

06:40.440 --> 06:46.440
with each other, and then with the more than human natural world.

06:46.440 --> 06:52.440
And in both of these, like both relationship and the economic model,

06:52.440 --> 07:01.440
I feel as though without reimagining masculinity, which has shaped our largest economies

07:01.440 --> 07:07.440
and family structures that feed into economies and so on.

07:07.440 --> 07:13.440
And also, I guess, a kind of quest to explore other parts of the world,

07:13.440 --> 07:17.440
which has resulted in colonialism and neocolonialism.

07:17.440 --> 07:25.440
It's men who have done these things and continue to largely lead the world.

07:25.440 --> 07:34.440
And also, in so far as our relationships and how we may not be able to express emotions with each other,

07:34.440 --> 07:43.440
how we denounce interiority and always stay on this kind of abstract space.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.440
And that feels to me like it's actually very connected to how we perceive masculinity.

07:49.440 --> 07:54.440
We have a question now. You have completed the first stage of the anti-debate.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.440
We didn't know what we were going to talk about 15 minutes ago. Now we do, my goodness.

08:03.440 --> 08:09.440
We're going to invite you to come outside and we're going to create a line where we ask you to

08:09.440 --> 08:14.440
place yourself on this line between yes and no and all that lies between.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.440
So is masculinity the problem now? Yes, we'll be right here on the left

08:18.440 --> 08:22.440
and then you can place yourself anywhere on that line. That's how you feel.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.440
We're going to add one extra dimension to this. We're going to turn this into an axis.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.440
We still have yes and no, but then we're going to add,

08:31.440 --> 08:35.440
do we believe we can make progress on this together this evening?

08:35.440 --> 08:38.440
And really take a personal note of your own position so that you,

08:38.440 --> 08:41.440
because later we'll come back to at the end of the process

08:41.440 --> 08:44.440
and just to see if we have felt a shift in ourselves.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.440
We want to just get everything in the room that is relevant on the table.

08:56.440 --> 09:03.440
So if you have a metaphor or a short story that relates to this bigger social issue,

09:03.440 --> 09:07.440
if you have a strong emotional reaction to it, please say it.

09:07.440 --> 09:12.440
If this is okay with you guys, I don't think we're going to get into the biology of sex and gender.

09:12.440 --> 09:16.440
Let's keep that down off my board.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.440
We're talking about masculinity in its kind of broadest cultural sense.

09:21.440 --> 09:25.440
And I will guide a little bit, but I want to hear from everyone.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.440
So please do not hold back. You don't need to try and be clever.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.440
That's not what this is about. It's something else.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.440
The first thing to say is that the question may be sad,

09:35.440 --> 09:40.440
even though it's about masculinity and not maleness or being a man.

09:40.440 --> 09:44.440
Nonetheless, the first reaction was one of really, can this be true?

09:44.440 --> 09:47.440
There's such great men out there. Can it really be inherently about masculinity?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.440
For me, it's more to do with design.

09:49.440 --> 09:55.440
It's how we've designed a public space and that men have designed a public space in a certain way.

09:55.440 --> 10:02.440
And it's not holistic. It doesn't really draw on the more complex resources that we have.

10:02.440 --> 10:10.440
If there's a problem, it's the lack of culturally appropriate, sacred initiation into the masculine.

10:10.440 --> 10:16.440
And that's what we lost. And ever since we lost it, patriarchy developed.

10:16.440 --> 10:21.440
And men aren't doing very well. Some of them are killing themselves.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.440
They're trying to live up to this. Men are depressed.

10:25.440 --> 10:32.440
Men have sacrificed themselves for centuries in wars, running into machine guns and bayonets.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.440
I don't want to because you're opening, so I just want to say that completely.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.440
Patriarchy doesn't do men any favour.

10:39.440 --> 10:44.440
So a better question might be, what does it even mean to be human?

10:44.440 --> 10:47.440
That goes up there.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.440
The problem is the question.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.440
The question itself is very masculine.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.440
A binary.

10:56.440 --> 11:03.440
I had a very strong visceral and personal response to looking at that quality.

11:03.440 --> 11:08.440
And it sort of hues around two significant losses in my life.

11:08.440 --> 11:14.440
The first was my father, who died in a reckless accident, a careless violent accident.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.440
And then 40 years later, my husband hung himself.

11:17.440 --> 11:23.440
And so there's something around that like sort of heedless physicality or bravado.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.440
These are, particularly my husband, was a lovely sensitive man.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.440
And whatever made him turn to that kind of violent response.

11:32.440 --> 11:38.440
I mean, I think it works with Michael's sense of the lack of initiation into a whole being.

11:38.440 --> 11:43.440
So I wanted to add violence over here, Marley Charmin and Nina.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.440
And other things that there is just...

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
This is a big thing in the world.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.440
And it's mainly men who perpetuate it.

11:52.440 --> 11:58.440
But then over here, I want to put education, because I think what I see as the mother of a son.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.440
And I actually don't think it's shameful to say, as a father of daughters, I get feminism.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.440
Because I think when we encounter people in human relationships, that's how our empathy deepens.

12:06.440 --> 12:13.440
But as a mother of a son, I see the way the education system actually problematises young male

12:13.440 --> 12:19.440
who develop more slowly, generally, and can't sit still and need to run around in general.

12:19.440 --> 12:26.440
And actually the discipline system in schools is problematising masculinity at that age.

12:26.440 --> 12:32.440
The first thing that sprung to my mind was the image of Yin Yang and the movement of one into the other.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.440
And the fact that one contains the other as well.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.440
And it kind of frapped all the way.

12:38.440 --> 12:45.440
And that describes Sun and Moon or North slope or South slope of the same mountain.

12:45.440 --> 12:52.440
And that, I suppose, to one extent, if you kind of get it back here into balance

12:52.440 --> 12:58.440
and remove the extreme masculinity, the thing that you used to call feminine has its kind of masculine side.

12:58.440 --> 13:06.440
Just with that, I want men to be men and I know that my power is as a female in the feminine.

13:06.440 --> 13:10.440
Perhaps the majority of the things that were coming up and are going on that board

13:10.440 --> 13:17.440
are still being viewed through a structure of masculinity that is unsaid and largely invisible to us.

13:17.440 --> 13:29.440
And that there's this profound absence in our thinking overall about a sort of missing femininity.

13:29.440 --> 13:33.440
And I mean the feminine principle here, I don't mean women.

13:33.440 --> 13:45.440
Just as there's this extraordinary accumulation of historical absence in the institutions that we're dealing with.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.440
It's even in our framing of how we speak about this.

13:53.440 --> 14:01.440
Now, I can't take everyone who's got their hands up, so just take a second and think, is this missing on the board?

14:01.440 --> 14:07.440
I think there's quite a lot missing on the board, so I'll try to just say it as briefly as possible.

14:07.440 --> 14:14.440
But yeah, starting with the question being the problem, I don't think that it is.

14:14.440 --> 14:24.440
But one of the clarifications to make again is that, of course, to Dominique's point, masculinity is intersectional, you could say.

14:24.440 --> 14:33.440
So it's layered with race and ethnicity and culture and class and all of those kinds of things.

14:33.440 --> 14:39.440
The reason that the question I think is far more important than the question of just human interactions

14:39.440 --> 14:47.440
is because we are talking about things like toxic masculinity and crisis and masculinity.

14:47.440 --> 14:53.440
And even the conversation here in this room has kind of been talking a lot about kind of striving for balance

14:53.440 --> 14:57.440
and we brought up male pain, if you like.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.440
And I do want to acknowledge that that exists and it's important to talk about.

15:00.440 --> 15:05.440
But actually, if you really think about it, masculinity and men are thriving.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.440
Men are leading countries. Men are doing less domestic work.

15:09.440 --> 15:15.440
Men are wealthier than women. Men are just incredibly privileged in comparison to women.

15:15.440 --> 15:22.440
So if any group is in or any construct is in crisis or it would be femininity.

15:22.440 --> 15:32.440
I'm tired of women not having power, not being able to shape our societies, not being able to shape conversations that impact our lives.

15:32.440 --> 15:37.440
I'm tired of women being raped and abused and killed and beaten up in their homes.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.440
I'm tired of not seeing women in all of the powerful institutions.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.440
I'm tired of women not being acknowledged as voices.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.440
I'm tired of old women being made invisible.

15:48.440 --> 15:54.440
I'm tired of girls being conditioned to become passive with toys.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.440
I'm just tired of so many things.

15:58.440 --> 16:09.440
And what I'm tired of of all perhaps is that men are not talking really about how masculinity is the problem.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.440
And so women once again have to do even that.

16:13.440 --> 16:20.440
I'm just tired of those conversations not happening and yet there is so much pain and so much suffering for women

16:20.440 --> 16:24.440
because masculinity and not humanity is the problem.

16:24.440 --> 16:28.440
Thank you so much. Thank you for being honest and bringing your feelings.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.440
Sorry, Michael. I'm going to just call a halt.

16:31.440 --> 16:36.440
If there's anything I could say to help at the end or if the question.

16:36.440 --> 16:42.440
I just, I think it's been really useful somehow.

16:42.440 --> 16:51.440
I hope everybody else felt that way but I just think that we should not leave this space and leave the question behind.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.440
Okay, so this is after the entry debate.

16:59.440 --> 17:07.440
We're now sort of reconfiguring our positions on this question and we have two axes basically.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.440
We have an axis on the existing question, is masculinity the problem?

17:11.440 --> 17:14.440
And if it's a yes, it's over here and if it's a no, it's over here.

17:14.440 --> 17:20.440
And now we have another dimension which is about our chance of making progress on this question in the wider world.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.440
And if it's a yes, it's in that direction and if it's a no, it's in that direction.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.440
In other words, you have to find yourself across two axes,

17:27.440 --> 17:31.440
both where you are on the issue and how constant you are that we can make progress on it.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.440
So for me, I'm somewhat towards the yes but quite close to the middle.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.440
And after that debate, after the entry debate, which went, I feel quite well,

17:39.440 --> 17:42.440
I'm inclined to move backwards towards the yes.

17:42.440 --> 17:46.440
And I feel like I'm about happy here.

17:54.440 --> 17:59.440
Thank you for being part of the first public anti-debate.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.440
I can add a couple of things. One is that, as you know, it's still in its early stages,

18:03.440 --> 18:05.440
but it has very different principles.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
It's involving the audience in a certain way.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
It's bringing in emotions in a certain way.

18:09.440 --> 18:15.440
It's taking quite a lot of time to get the question right so that we feel a shared investment in the inquiry.

18:15.440 --> 18:20.440
It's stopping to check with the question holder about whether they sent the energy that they brought into the room

18:20.440 --> 18:22.440
as being honoured in the right way.

18:22.440 --> 18:28.440
And it's also about finding the disagreement within ourselves, not just between each other,

18:28.440 --> 18:32.440
but also our own grappling, our own dissonance, our own sense of struggle.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.440
Because if the question is a good question, we're likely to feel somewhat conflicted about it.

18:36.440 --> 18:42.440
And the anti-debate is about giving each of us a chance to feel that we can make some kind of progress

18:42.440 --> 18:47.440
within ourselves as well as in the shared context, what we might call collective individuation,

18:47.440 --> 18:51.440
something that we get closer to our own sense of who we are because of the question asked

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
and because we're sharing it together.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.440
And that's the beginning of the anti-debate.

18:55.440 --> 19:01.440
Future trinkets and alterations might include bringing in a longer spell.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
As we felt there, there was more to be said.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.440
It could last a whole day even, potentially.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
Some feel not, but we're discussing that.

19:09.440 --> 19:14.440
Someone to bring in metaphor to have a phase where we talk only about metaphor.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
Someone to improvise a little bit more.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.440
Someone a bit more ding-dong and a bit more clash.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.440
But for now, we're pretty happy that we have a template to work with,

19:23.440 --> 19:25.440
and I thank you all very much for joining us.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
Thank you.
