0	28000	The
28000	37560	Metacrisis is the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our
37560	46480	persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriing of reality. It arises from the
46480	54800	material and spiritual exhaustion of modernity. It is a multifaceted delusion. It is the crisis
54800	63680	within, between, and beyond our existing conceptual crisis, and it manifests institutionally and
63680	72920	culturally to the detriment of life on earth. The Metacrisis is something about our relationship
72920	77040	to all of the crises in the world. So it's reflexive, it's inherently reflexive, it's about
77040	83840	talking through, thinking through, how does human nature relate to this thing. Now, that's quite
83840	89120	distinct from polycrisis, or permanent crisis, or all these other terms. What's different about
89120	94160	Metacrisis is it acknowledges human interiority and relationality as a fundamental part of the
94160	98960	problem, or the problematic, I should say. The other way of looking at Metacrisis, and there are
98960	105480	many actually, but you can see it as the sign that modernity is ending. And so this expression of
105480	112760	Zack Stein's time between worlds, that we're in a time between worlds captures that. And it's
112800	116000	because we're in a time between worlds that things don't make sense, things begin to break
116000	121280	down. And this is where, again, you can get into Jean Gebster's notion of the mental rational
121280	126400	function, breaking down, which in plain language is intellectually we're not up to it anymore. The
126400	131760	intellectual function is not succeeding in making sense of the world. The world is eclipsing or
131760	137120	going beyond our capacity to make sense of it. And these are all signs that our existing form of
137120	143640	consciousness is somehow in need of evolution, in need of growing in some way. But I also think
143640	149840	Meta's kind of alive. I think there's a kind of participatory knowing of the Metacrisis. When
149840	153880	you put it as a proposition, and say define the Metacrisis, it becomes one more concept,
153880	160040	a million concepts. The Metacrisis is your daily experience of a world falling apart. It's your
160040	166000	incredulity towards how weird everything's becoming. Both the kind of rapid technological growth,
166880	173680	and the combination of synthetic biology and AI and virtual reality, changing the life world. And
173680	179840	then you have things like gene editing and so on that are actually changing life as such. And then
179840	185920	you have maybe a new phase of geological time. The academics are still arguing about it. But for
185920	191920	all intents and purposes, the whole of scene has ended. The stable geological period that has lasted
191920	198960	many thousands of years is now unstable. And we're entering uncharted territory. And you can see
198960	207640	that in the planetary boundary framework very clearly. But you can also feel it. The quick
207640	213240	definition would be something like the Metacrisis is all the crisis put together, right? And people
213240	217240	go, Oh, I see, I see. But they don't see, right? Because it's not really the end of it. That's
217240	222520	just the beginning of the conversation. The Metacrisis is also in the way you make sense of the
222520	230720	world, the way you feel it and in a mode in relation to it. The Metacrisis is in your incapacitated,
230720	239920	fully articulate and narrate the self in this context. And the Metacrisis is also, you know,
239920	246920	co extensive with co arising with this particular historical epoch. So it's not as though there
246960	252240	haven't been Metacrisis before. I mean, arguably, the time of Christ was a kind of Metacrisis. If
252240	259080	you think about an occupying Roman Empire, a kind of religious fervor people waiting for, you know,
259080	265320	Messiah, and then this person appears apparently doing miracles. Everyone's totally confused, right?
265320	271600	Just as we are kind of now. So one of many examples where it's not like we haven't had historical
271640	277800	turbulence before. Is there something distinct about today? Yes, that we're actually destroying our
277800	285640	only home. Our one precious planet in the infinite regions of space is under threat, not of annihilation
285640	292120	necessarily, but of being in a habitat for human life. That's in question now. The forms of
292120	297800	technology developing so rapidly that you can get into a world of autonomous weapons that really
297800	304160	can cause massive destruction. So what's different today is the degree of risk to the planet as a
304160	313240	whole. That's one distinct feature of the Metacrisis. But arguably we had this with nuclear weapons as
313240	320320	well. So it's different. But at the same time, I like to speak of the Metacrisis in a way that
320320	328120	doesn't just leave you dazed and confused, and looking as a passive subject at a kind of unfamiliar
328120	335560	object saying, that there is the Metacrisis. What do I do? That's not the way to go. The Metacrisis is
335560	342040	our historical inheritance. We're born into this. It's this generation that perceives it and feels
342040	347240	it. It's the set of cards we have to play. It's not something we can fix. The problem with the
347240	353240	crisis framing is that it's still a kind of tacit problem solution mentality. That would be
353240	358400	misunderstanding the nature of the Metacrisis. What's going on is a very slow historical process
358400	365080	that's culminating in a certain way and beginning to transform into something else. The nature of
365080	372600	what it transforms into will depend whether we survive and thrive or collapse. I believe about 90%
372840	377040	of what I just said. But there's another part of me that says, are we sure this is the time between
377040	383480	worlds? Is modernity really ending? If I told Elon Musk or Sam Altman that modernity is ending,
383480	389640	they'd just laugh at me, right? So I'm thinking of the other side saying, modernity is not ending.
389640	394880	What are you talking about? It's just taking off. If anything, technology is going to radically
394880	399040	change the world and solve a lot of these problems. Now, I don't feel that. It's not how I'm politically,
399120	406360	socially, culturally, intellectually oriented, but it's possible. It's possible that you solve
406360	413360	something like nuclear fusion and have abundant energy. It's conceivable that a lot of the
413360	419800	illnesses that lead us to suffer and die will be dealt with. It's conceivable that the powers that
419800	427120	be that somehow at the moment seems so cut off from the rest of the world will be in some sense
427200	433920	democratized and brought back into the fold such that the great benefits that are currently accruing
433920	439920	in a very small number of people are shared more widely and people might insist on that. So I'm
439920	452280	not sort of predisposed to feel that collapse is sort of absolutely necessary. On the other hand,
452320	459800	I do feel a kind of collapse is underway. And the challenge for us is collapse is underway. What
459800	466560	does a transformative response to collapse look like? But look, I say this in a kitchen in a
466560	474320	suburb of Landa, living quite a full, healthy life in a safe, democratic, more or less country.
475240	483800	So there's a lot of incredulity here. There's a lot of dissonance, confusion that we live as if
483800	489040	living a normal life while watching the news in our pocket, the kind of planet in our pocket that
489040	495000	says everything's falling apart. And yet we go to the shop and we buy our milk and we walk back home
495720	502680	as if things are normal. So that's kind of the Metacrisis too. It's the experience of
503800	511240	confusion that's now baked into our lives as we hear about a world collapsing on the news and on
511240	520120	our phones, but often live as if life could carry on forever. I was formed as many, many millions
520200	526440	of people were with a notion of what normal looks like. And a lot of what's going on is a kind of
526440	532240	clamouring to get normal back, like solve these problems, you know, like make them make democracy
532240	539680	stronger, make the market work, but just get rid of the environmental externalities. You know,
539680	544320	yes, there's problems with, you know, mass immigration, but surely we can just build more
544360	551280	houses and, you know, there's a kind of notion that make do and mend is enough, right? But many
551280	554920	don't feel that in their hearts, right? Many feel this is something altogether different.
554920	561600	Now, I think what's going on in our kind of community in our world is that most people are
561600	567200	reading the position and seeing that the make do and mend story doesn't doesn't sound like it's
567200	576280	true. It seems very unlikely. It seems more likely that they'll either be in the next years,
576280	583040	decades, hard to say exactly how quickly, but forms of dissolution and collapse in various
583040	588480	parts of the world, you know, you're already seeing people dying of heat deaths and people
588480	594520	losing their homes to floods and forest fires. And we don't, we haven't really seen AI biting
594520	599920	properly yet on the labor market, but that will begin to happen. And we see deep fakes
599920	605480	affecting democratic elections. And that will happen more like the Nobel Prize winner Maria
605480	612160	Ressa feels that 2024 will be the last year of proper democratic elections, because she sees the
612160	616520	problem of these technologies basically, you can't trust public opinion that the notion of
616520	622640	universal suffrage is compromised by the fact that the information stream is polluted with
622880	629720	falsehoods. And so the legitimacy that underpins democracy is in question, right? And so you get
629720	635360	problems with authoritarianism and so on. If that seems confusing, it's because it is. It's
635360	641080	because all these things are happening at once. Most people in our sector of the internet and our
641080	648200	sort of world feel intuitively that something deeper is going on. And we look to history sometimes
648240	654400	to see what is this like? What kind of transition is this like? And there are many ways of doing it,
654400	660000	but one would be the Axial Age. One would just say there was a moment in time about give or
660000	666640	take 500 years before Christ, where there was the early signs of systematic thought,
666640	674520	that we sort of moved out of a kind of mythos into a kind of logos, where we began to actually have
675520	684680	sort of reason and writing. And we would turn from a barter economy to money and there was a
684680	690520	move towards the cities away from the country. And in our consciousness, the sort of notion of the
690520	698200	individual was kind of born. And then at this time, Buddha appeared and Lao Tzu and so on,
698200	705760	and many of the Greek philosophers. And around that time, it was as if the whole world, although
705760	712360	it wasn't evenly spread, developed a new kind of consciousness. And I think a lot of people in my
712360	717160	world feel something else like that as happening. And it's a very audacious, somewhat absurd thing
717160	724040	to think. But it roughly is what I think. It feels more true than that we can muddle through with
724040	729560	the existing framework. So when people ask me what I'm doing sometimes, because I did a lot of work
729560	734480	on climate change, I have a lot of contacts in that world. And they're working on, you know,
734480	741040	getting the government to sign up to net zero by 2030 or whatever the latest thing is. And I'm like,
741040	745960	well, you can do that if you like. But I think something altogether deeper is happening. And
745960	753800	you're not likely to succeed that way. I place more hope in a fundamental transformation of
753800	758560	consciousness than I do in dealing with things with the institutional and cultural structure we
758560	763960	have now. It's worth saying a bit more about Time Between Worlds, because it's, like I say,
763960	770680	the expression was first mooted in a book titled by Zachary Stein called Education in a Time
770680	775680	Between Worlds. And the term is very charming. And so people use it as a shorthand for this
775680	781960	period of time. But it's important to understand that it has precursors. So in sociology, particularly
781960	787120	in Gramsci, there's this notion of the interregnum, where one thing has ended, but the next thing
787120	798240	hasn't yet been born. In anthropology, there's the notion of the liminal, which is really
798240	802880	fascinating for our community. Because what it is to be in the liminal is for an ethnographer,
802880	809440	who is from one culture, let's say a regular Western culture, goes into a tribal context or
810040	816240	an indigenous context. And he's trying to do deep ethnographic work. So he's trying to sort of
816240	822760	live like them with them, observe them, participate or observation. But there's a period of time
822760	827040	when they're neither, they're so ensconced in that world that they almost forget what it was like
827040	832160	to be in the prior world. But they're not yet one of them. And that's what they mean by liminal
832160	836720	anthropology. And in some ways, that's how a lot of our community is. It's like we don't
836800	842680	entirely belong to the world as it is now, although we're still part of it. And yet there
842680	846760	isn't really another thing that we're fully belonging in. So we're in this in between phase.
846760	851840	The other thing to say about time between worlds is it's not just a poetic soundbite. There's
851840	857880	quite a lot of empirical work underpinning it. So Immanuel Wallerstein's world system dynamics
857880	863400	is one of these sources. And that's to do with understanding the world system as trade flows.
863680	868720	And it's actually a very political analysis. It's to do with the exploitation of the poor world
868720	874680	by the rich world. And following the pattern of that over time, and seeing that it lacks durability,
874680	879120	that it will inevitably collapse. And then you have work by people like Peter Turchin to do a
879120	884000	secular psycho theory. It's some similar theory of history. He sometimes calls it cleodynamics,
884000	888480	which is the sort of quantitative history of looking at past patterns and seeing how they repeat
888520	896200	today, and measuring things like income inequality, and autocratic governance, and so on. And
896200	900480	beginning to sort of do a quantitative measure when this number of things happen, things fall
900480	904680	apart. So the time between worlds is not just a feeling. There's also a kind of empirical
904680	912360	underpinning to it. And at its heart, there's an analysis of modernity. And what the hell is
912360	919760	that, right? I'm not sure I can adequately describe modernity, but Habermas speaks of it as an
919760	925480	orientation towards the future. And a big part of what's happening in our world is, people are not
925480	931280	so sure about the future. It's not clear where the ship is sailing, where we're going, right? So
931280	935760	to be in a time between worlds in that sense, and the reason some people call it meta-modern,
936040	943640	is that if the orientation to the future and the progress narrative is a big part of what
943640	949080	modernity is about, first of all, we can't see the future very clearly. And if anything,
949080	954120	we're a bit wary of it. And secondly, it's not at all clear its progress. It might well be regress.
954120	959880	And that's why it's between worlds. And then you also have, though, rather than just the world is
959880	964880	me, everything's falling apart. There are these wellsprings of renewal. You know, there are these
964880	970800	people doing different things, like I'm thinking here of maybe Joe Brewer, who's currently trying to
970800	976680	get a river back to life in Bari-Chara, Colombia. And that's exciting because he's kind of given up
976680	983240	on the nation state. He's like, we need to start building the biorhegional hubs. And then there
983240	987040	are many biorhegions around the world. If more people start to work around biorhegions, you might
987040	992120	find a new form of governance emerging. Then you have this notion of like cosmolocalism, which
992160	997400	is something to do with being wise about your production patterns, so that if something is very
997400	1003800	heavy to transport, you don't transport it. You use it locally. But also, it's more philosophically,
1003800	1009280	it's kind of like you focus locally on your niche and your immediate needs in your community. But
1009280	1014440	you're connected to this much bigger cosmological framework because of the internet. And you have
1014440	1019960	other ideas, you know, there's ontological mutiny. It's a term of biocomalaphism, that we somehow
1020000	1025160	have to just break out of this kind of collective illusion that we're part of. My colleague,
1025160	1030520	Evo Mensch also speaks about this. He jokes that we're collectively living a life that no longer
1030520	1036640	exists. And a lot of us feel that way. When Bonita has work on complex potential states, something to
1036640	1044680	do with inshooting potentials, quite a Taoist go with the energy kind of notion. So it's not as
1044680	1049840	though there's no ideas. It's not as though no one has any idea what happens next. But if you look
1049880	1056240	at scale, in terms of where the power is, who has power now, particularly technological power, it
1056240	1063520	is daunting. And it takes quite a lot of courage and resilience, not to just give in to despair.
1066520	1072080	I came across it through my friend Zachary Stein, and I think he worked on it with Mark
1072080	1077800	Gaffney. And it's to do with what they call the stations of the self. And it's not really a
1077840	1084080	developmental theory, but it's more a way of describing a sort of existential interiority of
1084080	1090480	the human being as it goes through life. And the stages are roughly pre-tragic, tragic, and
1090480	1095920	post-tragic. Pre-tragic is something like we can fix every problem. Everything's going to be okay.
1096000	1101520	Don't don't fixate on your worries. Everything will work out in the end. We can do it kind of
1101520	1108200	in our mentality. So arguably a lot of techno optimism is pre-tragic. It's sort of like not
1108200	1113960	really contending with just how compromise everything already is. The tragic though is to be
1113960	1124360	lost and broken by despair. The tragic is to be unable to function because you're so thoroughly
1124360	1129560	depressed when everything seems to be going wrong. But the problem is tragic as you get stuck in
1129560	1135000	them, completely stuck in them. And the claim here is that it's not that it's better to be
1135000	1143880	post-tragic as such, but just there is also a state of sort of sensibility available to us that
1143880	1150440	doesn't have the pre-tragic. Nothing's wrong. Everything will be fine. But nor is it lost forever
1150440	1159440	in the kind of the implosion of the tragic. It reclaims the agency of the pre-tragic informed by
1159440	1166840	the understanding of the tragic to live in a way that recognizes that suffering and pain is an
1166840	1175080	endemic feature of life. Humans screw things up all the time. We can't help it almost. I believe
1175080	1179920	one of the better definitions of sin for what it's worth is from Francis Spufford. He calls it
1179920	1187160	the human propensity to fuck things up. And it's a real feature of human life. So the post-tragic
1187160	1194040	recognizes that as something that we can't escape. There will be no Eden as such. There will still
1194040	1199760	be wars. There will still be sociopaths. There will still be narcissists. There'll still be corruption.
1199760	1205560	And yet you don't collapse and despair because of that, because it's not really your work to do to
1205560	1210760	solve that. That's baked into reality as the oppositional principles that gives rise to creative
1210760	1217080	possibilities and so on. What the post-tragic's about is rediscovering the beauty on the other side
1217120	1223320	of the suffering, to see that somehow the soul is formed through those contests, those battles.
1223320	1239840	At scale things are so bad we have to rethink. That's where it comes into structures of consciousness
1240600	1249520	because reason is powerful and good. Science, when it's working well, is important. And we shouldn't
1249520	1254400	wish these things away. But what is true, and I think Paul Marshall does a particularly good job
1254400	1261000	at this in his book, Complex Integral Realism, he speaks about the biases of the modern mind.
1261000	1268160	And what he's doing there is fleshing out Jean Gebster's notion of the evolution of consciousness
1268160	1273720	and the mind in its mental rational function breaking down and he's spelling it out. And he
1273720	1282080	speaks about the various kinds of biases, but the essence of it, the way he sums it up, is that the
1282080	1288520	modern mind got very good at standing back. Again, the term poly crisis, it's all standing back
1288520	1296880	and looking at it. But it lost its way in terms of looking within, which is more about the depth
1296920	1303960	of the psyche, the deep interior. And it lost its way in terms of let's say cosmo vision and
1303960	1311080	metaphysics. It stopped asking, what are our assumptions about the fabric of reality? And those
1311080	1317400	two moves, the looking within and looking beyond, are the other two meanings of meta, which is why
1317400	1323680	I think metacrisis is the term to use, because that's the work we have to do. It's like, what is
1323720	1329160	inside the imaginal realm? What is the psyche? How do we know it better? How do we live through it
1329160	1334840	so that we have less need of consumer durables to live well, that we don't need to meet our
1334840	1342720	emotional needs by buying something new necessarily. And at the same time, the sort of broadly liberal
1342720	1348680	imaginary that says, have your religion if you want, but keep it out of the public realm as far
1348680	1356360	as you can, doesn't seem to be working very well. It would appear that we need a view of the world
1356360	1368920	that is altogether more enchanted, more profoundly, I think, personal. It's not like anything goes.
1368920	1375440	It's not like you surrender your intellect or surrender your critical faculties. It's just
1375520	1381560	that you realize that the story you've been told about material reality, cause and consequence,
1381560	1388240	space and time, it's less than the full story. And because it's less than the full story, with
1388240	1395200	all due discernment, with all due care, with all due critical caution, be open to the possibility
1395200	1400160	that the world is radically different from the one you imagined. So when I have something like a
1400160	1407200	serendipity or a feeling that the universe is somehow talking to me, I can explain it away,
1407760	1415200	but I prefer not to. And I don't have to. The universe may well be enchanted and there may well
1415200	1422560	be a form of relationship between the cosmos and us that we need to reconnect with and at scale and
1422560	1430320	quickly so that the major collective action problems we face feel different and they feel
1430320	1436240	different not just to the niche people who are complaining, but to the powers that be as well.
1438720	1444560	You can't really know. So in the absence of not being able to know with certainty,
1445600	1449040	do you opt for a kind of conventional view of how things are
1449360	1459040	that is still culturally hegemonic? Or do you venture out into other ways of knowing that seem
1459920	1465040	less socially validated, but perhaps more emotionally rewarding and credible?
1466800	1474640	And personally, I do the latter. But I do think it's delicate because you could have psychosis,
1475600	1479840	the mental structure could just collapse and I have schizophrenia in my family.
1480480	1487360	I don't want to wish away the mental structures lightly. I'm very happy for sanity and reason.
1488400	1493600	It's just that I also feel that the world is much more than we've been led to believe.
1494160	1499040	I believe consciousness is an ontological primary, a fundamental feature of reality.
1499760	1505200	I think value and meaning are inherent to the fabric of reality and not just socially constructed.
1505840	1509200	I'm at ease with using the word God, though I don't quite know what I mean by
1510160	1515520	that. But I do feel there's a kind of relationship between the whole and the parts that's constantly
1515520	1523200	happening. And sometimes you can feel yourself in the whole in a way that's quite personal and
1523200	1530160	livening. I would just hope that when we try and think about the future, people in the social
1530160	1535840	change world, they often don't go there. They stick within the narrow confines of what's politically
1535840	1541280	possible and culturally acceptable. But I think a lot of people in our network feel instinctively
1541280	1547520	that's not enough, that you have to actually widen the scope of the inquiry. Because only then do you
1547520	1554160	get the quality of idea and the kind of institutional and cultural innovation that might be more worthy
1554160	1563600	of the scale of the challenges we face. There's that old line by Charles Kettering that a problem
1563600	1570640	well stated is half solved, which I always thought was only about half true. I don't think it's the
1570640	1575600	whole truth. You need to do more than specify the problem. And we're a bit beyond problems,
1575600	1580560	we're in a kind of predicament now. But still, all very well, but what do we do, right?
1582640	1589360	So one thing I've suggested is that trying to get beyond a crisis mentality seems to me to be
1589360	1594560	quite important. This has come to me quite recently. But I've noticed that the people that I admire
1594560	1600320	are not fixated with crisis. People I'm drawn to these days are not those who are pointing out
1600320	1607200	just how dangerous it all is. They're people who are already underway doing something different.
1607200	1612080	People who are actually innovating in a way that prefigures the next world are the ones that I admire
1612080	1618800	the most. And very few of them are motivated by the language of crisis. And I find this very intriguing
1618800	1627120	because at a purely conceptual level, some would argue that the entire thrust of modernity, the
1627120	1634720	entire sort of engine that drives the progress narrative and the future orientation is the
1634720	1642400	perpetual construction and solving of crises. And this is through war. This is through sort of
1642400	1649040	capital investment. It happens in the institution building. It's like, this is a big crisis,
1649040	1653040	let's solve it by doing this. And that's how the whole thing keeps moving over many, many centuries.
1653680	1660240	But where we are now is we can't keep on talking of crisis and solving them. That's actually,
1660800	1664160	rather than being the solution, that's, you begin to see that's part of the problem,
1664160	1670960	that entire way of framing things. Instead, you've got to look for potential. You've got to look,
1670960	1681040	where is the scope to do things fundamentally differently in a transformative way? And I
1681040	1686960	mean that in quite a specific way, not just as a kind of rhetorical flourish, but transformative
1686960	1691840	in the sense that the underlying form of it, the underlying reality of it, you go beyond in some
1691840	1705920	way. Going from the nation state to the bioregion is an example of that. Getting out of a university
1705920	1711280	department, speaking about sustainability and actually having your own farm where you actually
1712640	1718000	model how to grow crops is an example of that. Creating a pop-up school rather than
1718640	1723440	getting a job in a university department is part of that. It's creating new language, so
1724400	1732160	let's say Nora Bateson's a fanny poesis, for example, which is a kind of tending to what is
1732160	1738480	latent, seeing what's unseen, and moving with that in some way is another example.
1741040	1747040	These are the things to get behind, and at a more spiritual level is to do with calling, right?
1752160	1757040	I don't know how else to put this, other than to say that there's a place where Carl Jung's idea
1757040	1764240	of individuation meets Eleanor Ostrom's idea of the functional commons, the solving of collective
1764240	1769680	action problems, or collective action solutions. There's a place where individuation meets collective
1769680	1774640	action solutions, and you can think of it as a kind of collective individuation, and what I mean
1774640	1779360	by that is the distinction between the I and the we begins to break down, and not in a coercive,
1779360	1784560	there's no individual anymore, but rather the very notion of what an individual is, is that
1784560	1788560	they're part of a collective and responding to its needs, and the very notion of what a collective
1788560	1794160	is is something that gets rise to individuated beings. That's what we want to get to, but to get
1794160	1800000	there, I do believe you have to tune in to something more cosmic, which is something like your own
1800000	1805200	sense of what you're meant to be doing. Now not everyone is, let's say, spiritually musical,
1805200	1811840	not everyone hears that frequency, but for a lot of people I think they do sense it, and they may
1811840	1815440	even be in denial about it, but they feel there's something they're meant to be doing,
1817600	1822880	and I guess I feel the more that we tune into that, and of course listen for feedback from the
1822880	1828720	world, otherwise you get caught in narcissistic spirals of self-indulgence, but look at what the
1828720	1835200	world appears to need, think of what you have to offer it, and that's where we're speaking of
1835200	1840320	something like collective individuation, and it's also about potential, it's not just about solving
1840320	1846080	a problem to prop up the status quo, it's like what is actually transforming the world, changing
1846080	1852960	the underlying form, going beyond it, creatively, subversively, transgressively even, that's the
1852960	1861200	kind of work that excites me. Hope lies not so much in the massive armies and the big plans,
1861840	1867120	but in the people tending to everyday life. Now this is quite an uncomfortable, I find it
1867200	1873120	quite a difficult thought to bear, because there's a part of me that is more conventionally masculine
1874160	1881520	in the sense of like trying to disclose the problem and fix it, but I'm growing out of that,
1881520	1887600	I sort of feel that's actually not the right way to approach things, great to map things if you can
1887600	1893840	and see as clearly as you can, but the hope lies from something more like tending, digging where
1893840	1900800	you stand, tending to what's yours to deal with. Now that doesn't mean shutting off the rest of the
1900800	1907120	world, but it does mean asking deeply, given that context, what is my work in this context,
1908000	1915040	and that gets back to the cosmolocal idea, so it's something like this, it's not a big grand
1915040	1920800	action plan, it's trusting in the innovation of smaller groups, for those who are more theoretically
1920800	1928320	inclined in the world of hyper-objects, and by hyper-objects we mean these almost unintelligible
1928320	1932720	ideas like the climate crisis and the pandemic and the metacrisis, these things we can't quite get
1932720	1937920	our head around, but we still live every day. In the world of hyper-objects you need hyposubjects,
1938720	1944560	by hyposubjects it's not hyper-agents, it's not, you don't need more Elon Musk's, you need more
1944560	1951040	people who are turning away from the miasma, the drama of the global election problem, global
1951040	1959200	situation, towards the spiritual calling of the work they're meant to do in the context they have,
1959200	1965840	but not in a politically naive way, in a way that is deeply informed by the need to generate a new reality.
1974560	1975440	you
