0	17160	So music metacrisis and metanoia. So what I want to talk about today, it really kind
17160	26920	of comes down to these two ideas. Acrasia and metanoia, two ancient Greek words. And
26920	33280	you see the statue that's related to Acrasia is someone kind of bound in chains and unable
33280	40080	to break free. And then this sculpture, which I discovered online when I was looking for
40080	50280	a counterpart to the sculpture of the man bound in chains, has this kind of quality
50280	56360	of an inner light bursting forth, which I think speaks to metanoia. So I want to look
56400	63920	a little bit more deeply at these terms. So Acrasia is from the Greek meaning without
63920	70280	and kratos meaning power or strength. So it's a lack of power, it's a lack of strength.
70280	79240	And the term Acrasia really means a kind of lack of command of oneself. So this, we see
79240	85280	this when individually when we know what is the right thing to do. Intellectually, we
85280	90920	might think, okay, you know, what's a really important value to me is to be healthy. And
90920	99720	so I don't want to eat too much chocolate. But then we have a weakness of will. And we
99720	103960	go for the cookie or we eat the chocolate anyway, you know, so that's a kind of banal
103960	109240	form of Acrasia, maybe a more painful form of Acrasia might be when we know that we don't
109240	114240	want to lose a temper with people that we love. But in the midst of strong emotions,
114280	121120	we say things that hurt people, you know. And so it's having some understanding, some
121120	125720	intellectual knowledge of what is the right way, what is the wise way, what is the good
125720	131720	way to go. But then for whatever reason, we're not able to adhere to that, we're not able
131720	138440	to be in alignment with that. And so I mean, my sense is that this is a very, when you
138440	142200	understand, you hear this term, there's a kind of familiarity, we think, oh, yeah, I
142240	149200	can see that in my own life, I can see that myself. I feel, I believe at the moment, we're
149200	157760	experiencing a kind of civilization on Acrasia, where our kind of young, nascent global
157920	165720	civilization is collectively going in a direction, acting in ways that I think many of
165800	173040	us sense is not wise. Many of us sense is taking us in an unwise, a wrong direction. And yet we
173040	178920	seem unable to change that, to change course, to do something different. And there's almost
178920	187320	a kind of an inevitability of this unfolding of the Metacrisis. So this is our kind of
187320	194800	predicament that we're in. And the counterpart to that are the journey that we could maybe
195000	200480	make to something different, I think is encapsulated in the term Metanoia. And so Metanoia
200480	209760	comes from the Greek meaning Meta, the Greek term Meta, which means change after or beyond. And the
210040	215960	word new, which means meaning, which means mind or consciousness. So it refers to a kind of
215960	223120	profound change of heart. But it's not just a change of mind, like a kind of shallow kind of
223120	228720	change in the way of thinking or change of opinion. In fact, in the synoptic Gospels, it's the
228720	235440	first word that Jesus says. So the term Metanoia has a really deep history that speaks to a
235440	243000	profound inner revolution and inner transformation. And it relates to one seeing the error of our
243000	250600	ways, but also this kind of profound commitment to go in a completely different direction. And so
251040	261440	if we are stuck in a kind of civilisation like crazy, then one possible solution, if I can use
261440	266320	that word, although it's not the most appropriate word, the response needs to be some kind of
266320	274520	collective Metanoia, some kind of profound transformation. And I want to share with you a
274520	281400	depiction of Metanoia before I say a little bit more about Metanoia. And it actually comes, it's a
281400	287760	somewhat humorous depiction, but it comes from the film Blues Brothers. If you haven't seen the
287760	294080	film, Jake and Elwood Blues, I think Jake just gets out of prison, and then they go back to their
294080	299000	orphanage and the orphanage is about to close and they're running out of money. So they need to kind
299040	303720	of find, find them, they're given this task, you know, like the hero's journey, they have this task
303720	309880	to complete. And they're told to go to church. And Jake's not happy, but he doesn't want to go to
309880	318200	church. I think Jake is John Baluchian, Elwood is Dan Lackroyd. And then you see this kind of
318440	324440	Metanoia transformation that happens as they're in the church listening to music. So I want to play
324480	329400	this for you just now. One, because the music is so wonderful, but it also, it only came to me
329400	334960	after I wrote the essay that we published in Substack, that this is an example of Metanoia
334960	337240	through music. So I'm going to play this for you just now.
354440	384440	We all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all

432480	434480	The bear!
434480	436480	Do you see the bear?
436480	438480	The bear!
438480	440480	Do you see the bear?
440480	442480	What light?
442480	444480	Have you seen the light?
444480	446480	Yes! Yes!
446480	449480	Jesus hates God-dancing Christ!
449480	452480	I have seen the light!
471480	475480	The band! I want the band!
475480	477480	The band?
477480	479480	The band?
479480	481480	The band?
481480	483480	The band?
483480	485480	The band?
485480	487480	The band!
487480	492480	And God bless the United States of America!
492480	494480	The band!
500480	506480	When I hear the term metanoia, it sounds like, oh, wouldn't that be lovely?
506480	509480	Wouldn't a metanoia be a wonderful thing to have, you know?
509480	511480	Some kind of spiritual awakening.
511480	516480	And it seems to my mind, within kind of spiritual circles,
516480	520480	if you like, a metanoia could be treated a little bit like
520480	524480	how falling in love is treated in rom-coms.
524480	526480	Bear with me here.
526480	528480	What do you mean by this?
528480	531480	And I think there is actually a deep connection between metanoia and falling in love.
531480	536480	But in a romantic comedy, a couple fall in love,
536480	539480	and then that's the end of the movie, when they get together.
539480	542480	And it's like, happily ever after.
542480	547480	But of course, you know, if you've been in a relationship that's lasted any amount of time,
547480	551480	you know, the falling in love is not the end of the story, it's the beginning.
551480	554480	And then there's the relationship, and maybe the many decades,
554480	558480	and the work, and all that happens with that, you know?
558480	563480	And so you could look at a metanoia, or if we talk about what the world needs,
563480	566480	and we talk about it like it's a shift of consciousness,
566480	570480	like if we had that, then everything would just be solved, everything would be fine.
570480	575480	But I actually think a metanoia is simply the beginning,
575480	581480	and then the painstaking work begins of actually bringing oneself
581480	585480	and one's life into alignment with that revelation, with that understanding.
585480	590480	And of course, in the Blues Brothers, I never thought I would turn to the Blues Brothers as a source of wisdom,
590480	595480	but there you go, in the Blues Brothers, the metanoia experience happens at the beginning of the movie.
595480	600480	It's the start, it's not the end, it's the start, it's then they go on their kind of journey.
600480	606480	So, I just want to situate that in that way,
606480	617480	that metanoia is not the kind of, once we achieve that, that's the work's done, that's just the first step.
617480	626480	And so, to my mind, metanoia, and this is just the way that I understand it,
626480	632480	as I say, it's a very deep term, and there could be many different ways of understanding and moving into this,
632480	639480	but what occurred to me was that metanoia is a three-part transformation,
639480	646480	and it's a transformation in loving, it's a transformation in knowing, and it's a transformation in action.
646480	656480	And so, I'll start maybe by talking about loving, by saying metanoia is a transformation in what we love,
656480	662480	and what I want to point to is it's a transformation in their structure of value, a hierarchy of value.
662480	669480	This is something, there was a wonderful conversation between the philosopher and educator Zach Stein and Ian McGillchrist,
669480	677480	that took place, you can find it on our YouTube channel, Tifa's YouTube channel, maybe eight or nine months ago,
677480	683480	and they talked about the importance of value-ception, and with value-ception, what they're talking about is this,
683480	690480	this capacity that we have as human beings to perceive value directly,
690480	698480	and that value is not something that we just kind of, our consciousness paints on to the cosmos,
698480	705480	but it's something inherent in the cosmos, and that we actually perceive it, we can come into a relationship with it.
705480	712480	And one of the points, and I can't remember whether it was Zach or Ian, but I think there was very much an agreement with this,
712480	720480	was that there is a problem with our society's collective capacity for value-ception.
720480	726480	Like as a society, we, our value-ception is not working very well.
726480	732480	We are valuing the wrong things and not valuing the higher goods that we should be valuing.
732480	739480	And so, in an individual metanoic transformation, what happens is, before the metanoia,
739480	749480	the individual might be concerned with narrow egoic concerns, status, reputation, comfort, pleasure.
749480	758480	And then, with the metanoia, their concerns, what they value, what they deeply care about, starts to transcend beyond themselves.
758480	764480	An example of this, of course, is a Christmas carol, Charles Dickens' Christmas carol,
764480	772480	where Scrooge, all he cares about is money, but through those kind of, the dreams and the encounters with the ghost of Christmas past, present and future,
772480	777480	he becomes transformed and he cares about things beyond himself.
777480	781480	So there's this transformation, and this is why I call it transformation and loving,
781480	787480	because it's about what we deeply value, what we deeply care for, and about what we love.
787480	790480	And therefore, what we want to serve.
790480	803480	And then also, I see it as a transformation in knowing, because along with this comes a kind of reordering of our understanding of reality and our place within it.
803480	812480	So, for a Buddhist, it might be an awakening into the profound interconnectedness of all of life.
812480	821480	And then the kind of myopic, narrow concerns of the self might seem silly, you know, and there's kind of an overflowing of compassion and love outwards.
821480	832480	And in the Christian tradition, it might be seeing oneself as a kind of a child of God or Christ.
832480	837480	And then, once placed within the cosmos, it's shifted somehow.
837480	844480	So there's a kind of transformation or understanding of reality and what matters in reality and our place within it.
844480	852480	And again, I think this is, this connection to falling in love, I think is quite deep.
852480	865480	Because if you think about when you fall in love with someone, the loving them, the coming to value them, comes along with the learning more about them, the insight into them.
865480	874480	So the learning about them, the discovery of the person and the loving them are kind of like one in the same thing, they kind of happen together.
874480	880480	And so, I think there's this profound transformation in loving, there's this profound transformation in understanding, knowing insight.
880480	885480	And then these two things bring a kind of call to a new kind of action.
885480	893480	And I think this transformed action has, we can think of as having an interior aspect and an exterior aspect.
893480	905480	And the interior aspect, I believe, is the kind of orientation to the spiritual practice, to transform oneself.
905480	910480	As I say, you have a kind of metanoia experience.
910480	918480	And then, I'll give you an example, you go on a retreat.
918480	927480	You have this wonderful experience, you feel maybe deep sense of peace, you feel you're in touch with the wondrous life, the miraculousness of life.
927480	930480	And there's this sense, now everything is going to be different.
930480	934480	Now I'm going to be a completely different person, I'm going to change how I live all the rest of it.
934480	939480	And then three weeks later, you're back at home in the same job with the same partner.
939480	945480	And you find yourself being the same old grumpy son, so you've always been, you know, this miraculous experience.
945480	948480	And then back to the way you were.
948480	955480	And, you know, the first time you're going to retreat and then come off it, that can be a bit disillusioning.
955480	959480	It can be a bit disappointing, you know, it can be kind of crushing actually.
959480	962480	But after you go on more retreats, you see, oh, this is what happens.
962480	977480	And so then the practice becomes nurturing that nurturing the soul really nurturing one's spiritual transformation so that oneself can go in the direction of what the metanoia is calling.
977480	981480	And then also in the external world, living that.
981480	991480	So this is the, and while I'm talking principally about the individual, I think this can apply to us collectively.
992480	1008480	And a kind of collective metanoia would be a kind of profound transformation in what society what we collectively value profound transformation or understanding of reality, which I think is taking place in many, many respects.
1008480	1013480	And I think this field is really important to that.
1013480	1023480	And then, and then a profound transformation in actually what we do how we live that is informed by that deep care and that deep understanding of reality.
1023480	1034480	Okay, and the contention I want to make in this kind of workshop is that music has a particular power to enable a collective metanoia.
1034480	1038480	And I just want to just refer back to the term a crazier from earlier.
1038480	1042480	If you remember that term, it means a lacking command over oneself.
1042480	1056480	It means an absence without power, particularly I think the absence of the kind of spiritual power to the existential power to do what one feels is right to do what one feels called to do.
1056480	1064480	And I think music actually has within it a spiritual power to enable a collective metanoia.
1064480	1072480	And I think this is just a very brief aside one thing that as many of you will know Ian McGill's Chris work and the difference between the left and right hemispheres.
1072480	1079480	And he talks about how the left hemispheres principle concern is power and acquiring power.
1080480	1086480	But I would, I would argue that the right hemisphere has a power as well, but it's a different kind of power.
1086480	1090480	It's not a power to control a power over another.
1090480	1101480	It's more a power to enchant more a power to in soul and more a power to move the heart if you like.
1101480	1103480	And this is what music can tap into.
1103480	1109480	Okay, so we better have some evidence for this.
1109480	1112480	And music has this power.
1112480	1114480	So I want to explore this now.
1114480	1123480	And just before I get into this, I should say, I'm not saying that music by itself can address or resolve the metacrisis or solve all the world's problems.
1123480	1127480	That would be completely idiotic, you know, totally foolish.
1128480	1145480	And because the metacrisis is so multi multidimensional, our response will need to be multimodal will need lots of different and a variety of responses, maybe countless responses in many, many different ways.
1145480	1156480	But I do believe music in the arts more generally will be necessary because the kind of they can speak at the level of consciousness in a profound way.
1156480	1158480	And I want to talk a little bit about that just now.
1158480	1164480	So music has deep roots in our nature, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically.
1164480	1166480	So let me explain what those words mean.
1166480	1174480	So phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary history and relations among or within groups of organisms.
1174480	1185480	So when I say music has deep is deep in our nature phylogenetically, I mean, it's deep in our evolutionary history.
1185480	1191480	For many researchers, they believe it predates the emergence of language.
1191480	1198480	And in a moment, I'm going to show you a clip of a dog actually dancing to music.
1198480	1208480	And you can see that the dog really is grooving to music, which suggests this deep common ancestry that goes way back predating ourselves as humans.
1208480	1219480	And then also what's interesting is ontogenesis is the development of an individual organism or anatomical or behavioral feature from the early stage to maturity.
1219480	1232480	So this talks about the kind of development of like the human being from the embryo and all the way up to, you know, the baby to the infant and so on and so on and so forth.
1232480	1241480	And what's interesting is that there is a appears to be a parallel between ontogenesis and phylogenesis.
1241480	1249480	So what is ancient in our evolutionary history, you can often find it in the early stages of the organisms development.
1249480	1256480	And so this is an example, this is really, I'm just going to move this little zoom box here.
1256480	1261480	So you can see this is a fish, salamander, tortoise, chicken, pig, cow, rabbit, human.
1261480	1267480	And you can see the embryos of all of these creatures are very, very similar.
1267480	1276480	And of course, interestingly, the human embryo, when it's really, really young has a tail, because that's part of our evolutionary history.
1276480	1286480	We evolved from mammals that had tails, even even prior to mammals, fish, reptiles.
1286480	1296480	And then you can see as the embryo develops, it starts to take its own path and goes its own trajectory.
1297480	1305480	Okay, so music, I want to argue is is deep, deep ancient part of ourselves.
1305480	1309480	And I want to share with you some videos that reveal this now.
1309480	1312480	Now I'm going to play this clip and you'll watch.
1312480	1318480	You'll actually see if you watch closely, you'll see the dog moves actually in time to the music.
1318480	1326480	And then of course, you can also see the expression of the dog, which shows his or her pleasure as well.
1348480	1365480	Okay, pretty clear that dog likes his kind of funky blues.
1365480	1370480	Okay, next video, I want to show you of a mother with her baby.
1370480	1374480	I can find the video.
1374480	1381480	And what's interesting here, you'll see the mother sing a few songs, the baby and the baby's quite happy and then she'll she'll sing opera.
1381480	1385480	And I just want you to notice the strength of the baby's emotional response.
1385480	1392480	Like the baby responds to this music more strongly than many adults would.
1393480	1411480	Okay, so my son who is super happy all the time and loves when I sing every song like everybody clap, clap, clap, clap.
1411480	1415480	Everybody sing la la la la la.
1415480	1418480	Okay, so he loves that song.
1418480	1421480	He loves heavy metal.
1432480	1437480	Okay, that should like terrify a baby, but not George.
1437480	1443480	But when it comes to opera, he gets super emotional and upset.
1443480	1445480	George?
1473480	1500480	Okay, so I think it's very interesting just how profound the baby's response is.
1500480	1520480	Like the pathos in that opera music, the baby picks it up and his response, I think is just revealing how quick we are to kind of resonate with music.
1520480	1533480	And what's interesting is this, the deep kind of, the fact that music is deep, deep in our nature means that it's really cross cultural.
1533480	1537480	And so I want to show you another couple of clips.
1537480	1542480	One is of Bobby McFerrin.
1542480	1549480	And I'll just let this clip kind of speak for itself if I can find it.
1549480	1556480	Give me one second. Okay, here it is.
1556480	1559480	Expectations? Expectations.

1691780	1706820	Now, what's interesting to me about that is, regardless of where I am, anywhere, every
1706820	1712020	audience gets that, but it doesn't matter, you know, it's just, you know, the pentatonic
1712020	1713620	scale for some reason.
1713620	1729460	Okay, now, in that little video clip, Bobby McFerrin used the audience for singing what's
1729460	1735100	called the pentatonic scale in music, and I might be able to play this. Let me see, can
1735100	1741380	you guys hear this if I play this? Can you hear that note there? Yeah? So the pentatonic
1741380	1751700	is just, that's it, those five notes. And that's the scale that he was using. And I
1751700	1756940	want to show you one more video now. And I might flick through this video a little bit
1756940	1763620	because I don't want to spend too long on it, but it just shows you the various, from various
1763620	1770780	cultures all over the world, using the pentatonic scale. And in the Western musical scale, there
1770780	1775620	are 12 different notes that, of course, can be arranged in all kinds of different forms
1775620	1781380	and there's all types of different scales. But the pentatonic, for some reason, these
1781380	1791620	five notes are used by cultures all over the world, much more than any other scale. So
1791620	1794780	let me just find this and bring this up. Okay, I've got it now.
1881620	1911340	Okay, and it goes on. You get the idea.
1912300	1922220	For some reason, these five notes touch the human being, activate our emotions, speak to
1922220	1926220	love, speak to pain, speak to all of these different aspects of what it means to be human.
1926220	1933340	And all different cultures all over the world create music around these five notes. Now, of
1933340	1937500	course, there's a lot of music that's created out with these five notes, but there's something
1937500	1944700	quite universal about this. And so what I wanted to kind of point to is the fact that music has an
1945500	1954060	impact to touches in a kind of deep way and move consciousness away. And so to return now to
1954780	1964860	the little slideshow, I want to, I want to now explore the three pathways that I think music
1964860	1973900	can offer to, to enabling this collective metanoia. So one, and this relates to, of course,
1973900	1980540	the knowing is music as a metaphor, as offering insight into the nature of reality and ourselves.
1981580	1989340	And so the first thing I want to touch on is I want to share with you three different
1990300	1995260	metaphors that music can offer. The first one is a little bit playful, but it just, I just want to
1995260	2002220	show you how music reveals truths about who we are as human beings, mirrors our nature,
2002220	2007500	and then mirrors also the deep nature of reality. So the first has to do with something called the
2007500	2016300	12 bar blues. And the 12 bar blues is this structure that you see here. And if I can,
2016300	2023500	I can maybe play it for you. Can you hear that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So the 12 bar blues
2023500	2034620	is one of the most widely used famous song forms in Western music, Western music. And it was the,
2035260	2040220	the absolute foundation of rock and roll. Okay. And the devil's music. And that's important
2040220	2043900	because we're going to come back to that in a minute. So I'm going to play. So if I was to play
2043900	2047260	the 12 bar blues, it would be a bit like this. Okay. So it'd be like, um,
2048540	2051580	so I'll play in a kind of rock and roll kind of rhythm. So like,
2054140	2059660	so this would be the one chord. That's the third bar, fourth bar. And then I move to the fourth
2059660	2077580	chord. And then back to the one. And what's interesting about this, and I don't know,
2077580	2082380	I'm sure other people have said this. I think I stumbled across this revelation myself. I don't
2082380	2087660	know what it says about me. But if you look at the structure of the 12 bar blues, it's actually
2087660	2095580	pretty similar to the classical pattern of an orgasm. Now, why would it be the case that the
2095580	2100380	music of rock and roll, which is kind of the music of sex, you know, that's what rock and roll was
2100380	2108220	all about. Um, and which people, you know, derided as the devil's music, if you look at the structures
2108220	2113340	of them, it stays on the one for a while. And then it gets to this, the four chord, which is that
2113340	2121740	middle part where it kind of gets to the plateau, right? And then the excitement's building. And then
2121740	2134620	you get to the climax. And then the resolution. And then back to the one. So this is just a
2134620	2139980	slightly humorous example, but it just, it just shows you how music has this capacity to speak
2139980	2148620	to deep aspects of who we are, ourselves as embodied beings. Now, another aspect of another
2148620	2156300	kind of music, a kind of metaphor that, that can be the music can offer, I think, and maybe
2156300	2161260	teach us something a little bit more profound. So this is something that we use actually at the
2161260	2169820	beginning now of the anti debate that perspectiva has developed. And the anti debate is seeks to
2169820	2179100	be an antidote to debate, a way of having public conversations, a kind of democratic discourse
2179740	2186700	that is that moves beyond polarization and moves into a deeper appreciation of diversity of you.
2187900	2193420	Um, and there's, there's, there's many aspects to it. And I, I, I, I, um, there's a lot to the
2193420	2199580	anti debate. Um, and watch this space because we have a video on it coming out soon. But I just
2199580	2206140	want to share with you one metaphor that we use that draws on music that, that's helpful to, to
2206140	2209900	understanding what we're trying to do with it. And I think it's helpful to understanding the
2209900	2219020	nature of truth actually. So when we think of consonants in music, we usually think of
2219820	2225580	intervals that fit well together. So you can see there, if the, if I was to play the note middle C,
2226220	2233340	okay, or I play, if I play this note here actually, so this is C. And then if I play the note above,
2234940	2241660	that's an octave above. And you can see in those first two waveforms, the second waveform,
2243340	2252300	this one here is double the length. Um, or, or it's, um, the ratio of the two wave waveforms is
2252300	2258380	two to one. So the second there's, there's for, for the same length of time, there's two waveforms
2258380	2265900	for the length of time it takes for one in the first. And this is why these two notes fit together
2265900	2271020	because the wavelength of one is double the length of the other. And so they sync up very
2271020	2281900	frequently. Now, if I go to the next note, G, which is the fifth, that has a ratio with the note C
2281900	2287980	of three to two, two, three to two. So they're very, um, they're very consonant intervals.
2287980	2292300	These intervals fit well because the wavelengths fit together. So when we think of
2293100	2299020	consonants or harmony, we usually think that harmony is about consonants. It's about notes
2299020	2305260	that fit well together. And in some sense, this is true. But if you only play notes that fit well
2305260	2310860	together, then what you'll actually get is quite boring music. You don't get anything interesting.
2310860	2316140	Okay, it sounds a little bit deranged. There's too much order, you know, actually, when you
2316140	2324620	play music like that, it's almost, you know, it has kind of the kind of quality of a totalitarian
2324620	2331820	state comes to mind. Now, if you take an interval that has a lot of dissonance, so rather than
2331820	2339500	these two notes together, an octave, rather than playing C and C, I play C and B, the ratio of
2339500	2344140	those two notes is something like, I can't remember exactly, something like eight to 19 or
2344140	2350620	something. It's very dissonant. And you can hear to the ear those two notes clash. Okay.
2352780	2361020	But if I play two other notes along with them, so these two notes clash, but when I add in E and
2361020	2367180	G, so I play C, E, G, and B, then they form a chord called the major seventh.
2369740	2375020	And actually, that dissonance is unfolded within our larger relationships that actually
2375020	2378620	produces a more beautiful harmony. And all of music
2382460	2386460	is all about the interplay of dissonance. It's actually the interplay of dissonance
2386460	2390140	that creates beauty that creates richness that creates soulfulness in music.
2390140	2395420	It's not consonance. Consonance by itself, constant intervals don't do much at all.
2397100	2403980	It's actually the interplay of dissonance. And to my mind, this is also true of the nature of
2403980	2413740	ecosystems. If you think about the relationship between a lion and a gazelle, it doesn't look
2413740	2419020	very consonant, certainly not from the gazelle's point of view. Okay. There's a lot of tension,
2419020	2424220	a lot of antipathy, animosity, but when you take the step back to the ecosystem as a whole,
2425180	2431580	that is unfolded within a larger harmony. And so what can this teach us? Well, what happens if
2431580	2438940	we apply this to the notion of truth rather than the being one truth? What if we understand the
2438940	2444940	ontology of truth to be like an ecosystem? And actually, there are a diversity of truths that
2444940	2455740	come in together that kind of form a larger whole. So this is, to my mind about the direction we
2455740	2462380	need to go in, these kinds of metaphors might offer us insight about the nature of reality.
2463740	2471020	Okay, I want to go to one more now. So I'm just going to grab a guitar.
2475100	2487100	Okay. So unfortunately, I probably need a very, very close microphone for you guys to see this,
2487100	2490140	and you won't be able to hear it either, but you'll just have to take my word for it.
2491100	2499660	If I play this string here, it resonates and vibrates. Okay. Now the other five strings in
2499660	2511580	the guitar don't do anything. They don't move. But if I play this note here, if I put my finger in
2511580	2521660	this fret, that's the same tone, same pitch as this note. And what's interesting is when two strings
2521660	2527260	are at the same pitch and you play one of them, the other starts to resonate as well.
2527980	2532540	They start to sync up, and the other one actually starts to resonate and vibrate.
2533500	2536460	If it's not the same pitch, it'll just be completely static.
2539420	2544140	So how does this offer us an insight? What is the metaphor that we can draw here?
2544940	2551900	Well, I want to argue that this is actually a metaphor for music itself, because I believe that
2552860	2561100	music has the capacity to allow different consciousnesses. So the consciousness, for
2561100	2566140	instance, my consciousness, the consciousness of Anna, the consciousness of Haley, of Kylan, Rob,
2566140	2572780	we can actually come into a resonance together through music. And this is what music does.
2572780	2579020	And I want to share with you an example of this. A quite powerful recent example of this,
2579740	2585980	which is from the singer Oliver Antony. And he has a song, I'll see if I can bring this up now.
2585980	2592060	You might have heard this, you might recognize this. I think this video now has over 110 million
2592060	2602060	views online. And there's something about the pain of his song, about the authenticity of his
2602060	2609100	singing, the melody and the words that resonated with people all over the world.
2611740	2614380	So I'd like to play just a little bit for you.
2632540	2640780	It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to for people like me, people like you wish I could
2640780	2653660	just wake up and not be true, but it is. Oh, it is living in the new world with an old soul.
2654380	2661580	These rich men, old for rich men, Lord knows it all, just want to have total control.
2661580	2667580	Want to know what you think, want to know what you do, and they don't think you know.
2667580	2673260	But I know that you do, because your daughter hates shit, and it's tax to no hand.
2673260	2678060	Tax to no hand, old for rich men, old for rich men.
2687260	2692060	Okay, I feel really bad for having to cut these songs off.
2695420	2697740	So I hope you can be with me in that.
2698300	2706940	What was interesting about this was if you look at the comments on YouTube,
2708060	2712220	you see people from all over the world saying how they resonate with this.
2712220	2719500	People living in Iran, South Africa, Finland, Zimbabwe, the UK, Turkish, Netherlands,
2720060	2725820	Germany, Australia, it goes on and on. And there's one comment that I wanted to just highlight
2726380	2730060	that somebody said, I'm from the UK, and this song isn't just an American anthem,
2730060	2736540	it's a world anthem. And so there's something about music, and I think it's because it goes
2736540	2747980	into the depth of who we are as human beings, that it can kind of, to use a kind of musical
2747980	2757340	cliche, strike a chord. It can somehow, consciousness is all over the world, and
2758460	2765020	different people can resonate in the same understanding. It's much more profound,
2765020	2770060	I think, and much more powerful than just words, just saying, yeah, to just say,
2771180	2775660	working people, working class people are having a hard time at the moment. Doesn't do it like his
2775660	2784540	song does it, no? And so one of the ways that music can enlighten, can reveal
2785420	2789500	deep aspects of the nature of reality, aspects of nature ourselves, is through metaphor,
2789500	2794300	and I've talked a lot about metaphor, but the other way is actually through direct experience.
2795740	2797900	And I want to share with you a couple more songs.
2797900	2806620	One is from a band called the Swan Silver Tones, a group of singers, a group of gospel singers.
2807420	2812620	I was fortunate enough to stumble across this group of singers when I was about 15,
2812620	2819100	and I just happened into a CD store and bought some kind of compilation of great gospel singers
2819100	2824700	for about, I think it was probably about £1.50 at the time. And these are some of,
2824700	2828860	to my mind, some of the best singers I've ever heard. And you might notice that I have a particular
2828860	2834780	affection for the African American musical heritage. So I'm going to play with you for
2834780	2842300	you a song called Mary Don't You Weep. And for me, there's something amazing about this music
2842300	2848700	that comes from a time and from a people who suffered extremely, like suffered terribly.
2849420	2856780	And the music has within it that suffering, has within it the pathos, the struggle of life,
2857660	2865020	and yet it has joy, and yet it has ecstasy, and yet it actually tilts into moments of transcendence
2865020	2871500	and hopefulness. And to me, that says something profound about the word it means to be human
2871500	2878060	and what's possible for human beings. I'll play this just now, and it's just about just short
2878060	2885020	of three minutes, I think this song. We're hopefully not being too indulgent, but I think it's just
2885020	2896780	so good it's worth listening to the whole thing. And just to notice, just noticing the warmth,
2896780	2902140	the softness in it, but then the kind of movement to the climax of ecstasy and joy at the end.
2908060	2920940	And Mary, Martha don't have tomorrow. Listen to me, Mary, Martha don't have tomorrow.
2923500	2932140	Pharaoh's army, they got drowned in the sea one day, but Jesus said Mary,
2932860	2940220	your little sister don't have tomorrow. Now can I get a witness, he said Mary,
2942460	2948540	Martha don't have tomorrow. It may be somebody sick today,
2949500	2955740	if somebody here ain't got no home. But listen, Pharaoh's army,
2956220	2963100	they got drowned in the sea one day, but I believe in man said Mary,
2964860	2971420	your little sister don't have tomorrow. Now listen, if I could write your name,
2972540	2978780	I won't tell you that I surely would not. Put your foot on the rock,
2978780	2982940	put your hand on the rock, stand on the rock where Moses stood one day,
2984060	2991180	because of the Pharaoh's army. That's what the Bible said, you got drowned in the sea one day,
2991740	2995580	but I believe in man said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.
2996460	3000220	He said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.
3000220	3002940	He said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.
3003100	3008860	Trouble in the land will be all over after war. You won't have to give up night for long for
3008860	3015660	more, and maybe it could have been a little hard to hear. And I believe Jesus said I better call a
3015660	3025100	little bit louder. I wish I had somebody to help me call Mary.
3033100	3035100	Over deep water I've been trusting my name.
3045100	3055100	I don't believe she heard you, you better call her again.
3063820	3074860	Okay, this one's Silver Tones. So,
3078940	3088300	this is the annoying aspect of metanoia, but there's another aspect which is the
3088860	3094700	music of spiritual practice, and this is the kind of the action part of inner transformation.
3095820	3104860	And there are many ways in which music as is either enhances spiritual practice or is a direct
3105660	3109420	directly implicated or the direct path of spiritual practice.
3111180	3115500	I'll come back to the writer and the elephant. We see this in the indigenous traditions,
3116300	3123740	in plant ceremonies, in Christian choral, even song, and Buddhist chanting,
3123740	3131260	and the Sufi mystics, the whirling dervishes, and breath work. And then, of course, more recently
3131260	3137260	is an existential and spiritual practice psychedelics. Music is often really, really central to that.
3137500	3146220	And one of the reasons I think music is particularly powerful, and it relates to
3146220	3152460	this notion that Jonathan High developed this metaphor of the writer and the elephant,
3152460	3162220	which is a description, a way to describe the human psyche. And so, he sees the human psyche
3162220	3168620	as being composed of these two parts. The writer represents the rational mind, the intellect,
3168620	3181180	their capacity for planning, their capacity to plan, make decisions, see into the future,
3181180	3187660	and the elephant is our kind of deeper, more evolutionary, ancient, instinctual, emotional,
3187660	3194860	impulsive self. And what's key is the way these two aspects of ourselves relate to each other.
3194860	3199660	So, on the surface, it might look like the writer is in control. The writer's deciding,
3199660	3204940	right, go this way, go that way. But really, if the elephant wants to go in a different direction,
3204940	3212540	what hope has the writer got? And so, this speaks to the problem of acracia,
3212780	3219020	that we might see what the right thing to do is we might desire to go in a certain direction,
3219660	3223900	but due to our emotional selves, our instinctual selves, our impulsive selves, our desire for
3224700	3230860	pleasure, or the force of fear of whatever it might be, the elephant goes its own direction.
3231500	3237180	And the reason spiritual practice is so powerful is because we can then, it's a way for us to train
3237180	3242620	the elephant. It's a way for the writers to say to the elephant, okay, we're going to learn how to
3242620	3248620	go in the right direction. And I think music is a particularly powerful aspect, particularly
3248620	3254220	powerful method in spiritual practice, because music actually speaks to the deeper aspects of us.
3254860	3261660	It doesn't just operate at the kind of upper intellectual level, the more recently evolved
3262540	3269180	aspects of human cognition, but it speaks to the depth of our being. And which is why it's used
3269180	3274780	in all of these different traditions. It can be used devotionally, so then it can kind of draw
3274780	3279660	us towards the good draws towards the beautiful draws towards the transcendent. It can also be
3279660	3286140	used as a kind of an alchemical process, like in breathwork practices or psychedelics, where the
3286140	3292220	music itself seems to be a kind of a catalytic agent that can actually bring about kind of
3292220	3299020	inner transformation. So I thought it would be nice actually for us to engage in just a little bit
3299020	3309980	of practice right now together and use music as part of that. So what I want to do is just do a
3309980	3315500	very short meditation. I'd like to guide us for a few minutes, and then I'd like to play
3315500	3321020	a very well-known song, you've probably heard it many times, Debussy's Clair de Lune, which is a
3321020	3328540	beautiful, evocative, very deep song, piece of piano music. But what I'd like to do is guide us
3328540	3335580	into contemplation on the interconnectedness of the cosmos. And then as we listen to the music,
3335580	3343500	just rest in the kind of remembering. In Buddhism, the word for mindfulness is sati,
3343500	3347740	which means remembering. And another way of saying remembering, which I really like,
3347740	3355500	I learned from the trauma specialist, Peter Levine, is remembering being the opposite of
3355500	3361580	dismembering. So when something is dismembered, it's pulled apart, but remembering is to sew
3361580	3367740	back together. So the invitation is to kind of rest on the remembering of our interconnectedness
3367740	3375420	with everything, or coming back together with the whole. And I think this short quote from
3375420	3381500	Einstein, which is also well known, is appropriate for this. And this is something Einstein, I think
3381500	3387420	he wrote this to a friend when they recently experienced the bereavement, and he wrote this
3387420	3392940	to them to console them. This was in a letter he sent to them. A human being is a part of the whole
3392940	3399900	called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
3399900	3405340	feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
3406140	3411180	The delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires,
3411180	3417180	and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this
3417180	3423500	prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of
3423500	3431260	nature and its beauty. Okay, so if you want to find a way of sitting that feels comfortable
3431900	3439980	and stable, and I'll guide us in a short meditation just for a few minutes, and then I'll play the
3439980	3444860	piece of music and my invitation is just to listen to the music and let yourself rest into it and
3444860	3454140	just let your attention really be fully with the music and where it wants to go. Okay, so
3460380	3466300	get me nice too. Let me close the eyes that feels comfortable for you.
3469660	3472460	It can also be good to take a few slightly deeper breaths.
3474860	3484060	And with each in breath and out breath,
3486380	3490060	allowing the mind, allowing the mind to kind of rest down into the body,
3490940	3499340	and feeling also the body supported
3502620	3505020	by the chair whenever you're sitting on,
3509180	3516060	feeling the gentle force of gravity operating on the body.
3520060	3540060	And then allowing the breath to find its own rhythm, allowing the body to just breathe naturally.
3543500	3547020	Almost everything that is alive breathes in some way.
3550780	3559900	So sometimes it can be a sense that life is breathing us.
3567980	3575420	The breath, it's a rhythm in nature like so many rhythms, the rhythm of day and night,
3575740	3580700	the rhythm of the seasons,
3584380	3585900	the rhythms of the tides,
3590380	3593420	the heartbeats of countless creatures,
3606380	3616060	and of course the body is warmed by the sun in this moment.
3623260	3625420	Without the sun there would be no heat.
3635420	3637660	And also the body is full of water,
3644460	3647260	because dependent on the rivers, the oceans, the clouds,
3665420	3679260	so simply resting here in a kind of remembrance, the interconnectedness with everything else.
3996140	4012060	Hey, we need some time to come back,
4020220	4022300	back to the screen.
4025420	4027180	Back from the cosmos, back to the screen.
4032940	4042140	So I'd like to just finish by speaking briefly about music as realisation.
4042780	4051020	And so if the music's capacity to enlighten is about bringing us into deeper understanding
4051020	4058700	of reality and offering insights to reality, and in souling is about practice,
4060460	4064460	then if we come back to that kind of those original three aspects of metanoia,
4065260	4069820	to my mind music as realisation is maybe the most important and most profound,
4070380	4075100	which is transforming what we love, transformation of loving,
4075580	4079580	very much in that respect value section.
4080380	4086060	And so to this end, I want to draw in the words of Thich Nhat Hanh.
4089260	4096220	And yeah, I'll read, I'll just read this out, this is from I think the fifth of 10
4096220	4101100	love letters to Mother Earth. Thich Nhat Hanh writes, Dear Mother Earth,
4101740	4104940	There are those of us who walk the earth searching for a promised land,
4105660	4109740	not realising that you are the wondrous place who've been looking for our whole life.
4111020	4118220	You already are a wonderful and beautiful kingdom of heaven, the most beautiful planet in the solar
4118220	4124140	system, the most beautiful place in the heavens. You are the pure land where countless buddhas and
4124140	4130140	bodhisattvas of the past manifested, realised enlightenment and taught the Dharma. I do not
4130140	4135340	need to imagine a pure land of the Buddha to the west or a kingdom of God above where I will go
4135340	4142060	when I die. Heaven is here on earth, the kingdom of God is here and now. I don't need to die to be
4142060	4148540	in the kingdom of God. In fact, I need to be very much alive. I can touch the kingdom of God with
4148540	4162940	every step. So for me, this is quite a profound view on the nature of life and the nature of
4167500	4171900	the nature of our relationship to what could be called divine or sacred.
4172780	4181020	One way that this is spoken on, the pithiest way this is spoken of, this is it, which is to say that
4185180	4189900	music doesn't just point towards the true, the good and the beautiful, it doesn't just point
4189900	4196380	towards the possibility of a sacred relationship with reality or the realisation of sacredness.
4197180	4206540	Music is itself a beautiful manifestation of truth, goodness and beauty. It is reality manifesting
4206540	4213820	as joy, as beauty, as sacredness and we can participate in that directly through music.
4215180	4222380	In this Zen tradition, they teach that this is available to us all the time and a similar
4222380	4232140	sentiment is depicted in this painting by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
4233020	4238460	where you have Adam and God reaching to each other and if you look closely, you'll see that
4238460	4244940	Adam's finger, where God's finger and arm is fully outstretched, Adam's finger is,
4244940	4249740	for them to make contact, is up to Adam to just extend his finger that little bit further.
4250540	4257660	And the meaning of this is that what we can infer is that God is all of what's available to us,
4257660	4263180	the ultimate, the divine, the sacred nature of reality, beauty, truth, goodness, the wondrousness
4263180	4269340	that is reality is available to us, but it's just up to us to kind of wake up to it, to realise that,
4269420	4281100	to make that movement towards it. And I like to think that music is, to add one more dimension
4281100	4288140	to this picture, music is kind of God calling to us, singing to us, urging us to come into
4288140	4299180	contact with this sacred nature of reality. And there was a conversation recently between
4299340	4306940	Ima Gilchrist, Daniel Schmutterberger and John Verveke, and they talked about the need for really,
4306940	4314780	for a transformation or value-ception, for collectively, as to come, to reorientate towards
4314780	4320460	deeper, true or higher values. And the term the sacred actually came up 52 times in the space of
4320460	4325900	the conversation. And it wasn't just in one part, it came up throughout the entire conversation.
4325900	4334140	And this is three very accomplished thinkers putting their minds to the question of how do
4334140	4339420	we address the metacrisis and how do we chart a new path. And there was this constant coming back
4339420	4345660	to this need to orient towards the sacred. And my sense is that music offers us a way to,
4346460	4351260	not just to point towards it, but actually to participate in it, to realise it, to experience
4351340	4360540	it in the here and now. And this is, I think, what music offers us is realisation.
4362220	4368060	And it can help us fall in love with reality. If somebody can have an appreciation of the
4368060	4375180	sacredness of the beauty of reality through music, then my sense is that that can open up
4375180	4380300	into an appreciation and the sacredness of reality as a whole beyond music as well.
4382140	4387420	I'd like to share for you one final, final clip. Okay, just before I get to that clip,
4388300	4396780	I just want to share this briefly. This notion that the fruit contains the seed.
4396860	4402860	So far, I've been talking about music as metaphor as a way to understand reality, music as spiritual
4402860	4410220	practice. And all of these things would point to the notion that music is a way to get to some
4410220	4417500	better goal. And you could think of all of our attempts to address the various crises we're in,
4417500	4424140	the predicament we're in, as means to some kind of end, maybe in the future, maybe 700, 150 years,
4424220	4428220	where human beings finally learn how to live in harmony with each other on the planet.
4429500	4438140	But I think we also need to understand what we can learn from this notion that the fruit and the
4438140	4445580	seed can be the same thing. And what I mean by that is, if we are seeking a more beautiful world,
4445740	4455740	if we are seeking a more beautiful world, one way to explain the way to that is that there is no
4455740	4464220	way to a more beautiful world. The more beautiful world is the way. So if we seek to bring into
4464220	4469100	being a more beautiful world, we have to realize it in the here and now. We have to make it come
4469100	4474700	alive in the here and now. And when I think about what a beautiful, more beautiful world might entail
4475420	4481020	it definitely has people singing and dancing in it. It's people somehow coming together in community,
4481020	4485980	maybe sharing food, and maybe they're celebrating the joy and the miracle of life,
4485980	4490780	maybe they're having a live experience of the beauty and the wondrousness of existence.
4490780	4497020	There's something of that there. And if we can do that in the here and now and move into that more
4497020	4501980	and more, I think it sows the seed for more in that it sows the seed for a more beautiful world.
4501980	4508140	Whereas if we think, well, that's kind of a luxury. We need to just figure out how we're going to
4508140	4512780	transition off of fossil fuels, or we just need to figure out how we're going to deal with our
4515260	4520140	the kind of scourge of misinformation, or we need to just focus on the problems.
4520860	4526140	My concern is that we'll actually forget to be in love with the world. We'll get to be in love
4526140	4534220	with reality. And that is really surely going to bring our demise. So there's a need to bring to life
4535420	4540860	the more beautiful world in the here and now. And if we do that, that has its own causal power,
4540860	4549500	that has its own causal agency. And the final thing I want to point towards is that we need to find
4550460	4556060	new ways. We need to give birth to new forms of communitas that generate the right set and
4556060	4562220	setting to fully harness the spiritual power of music. And so what I mean by this is in psychedelic
4562220	4565980	therapy and psychedelic practice, they talk about the importance of the set and setting.
4566860	4570700	If you're the set is the kind of mindset you bring to it, the intention you bring to it.
4571500	4575420	And the setting is the environment, the people you're around. And if these things are
4575420	4582780	not right, the likelihood of a good trip or a valuable trip is goes down. And the likelihood
4582780	4588780	of a bad or very traumatic trip goes can go up quite a lot. But if you get the set and setting
4588780	4593500	right, you can have a much more helpful experience. And I think just now what happens with music,
4594460	4600300	sadly in our kind of spiritually hollowed out culture, and are the way kind of capitalism
4600300	4606380	has infiltrated every aspect of life, music is reduced to mere entertainment,
4606380	4613900	something we merely consume. And we don't really engage with it in profound spiritual
4613900	4620540	context or with a profound spiritual intention, kind of related to the this historical moment,
4620540	4627340	to the challenges of our times. And if I feel like it's something we need to experiment,
4627340	4631740	we need to explore how we can do that. And I don't know how to do that. Quite honestly,
4631740	4639900	I'm not sure. I also think there's a necessity to do this in ways that are not bound within the
4639900	4646940	old religious traditions, which to many people, the kind of dogmatic metaphysical and cosmological
4646940	4651900	claims turn them off. And we need to do this in a way that can be more pluralistic, more open,
4651900	4660140	but none the less, affirms the deep maturing of life. And so I want to just share one final video
4660140	4669420	now, which is of, which I had the chance to record when I was in Argentina last year. And
4670220	4677420	in Argentina, Buenos Aires, my wife, Kylan, who's on this call, we were there for, I think,
4677420	4684460	just over two months. And one of the things that we saw a lot, which was quite, in some sense,
4684460	4690380	kind of amusing, but also wondrous, is that the Argentinians, they protest a lot. They seem
4690380	4696380	to be always on the streets protesting, right? But whenever they protest, they're out playing
4696380	4705980	drums and they're dancing. Okay, so I want to show you just a quick video that I took of just this
4737740	4746540	video. Okay, so there you go. So this is just an example that was, that doesn't happen, at least
4746540	4752460	in my country in Scotland, we don't see this, you know, very much at all. But it's kind of woven
4752460	4759180	into communal cultural practice that has a kind of socio-political end to it goal in mind. And
4760060	4768300	it becomes a form of communitas, but also is devoted to some wider aim. And I'm really curious
4768300	4776380	about how could we form, how can we kind of give rise, give birth to new forms of communal activity,
4776380	4782620	new cultural practices that really harness music, and the address that speak to the challenges of
4782620	4788140	our time. And so that's the one of the things that, in this project that we're, we're kind of in the,
4788140	4793580	in the very early stages of a perspectiva, I'm giving my mind to, to think about how that might happen.
4795260	4804780	So that's me. I'm finished with that workshop. I hope you guys are not totally exhausted by that.
4804780	4809980	And I very, very much appreciate your presence and attention. What I'd like to do now
