00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
The

00:28.000 --> 00:37.560
Metacrisis is the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our

00:37.560 --> 00:46.480
persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriing of reality. It arises from the

00:46.480 --> 00:54.800
material and spiritual exhaustion of modernity. It is a multifaceted delusion. It is the crisis

00:54.800 --> 01:03.680
within, between, and beyond our existing conceptual crisis, and it manifests institutionally and

01:03.680 --> 01:12.920
culturally to the detriment of life on earth. The Metacrisis is something about our relationship

01:12.920 --> 01:17.040
to all of the crises in the world. So it's reflexive, it's inherently reflexive, it's about

01:17.040 --> 01:23.840
talking through, thinking through, how does human nature relate to this thing. Now, that's quite

01:23.840 --> 01:29.120
distinct from polycrisis, or permanent crisis, or all these other terms. What's different about

01:29.120 --> 01:34.160
Metacrisis is it acknowledges human interiority and relationality as a fundamental part of the

01:34.160 --> 01:38.960
problem, or the problematic, I should say. The other way of looking at Metacrisis, and there are

01:38.960 --> 01:45.480
many actually, but you can see it as the sign that modernity is ending. And so this expression of

01:45.480 --> 01:52.760
Zack Stein's time between worlds, that we're in a time between worlds captures that. And it's

01:52.800 --> 01:56.000
because we're in a time between worlds that things don't make sense, things begin to break

01:56.000 --> 02:01.280
down. And this is where, again, you can get into Jean Gebster's notion of the mental rational

02:01.280 --> 02:06.400
function, breaking down, which in plain language is intellectually we're not up to it anymore. The

02:06.400 --> 02:11.760
intellectual function is not succeeding in making sense of the world. The world is eclipsing or

02:11.760 --> 02:17.120
going beyond our capacity to make sense of it. And these are all signs that our existing form of

02:17.120 --> 02:23.640
consciousness is somehow in need of evolution, in need of growing in some way. But I also think

02:23.640 --> 02:29.840
Meta's kind of alive. I think there's a kind of participatory knowing of the Metacrisis. When

02:29.840 --> 02:33.880
you put it as a proposition, and say define the Metacrisis, it becomes one more concept,

02:33.880 --> 02:40.040
a million concepts. The Metacrisis is your daily experience of a world falling apart. It's your

02:40.040 --> 02:46.000
incredulity towards how weird everything's becoming. Both the kind of rapid technological growth,

02:46.880 --> 02:53.680
and the combination of synthetic biology and AI and virtual reality, changing the life world. And

02:53.680 --> 02:59.840
then you have things like gene editing and so on that are actually changing life as such. And then

02:59.840 --> 03:05.920
you have maybe a new phase of geological time. The academics are still arguing about it. But for

03:05.920 --> 03:11.920
all intents and purposes, the whole of scene has ended. The stable geological period that has lasted

03:11.920 --> 03:18.960
many thousands of years is now unstable. And we're entering uncharted territory. And you can see

03:18.960 --> 03:27.640
that in the planetary boundary framework very clearly. But you can also feel it. The quick

03:27.640 --> 03:33.240
definition would be something like the Metacrisis is all the crisis put together, right? And people

03:33.240 --> 03:37.240
go, Oh, I see, I see. But they don't see, right? Because it's not really the end of it. That's

03:37.240 --> 03:42.520
just the beginning of the conversation. The Metacrisis is also in the way you make sense of the

03:42.520 --> 03:50.720
world, the way you feel it and in a mode in relation to it. The Metacrisis is in your incapacitated,

03:50.720 --> 03:59.920
fully articulate and narrate the self in this context. And the Metacrisis is also, you know,

03:59.920 --> 04:06.920
co extensive with co arising with this particular historical epoch. So it's not as though there

04:06.960 --> 04:12.240
haven't been Metacrisis before. I mean, arguably, the time of Christ was a kind of Metacrisis. If

04:12.240 --> 04:19.080
you think about an occupying Roman Empire, a kind of religious fervor people waiting for, you know,

04:19.080 --> 04:25.320
Messiah, and then this person appears apparently doing miracles. Everyone's totally confused, right?

04:25.320 --> 04:31.600
Just as we are kind of now. So one of many examples where it's not like we haven't had historical

04:31.640 --> 04:37.800
turbulence before. Is there something distinct about today? Yes, that we're actually destroying our

04:37.800 --> 04:45.640
only home. Our one precious planet in the infinite regions of space is under threat, not of annihilation

04:45.640 --> 04:52.120
necessarily, but of being in a habitat for human life. That's in question now. The forms of

04:52.120 --> 04:57.800
technology developing so rapidly that you can get into a world of autonomous weapons that really

04:57.800 --> 05:04.160
can cause massive destruction. So what's different today is the degree of risk to the planet as a

05:04.160 --> 05:13.240
whole. That's one distinct feature of the Metacrisis. But arguably we had this with nuclear weapons as

05:13.240 --> 05:20.320
well. So it's different. But at the same time, I like to speak of the Metacrisis in a way that

05:20.320 --> 05:28.120
doesn't just leave you dazed and confused, and looking as a passive subject at a kind of unfamiliar

05:28.120 --> 05:35.560
object saying, that there is the Metacrisis. What do I do? That's not the way to go. The Metacrisis is

05:35.560 --> 05:42.040
our historical inheritance. We're born into this. It's this generation that perceives it and feels

05:42.040 --> 05:47.240
it. It's the set of cards we have to play. It's not something we can fix. The problem with the

05:47.240 --> 05:53.240
crisis framing is that it's still a kind of tacit problem solution mentality. That would be

05:53.240 --> 05:58.400
misunderstanding the nature of the Metacrisis. What's going on is a very slow historical process

05:58.400 --> 06:05.080
that's culminating in a certain way and beginning to transform into something else. The nature of

06:05.080 --> 06:12.600
what it transforms into will depend whether we survive and thrive or collapse. I believe about 90%

06:12.840 --> 06:17.040
of what I just said. But there's another part of me that says, are we sure this is the time between

06:17.040 --> 06:23.480
worlds? Is modernity really ending? If I told Elon Musk or Sam Altman that modernity is ending,

06:23.480 --> 06:29.640
they'd just laugh at me, right? So I'm thinking of the other side saying, modernity is not ending.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.880
What are you talking about? It's just taking off. If anything, technology is going to radically

06:34.880 --> 06:39.040
change the world and solve a lot of these problems. Now, I don't feel that. It's not how I'm politically,

06:39.120 --> 06:46.360
socially, culturally, intellectually oriented, but it's possible. It's possible that you solve

06:46.360 --> 06:53.360
something like nuclear fusion and have abundant energy. It's conceivable that a lot of the

06:53.360 --> 06:59.800
illnesses that lead us to suffer and die will be dealt with. It's conceivable that the powers that

06:59.800 --> 07:07.120
be that somehow at the moment seems so cut off from the rest of the world will be in some sense

07:07.200 --> 07:13.920
democratized and brought back into the fold such that the great benefits that are currently accruing

07:13.920 --> 07:19.920
in a very small number of people are shared more widely and people might insist on that. So I'm

07:19.920 --> 07:32.280
not sort of predisposed to feel that collapse is sort of absolutely necessary. On the other hand,

07:32.320 --> 07:39.800
I do feel a kind of collapse is underway. And the challenge for us is collapse is underway. What

07:39.800 --> 07:46.560
does a transformative response to collapse look like? But look, I say this in a kitchen in a

07:46.560 --> 07:54.320
suburb of Landa, living quite a full, healthy life in a safe, democratic, more or less country.

07:55.240 --> 08:03.800
So there's a lot of incredulity here. There's a lot of dissonance, confusion that we live as if

08:03.800 --> 08:09.040
living a normal life while watching the news in our pocket, the kind of planet in our pocket that

08:09.040 --> 08:15.000
says everything's falling apart. And yet we go to the shop and we buy our milk and we walk back home

08:15.720 --> 08:22.680
as if things are normal. So that's kind of the Metacrisis too. It's the experience of

08:23.800 --> 08:31.240
confusion that's now baked into our lives as we hear about a world collapsing on the news and on

08:31.240 --> 08:40.120
our phones, but often live as if life could carry on forever. I was formed as many, many millions

08:40.200 --> 08:46.440
of people were with a notion of what normal looks like. And a lot of what's going on is a kind of

08:46.440 --> 08:52.240
clamouring to get normal back, like solve these problems, you know, like make them make democracy

08:52.240 --> 08:59.680
stronger, make the market work, but just get rid of the environmental externalities. You know,

08:59.680 --> 09:04.320
yes, there's problems with, you know, mass immigration, but surely we can just build more

09:04.360 --> 09:11.280
houses and, you know, there's a kind of notion that make do and mend is enough, right? But many

09:11.280 --> 09:14.920
don't feel that in their hearts, right? Many feel this is something altogether different.

09:14.920 --> 09:21.600
Now, I think what's going on in our kind of community in our world is that most people are

09:21.600 --> 09:27.200
reading the position and seeing that the make do and mend story doesn't doesn't sound like it's

09:27.200 --> 09:36.280
true. It seems very unlikely. It seems more likely that they'll either be in the next years,

09:36.280 --> 09:43.040
decades, hard to say exactly how quickly, but forms of dissolution and collapse in various

09:43.040 --> 09:48.480
parts of the world, you know, you're already seeing people dying of heat deaths and people

09:48.480 --> 09:54.520
losing their homes to floods and forest fires. And we don't, we haven't really seen AI biting

09:54.520 --> 09:59.920
properly yet on the labor market, but that will begin to happen. And we see deep fakes

09:59.920 --> 10:05.480
affecting democratic elections. And that will happen more like the Nobel Prize winner Maria

10:05.480 --> 10:12.160
Ressa feels that 2024 will be the last year of proper democratic elections, because she sees the

10:12.160 --> 10:16.520
problem of these technologies basically, you can't trust public opinion that the notion of

10:16.520 --> 10:22.640
universal suffrage is compromised by the fact that the information stream is polluted with

10:22.880 --> 10:29.720
falsehoods. And so the legitimacy that underpins democracy is in question, right? And so you get

10:29.720 --> 10:35.360
problems with authoritarianism and so on. If that seems confusing, it's because it is. It's

10:35.360 --> 10:41.080
because all these things are happening at once. Most people in our sector of the internet and our

10:41.080 --> 10:48.200
sort of world feel intuitively that something deeper is going on. And we look to history sometimes

10:48.240 --> 10:54.400
to see what is this like? What kind of transition is this like? And there are many ways of doing it,

10:54.400 --> 11:00.000
but one would be the Axial Age. One would just say there was a moment in time about give or

11:00.000 --> 11:06.640
take 500 years before Christ, where there was the early signs of systematic thought,

11:06.640 --> 11:14.520
that we sort of moved out of a kind of mythos into a kind of logos, where we began to actually have

11:15.520 --> 11:24.680
sort of reason and writing. And we would turn from a barter economy to money and there was a

11:24.680 --> 11:30.520
move towards the cities away from the country. And in our consciousness, the sort of notion of the

11:30.520 --> 11:38.200
individual was kind of born. And then at this time, Buddha appeared and Lao Tzu and so on,

11:38.200 --> 11:45.760
and many of the Greek philosophers. And around that time, it was as if the whole world, although

11:45.760 --> 11:52.360
it wasn't evenly spread, developed a new kind of consciousness. And I think a lot of people in my

11:52.360 --> 11:57.160
world feel something else like that as happening. And it's a very audacious, somewhat absurd thing

11:57.160 --> 12:04.040
to think. But it roughly is what I think. It feels more true than that we can muddle through with

12:04.040 --> 12:09.560
the existing framework. So when people ask me what I'm doing sometimes, because I did a lot of work

12:09.560 --> 12:14.480
on climate change, I have a lot of contacts in that world. And they're working on, you know,

12:14.480 --> 12:21.040
getting the government to sign up to net zero by 2030 or whatever the latest thing is. And I'm like,

12:21.040 --> 12:25.960
well, you can do that if you like. But I think something altogether deeper is happening. And

12:25.960 --> 12:33.800
you're not likely to succeed that way. I place more hope in a fundamental transformation of

12:33.800 --> 12:38.560
consciousness than I do in dealing with things with the institutional and cultural structure we

12:38.560 --> 12:43.960
have now. It's worth saying a bit more about Time Between Worlds, because it's, like I say,

12:43.960 --> 12:50.680
the expression was first mooted in a book titled by Zachary Stein called Education in a Time

12:50.680 --> 12:55.680
Between Worlds. And the term is very charming. And so people use it as a shorthand for this

12:55.680 --> 13:01.960
period of time. But it's important to understand that it has precursors. So in sociology, particularly

13:01.960 --> 13:07.120
in Gramsci, there's this notion of the interregnum, where one thing has ended, but the next thing

13:07.120 --> 13:18.240
hasn't yet been born. In anthropology, there's the notion of the liminal, which is really

13:18.240 --> 13:22.880
fascinating for our community. Because what it is to be in the liminal is for an ethnographer,

13:22.880 --> 13:29.440
who is from one culture, let's say a regular Western culture, goes into a tribal context or

13:30.040 --> 13:36.240
an indigenous context. And he's trying to do deep ethnographic work. So he's trying to sort of

13:36.240 --> 13:42.760
live like them with them, observe them, participate or observation. But there's a period of time

13:42.760 --> 13:47.040
when they're neither, they're so ensconced in that world that they almost forget what it was like

13:47.040 --> 13:52.160
to be in the prior world. But they're not yet one of them. And that's what they mean by liminal

13:52.160 --> 13:56.720
anthropology. And in some ways, that's how a lot of our community is. It's like we don't

13:56.800 --> 14:02.680
entirely belong to the world as it is now, although we're still part of it. And yet there

14:02.680 --> 14:06.760
isn't really another thing that we're fully belonging in. So we're in this in between phase.

14:06.760 --> 14:11.840
The other thing to say about time between worlds is it's not just a poetic soundbite. There's

14:11.840 --> 14:17.880
quite a lot of empirical work underpinning it. So Immanuel Wallerstein's world system dynamics

14:17.880 --> 14:23.400
is one of these sources. And that's to do with understanding the world system as trade flows.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.720
And it's actually a very political analysis. It's to do with the exploitation of the poor world

14:28.720 --> 14:34.680
by the rich world. And following the pattern of that over time, and seeing that it lacks durability,

14:34.680 --> 14:39.120
that it will inevitably collapse. And then you have work by people like Peter Turchin to do a

14:39.120 --> 14:44.000
secular psycho theory. It's some similar theory of history. He sometimes calls it cleodynamics,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.480
which is the sort of quantitative history of looking at past patterns and seeing how they repeat

14:48.520 --> 14:56.200
today, and measuring things like income inequality, and autocratic governance, and so on. And

14:56.200 --> 15:00.480
beginning to sort of do a quantitative measure when this number of things happen, things fall

15:00.480 --> 15:04.680
apart. So the time between worlds is not just a feeling. There's also a kind of empirical

15:04.680 --> 15:12.360
underpinning to it. And at its heart, there's an analysis of modernity. And what the hell is

15:12.360 --> 15:19.760
that, right? I'm not sure I can adequately describe modernity, but Habermas speaks of it as an

15:19.760 --> 15:25.480
orientation towards the future. And a big part of what's happening in our world is, people are not

15:25.480 --> 15:31.280
so sure about the future. It's not clear where the ship is sailing, where we're going, right? So

15:31.280 --> 15:35.760
to be in a time between worlds in that sense, and the reason some people call it meta-modern,

15:36.040 --> 15:43.640
is that if the orientation to the future and the progress narrative is a big part of what

15:43.640 --> 15:49.080
modernity is about, first of all, we can't see the future very clearly. And if anything,

15:49.080 --> 15:54.120
we're a bit wary of it. And secondly, it's not at all clear its progress. It might well be regress.

15:54.120 --> 15:59.880
And that's why it's between worlds. And then you also have, though, rather than just the world is

15:59.880 --> 16:04.880
me, everything's falling apart. There are these wellsprings of renewal. You know, there are these

16:04.880 --> 16:10.800
people doing different things, like I'm thinking here of maybe Joe Brewer, who's currently trying to

16:10.800 --> 16:16.680
get a river back to life in Bari-Chara, Colombia. And that's exciting because he's kind of given up

16:16.680 --> 16:23.240
on the nation state. He's like, we need to start building the biorhegional hubs. And then there

16:23.240 --> 16:27.040
are many biorhegions around the world. If more people start to work around biorhegions, you might

16:27.040 --> 16:32.120
find a new form of governance emerging. Then you have this notion of like cosmolocalism, which

16:32.160 --> 16:37.400
is something to do with being wise about your production patterns, so that if something is very

16:37.400 --> 16:43.800
heavy to transport, you don't transport it. You use it locally. But also, it's more philosophically,

16:43.800 --> 16:49.280
it's kind of like you focus locally on your niche and your immediate needs in your community. But

16:49.280 --> 16:54.440
you're connected to this much bigger cosmological framework because of the internet. And you have

16:54.440 --> 16:59.960
other ideas, you know, there's ontological mutiny. It's a term of biocomalaphism, that we somehow

17:00.000 --> 17:05.160
have to just break out of this kind of collective illusion that we're part of. My colleague,

17:05.160 --> 17:10.520
Evo Mensch also speaks about this. He jokes that we're collectively living a life that no longer

17:10.520 --> 17:16.640
exists. And a lot of us feel that way. When Bonita has work on complex potential states, something to

17:16.640 --> 17:24.680
do with inshooting potentials, quite a Taoist go with the energy kind of notion. So it's not as

17:24.680 --> 17:29.840
though there's no ideas. It's not as though no one has any idea what happens next. But if you look

17:29.880 --> 17:36.240
at scale, in terms of where the power is, who has power now, particularly technological power, it

17:36.240 --> 17:43.520
is daunting. And it takes quite a lot of courage and resilience, not to just give in to despair.

17:46.520 --> 17:52.080
I came across it through my friend Zachary Stein, and I think he worked on it with Mark

17:52.080 --> 17:57.800
Gaffney. And it's to do with what they call the stations of the self. And it's not really a

17:57.840 --> 18:04.080
developmental theory, but it's more a way of describing a sort of existential interiority of

18:04.080 --> 18:10.480
the human being as it goes through life. And the stages are roughly pre-tragic, tragic, and

18:10.480 --> 18:15.920
post-tragic. Pre-tragic is something like we can fix every problem. Everything's going to be okay.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.520
Don't don't fixate on your worries. Everything will work out in the end. We can do it kind of

18:21.520 --> 18:28.200
in our mentality. So arguably a lot of techno optimism is pre-tragic. It's sort of like not

18:28.200 --> 18:33.960
really contending with just how compromise everything already is. The tragic though is to be

18:33.960 --> 18:44.360
lost and broken by despair. The tragic is to be unable to function because you're so thoroughly

18:44.360 --> 18:49.560
depressed when everything seems to be going wrong. But the problem is tragic as you get stuck in

18:49.560 --> 18:55.000
them, completely stuck in them. And the claim here is that it's not that it's better to be

18:55.000 --> 19:03.880
post-tragic as such, but just there is also a state of sort of sensibility available to us that

19:03.880 --> 19:10.440
doesn't have the pre-tragic. Nothing's wrong. Everything will be fine. But nor is it lost forever

19:10.440 --> 19:19.440
in the kind of the implosion of the tragic. It reclaims the agency of the pre-tragic informed by

19:19.440 --> 19:26.840
the understanding of the tragic to live in a way that recognizes that suffering and pain is an

19:26.840 --> 19:35.080
endemic feature of life. Humans screw things up all the time. We can't help it almost. I believe

19:35.080 --> 19:39.920
one of the better definitions of sin for what it's worth is from Francis Spufford. He calls it

19:39.920 --> 19:47.160
the human propensity to fuck things up. And it's a real feature of human life. So the post-tragic

19:47.160 --> 19:54.040
recognizes that as something that we can't escape. There will be no Eden as such. There will still

19:54.040 --> 19:59.760
be wars. There will still be sociopaths. There will still be narcissists. There'll still be corruption.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.560
And yet you don't collapse and despair because of that, because it's not really your work to do to

20:05.560 --> 20:10.760
solve that. That's baked into reality as the oppositional principles that gives rise to creative

20:10.760 --> 20:17.080
possibilities and so on. What the post-tragic's about is rediscovering the beauty on the other side

20:17.120 --> 20:23.320
of the suffering, to see that somehow the soul is formed through those contests, those battles.

20:23.320 --> 20:39.840
At scale things are so bad we have to rethink. That's where it comes into structures of consciousness

20:40.600 --> 20:49.520
because reason is powerful and good. Science, when it's working well, is important. And we shouldn't

20:49.520 --> 20:54.400
wish these things away. But what is true, and I think Paul Marshall does a particularly good job

20:54.400 --> 21:01.000
at this in his book, Complex Integral Realism, he speaks about the biases of the modern mind.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.160
And what he's doing there is fleshing out Jean Gebster's notion of the evolution of consciousness

21:08.160 --> 21:13.720
and the mind in its mental rational function breaking down and he's spelling it out. And he

21:13.720 --> 21:22.080
speaks about the various kinds of biases, but the essence of it, the way he sums it up, is that the

21:22.080 --> 21:28.520
modern mind got very good at standing back. Again, the term poly crisis, it's all standing back

21:28.520 --> 21:36.880
and looking at it. But it lost its way in terms of looking within, which is more about the depth

21:36.920 --> 21:43.960
of the psyche, the deep interior. And it lost its way in terms of let's say cosmo vision and

21:43.960 --> 21:51.080
metaphysics. It stopped asking, what are our assumptions about the fabric of reality? And those

21:51.080 --> 21:57.400
two moves, the looking within and looking beyond, are the other two meanings of meta, which is why

21:57.400 --> 22:03.680
I think metacrisis is the term to use, because that's the work we have to do. It's like, what is

22:03.720 --> 22:09.160
inside the imaginal realm? What is the psyche? How do we know it better? How do we live through it

22:09.160 --> 22:14.840
so that we have less need of consumer durables to live well, that we don't need to meet our

22:14.840 --> 22:22.720
emotional needs by buying something new necessarily. And at the same time, the sort of broadly liberal

22:22.720 --> 22:28.680
imaginary that says, have your religion if you want, but keep it out of the public realm as far

22:28.680 --> 22:36.360
as you can, doesn't seem to be working very well. It would appear that we need a view of the world

22:36.360 --> 22:48.920
that is altogether more enchanted, more profoundly, I think, personal. It's not like anything goes.

22:48.920 --> 22:55.440
It's not like you surrender your intellect or surrender your critical faculties. It's just

22:55.520 --> 23:01.560
that you realize that the story you've been told about material reality, cause and consequence,

23:01.560 --> 23:08.240
space and time, it's less than the full story. And because it's less than the full story, with

23:08.240 --> 23:15.200
all due discernment, with all due care, with all due critical caution, be open to the possibility

23:15.200 --> 23:20.160
that the world is radically different from the one you imagined. So when I have something like a

23:20.160 --> 23:27.200
serendipity or a feeling that the universe is somehow talking to me, I can explain it away,

23:27.760 --> 23:35.200
but I prefer not to. And I don't have to. The universe may well be enchanted and there may well

23:35.200 --> 23:42.560
be a form of relationship between the cosmos and us that we need to reconnect with and at scale and

23:42.560 --> 23:50.320
quickly so that the major collective action problems we face feel different and they feel

23:50.320 --> 23:56.240
different not just to the niche people who are complaining, but to the powers that be as well.

23:58.720 --> 24:04.560
You can't really know. So in the absence of not being able to know with certainty,

24:05.600 --> 24:09.040
do you opt for a kind of conventional view of how things are

24:09.360 --> 24:19.040
that is still culturally hegemonic? Or do you venture out into other ways of knowing that seem

24:19.920 --> 24:25.040
less socially validated, but perhaps more emotionally rewarding and credible?

24:26.800 --> 24:34.640
And personally, I do the latter. But I do think it's delicate because you could have psychosis,

24:35.600 --> 24:39.840
the mental structure could just collapse and I have schizophrenia in my family.

24:40.480 --> 24:47.360
I don't want to wish away the mental structures lightly. I'm very happy for sanity and reason.

24:48.400 --> 24:53.600
It's just that I also feel that the world is much more than we've been led to believe.

24:54.160 --> 24:59.040
I believe consciousness is an ontological primary, a fundamental feature of reality.

24:59.760 --> 25:05.200
I think value and meaning are inherent to the fabric of reality and not just socially constructed.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.200
I'm at ease with using the word God, though I don't quite know what I mean by

25:10.160 --> 25:15.520
that. But I do feel there's a kind of relationship between the whole and the parts that's constantly

25:15.520 --> 25:23.200
happening. And sometimes you can feel yourself in the whole in a way that's quite personal and

25:23.200 --> 25:30.160
livening. I would just hope that when we try and think about the future, people in the social

25:30.160 --> 25:35.840
change world, they often don't go there. They stick within the narrow confines of what's politically

25:35.840 --> 25:41.280
possible and culturally acceptable. But I think a lot of people in our network feel instinctively

25:41.280 --> 25:47.520
that's not enough, that you have to actually widen the scope of the inquiry. Because only then do you

25:47.520 --> 25:54.160
get the quality of idea and the kind of institutional and cultural innovation that might be more worthy

25:54.160 --> 26:03.600
of the scale of the challenges we face. There's that old line by Charles Kettering that a problem

26:03.600 --> 26:10.640
well stated is half solved, which I always thought was only about half true. I don't think it's the

26:10.640 --> 26:15.600
whole truth. You need to do more than specify the problem. And we're a bit beyond problems,

26:15.600 --> 26:20.560
we're in a kind of predicament now. But still, all very well, but what do we do, right?

26:22.640 --> 26:29.360
So one thing I've suggested is that trying to get beyond a crisis mentality seems to me to be

26:29.360 --> 26:34.560
quite important. This has come to me quite recently. But I've noticed that the people that I admire

26:34.560 --> 26:40.320
are not fixated with crisis. People I'm drawn to these days are not those who are pointing out

26:40.320 --> 26:47.200
just how dangerous it all is. They're people who are already underway doing something different.

26:47.200 --> 26:52.080
People who are actually innovating in a way that prefigures the next world are the ones that I admire

26:52.080 --> 26:58.800
the most. And very few of them are motivated by the language of crisis. And I find this very intriguing

26:58.800 --> 27:07.120
because at a purely conceptual level, some would argue that the entire thrust of modernity, the

27:07.120 --> 27:14.720
entire sort of engine that drives the progress narrative and the future orientation is the

27:14.720 --> 27:22.400
perpetual construction and solving of crises. And this is through war. This is through sort of

27:22.400 --> 27:29.040
capital investment. It happens in the institution building. It's like, this is a big crisis,

27:29.040 --> 27:33.040
let's solve it by doing this. And that's how the whole thing keeps moving over many, many centuries.

27:33.680 --> 27:40.240
But where we are now is we can't keep on talking of crisis and solving them. That's actually,

27:40.800 --> 27:44.160
rather than being the solution, that's, you begin to see that's part of the problem,

27:44.160 --> 27:50.960
that entire way of framing things. Instead, you've got to look for potential. You've got to look,

27:50.960 --> 28:01.040
where is the scope to do things fundamentally differently in a transformative way? And I

28:01.040 --> 28:06.960
mean that in quite a specific way, not just as a kind of rhetorical flourish, but transformative

28:06.960 --> 28:11.840
in the sense that the underlying form of it, the underlying reality of it, you go beyond in some

28:11.840 --> 28:25.920
way. Going from the nation state to the bioregion is an example of that. Getting out of a university

28:25.920 --> 28:31.280
department, speaking about sustainability and actually having your own farm where you actually

28:32.640 --> 28:38.000
model how to grow crops is an example of that. Creating a pop-up school rather than

28:38.640 --> 28:43.440
getting a job in a university department is part of that. It's creating new language, so

28:44.400 --> 28:52.160
let's say Nora Bateson's a fanny poesis, for example, which is a kind of tending to what is

28:52.160 --> 28:58.480
latent, seeing what's unseen, and moving with that in some way is another example.

29:01.040 --> 29:07.040
These are the things to get behind, and at a more spiritual level is to do with calling, right?

29:12.160 --> 29:17.040
I don't know how else to put this, other than to say that there's a place where Carl Jung's idea

29:17.040 --> 29:24.240
of individuation meets Eleanor Ostrom's idea of the functional commons, the solving of collective

29:24.240 --> 29:29.680
action problems, or collective action solutions. There's a place where individuation meets collective

29:29.680 --> 29:34.640
action solutions, and you can think of it as a kind of collective individuation, and what I mean

29:34.640 --> 29:39.360
by that is the distinction between the I and the we begins to break down, and not in a coercive,

29:39.360 --> 29:44.560
there's no individual anymore, but rather the very notion of what an individual is, is that

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
they're part of a collective and responding to its needs, and the very notion of what a collective

29:48.560 --> 29:54.160
is is something that gets rise to individuated beings. That's what we want to get to, but to get

29:54.160 --> 30:00.000
there, I do believe you have to tune in to something more cosmic, which is something like your own

30:00.000 --> 30:05.200
sense of what you're meant to be doing. Now not everyone is, let's say, spiritually musical,

30:05.200 --> 30:11.840
not everyone hears that frequency, but for a lot of people I think they do sense it, and they may

30:11.840 --> 30:15.440
even be in denial about it, but they feel there's something they're meant to be doing,

30:17.600 --> 30:22.880
and I guess I feel the more that we tune into that, and of course listen for feedback from the

30:22.880 --> 30:28.720
world, otherwise you get caught in narcissistic spirals of self-indulgence, but look at what the

30:28.720 --> 30:35.200
world appears to need, think of what you have to offer it, and that's where we're speaking of

30:35.200 --> 30:40.320
something like collective individuation, and it's also about potential, it's not just about solving

30:40.320 --> 30:46.080
a problem to prop up the status quo, it's like what is actually transforming the world, changing

30:46.080 --> 30:52.960
the underlying form, going beyond it, creatively, subversively, transgressively even, that's the

30:52.960 --> 31:01.200
kind of work that excites me. Hope lies not so much in the massive armies and the big plans,

31:01.840 --> 31:07.120
but in the people tending to everyday life. Now this is quite an uncomfortable, I find it

31:07.200 --> 31:13.120
quite a difficult thought to bear, because there's a part of me that is more conventionally masculine

31:14.160 --> 31:21.520
in the sense of like trying to disclose the problem and fix it, but I'm growing out of that,

31:21.520 --> 31:27.600
I sort of feel that's actually not the right way to approach things, great to map things if you can

31:27.600 --> 31:33.840
and see as clearly as you can, but the hope lies from something more like tending, digging where

31:33.840 --> 31:40.800
you stand, tending to what's yours to deal with. Now that doesn't mean shutting off the rest of the

31:40.800 --> 31:47.120
world, but it does mean asking deeply, given that context, what is my work in this context,

31:48.000 --> 31:55.040
and that gets back to the cosmolocal idea, so it's something like this, it's not a big grand

31:55.040 --> 32:00.800
action plan, it's trusting in the innovation of smaller groups, for those who are more theoretically

32:00.800 --> 32:08.320
inclined in the world of hyper-objects, and by hyper-objects we mean these almost unintelligible

32:08.320 --> 32:12.720
ideas like the climate crisis and the pandemic and the metacrisis, these things we can't quite get

32:12.720 --> 32:17.920
our head around, but we still live every day. In the world of hyper-objects you need hyposubjects,

32:18.720 --> 32:24.560
by hyposubjects it's not hyper-agents, it's not, you don't need more Elon Musk's, you need more

32:24.560 --> 32:31.040
people who are turning away from the miasma, the drama of the global election problem, global

32:31.040 --> 32:39.200
situation, towards the spiritual calling of the work they're meant to do in the context they have,

32:39.200 --> 32:45.840
but not in a politically naive way, in a way that is deeply informed by the need to generate a new reality.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.440
you
