0	13400	I just want to make sure I want to make sure you ordered last in your class first
13400	14400	in your class.
14400	17840	When inflation gets out of control, interest rates go up.
17840	19840	Rishisuna, please let us trust answer.
19840	23280	Excuse me, Chris, I'm speaking and I'm not done yet.
23280	33280	I haven't heard a time when you weren't speaking.
33280	36200	Welcome everybody to this evening's anti-debates.
36200	43240	Let me say a little bit at the beginning before we start about why we're doing it and what
43240	44240	it's about.
44240	45240	Debate has its place.
45240	48400	Debate can be beautiful, edifying.
48400	51840	It's often a spectacle, a clash, entertaining.
51840	54640	It's often very enlivening and it's done well.
54640	56760	It can even be informative.
56760	63120	But sadly, the way the world is today, there's many structural incentives towards polarization
63120	65760	built into the way we get our information.
65760	70440	So we're in a phase of history where divergence and bifurcation and disagreement is actually
70440	76120	being compounded and exacerbated by the systems and structures that prevail.
76120	80720	And this is a big deal because democracies are even any functioning form of government
80720	87240	that includes people relies on a capacity to discuss adequately what's going on.
87240	95560	So I first encountered the idea of the anti-debate when I read a post by Peter Lindbergh on
95560	101880	the e-merge site, WhatIsEmerging.com, and that was a relatively political version of
101880	102880	the anti-debate.
102880	107040	It was particularly framed with regard to recent debates that were happening in the U.S.
107040	111280	and he was saying, wouldn't it be great if we had something, a different kind of practice
111280	115920	that was, if anything, the exact opposite of all the things that are going wrong with
115920	117760	debate.
117760	120200	Just look at it as a form.
120200	122600	It's typically two people.
122600	124240	Historically, they would be male.
124240	125760	Today, they may not be.
125760	131560	And there would be an audience watching these two people flesh something out and very often
131560	135760	there would be a contention or a proposition.
135760	138400	And that gives rise to a contest.
138400	140720	One side has one view, one side has the other view.
140720	143080	You mobilize the arguments to support your view.
143080	145840	You find the counter arguments to your opponent's view.
145840	149160	And of course, there's a great illustrious history to debate.
149160	152760	So when debates are done well, it can be really rather a beautiful thing.
152760	156560	But there are so many things militating against doing it well.
156560	163000	The very architecture of social media is built upon maximizing polarization.
163000	169000	And paradoxically, the way it does that is it unites people in what they're against.
169000	177120	People are looking for that sense of contest, even conquest, even humiliation.
177120	180680	So we want debate to be sort of there as a reference point to ground people in what
180680	181680	this is.
181680	186280	It's a kind of public exploration of any given subject.
186280	188040	But it's empty in the sense of antidote.
188040	204720	It's trying to actually get beyond all the things that we see as being wrong with debate.
204720	209800	I was involved with the anti-debate from almost the very beginning.
209800	220280	My involvement really stemmed from my own long-term question about where is the voice
220280	222480	of the people?
222480	227920	We're living in a socioeconomic political system that really only gives voice to the
227920	233160	people once every five years, and then it only requires them to vote in a choice between
233160	234560	two parties.
234560	242120	What I've always been interested in is this idea that every human being plays a part in
242120	249720	a really colorful and rich tapestry of voices that could add up to something that would
249720	253320	respond holistically to the problems that we are facing today.
253320	259480	What I've just realized is that all my decisions on this are made by my feelings.
259480	264440	We live in a time where we're all exposed to things that we struggle to make sense of,
264840	267160	moments where we can't quite agree with ourselves.
267160	269400	Our values don't always align with our actions.
269400	273560	Our ideas don't always chime with our values, and a lot of what the anti-debate is getting
273560	275920	at is that internal struggle.
275920	278520	It's about finding your own inner center in a relationship.
278520	280640	So what are we trying to achieve at the end of it?
280640	283680	It's not some beautiful middle position in which everyone can agree on.
283680	285960	It's not some consensus verdict.
285960	292760	It's a deeper felt sense of your relationship to the issue of hand.
292760	300680	The anti-debate is a process where you can bring much more of who you are as a human
300680	306520	being, your emotional self, what is important to you spiritually, what you value deeply,
306520	311840	and bring that into a conversation about things that really matter and about issues where
311840	317120	there can be contention, where there can be disagreement and dissonance, and to try and
317120	325240	hold that gracefully in the service of a collective wisdom feels like something we deeply need.
325240	328840	As we go through the process, we are experimenting.
328840	333520	And so while we have a methodology and we've done this before, we're ready for surprises
333520	336160	and we're quite happy for you to help us co-create this.
336160	339880	I feel that for me personally, the anti-debate has really come alive since Evo and Indra
339880	344800	have helped me with it because I've realized we've connected it to democracy a bit more
344800	346040	closely.
346040	350680	This is something about a practice of democracy if it's done well.
350680	353240	I have been a designer.
353240	360160	I have been a participant, a guinea pig you could say, and I've been a host.
360160	364480	And I would say it definitely has a lot of potential because it's fun.
364480	369000	It's engaging, it's challenging, it's all those things.
369000	375600	And because it goes just beyond theory, it goes beyond thought.
375640	382120	That's why I think it has such potential because I don't recall who came up with this quote,
382120	387520	but it's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, think yourself into a new
387520	391120	way of acting, and I believe that is very, very true.
391120	395720	I think peace, we don't really know that much about peace and whether it's interesting
395720	398240	or not because we don't know much about it.
398240	402360	So I would suggest that actually peace is a lot more interesting than violence, it's
402360	404840	just that we actually haven't explored it very much.
404840	408960	Action, arguably, is the true transcendent value in the world, so you have to act, you
408960	414600	have to put yourself on the line, you have to take steps, you have to stand, take a stand
414600	422440	of what it is and see how other people receive you or don't, and either way, this is a kind
422440	428240	of courage to put yourself into a new world.
428240	434320	We managed to put together a funding application with the encouragement actually to the credit
434320	435800	of the John Templeton Foundation.
435800	439600	When I first met somebody there, I spoke to them about it as an idea, there's this thing
439600	443360	called the anti-debate, we don't know what it is yet, we need some time to create it,
443360	447560	we've actually no idea what the practice looks like yet, we want to start trying, and we
447560	451280	may even take a while to get to public engagement because until you know what you're doing there's
451280	454920	no point in putting something out there that's just not yet formed.
454920	459640	So the first few anti-debate practice sessions were six people gathering together and we'd
459640	466600	often practice with two people together, choosing an issue we wanted to be somehow contentious.
466600	471920	So the early stages were quite interesting in terms of the one-on-one activity was not
471920	476600	without its value, we learned something about what it was to inhabit another point of view,
476600	480920	but mostly it was slightly underwhelming, it had this feeling of this is not the call,
480920	486320	the anti-debate had its own kind of agenda, its own kind of source energy, most contexts
486320	492080	are not two people, most organizational contexts, most political parties, most communities,
492080	497800	any given electoral system, invariably multiple layers of interest.
497800	504480	So the evolution of the anti-debate was something about recognizing that the one-on-one conversation
504480	510960	while it still had its place wasn't necessarily our touchstone, and there might also be something
510960	515440	about the way the world is evolving that makes it less and less likely that one-on-one will
515520	516520	work.
516520	521360	There's something about social media that's changed from being mere consumers of kind
521360	525320	of information and knowledge to actually what they sometimes call prosumers, you know, we're
525320	528160	actually creating and consuming at the same time.
528160	534680	So most people who inhabit an online space will have a political view or a view of any
534680	538920	given contentious issue, and they'll also be observing views coming in and they'll be
538920	540960	relating to them in various ways.
540960	547440	In that context, watching two people thrash it out is not nearly as interesting as a larger
547440	551360	plural encounter with lots of different views on where they come from.
551360	555400	So we began to think that rather than doing it one-on-one, we needed to set up a process
555400	559400	that was a bit more collective, a bit more plural, a bit more collaborative.
559400	563920	And it was also very clear to me that the anti-debate was a quintessentially offline
563920	568960	activity because it's much more interested in the role of the body, the role of somatic
568960	573240	data, what's happening in your body as part of what's going on in an argument.
573240	579800	One innovation we had was tabloid, where you would show in space your view of the question
579800	581640	at hand or issue at hand.
581640	583640	Agree, disagree.
583640	589680	But I'm going to ask the room to speak to itself.
589680	594920	Just an observation in myself that I notice that when I move to a position, the first
594920	598800	thing I kind of almost unconsciously do is kind of say, who's in my community?
598800	599800	Hello, Heli.
599800	602920	It's nice to see you there, just noticing that.
602920	606920	So one of the main ways to move beyond debate was the question.
606920	610160	Debate the question is given to you and you may or may not like it.
610160	615040	There's a power struggle in the very question and about what should we be talking about
615040	616400	here and why.
616400	620120	And we felt that needed to be part of the method.
620120	623920	How are you feeling about what you're hearing in relation to your question about is fear
623920	625760	ever useful?
625760	629680	It feels related, but it does feel quite separate, or rather it feels like there's a hearing
629680	630680	or a polarity here.
630680	634960	I'm tired of not seeing women in all of the powerful institutions.
634960	639400	I'm tired of women not being acknowledged as voices.
639400	642400	I'm tired of old women being made invisible.
642400	647880	I'm tired of girls being conditioned to become passive with toys.
647880	648880	I'm tired.
648880	651280	I'm just tired of so many things.
651280	654120	Is masculinity the problem, serve hands?
654560	656640	Okay, we have a question now.
656640	659720	You have completed the first stage of the anti-debate.
659720	662640	We didn't know what we were going to talk about 15 minutes ago.
662640	663760	Now we do.
663760	667760	And so this would move on to the next phase is what we sometimes call the question bomb,
667760	672320	which is that within any good given question, there would be millions of other questions
672320	673440	nested within it.
673440	678200	So for example, one question we had along the way was, is war natural?
678200	681440	That's a good example of a question that needs to be disaggregated.
681440	682440	What is war?
682440	683440	What is natural?
683440	684440	How do we decide what is natural?
684440	687880	What do we what do we imply when we call something natural?
687880	690880	How do we make a distinction between war and conflict?
690880	694440	And it's not for one single authority to answer them.
694440	697280	It's for the room to know that these questions are alive.
697280	701360	And next we'd often have something about thrashing it out.
701360	703520	So we'd say what we feel about this.
703520	706400	We were quite early on keen to get the feelings, right?
706400	708080	This is a very important part of the anti-debate.
708200	712600	And that felt like I was having something taken away from me.
712600	719080	And I don't choose to believe that it exists, but in an individual sense, I don't choose
719080	720840	to give over my power.
720840	725280	It's just not true that human beings are primarily rational creatures, right?
725280	726880	Yes, we have reason.
726880	730960	Yes, we're capable of great rational prowess when the time comes.
730960	737160	But underlying it all, there are these deep feelings of threat perception and anger and
737160	742880	fear and maybe resentment and a kind of identity protection going on.
742880	746280	These are all baked in to any given public conversation.
746280	749000	Our job in the anti-debate is to make them a part of it.
749000	752400	So we're less subject to them and they become more like an object of inquiry that we can
752400	754280	begin to explore together.
754280	757040	Sometimes we succeeded, sometimes we fail, but that's what we're trying to do.
757040	758560	Well, it's very short, really.
758560	761240	I think this is a human-centered question.
761240	766720	And I would like to think that we think beyond the human and natural refers to the whole
766800	768800	of creation.
768800	771640	OK, one more question relating to this.
771640	776560	Thinking and feeling are both the same and different.
776560	779480	If you agree with that statement, go here.
779480	783440	If you disagree, you're here.
783560	784480	Who loved the moon?
784480	785280	Who felt great?
785280	788680	And now we're getting somewhere, right?
788880	793080	I was standing in the middle and I didn't feel, you know, I could go to the end of the room
793080	796360	and then you say something like that and I'm like, great, that's exactly where I was.
796560	803040	The fact that the emotion has a legitimate place in the anti-debate, for me, that was a big thing.
803040	808840	I think this idea that reason and emotion are different parts of cognition and they
808840	814280	don't really have a way of working well together, I think it's really outmoded.
814280	819840	We really have to learn to bring our emotion in the way we deal with people in the right way.
819840	828400	This is why these sorts of opportunities to hone your skill, your cognition can be quite helpful.
828400	831120	So for me, I found it quite revelatory.
831120	832760	It was a thrilling experience.
834480	840680	Throughout the anti-debate, we're also very keen to keep in mind the critical mass of people
840960	842920	who just couldn't give a damn, right?
842920	845320	Certain number of people who are like, this is not for me.
845520	847720	I don't particularly want to talk about this.
847720	848720	They're not going anywhere.
848760	853880	They're part of our world and we need the process to somehow acknowledge them and bring them in
853880	859800	when the time's right because they sort of help to help us to get in perspective,
859800	862160	whether what we're doing is really the right thing.
862560	868040	And over here, still, are the people who felt they couldn't get behind these positions.
868840	876880	And we'd actually like you now to be another group.
877320	880360	That's why we chose the name and the process to call you the enigmatics.
881080	884280	People that we don't actually know really what they think and feel.
884280	885680	They know what they think and feel.
886040	889560	As part of the group in that first anti-debate, they called the enigmatics.
890000	894600	There was a good 15, 20 of us who were just sort of sitting toward the back of the room,
894960	902120	watching this all play out and feeling really just sort of disillusioned, disenfranchised,
904000	906360	disenchanted with the process.
906600	910520	Which I thought was really interesting because I think that's really reflective of what happens in society.
910680	917000	These people are always in the room and they're always in your community and they're always in the public space.
917640	924520	So I'm just going to invite you for a second to hear from the people on this side over here.
926480	933560	Well, kind of standing behind that, but feeling reluctant to move into a new group.
934480	940520	For the same reason I don't join a political party, although I vote.
941520	944360	Because I'm kind of thinking, where's the empathy?
944640	951280	How are we going to shift into empathy where we can sit down with people we really disagree with?
951800	973160	I pull back from the project because I think that that sense of being before what's not known actually takes the development of quite deep relationships between the participants in a debate.
973720	980760	And so bringing two people together for an evening or an evening afternoon when they don't know each other before.
981480	1002160	And maybe you're coming together because they feel they're on opposite sides, cultivating the sense of trust and not just in each other, actually, but faith that being mistaken or being exposed to a wider or alternative view point that that can be good for you.
1002640	1007200	I just felt that we didn't really get to grips with that. We didn't quite know how to bring that about.
1007960	1027440	I think one of the main challenges has been moving from theory into practice. There are a lot of really good intellectual ideas, concepts, frameworks, but when you move that into live practice with warm bodies, it's difficult, and there's a different skill set that's required.
1027880	1032320	It's much more important to focus on the relational.
1033320	1041680	Okay, the answer debate. Where's it going? What's it for? Who's it for? What are we trying to achieve? It always had this feeling, like throughout it, we were like, what the hell are we doing?
1042680	1049120	We're making this up as we go along. Why does it feel that we have to do this? And yet we don't know what we're doing, right?
1050160	1060280	It's something to do with, you could say, listening to the future at some level, being pulled along by a certain pattern that is implicit and you're trying to make it a little bit more explicit.
1061240	1075680	So the evolution of the anti-debate, that point we began to feel, we were missing a little bit of the initial contest. The binary gives you a kind of oscillating energy between two forces that can be quite compelling when it's done well, right?
1075680	1082920	After a while, we didn't want it to collapse into dialogue, right? So we introduced this innovation. We call it swarming near the end.
1083920	1100360	And that's where, after you've taken some time with the question, to first of all decide on what you want to share together, and by the way, there's a little voting process for that, where people drop out when they feel the question is not theirs, then you begin to feel the group physically stands around the question they want to go with.
1100360	1109880	We do that, and then there's a certain amount of time exploring the question, then an engagement with the underlying issues and values in the question, a certain amount of representation of the diversity in the room.
1110840	1127840	Once you've done all that, there's still this issue of answer what? How can this practice actually in some way focus your mind, actually clarify what's at stake? So what we build up to towards the end is people showing not just their opinion, but their moral and political commitment.
1127840	1129840	And this is called taking a stand.
1129840	1134840	I stand for virtue, cultivation, internally and externally.
1134840	1138840	Effectively, what's going on here is you're trying to recruit people. You're trying to attract them.
1139800	1147800	Embodied resistance is with your body. It's not something outside of you. So it's about the earth reflecting into your body and awakening the inner movement of politics.
1147800	1150800	Okay, who's moving? Who's moving towards Dominique?
1154800	1167800	I think it's so interesting that I can't speak about it as if it's a static thing. The words that want to come to me is like organism. I don't want to call it a project. I want to find some term for it that speaks to its sort of living essence.
1168760	1182760	Because I think that's part of its magic and its potential. And also why it's still frustrating to people. Because it's not something that you're necessarily going to come out of with a 12 step action plan.
1182760	1193760	I'm wondering if anyone here is going to make any difference in their lives or the way they act as a result of this. And depending on the outcome of that, is that what this was designed to do?
1194720	1206720	Or is this process more like maybe a religious experience or maybe a really good psychedelic trip where it kind of works through you over the coming months and years without you really realising it's somewhere deep inside?
1206720	1216720	It felt really alive as a process. Sometimes these things can be quite city downy talky talky. But it felt a lot more, yeah, a different energy to that. Which I really appreciated.
1217680	1227680	And for me personally, I find myself asking myself some difficult questions, some important questions. I may have left with more questions than I have answers, but in a good way.
1227680	1242680	We all had different takes on the statement. And just through this very short discussion, we were all able to see each other's point and realise that actually we're quite aligned on this even though our focus is on different words in the statement.
1243640	1261640	For me, the most important thing about the anti-debate is that it transforms the tempo at which people speak and also even the kind of personal involvement, let's say. It allows a different register, different levels.
1262600	1272600	I think there's so much benefit for a group to unearth what's live and that they want to have a conversation or maybe there wasn't predetermined.
1272600	1286600	And just the unearthing of unexpected points of view and really tuning into where you might resonate with it or disagree, but we can learn from nature to access our better selves as humans.
1287560	1297560	We're stretching a muscle here and expanding our capacities here, which is really important. I know this is happening in schools, which is absolutely where it needs to be.
1297560	1308560	We brought the process into the schools pretty much exactly as we've been running it with adults. And when we did this, prior to this, we had no idea what was going to happen.
1309520	1317520	We don't know how the young people are going to respond. And so it was a real delight to actually find their engagement with so high with it.
1319520	1330520	That's an age where developmentally young people are figuring out who they are, what they care about, what they stand for, what they believe, and also making sense of the world.
1331480	1339480	And so the anti-debate is a kind of process where that's really what you're doing. You're getting clarification on what you feel, what you think, what you believe.
1339480	1345480	But you're also experiencing that, exploring that in relationship to what other people's thoughts, values and opinions are.
1345480	1357480	One of the things that's interesting about the anti-debate, as I understand it, is that it's something that many different people have contributed to over its existence.
1358440	1363440	So it's not just one sole author. Lots of people have kind of given their input.
1363440	1372440	So the anti-debate is like a mutt. It's kind of this lovable rogue.
1372440	1375440	And so my hope for the anti-debate is that it actually continues.
1375440	1385440	My hope is that we can find a way to release it into the world and that more and more people can start to iterate upon it and play with it and bring their innovations to it.
1386400	1405400	The anti-debate as a piece of social software, if you like, would be very useful if it was simply available to communities to pick up, to learn the mechanics of and to use for themselves, set their own agenda, set their own tone, set their own pace.
1406360	1416360	I think some of the people, and even my first impression of it, was perhaps like, this is hubris.
1416360	1431360	This is hubris to try and attempt to devise a new form of civic dialoguing, of relating, of coming into conversation about the world and reality.
1431360	1442360	And it is hubristic. It is audacious. And yet it's worth trying. It's worth trying.
1442360	1450360	I do believe that creating new social practices that are worthy of the challenges of our times is a big part of the work.
1450360	1454360	It's not enough to theorize. It's not enough to persuade.
1454360	1461360	You actually have to practice in a way that speaks to and from the challenges that you're writing about, thinking about.
1461360	1472360	It's moving beyond the expectation that a mere idea can change the world. It's the idea enacted socially and culturally that begins to feel more promising.
1484360	1494360	It's not enough to try and devise a new form of civic dialoguing. It's not enough to persuade.
1494360	1500360	It's not enough to persuade. It's not enough to persuade.
1500360	1508360	It's not enough to persuade. It's not enough to persuade.
1508360	1514360	It's not enough to persuade.
1514360	1520360	It's not enough to persuade.
1520360	1526360	It's not enough to persuade.
1526360	1532360	It's not enough to persuade.
1532360	1542360	It's not enough to persuade.
1542360	1552360	It's not enough to persuade.
