0	11360	Welcome. Good to be here. Thank you for coming. My name is Jonathan Rousson. I am Director
11360	19040	of Perspectiva and I have known Ian for 12 years, I realized today, and in that time
19040	25840	come to understand his work, I hope, and certainly enjoyed his work and found a great
25840	29920	deal of importance in it, and we're the very proud publishers of The Matter with Things,
30960	38560	which is an extraordinary book over two volumes, and the paperback has just come out officially
38560	44320	today. So tonight's event is partly a way of marking the, I don't know if it's still a launch
44320	48960	when it happens the second time, but the kind of re-enchantment of the book through the act,
48960	56000	let's say, and Perspectiva, for those who don't know, we think that based on the
56720	60800	data we could receive from who's joining tonight, roughly a third of you are familiar with
60800	67120	Perspectiva, and maybe roughly two-thirds not so much. We are a charity based in London,
67120	73360	although our reach is quite global because of the digital world, and we have staff that are
73360	79840	outside of London as well, and we are funded primarily by the Fetzer Institute in the USA,
80640	84640	and I say that now because that's what makes tonight's event being free possible,
85440	91120	that and an additional funding that we've received, particularly for this event, and
94240	98160	Perspectiva, it's worth just saying a few things about it to contextualize why we're
98160	105200	interested in Ian's book and what the series is about. So we sometimes call ourselves an urgent
105200	111360	100-year project, and it's interesting when you say that. Some people hear the 100 years and think
111360	117440	that's far too long, and the point of saying urgent 100-year project is deliberately to get that
117440	123600	problem of sort of playful paradox being somehow the reality of things, that we think that we do
123600	127920	urgently need to rethink the world, reimagine the world, we conceive the world, but at the same
128000	134640	time, it's not something that is in kind of action panic mode, we're not in the business of
135600	140560	trying to put fires out as such, we're trying to reconceive the world from first principles and
140560	146160	give intellectual permission and social permission to people who want to try to reimagine how the
146160	152560	world might be, not just next year, but in 10 years or in 100 years, and that kind of work often
152640	159280	takes quite a philosophical dimension, but a lot of our work is also applied, we do a lot of
159280	165840	sort of social innovation of various kinds, and of course a publisher, so there's more to say,
165840	170400	but if you'd like to understand perspective a better, someone can put in the chat our website
171760	177200	and do have a look around. Although tonight's event is free, you are very welcome to make a
177200	182000	donation, if you're interested in the work we do already, or if you're becoming interested,
183040	186000	and later after this event, we'll be asking if you want to sign up to our
186640	192080	work and get to know us better, so first of all welcome, and I'm very grateful to Ian for making
192080	202880	it possible to have so many of you here. So this series is called Attention as a Moral Act,
203920	209680	and I want to just draw your attention to a line in the first book here, The Big Tomes,
209680	217200	so it just takes a second to come to it, but Ian, for those of you who don't know Ian's work,
217200	226240	and I'm assuming we're working on the assumption that you mostly do, and he says here, we'll just
226240	233360	find it, yeah, it's not a small claim, Ian says this right at the beginning of the introduction,
234000	241360	I believe we have systematically misunderstood the nature of reality, I believe we have systematically
241360	247760	misunderstood the nature of reality and chosen to ignore or silence the minority of voices
248640	252880	that have ensured it as much and consistently maintained that this is the case.
254160	257600	Now we have reached the point where there is an urgent need to transform
258400	264240	both how we think of the world and what we make of ourselves, attempting to convey such a richer
264240	270160	insight is the ambition of this book, so he sets himself a very high bar that we're systematically
270800	277280	misunderstood, misrepresented reality, and what's interesting for me as a civil society,
277280	282800	leader of a civil society organization is, many people ask how to make Ian's work relevant,
282800	287920	and this is a non-trivial task, as someone who's been alongside it in some way for 12 years,
288720	293520	it's not as simple as because Ian says X, the policy should be Y, it's never that simple,
294720	301360	but Ian's comment there does point to this quality of kind of the need to reconceive
301360	306800	who we are and what we're living for at a very fundamental level, to have a chance of surviving
306800	313600	and thriving in the 21st century and beyond, so the stakes are kind of high, so the combination
313600	319120	of the really high stakes, but often the quite deeply philosophical content makes it a particular
319120	326000	kind of discussion, it's important for me, our job here in this series, is to try to move the
326000	332240	conversation towards people beginning to perceive it and experience it and understand
333040	337840	the view of the world presented in these books in a way that allows them to act differently,
338400	343200	not as kind of premise to conclusion, but as a shift to perception, a kind of metanoia,
343200	348320	sort of completely new frame of mind that allows them to live differently, to prioritize
348320	352720	differently, and so on, so that's what this series is about, and we call it attention as a moral act
353280	358800	to get to that feeling of it matters how you attend to the world, and these books help to explain
359360	365360	both what that means and why, and we're going to have, we already have scheduled for two weeks
365360	370960	time Zach Stein, and then laterally, soon after that, we have Phoebe, Zach Stein will be speaking
370960	376080	about value, value-ception, the notion of value as being something that you can actually perceive,
376080	381600	a very profound notion in Ian's work, Phoebe Tekel will be grappling with imagination,
381600	385440	she's an imagination activist she calls herself, so she'll be interested in the kind of theoretical
385440	392240	basis of her work, Bonito Roy will be speaking about the notion of what it means for a society to be
392240	397200	insane, whether we are in some meaningful sense insane, the book's subtitle, as you may know,
397200	402800	is our brains, our delusions, delusions, sorry, delusions, and the unmaking of the world, so
402800	407840	this notion of what it means to be deluded at scale will be that focus, and then we also have a
407840	413680	discussion on the physics in Ian's book with a physicist, Philip, can you remind me of his second
413680	419600	name? Philip Goyle. Philip Goyle, sorry, Philip Goyle, who will get into the sort of the depth
419600	424720	of the physics that underlies some of Ian's theorizing, so that's ahead, and then we have
424720	431520	another six or so after that, and we want this conversation to go on to try and really tease
431520	438160	out from unusual places what to make of Ian's work, like how does it help us reorient to the
438240	445920	situation of the world at the moment, so that's all going on, and I think I've mentioned everything
445920	452080	essential, so the first question really, I want to speak to Ian tonight about something I call
452080	456800	the McGillchrist manoeuvre, half and jet, totally an earnest, but we're going to come to that a
456800	462560	little bit later, the first thing I want to do really is most people here know Ian as a talking
462560	468160	head, perhaps from Channel McGillchrist, perhaps from a lecture, and they'll know his writings
468160	474560	from his books, but there is an intellectual formation story, you know, Ian sometimes gives
474560	479920	the impression of being a polymath, but it wasn't always thus, and so I'm interested in if you could
479920	488400	please, slowly but surely, yet somewhat quickly, talk us through the key turns of your intellectual
488400	493600	formation, because you appear to have this sort of polymathic erudition, and I suppose I mentioned
493600	504240	doesn't know where it came from. Well, as with all polymathic erudition, it's probably not as
504240	512720	exciting as it looks, but it started in childhood, I was a very, I was kind of a curious child,
512720	518080	and that's probably true as well, and I was interested in many things, my father was a doctor,
518160	524560	but it was mainly my mother's father, my grandfather's interest in science that fired my
524560	530560	imagination as a child, he used to love going to stay with him and being, he showed me many
530560	537920	fascinating things in science, in the workshop, in the garden, and so on, and that made me think,
538720	543440	wow, this is something I really need to know more about, and I suppose that was the general drift
543440	552800	of my intellectual life, until I, at the age of 12, which is of course a very important turning
552800	563760	point for everybody, I got to be at a school where I could explore many things, and I've really
563760	569760	always been philosophically minded, there were a number of things that occurred to me and seemed
569760	577680	terribly important that were different from what everyone taught me, or what everyone seemed to imply
577680	584080	at any rate, and these were things like, that the whole is never the same as the sum of the part,
584080	590240	you know, when I used to say this to people, they'd say, well what is this magical something extra
590240	596080	that goes in there, and at the time I felt, you know, well, that's all very well, but it's not
596080	602720	quite right, but I couldn't articulate it at the time, I can't now I think, and I thought that the
602720	616160	world was not a sort of unresponsive lump of matter, it was a deeply responsive, vibrant,
616160	625600	living, reverberative experience in that whatever it was was a two-way process between
625600	632160	the world around me, particularly the natural world and me, I thought that opposites were not
632160	638400	necessarily as far apart as people seem to think, in fact I started to think that opposites often
639040	643920	seem to coincide and that the further you push something, the more you approach the very thing
643920	650320	you're fleeing from, I thought that history generally seemed to move in spirals, not in a
650320	656960	sort of linear trajectory, and I thought that the general tendency of the analytic mind that
658000	664480	was very much prized in my education, was to take things, abstract them,
666080	673120	decontextualize them, and render them no longer unique and alive, and this was an odd thing,
673120	679280	because doing this was important, it was definitely what we did, and I seem to be good at it,
679280	685680	but I also thought this is not enough, and then, I ultimately-
685680	691440	Your thoughts are arising when you're 12, or is that rather when they began to?
691440	697920	No, I would say probably about 13 or 14, and what happened at the school I was at,
697920	705280	Winchester College, was that you did your own levels in the first term, or at least by the end
705280	710000	of the third term, the end of the first year, so at age 12, when I got one's own levels out of the
710000	717440	way, and the rest of the time was free to really explore many things, and there were three strands
717440	724640	to it, one was a science ladder, one was a humanities, i.e. the history and languages,
724640	729440	and the other was the classics, and everybody had to, whatever they chose as their special area,
729440	734560	they all had to do a hard core that never drops things like mathematics, history,
735600	742320	English, and so forth, and I started off, in short, by jumping onto the science ladder,
742320	746960	because that seemed to me the thing that was most interesting, and I very quickly found as my
748000	755440	mind unfolded in this, and as I became slightly more of a mature person than I was at 12,
755440	762800	that things like history and literature were vastly important, so I hopped at that one,
762800	770800	and then finally I hopped to the classics, so that rather unusually, I managed to straddle
770800	775200	all three of these things, I've never been able to seem to make up my mind about what it is I
775200	781920	particularly want to specialize in, and then I wanted to go to Oxford to study philosophy,
782000	790880	and particularly the kind of philosophy that was not the terrifically dry splitting of hairs,
790880	795840	but the kind of philosophy that saw into the depths of things and had a place in it for the
795840	801440	idea of a god, because I came from a god, I can put it this way, from a godless household,
801440	806880	I mean one in which we never went to church, my parents didn't talk about that kind of thing,
807600	816560	to being in my teens struck by the force of what one can only call the sacred in nature,
816560	825040	in music, in art, and in the fellowship and community in which I lived, so I was changing
825040	830960	at that point, but I'd always wanted to do philosophy, and as I say I was excited because
830960	835520	in Oxford there was a course called philosophy and theology, which was just what I wanted to do,
835520	841280	so I did the exam and I went up for interviews, and I had to do the exam in some school subject
841280	846080	which just happened to be English literature, and the people who interviewed me said, oh you can't
846080	852400	do philosophy and theology, it's not an honours degree, so in 1971 philosophy and theology was
852400	857760	not even an honours degree at Oxford, there's a simple reason it had only just been founded,
857760	864160	and I don't think it had had time to acquire that status, but they said instead you must do PPE,
864240	869120	philosophy, politics, and economics, and I'm sorry to say this to somebody like Hugh Jonathan
869120	875280	who's learned and excited by both philosophy and by both politics and economics, I'm not
875280	880880	particularly, and I wanted the other thing, and they said well look, I don't want to do that,
880880	884640	so they said well come and do literature because it's quite philosophical if you want it to be,
885200	892080	and so I did, I read English literature, after I got my degree I was then
892400	899440	encouraged to sit the exam for Old Souls College which is an odd college, it doesn't have any
899440	906160	students, not graduates, not any kind of students, it's really just a kind of an intellectual
906160	911440	hot house for people who can be assumed to be somewhere near the head of their game,
911440	916000	and it was a very exciting seven years I had there, when I arrived there.
916000	919760	I was thinking before the seven, before you got admission, I want to pause there because I happen
919760	925040	to know something that's of interest to the audience maybe, I took the exam myself I believe
925040	934240	in 2001 and did not pass, but I do remember the, at that time had one of the five papers being a
934240	939760	single word essay question, and the one was diversity which is quite curious given the
939760	947440	current world, but what's also curious is I believe yours was on evil, and do you remember
947440	949760	what you said about evil that got you admission to Old Souls?
951520	957600	Well I wouldn't have remembered, but a philosopher Derek Parfit was a colleague who was so
958720	964320	taken with that essay that I wrote that he photocopied it, and when I became a fellow he gave
964320	969840	it to me, so somewhere in a box in the attic if I could ever find it, there is that essay.
972080	976240	I was alarmed because I sat in this room with I suppose 20 people,
976240	981840	we were competing for at maximum two fellowships, and very often one or none were appointed,
982880	989200	and in the room people started to write after five or ten minutes, and I sat there and I was sort of
989200	993600	thinking half an hour went by, I could see everyone scribbling, I still wasn't writing,
993600	1000720	three quarters of an hour went by, and finally at two hours I was just so, if you like wired,
1000720	1011040	I just thought I've got to write, and I just did in that hot fire of the pressure of time.
1011600	1018640	Anyway that was that, it's an extraordinary exam, I hope it's not too different these days,
1018640	1022800	it seems to me to be able to try and take in people who are not just very good at their
1022800	1028400	special thing, but actually can think broadly about many topics, say there were general papers.
1028400	1032640	It was you who told me and that they did away with the one word question in the exam.
1032640	1034480	I think they have done, I think they have.
1035040	1038960	The quality had decreased so much that they weren't sure it was worthwhile.
1039920	1043760	I don't know if that's the case, I think that was the case with the language, there was a language
1044640	1050320	where you just had to translate as many pieces as you could in three hours from Greek, Latin,
1050320	1057440	German, Spanish, French, Russian, and Italian, I think it was. Anyway, I think they stopped doing
1057440	1061680	that, I'm sorry about the essay because I think it was a real test of something,
1063280	1070880	a kind of ability to think broadly and differently. But they do still have, I think,
1070880	1076720	the special subject papers alongside general papers, so you could, it doesn't matter what
1076720	1081520	subjects you're taking the exam in, you have to answer some general questions. Anyway,
1081600	1088880	there it was. And when I got to all servers, I had planned to do a thesis on 18th century
1090560	1096480	literature and ideas, the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism.
1097040	1104800	But a number of people, but most vocally, again, Derek Parfit, a very, very considerable
1104800	1109120	philosopher, I think by most people considered the greatest philosopher of his generation,
1109120	1113440	had started as a historian. And he said to me, you don't know where you may want to go,
1114480	1119120	don't do that, you've been given something very special, you can do a doctorate at any college,
1119120	1124080	but you've been given seven years in which you can do anything and there'll be no questions asked,
1124080	1131920	you can read what you like. So I did, I spent that time doing a lot of things, I read a lot of
1131920	1137840	science, of course, but I also read philosophy, went to philosophy seminars and other things,
1138320	1145040	I found myself a Russian teacher and so on. So that just generally broadened my horizons.
1145040	1149680	But I began to think at the end of this, what am I going to do next? I don't want to just
1149680	1154960	to go into some sort of normal academic rut. There's something wrong with the way we studied
1154960	1161120	literature. And I wrote a book called Against Criticism, published by Faber in 1982, in which
1161120	1167840	I laid out the philosophical basis for why the academic study of literature is somehow
1167840	1173200	vitiated, it destroys the very thing it's trying to get hold of. Anyway, I won't go into that,
1173200	1180480	except to say that in brief, I thought there were three important things about, say, a poem,
1180480	1184640	was that somebody in the past wrote something that they thought was very meaningful and
1184640	1189840	important, so important that they poured some very, you know, they suffered in order to produce
1189920	1197040	this thing. And along we came with our clever, sneering attitudes from the 20th century and sort
1197040	1204560	of encouraged to deconstruct it in a certain way. But more importantly, what happened was that we
1204560	1211200	abstracted something that was deeply contextual and embodied. We generalized something that was
1211200	1221200	unique. And we lost the sense of the living thing that we were looking at that is unique,
1222000	1229440	embodied, and implicit. And in the process of analyzing it, we'd taken this importantly implicit
1229440	1237440	material out and made it explicit. And that's as deadly as explaining a joke, explaining a poem
1237440	1244480	is, you know, death to the poem. So I wanted to move on and I got very interested in this
1244480	1249600	issue, what was wrong, and it struck me that it was to do with the mind body problem that we
1249600	1255840	neglected the body. And I was familiar with the philosophers, I went to their seminars and
1255840	1259840	heard what they had to say about the mind body problem. But it seemed to me they were just too
1259840	1266560	disembodied in their approach. And so I thought I not to do something more embodied about this.
1266560	1272560	And at that time, Oliver Sacks had just published Awakenings, which was one of the many sort of
1272560	1280880	real milestones in my intellectual development. Because here was somebody who related illness to
1280880	1287600	an analysis of what we are when we are well and healthy, who related what was going on for an
1287600	1293920	individual person, beautifully realized in his text. And he was able to see in it,
1293920	1300640	general truth, general philosophical truths through that highly individual vignette.
1301280	1307680	And that most of what he was saying was actually in the footnotes, it was as implicit as it could
1307680	1312880	be. So anyway, I thought, well, I want to be somebody like Oliver Sacks. And that meant going
1312880	1319200	to medical school and learning neurology and going into psychology in the overlap area between
1319200	1323520	neurology and psychology. So I did that. I became a doctor.
1323520	1327120	So still down to some words for a second, just because you seem to be saying two things there.
1327120	1331840	One is, in a very real sense, your first book on literary criticism prefigured the master
1331840	1336320	in his emissary that came much later. There was a sort of very clear overlap and the kind of
1336320	1342400	concerns you had. Yes. Which even went back to my my adolescence at school. Yes.
1342400	1347920	Right. And the second thing is that there's a very clear figure of admiration that sort of
1347920	1353040	propelled you forward into a way of looking at the person scientifically and philosophically.
1355200	1360480	I want to make sure we've been a number of days. Yes. Now, I'm worried about just taking up too
1360480	1365920	much time. It's worthwhile because people don't know these my senses. They don't know these things.
1365920	1373040	And it's good to work in the land. So then you go to medical school and later become a psychiatrist
1373040	1378160	and particularly Baltimore, right? And their brain scan things happen.
1379280	1383840	That's right. But perhaps just before that, I should say that I was at the Maudsley Hospital
1383840	1390480	in London, the Bethelman Maudsley Hospital, which is a great British teaching hospital.
1390480	1394480	They would like to think the greatest British teaching hospital in that area.
1395760	1401040	And I heard a lecture there one day by a man called John Cutting, who became another
1401120	1405760	influential figure for me. He'd just published a book called The Right Hemisphere and Psychiatric
1405760	1414160	Disorders with O.P. Oxford. And anyway, I almost didn't go to this lecture, but thank God I did.
1414160	1418160	Because in it, he talked about the differences between the hemispheres, which are nothing like
1418160	1425040	what I'd heard in the pop psychology stuff that is all too widely or used to be all too widely
1425040	1432160	believed. I think I've done something to erode that now. But what he was saying was that the
1432160	1438320	left hemisphere doesn't seem to be able to understand what is implicit. It understands what is explicit.
1438320	1447600	So it doesn't get tone of voice, humor, metaphor, irony, sarcasm, facial expression, bodily posture,
1447600	1452240	all the ways in which we communicate meaning. Secondly, it tends to categorize. So it takes
1452240	1457840	the unique thing and it categorizes it so that the uniqueness is lost. It becomes a representative
1457840	1463200	of a type. And the third thing that I remember, but so relevant, was of saying the right hemisphere
1463200	1468640	is literally more in touch with our embodied being for a number of reasons. I don't need to
1468640	1475280	mention, but to do with its more rich connections to the limbic system and its relationships to the
1475280	1483200	hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. Anyway, that fascinated me. I went to talk to John afterwards,
1483200	1489600	and I then began some research on hemisphere differences. And then I went to Baltimore,
1489600	1496720	and I was able to join a research group in which people were looking at hemisphere differences.
1496720	1506320	This was very exciting for me. And I became involved in researching into the abnormal
1507520	1513200	symmetry or asymmetry in the brains of people with schizophrenia. So in the normal brain,
1513200	1518480	there is a reliable finding that the left hemisphere is broader and bigger towards
1518480	1524000	the back and the right hemisphere broader and bigger towards the front. But in schizophrenia,
1524000	1530000	this is often either absent or actually reversed. And interestingly, the very parts that get
1530720	1540000	affected by this are the parts that underwrite some of our most important capacities for making
1540000	1545120	sense of the world. They're what's called hetermodal association cortex, particularly the
1545120	1551920	dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and parts of the cingulate.
1551920	1558880	So these things are very important, and they are abnormal in this condition. And that was
1558880	1563120	terribly exciting. I was able to map these things and take part in research into it.
1563680	1569360	But I also, at the same time, received an excited message from John Cutting saying,
1570080	1577760	you must read a certain book. It's absolutely essential to everything you and I are concerned
1577760	1585680	about. And it was Louis Sass's book Madness and Modernism. And its subtitle is Insanity in the
1585680	1591920	Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought. And this extraordinary book, extraordinarily clearly
1591920	1598080	and beautifully written, is the product of a mind that was able to range over many things,
1598080	1605440	over literature, over philosophy, obviously, over psychology, and over the visual arts.
1605440	1611040	And what he seemed to show was about 20 to 25 aspects of modernism, if you like, the culture
1611040	1618800	of the 20th century, mainly, and postmodernism that overlapped with elements in the experience
1618800	1625600	of subjects with schizophrenia. And I kind of knew this, as soon as I read, of course, of course,
1625600	1630960	it was really the most beautiful moment at which something happened to me that people say happens
1630960	1636480	when they tell me now, when they read my work, which is kind of, of course, I've sort of realized
1636480	1641840	this, but had no way of articulating it. Anyway, I mean, obviously, it couldn't be that we'd all
1641840	1648400	suddenly got schizophrenia, we haven't. But what seems to have happened is that we have ignored
1648960	1654960	the input of the left hemisphere, people with left hemisphere overdrive or right hemisphere
1654960	1660800	deficits, look at the world very much in the way that people with schizophrenia do, they become
1660880	1666240	frankly deluded. And that's why the word delusions is important in the subtitle of the book, The
1666240	1673520	Matterway Things, because I really believe that we are now in a world in which we have lost touch
1673520	1679360	with what the right hemisphere could have told us, and we are becoming deluded about what we are,
1679360	1687200	what the world is like, and so on. So that is some of my intellectual evolution. All these
1687280	1694080	influences were very important. And I spent the next, I suppose, 20 years writing The Master and
1694080	1700320	His Emistry. So that really takes you up to the beginning of that one.
1700320	1704160	So okay, great. Thank you. Well, I hope that was useful for people. It certainly is for me.
1705600	1710080	And like you said, that takes you up to the publication of The Master and His Emistry,
1710080	1713200	which I believe it took about 20 years to write, although you were working at the same time, I
1713200	1721120	suppose. I was working about 55, 60 hours a week at the time. And it only took me 10 years
1721120	1726080	to write the longer book The Matterway Things, but I was writing full time.
1727120	1732640	You also, yeah, okay. And so then The Master and His Emistry came out to mostly
1733360	1739040	critical acclaim, although some critical, some critical aspects of that too, but mostly acclaim.
1740000	1747360	And then a documentary was made about your work by Vanessa Dillon. And you've been on shows with,
1747360	1754720	I don't know, John Cleese and, you know, various other people that are very well known household
1754720	1762160	names. How do you, you feel fulfilled in? Do you feel like you're like at a personal level,
1762160	1763600	you've done your work in this world?
1764560	1772560	That's an interesting thing. I think the answer is I can't help being
1774000	1783120	delighted, touched, and filled with a sense of, yes, of something having gone right. When people
1783760	1787840	tell me what my work means to them, that is the important thing. And it's not,
1787840	1792640	yes, I've been on all the chat shows and I've met the various people, but it's,
1792720	1796800	it's actually when people, individual people that I didn't know, write to me
1797840	1803280	in the loveliest terms, saying what a difference it has made to their life, not just to their
1803280	1809200	intellectual life, their thinking, but also to their, to their relationships, to their work,
1809200	1813360	to everything. And that is, I think is the thing that fulfills me. That is the moment,
1813360	1817200	that is when I say, okay, it's, it's all worthwhile.
1817520	1824640	Okay. So I can tell you why, what it means to me. Now, it's a good segue to get to what I felt
1824640	1830080	recently. So as you know, Ian, I read the entire manuscript of the matter with things,
1830800	1837040	including all of the appendices and notes, which all inclusive, I believe, comes to,
1837040	1841360	quite close to a million words, if not actually there, when you factor in absolutely everything.
1842720	1846720	And I read quite a lot of it on train journeys. I think I said in the launch party of the event that
1847520	1853200	it was a time when I knew I had to interview you about the book. And I was struggling to read with
1853200	1858800	my job and family, just finding the time to, to read it. So I actually created excuses to go up
1858800	1863200	and down to Scotland a few times to meet extended family and made it sound like it was all about
1863200	1867600	them. And it was, I was also getting myself chunks of five hours each way to read the book.
1868400	1874720	Anyway, while, while reading it, I noticed something that kept recurring. And it was as if
1875440	1883440	it was a musical note that you hear come into a song every so often. And at the time, I couldn't
1883440	1889360	quite place it, but we spoke a bit about it when I was on Sky. And it had a certain kind of pattern
1889360	1894720	to it that I've laterally called the McGillchrist maneuver. And since then, I've been reading the
1894720	1899520	book more closely. And I think the heart of the McGillchrist maneuver in so far as it means something
1900480	1907840	is, is the primary hypothesis of the, what you call the hemispheric hypothesis,
1908400	1916080	which is broadly the, the brain functioning well, presencing, allowing the world to presence
1916080	1924880	itself to our own kind of appraisal and perception, then a kind of imperceptible shift towards left
1924880	1932000	to sort of make sense, categorize, and understand, then I sort of shift back to the right, no longer
1932000	1937520	quite the same for having received the input of the left. So the first McGillchrist maneuver is a
1937520	1944160	kind of right, left, right of that form. But then there's a more subtle one, which is a little bit
1944160	1951440	more analytical sounding, but it's very useful for public conversations, because you hear a lot of
1951440	1956560	people saying, you know, you're thinking in a two binary manner, it's not either or it's both and,
1956560	1962800	right? There's a very common refrain, you hear it a lot in sort of popular culture even. And,
1963440	1967680	what your argument suggests, and you're not probably the first to say this, but you say it
1967680	1973360	particularly well, and it falls out of the hypothesis as well, is that it's not so much that it's
1973360	1980640	either or or both and it's in some meaningful sense, either or and both and, but not to the same
1980640	1986640	extent, right? And that's the kind of like it's many layers of subtlety on that. But you begin to
1986640	1993120	see this in several different parts of the book. And where the heartland of that maneuver lies,
1993120	2000080	the kind of source code of it is in chapter 20. Chapter 20 of the book, I can say to people
2000080	2006080	watching this is the business. If you want to read one chapter of your fundamental work,
2006080	2010480	honestly, and you think if you've got a glimpse of the argument in general terms already is most
2010480	2015440	of you have, either from the prior book or just watching a video or whatever, I think you can
2015440	2020320	understand chapter 20 by itself without much other information. You need to know something
2020320	2027280	about the hypothesis, but not that much. Chapter 20 for me is like the hinges on the door between
2027280	2031920	the sort of scientific and philosophical appraisal and the sort of cultural implications.
2031920	2038160	And for those who don't know, chapter 20 is rendered into simple English as the coincidence
2038160	2044960	of opposites. But the word coincidence, as Ian points out in the book, has somewhat been tainted.
2046000	2053280	But nonetheless, so you use the Latin, I guess, coincidence. How do you say it? Coincidence
2053280	2061760	here? That's the one, right? Thank you. And this is really a beautiful, beautiful chapter.
2062400	2067920	Because I think that if people who are on a slightly more applied side of things, working in
2067920	2072320	stable society organizations concerned about climate change, interested in how the arts can
2072320	2078400	influence culture and thereby influence behavior or whatever. In chapter 20, I think we see
2079440	2086560	a shift in perception that is really generative of a different way of viewing the world and acting
2086560	2094640	in it. And I say this, knowing that earlier in the book, in the first volume, you begin the
2094640	2100320	book by targeting reductionism. Reductionism is kind of the public enemy number one in the first
2100320	2106880	part of the book. And I think more precisely, reductive materialism. And you make a very strong
2106880	2111680	case on that, and that stands on its own terms, and it has its own validity and so on. But I think
2111680	2117200	actually for people in the public realm, trying to fight against reductionism with something more
2117200	2121920	holistic of the kind you offer, is not necessarily as powerful as
2122160	2126960	recognising this McGilchrist maneuver in chapter 20. Because what happens there is, the enemy there is
2126960	2133680	not so much reductionism. It's actually the law of non-contradiction. And the law of non-contradiction
2133680	2139920	basically says, you know, it can't be night and day, that you can't be right and wrong, it can't
2139920	2147440	be black and white. And this chapter basically says, actually it can. And in many, many meaningful
2148400	2154160	senses, not only can it be this, but this is the beating heart of reality. These opposites that
2154160	2160000	are in some kind of meaningful relationship with each other actually are closer to the heart of
2160000	2165600	things than the law of non-contradiction would ever be. And if I could just read a few of the
2167760	2174880	statements you make, for example, you speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality.
2174880	2180960	I'll just get my notebook which fell under the table, one second. You speak about, yeah, you
2180960	2186960	speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality. You speak about the
2189520	2195120	unity of unity and multiplicity. And you also speak somewhere very profoundly, this is the
2195120	2199840	thing I want to ask you about now, because it relates back to your also's essay on evil indirectly,
2200800	2208800	is you speak about the equal necessity but unequal status of spiritual opposites.
2210960	2215760	And this is where you're getting at, it comes from the myth that you begin the second volume with,
2216400	2221680	but it also speaks to the perennial battle between good and evil. And again, the McGillchrist maneuver
2221680	2227040	here is very valuable, because what you seem to be saying is it's not that it's the world's either
2227040	2233280	good or bad, it's not either or, it's not that it's simply that it's good and bad, that's not
2233280	2240320	quite right either, it's that it's good and bad and it's somewhat more good than bad for particular
2240320	2245040	reasons. That's how I, at least that's how I read it, so please stop. How do you see it?
2247360	2253040	Well, I suppose the first thing to say is to anybody who hasn't read the book, I'm not sure,
2253040	2257760	apart from really in that opening myth, which is just absolutely staggering, which is
2257760	2263840	something I learned about, comes from an Iroquois people called the Onondaga.
2265600	2272800	And it's unfortunately too long to go into now, but it is the most stunning introspective
2272800	2277120	understanding of how the right and left hemispheres work together, that's the way I would look at it.
2277680	2283120	I don't really talk about the spiritual much. I address that in the last chapter,
2283120	2290240	28, because I don't want to lose my audience along the way, and I know how all the misconceptions
2290240	2296720	that surround the idea of the spiritual, the divine and the sacred will lose people,
2296720	2301600	but I want very strongly to show them that if they follow where I've been and you see the world in
2301600	2306640	a different way, there's nothing that's irrational or unintelligent about embracing
2307120	2312800	this idea. There's something very important about it. And I do, yes, I do in that chapter,
2312800	2319360	chapter 28, at the end of the book, I do briefly talk about the nature of evil, but it's just a
2319360	2326000	very personal thing. I can't believe the idea that evil is simply a kind of
2327920	2333440	lessening or falling away of good. I think it has its own dynamism. I think it's real and to be
2333440	2338880	reckoned with. And I think that this is part of the whole picture of the cosmos, which is that
2338880	2347760	there are different drives, if you like, that are both needed. And the intellect may try and get rid
2347760	2355040	of one or diminish one, but actually, that's just cheating. And so when I talk about the
2355040	2361840	coincidence of opposites, and I use the Latin term coincidentiopositorum simply because it was
2361840	2367680	the way in which it was first talked about by Nicholas of Cusa, a very interesting philosophical,
2367680	2375280	scientific-minded cardinal in the 15th century, and by Jung, who I think is enormously important here.
2377040	2382400	And as a psychiatrist, I can vouch that, you know, however good you think you are,
2382400	2387440	there is a dark side. And that dark side is very important and recognizing it is enormously
2387520	2393600	important. The failure to recognize it and understand it leads to damage, destruction,
2395280	2402400	and disease. And so it's a hugely important thing for each of us individually, but also
2402400	2408720	for a society as a whole, to realize that in pursuing headlongs, a very simple goal that
2408720	2414000	looks you perfectly good, you're destroying all kinds of other things that may be very important.
2414000	2418560	And if you push it too far, you may actually achieve the very opposite of what you intend.
2418560	2427040	I mean, a very obvious case of this is that anarchy leads to tyranny. So we need, what I'm
2427040	2431760	definitely not saying is, and people might say, oh, well, if he's saying something about the
2431760	2435520	coincidence of opposites, doesn't that leave us unable to say anything about anything? Because
2435520	2440160	really, anything and its opposites are true. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that context
2440240	2446720	greatly matters. And that these things share in some important way, their qualities.
2447680	2455760	So we need not, in fact, to reach, we must essentially never reach the position where we've
2456480	2464000	abolished both of these and just substituted some warm mediocre soup somewhere in the middle.
2464000	2470800	My point is, we need to hold both of these realities maximally, and yet hold them together.
2471520	2477120	And this is beautifully imaged in a whole range of ways in the philosophy of Heraclitus,
2477120	2481280	pre-Socratic philosopher, for me, most important philosopher in the West anyway,
2481280	2487120	that ever lived. And he has this image of a loop string or a lyre string,
2488160	2493600	and also the string of a bow that shoots an arrow. And his point is that it needs to be
2493600	2499200	pulled in opposite directions. And it's very nature, it's very power to do anything at all,
2499200	2505920	to give a note, to let the arrow fly comes from that tension being held. Now, that is what we,
2505920	2514000	that is one of the many things we don't perceive. We also don't perceive that reality has this
2514000	2518560	circular spiral like me, I prefer spiral light, because in fact, it doesn't circle back to where
2518560	2523520	it was. It circles back to somewhere that seems rather like it, but is now higher up the spiral
2523760	2530000	because things have happened, time has moved on. But that is an ancient image too, you know,
2530000	2535280	empedically, it's thought that love and strife are the two elements that cause the world.
2535840	2542160	And it's there in many philosophies around the world. We can't do away with one and just have
2542160	2547120	the other as Alan Watts said, we can't just have the peaks and not have the valleys.
2547440	2554400	Right. So we don't get that right. We don't understand that progress is never linear,
2554400	2558800	that you're curving back towards the very thing that you fear. And unless you watch out for it,
2558800	2564000	you will go to the place you really don't want to go to, that everything needs to be seen in
2564000	2569520	context. And the way in which we talk now is to take things out of context. So all that could in
2569520	2575760	a way, if you like, be implicit in that chapter on the current sense of opposites and you found it.
2575760	2579760	Yeah, but also the other thing that I was struck by when I read this by you earlier,
2581360	2588560	you say very amusingly, but very perturently here, that in your many talks, and you've got
2588560	2594160	lots of audience feedback and lots of questions, and you say there is a way you put it to me was
2594160	2598800	there are two things people want, and they can't have either of them. And as I understand it,
2598880	2606400	you can correct me on this. But the first is that they want one thing to be better than the other,
2606400	2610240	first of all, so they want the left hemisphere to be bad and the right hemisphere to be good.
2610240	2614000	And that's not right. We really want the goodie and the baddie. They want the kind of manikin,
2615040	2618240	right hemisphere, let's all create a right hemisphere world and forget about the left
2618240	2624560	hemisphere. I'm kind of bitch. It's not that at all. But they also struggle with the idea that
2624560	2627920	if there's two things that matter, that they necessarily matter equally.
2630080	2635120	Right. And these things like these two points, I know that for you, they're self evident now.
2635680	2639440	But I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I read this thinking, how can how can this book
2639440	2645600	be translated into some form of praxis in the community that I feel as though this kind of
2646240	2652000	this kind of capacity to see that you can have two things that are both really important.
2652720	2656160	But one is more important than the other. And yet the other, they need each other.
2656960	2662240	It's actually counter cultural. It's not actually there as one of our sort of memes of operation.
2663200	2667200	All the things I'm saying are counter cultural because I believe our culture is founded on
2667200	2674080	simplistic falsehoods. We've mistaken the nature of reality. That's what I'm saying. And in the
2674080	2679440	first seven pages or so of the matter of things, I lay out all kinds of things that must strike
2679440	2684640	people as very improbable. That for example, relations are prior to the things that are related.
2685440	2692560	Get that. But I stand by that throughout the book. So and just for one, but it's in the
2692560	2697200	master, it's in the image of the master and his emissary. The master needs the emissary and
2697200	2701840	knows it. The emissary needs the master but doesn't know it. There's an imbalance in this
2701840	2706880	relationship. And the emissary is good as long as it remains the emissary. The master is good
2706880	2711280	as long as the master remains the master. But when the emissary tries to be the master,
2711280	2718480	it falls apart. Now that image, I didn't know that. I only found out about it afterwards and in the
2718480	2725520	writing of the matter with things is central to many cultures. There are examples in Chinese
2725520	2730880	mythology, in Indian mythology, in North American native people's mythologies and so on.
2731120	2737280	Of this usurping force. And it's actually the subject of what is arguably
2738400	2745440	the greatest epic poem in the English language, Paradise Lost. It's precisely the story. So
2745440	2750240	this is a very important one. There's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere as long as it
2750240	2754480	knows its limitations. But unfortunately, one of the features of being limited is that you are
2754480	2759840	limited in your knowledge of your limitations. I mean, it's not just that it's limited and
2759840	2765520	it has to find its proper place in relationship. It's wonderful. It's glorious. It's an extraordinary
2765520	2772400	capacity, right? And with all due respect, I mean, people have said of your two volumes and
2772400	2778160	almost million words, it looks like the left hemisphere has won. But I think you would counter,
2778160	2783200	I think, that this is in the service of the right, which is also quite a valid contention.
2784080	2788960	Absolutely. I've spent my life struggling to bring the left hemisphere into service to what
2788960	2796400	the right hemisphere knows. So it is quite true. The book is absolutely stuffed with real science,
2796400	2802640	with hard science. So 5,600 references in the new book, it goes much further than the master in
2802640	2807040	his hemisphere and exploring this difference between the hemispheres and nobody can say I
2807040	2811760	haven't researched this properly. I don't think there are very few people alive in the world who
2811760	2818480	would be in a position to have read more about it than I have. So there it is. And I use reason.
2818480	2823520	Reason is my friend, not an enemy. It's just that not everything can be encompassed by reason.
2823520	2828000	Reason can't explain why a wonderful piece of music is as wonderful as it is.
2829040	2834160	There are, intuition and reason are both important. And again, when I chose the master
2834160	2839920	in his hemisphere as the metaphor, I didn't know that quote that is attributed to Einstein, that,
2839920	2844960	you know, the rational mind is a faithful servant, and the intuitive mind is a precious gift.
2845920	2852000	We live in a world which honors the servant but has forgotten the gift. Well, in the second part,
2852000	2856800	the middle part, as you know, of the matter of things, I look at reason, science, intuition,
2856800	2861280	and imagination and basically suggest that all of these are very important in their different
2861280	2868640	ways and we need to be able to make use of them appropriately. Okay, all well taken. And as always
2868640	2874320	with your book, there's a kind of hermeneutic kind of process going on in which you have to go over
2874320	2878240	many different aspects of your argument again and again until the full picture becomes clearer.
2878880	2882480	And one of the things I was struck by, again, just focusing on chapter 20 for a second,
2883760	2889360	it is the case, and sorry, not if, it clearly is the case. You argue it well, it's very compelling,
2889360	2895360	I believe it, that we live in a world of the coincidence of opposites, a world in which resistance
2895360	2901920	is a critical feature of life, opposition is necessary, movement or primary and all of the
2901920	2906640	things that you argue in the second volume. If that's the case, it's natural that we'll
2906640	2911040	struggle to perceive that without the language forms to perceive it. So on the one hand, what
2911040	2917040	you're getting is a lot of people broadly of the right hemisphere perspective, insuiting that you're
2917040	2920640	right. Of course Ian's right, this is why your book's so successful. Have you read Ian's book?
2920640	2926480	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And yet when it comes to trying to put it to work, without the language forms to
2926480	2931840	actually render this back to the right hemisphere in a way that gives a fuller picture of context,
2932400	2936160	we'll struggle. In that respect, I was very struck that there are at least three words
2936720	2944000	in chapter 20, big words, and there's no lack of them in the books, that I feel people don't
2944000	2949120	really know, I know they do not know them, but the fact that they don't know them means they
2949120	2954960	can't really perceive what they're pointing towards as well. So the first is hormesis,
2955920	2961840	the second is syllapsis, tell me about the finesse there, and the other, and I always struggle to
2961840	2969280	say this, but the enantiodromia is another. Can you talk us through what these three words mean
2969280	2973680	and why they matter? Because I think we sort of need to know to get a sense of what we're talking about.
2975200	2984560	Hormesis is a term from physical chemistry, originally, and it refers to the fact that
2984560	2991360	something that is toxic in substantial doses may actually be helpful and health-promoting
2991440	2999040	in small doses. There are certain very obvious examples of this, one is digitalist derived
2999040	3004960	from the Fox Club, which is extraordinarily poisonous, but has been used since the 18th century and is
3004960	3013200	still the basis of the most effective treatments for heart failure. Arsenic, which has also been
3013200	3019200	used for 2,000 years, in very small doses can be extremely helpful, they're obviously large doses
3019920	3027040	and atropine, which is derived from deadly nightshade, can restore function to people with
3027040	3036400	certain neurological diseases. But it really was first described and probably is still most used
3036400	3042160	in describing the effects of radiation, where large doses of radiation can obviously be damaging
3042160	3048800	and cause cancers, but small doses of radiation can in fact be health-promoting and can in fact
3048800	3054000	prevent the development of cancers in laboratory animals. It's all to do with the scale. Now that
3054000	3060000	is so important, because what was I saying earlier, if you push and push something, you lose it.
3060000	3066880	And actually it says this in the book of changes, in the Yi Qing, he who doesn't know when he has
3066880	3072640	achieved enough, but pushes further, loses it. So that is very important. And there's an interesting
3072640	3078240	observation that makes it vivid here. When people were looking at the biosphere 2, which is an
3078240	3087360	enormous protected environment, which was erected to see how plants and even animals would respond
3087360	3092320	to being in this protected environment, they were puzzled by the fact that healthy trees
3092320	3098240	tended to fall over before reaching maturity. And what they discovered in brief was for a tree
3098240	3104320	to grow, it needs wind, it needs the stress of the wind to develop what is in fact called stress
3104320	3109600	wood, which is the core strength of that tree. And this is something that, funnily enough, although
3109600	3115280	not presumably known in that form to Nietzsche, Nietzsche actually says this in 1870, something
3115280	3121520	that in relation to human beings, that we need adversity. In a very simple way, we need adversity
3121520	3126800	because, as you know, I think that everything is in motion. And contrary to the Newtonian image
3126800	3133600	that rest is the normal state and that motion is an aberration, motion is the normal state and
3133600	3138000	rest would be an aberration if it could ever be achieved. But to achieve that, we need friction.
3138000	3142480	Friction is the thing that stops motion, that's how you would describe it. But it is also the thing
3142480	3148880	that enables something to get started in moving. So that is Hormesis. One more thought on Hormesis
3148880	3154800	here before you get to syllapses. For those of you who remember, there's a film called Dances
3154800	3159520	with Rules with Kevin Costner, just to bring it to popular culture for a second. And the premise
3159520	3165520	of this movie is basically a sort of white frontier pioneer person getting lost within a sort
3165520	3170400	of Native American tribe and at some point he's captured and there's a kind of meeting around
3170400	3175920	the fire to discuss what to do with him, what to kill him, what to send him back and so on.
3175920	3180880	And I'll never forget watching this because one of the Native Americans is particularly aggressive
3181520	3186960	and being for blood. He says, we must kill him, we must kill him. And I remember thinking all
3186960	3192720	the others are like passing the peace pipes and kind of, you know, looking very quintessentially
3192720	3198960	wise indigenous knowledge kind of picture. And yet this one guy is like a warrior saying we need
3198960	3203520	to take him out now. And I remember feeling at the time, it's really important that he's there.
3203520	3209280	It's not that he's right, but there was something about that energy being in the room as a kind of
3209280	3214480	counterweight to the, it's not exactly Hormesis, don't get me wrong, but it's a similar spirit
3214480	3218800	of this thing that's in a small dose valuable. If they were all like that, you'd have a different
3218800	3225600	problem. And similarly, Ian, just to nail this point, you said that you prefer your dark chocolate
3225600	3232560	at 70%, is that right? Yes, correct. Yes, I do. Can you please tell me why is it because
3233840	3243440	because as you increase the percentage to 85 or 90, it becomes less pleasing. It's simply,
3243440	3250560	this is why all the really best dark chocolate is 70% or 70 something percent.
3251600	3256080	The others are used for cooking because they're a pure chocolate essence, if you like.
3257120	3261360	There are many things that are like this. For example, in Scotland,
3262880	3271520	you know, putting a lot of water in whiskey is considered a sacrilege. But a very tiny bit of
3271520	3278640	water in the whiskey is necessary to enable it actually to unfurl, unfold. It's in a richness.
3280000	3286720	And there's a joke I like, perhaps I may be indulged in it, in Scotland. In Scotland,
3287520	3292160	if you ask somebody, will you have water in the whiskey? The reply is, will there be room?
3293280	3299200	Anyway, perhaps I could talk about. In credulity, there will be space for the water.
3299920	3303200	For the water. So let's move on to
3304560	3313360	salapsis. Salapsis is, in fact, the Ionian or Ionic form of the word salipsis in Attic Greek,
3313360	3319760	which is the one that's best known to philosophers. But it's the one that Heraclitus used. And he has
3320720	3326800	a fragment, which is extraordinarily dense in my view. And it goes like this.
3326800	3336800	Salapsis, and the word is grasping in English, grasping, holds and not holds convergent,
3336800	3344080	divergent, consonant, dissonant from all things one and from one thing all. And I think that is
3344080	3350880	just extraordinarily rich. I mean, first of all, this idea of the word salapsis or salipsis is
3350880	3357520	something to do with a sudden comprehension, grasping in that sense, it brings things together,
3357520	3364400	the other idea of, you know, coincidence. And it also signifies fertility, which comes about
3364400	3372800	through the coming together of the gametes of the two sexes. So it says many things at once about
3372800	3379360	this deep nature of reality, that it comes in glimpses or grasping moments of insight,
3379360	3385280	and that in that insight, it's neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply hold
3385280	3391360	or simply not hold, neither simply like nor simply unlike. Each thing, as I say, working with and
3391360	3398560	by the same token working against the others, the one and the many may bring things into reality,
3398560	3404080	they bring one another forth into being generating a reality that has this structure of its core.
3404720	3409680	And that despite or in the light of all this, perhaps because of the nature of this multiplicity,
3409680	3416000	all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here that's not paired with an antithesis.
3416000	3427200	So I think that that idea is very rich. And I know what you're saying is so how do we get that into
3428080	3433840	into dialogues in places where people are making decisions? I think the first thing
3433840	3440640	is that we need to, we need to emphasize that while we are busily pursuing a single goal,
3440640	3445680	we're neglecting all kinds of other things that are disappearing as fast as we're achieving that
3445680	3452960	goal, that we need therefore to be very measured and see how far we should go and not go further
3453440	3459920	unless we destroy that we need to respect the fact that when we bring things together,
3459920	3467040	they remain unique and individual. This is not an abolition so that when a society is cohesive,
3467040	3473200	it doesn't somehow destroy the individual, but actually enhances the individual. The individual
3473200	3479840	can only be fully an individual with the background of an integrated society. That for example,
3479840	3484160	when we move towards the future, we need to remember where we've come from in the past.
3484160	3489600	We need not to jettison the knowledge that was painfully acquired by thousands of years across
3489600	3494480	the world. People now, without even knowing what they're rejecting are too quick to say,
3494480	3499600	well, we can make something new. Yes, we can. Things are always new. A river is always new.
3499600	3504080	A plant is always growing. Everything is growing and changing. Everything flows,
3504160	3507920	as Eric Leiter said, but you don't just cut it off from its roots.
3508960	3513760	All of these things are things that are worth saying. I think rehabilitating intuition is
3513760	3518960	important. We haven't got time to go into all of that, but I have three whole chapters on intuition.
3518960	3528160	But this constant dismissing of intuition is a mistake, I believe. Sorry, you were going to say
3528160	3532320	something. I wanted to hear also before making sense of what these things mean together,
3532320	3537840	but a little bit on an anti-odromia. Why is it important for us to use this concept as well?
3539200	3543840	Well, an anti-odromia is the easiest one to deal with. It's a term invented by Yong,
3544400	3553120	and it really refers to the fact that roads go in two directions. And this was first again
3554560	3559680	commented on, at least in the West, by Heraclitus, when he said the road up is the road down.
3560400	3565040	And so this is really the essence of an anti-odromia. We don't need to spend much time on it,
3565040	3575200	but I think that it is very beautifully, deeply, and with great imagination, and I mean that in
3575200	3582480	the best sense, unfolded by Yong in his looking at what a human being is. It's a very important
3582480	3591120	element, as I say, in the practice of anyone trying to help a human being with their suffering,
3591120	3600640	their mental suffering. And I'm just struck by these three terms when I was reading, because
3601520	3606240	they're not the kinds of things we bring to bear, right? We use language of systems change,
3606240	3612800	and we speak about regenerative economics, and we speak about a new narrative and all this kind
3612800	3621280	of stuff. But these things cut much more deeply into the need to perceive reality. We live in
3621280	3627600	arguably a reality avoidant culture, much of reality we don't want to attend to in a certain way,
3627600	3632480	and some would say it's also a kind of post-truth culture. But in order to sort of reach towards
3632480	3637600	the truth and reach towards reality, it feels like our conceptual maps are not fit for purpose.
3637600	3642800	There's a kind of, there's a linguistic drought of some kind that prevents us from seeing. I'm not
3642800	3648560	seeing that we should resuscitate these fairly scholastic terms as the only way. But it does
3648560	3656080	feel to me a little bit like part of the public education is to bring such terminology to bear
3656080	3661520	so that people can actually make sense again of what's actually real and true, rather than
3662160	3664800	believing they can't actually articulate their intuitions.
3666720	3671520	Well, yes, I mean, whether or not these particular terms are the right ones, I wouldn't
3671520	3676320	like to say, although there's nothing wrong with them, I suppose. But I think that the perception
3676320	3683600	from which they stem is, is explicable in terms that are not so strange. And I suppose that's what
3683600	3688400	I've tried to do in my writing, which is why one of the communist things people say is,
3688400	3693760	you gave me the words for things that I knew to be the case, but I had no language. I had no way
3693760	3697520	of saying these things. And I felt I'd be dismissed if I said them, but I've given
3698400	3705680	good groundings, reasons, and science behind why these things are important. And we need to
3706480	3712320	make this shift. We need to change our perspective on what we're doing here and who we are and what
3712320	3716720	the business of being alive is about before it's too late. Anyway, there we are.
3716720	3722960	Well, just a related example is, if you watch the news and the clamour on social media and the
3722960	3730960	main forms of debates in public life, there's ubiquitous partial truth, right? People say things,
3730960	3734720	and then there's a kind of watchable tree that's partially true, and there's a watchable tree
3734720	3739280	response that's also partially true. But there's very little sort of shared endeavor to get to the
3739280	3744000	kind of fuller vision of the truth. Now, there's a whitehead quotation somewhere in your book
3744000	3750480	about there are no whole truths or only partial truths. But I feel this is quite fundamental.
3751440	3758720	Again, it's something to do with realizing that to actually have a partial truth is,
3758720	3764560	in some sense, the truth. There is a meaningful way in which not to know everything is to know
3764560	3771120	everything. And you're getting towards that in your book, but in a way that is maddeningly elusive
3771120	3780000	at a cultural level. Well, I mean, I do, I do talk about the importance of not knowing,
3780000	3784640	which of course is not the same as ignorance. Ignorance is what you have before you know,
3784640	3788080	not knowing is what you have after you've gone through the process of knowledge.
3788720	3797440	So all that is very true. And what Chinese call Wu Wei, non-action, is as important.
3797440	3801520	And that is really in a very practical sense, people always saying, what do we do? And one of
3801520	3806480	the things that comes out of experience as a psychiatrist is the first thing is to see what
3806480	3811760	it is that you're doing that's wrong and stop doing it. So before you can actually have room to
3811760	3816640	do something new, you've got to get out of the picture, the thing you're doing, which is wrong.
3816640	3822560	So, you know, all this has very practical meaning in my view. It's not just some strange
3823520	3830320	insight into the structure of being. But if we are to survive, and if we're to understand
3830320	3834400	what we're doing, we do need to have some insight into the structure of being. And at the moment,
3835600	3843840	our image of a reductionist materialist mechanism is wrong on so many counts. And I give a lot
3843840	3848400	of them in the book. I mean, you've quoted Wu Wei, you mentioned Wu Wei there, the principle. In
3848400	3855280	the book you quote the Tauti Qing a few times, you mentioned the Yi Qing. I mean, many things,
3855280	3861520	but you're also a kind of Taoist, right? One way to understand. I am a Taoist. I'm precisely a
3861520	3868640	Taoist, yes. That's good to know. And I could be a Christian. And if I was, I'm probably a very
3868640	3877440	bad one. But I find the Christian mythos and the Christian tradition phenomenally rich. And it's
3877520	3883280	very, you know, I couldn't say whether, whether I am a Christian or not, but it's not incompatible
3883280	3889200	with being a Taoist at all. Or a Buddhist for that matter. And Thomas Murphy famously was
3889760	3896800	Catholic. I wanted to end by just briefly, for those who are curious, today I wrote a little
3896800	3900400	piece trying to get my head around what I meant by the McGillchrist maneuver a bit more clearly.
3901840	3905120	And I just, I've said here just a short definition for those who are interested.
3905680	3911440	I say the McGillchrist maneuver entails the combined perceptual and conceptual capacity
3911440	3917120	that transcends contradictions, disclosing the coincidence of opposites as generative of reality,
3917680	3925920	thereby re-enchanting aspects of lifelong, of, of, of life, re-enchanting aspects of life,
3925920	3931840	long considered problematic, including tension and paradox. So there's a kind of, you know,
3931840	3938240	I think there's a real thing going on here in the structure, the underlying structure that
3938240	3947600	is principally in chapter 20, but pervades to the entire work. And we will go now to something
3947600	3953680	else. But I suppose I want to say the whole series is called attention as a moral act. Now,
3953680	3958880	as a whole point of discussion, but just to end, please, why is attention a moral act?
3959440	3962400	What, if it's not obvious already, how would you describe it?
3964160	3968560	Well, I don't think it is entirely obvious. And when I discovered that
3970160	3976080	almost the foundational difference, probably the foundational difference between the two hemispheres
3976080	3981280	is the very well-known fact that they pay attention in different ways to the world,
3981280	3987120	it didn't altogether immediately strike me that I'd struck gold. You know,
3987120	3992320	this was an incredibly important thing, because part of my training was, you know,
3992320	3998000	attention is a cognitive function, you know, with memory and, you know, other things. And it
3998000	4006240	therefore gets reduced to a sort of mechanism of a kind. And I didn't realize how fundamental
4006240	4015920	this is to being the world that we know is the product of our attention. We cannot know a world
4016000	4022800	that is not part of our attention. I must say, first of all, that I don't mean by attention,
4022800	4028160	the scrutinizing self-conscious attention. But if it hasn't come to our attention at even an
4028160	4033280	unconscious level, if we haven't imbibed it, then it can't be part of our experiential world.
4033920	4044080	So I steer an important course, I think, which is, I say important because at the moment, yet again,
4044880	4051760	there is a polarization going on in which either people believe the world is simply
4051760	4057520	something that's made up in the individual mind. So this is post-modernism at its worst,
4058160	4067280	it's certain kinds of philosophy, a kind of naive idealism. And the other is a naive realism,
4067280	4074000	that the world is just stuff out there and our knowing it makes no difference to what it is.
4074000	4081760	Well, again, we don't have time for this, but how we attend something, whether we attend to it,
4081760	4086800	even within the world of physics, never mind in the world of philosophy and psychology,
4086800	4093840	makes a difference to what we are experiencing. And it's a moral act because it means that we
4093840	4103120	are not simply observers in this universe, we are creators in this universe. We co-create along with
4103120	4112880	the universe and along with that divine logos or Lee or Tao or whatever it is, that is the ground of
4112880	4119920	being. We are not just passive consumers. Once again, it is always a reverberative relationship.
4120480	4126720	I realize in my very early teens that everything has this structure and that therefore we have an
4126720	4132400	impact on the world, making it what it is, really literally making it what it is, the ways in which
4132400	4141840	we see it, alter what will be there. We know that from quantum mechanics as it's laughably called,
4143760	4151440	or quantum field theory as I prefer, but it is also part of our experience of the world.
4151440	4160240	So how we see the world creates is a duty laid on us to pay the right kind of attention,
4160240	4165680	a kind of nourishing attention that brings things into being, not the kind of attention
4165680	4171760	that alienates and that cuts us off from that reality and therefore changes it and changes us.
4171760	4175600	So it has an effect on the world, it has an effect on us, those who are doing the attending,
4175600	4184400	a moral effect. You can make yourself a very dubious person by always adopting a stance of
4184480	4193360	extreme remoteness. You can also get things wrong by engulfing yourself in things. So as
4193360	4200320	always, it is a matter of finessing a harmony of positions that look opposed to one another,
4200320	4206560	but are equally necessary or at least both necessary. So that's what I mean by it. And I
4206560	4214560	also mean that if we don't pay the right kind of attention to what we're doing in this world,
4214560	4220800	and the moment our attention is up for grabs from every kind of electronic device around us,
4220800	4225920	and I don't think that we are taught any longer how to be quiet and still and concentrate on a
4225920	4230400	piece of work, on reading or listening to a piece of music for an hour or two at a time,
4231280	4236480	if we don't reconnect with this kind of attention, we will lose the world. Literally,
4237200	4243280	you know, I'm not speaking in metaphors, we will lose this world, the world may carry on without
4243280	4250720	us. But that would be very sad for certainly us and possibly for the world because I, you know,
4250720	4256800	I don't hate humanity. I think we've got things very, very badly wrong. But what humanity is,
4256800	4263600	is something very, very special. Well, thank you. And
4266880	4271360	all of humanity is indeed special. And the work you've done is certainly very special. And
4272320	4277680	I suppose on behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank you for your decades of, you know,
4277680	4285280	scholarship and the fire that has propelled that is something that I think we all admire.
4286240	4292400	And you've done, I feel as though when I asked you earlier, you feel fulfilled about your work,
4292400	4299360	there's a sense in which you've clearly done with your talents what you alone could do in some
4299360	4304400	meaningful sense. And that's also why I wanted to share the biography. And I think it's up to us
4304400	4311040	as a broader population of people interested in your work, concerned about the world in various
4311120	4318080	ways to consider what it means to us and how we bring it into being. And with that in mind,
4318080	4324880	we're going to move in that direction now. Beginning with, I'll pass over to my colleague,
4325520	4331120	Michael Breddy, in a second. And we'll do a very short practice before we move into groups,
4331120	4334800	and then we'll come back together where we'll have a chance to ask you questions and I'll
4334800	4344000	help to field them as well. Okay, so this is a pretty fundamental question from Paul. Paul,
4344000	4350080	do you want to ask it? If you're there, can we see you and, or is that too much, too difficult,
4350080	4354800	Michael, to do that? I can actually, it might be a bit of a challenge, but I can. All right,
4354800	4358000	let me just ask it. If you don't mind, Paul, sorry, we better if we ask you. I hope you understand.
4358560	4361280	I think that's me. Okay, great. Let's hear from you then, Paul.
4361600	4367360	Thanks very much. So my question relates to how would you say that we could slow down and
4367360	4374880	nurture the sort of attention that grows out of that slowing down in a world that seems to be
4374880	4380720	speeding up and with less and less time to sit for three hours with a piece of literature or enjoy
4380720	4387040	how do we reconcile the speed of the world as we perceive it with the necessity of slowing down
4387040	4392160	with that? Thank you relatively quickly and just so we can get plenty of questions in.
4393200	4402640	Yes, I mean, the question is a very good question. And I think it is difficult.
4403440	4409840	There have never been more pressures on people to do more things in less time.
4410720	4416320	So the only thing I can suggest is that you stand out against that culture as much as you can.
4418000	4423520	And it's built into many of the assumptions of the culture that it's better for everyone to be
4423520	4428800	doing lots and lots of things. It might be better if we did fewer things but did them
4428800	4437840	with greater thought and depth. So I think one has to make some decisions. I mean, I'm not
4438640	4443600	holding myself out as any kind of example of what to do. I'm not a good example of doing anything,
4443600	4454160	but I have no television. I've found myself listening less and less to the radio. I hardly
4454160	4462480	ever do actually listen to the radio, to be honest. And I have switched off alerts when emails come.
4462480	4469520	I try to limit the times of day in which I will look at them. And I'm not on any of the social
4470240	4476880	networks, but I have the luxury of a PA who does and who therefore picks up messages for me.
4478640	4484080	But if you haven't got such a person, on the other hand, you might not have quite as many
4485920	4494800	requests or questions. But I think it is difficult. I think it's rather like asking
4495520	4500480	any kind of spiritual practitioner, how do you do this? And the answer is not some simple thing,
4500480	4505120	but it's about embracing a certain relation to the world. And that's really what I'm talking
4505120	4512320	about. So I think it's a start from day one of thinking, you know, what matters is my relationship
4512320	4517280	to the world, to people and so on, and all the things that interrupt and make more shallow,
4517280	4523040	my connections with them, my experiences also, are to be resisted. Sorry, it's not a very
4523040	4528560	satisfactory answer, but that's the best I can say. Thank you, Ian. And I'm looking at these,
4528560	4534080	sorry, Paul, thank you for your question. And I'm looking at these questions, all of which are
4534800	4541600	kind of explosive in their own way. One about AI, one about war and peace is one about God.
4541600	4551600	I want to be honest, I want to ask this because it seems to me something that Perspectiva recently
4551600	4555680	did an anti-debate about as a whole conversation. But if you're interested, look at the anti-debate.
4557520	4563920	In what is the question from Christine Miskelly, and it says, in what sense might war be needed
4563920	4574960	for the development of peace? What sense, if any, perhaps? Well, well, gosh, it's just a very good
4574960	4583280	question. I don't think it is, it is absolutely necessary, though some degree of difference,
4585280	4591600	competition, conflict is also part of the process of collaboration. So I mean, one of the things I
4591600	4602800	say about the history of evolution, which is constantly projected as a simple warfare of all
4602800	4607360	against all, is that it's not a bit like that. I mean, that it's far more distinguished by
4607360	4613600	collaboration and cooperation between species. But as a degree of competition is also extremely
4613600	4619600	helpful. And I suppose bringing it back to human war and peace, I would like to say I hope we can
4619600	4626880	certainly avoid a war, but that nonetheless some degree of independence of states, but working
4626880	4642640	together of states is important. That you know, the element of change that comes about when a
4642640	4649680	country is plunged into a crisis can be extremely helpful. I mean, it's not a bit of a cliche,
4649680	4657520	really, but it's true that the Second World War produced extraordinary advances in science and
4657520	4662080	technology, some of which may not be good in themselves, but some of which very clearly were
4662080	4670000	and have been used to great advantage. So once again, it's not all or nothing. But I hope that in
4670000	4676480	the case of actual human war, it will be as little as conceivably possible. Okay, thank you, Ian.
4676880	4682240	Gosh, there's so many. Do keep your questions coming just because we will keep a record of all
4682240	4686960	of these. So one way or the other, these will be attended to through a moral act, as it were.
4688240	4692240	And we probably won't manage to answer all of them now. However, there was one question that's
4692240	4698560	very much of the moment. There is a more challenging real world question from about AI from Pat Kain.
4698640	4702720	Pat, do you want to frame that in your own vernacular?
4703440	4710560	Sure. Hi, Ian, I love your work. But this is a pressing question, which is to say,
4711760	4719840	to what degree is computation a left brain phenomena? And what are the recent achievements
4719840	4725600	in computation, which are basically sort of modelling and building on the precedent of a
4725600	4731280	corpus? We all thought that machines, the one thing that machines wouldn't get anywhere near
4731840	4739280	would be creativity or responsivity. Maybe even that may be a more technical way to put it.
4739280	4742560	But it seems that's one of the first things that they've come for. We thought they would
4742560	4748240	be dealing with our routineized behaviours and liberating us from labour. What it seems to be
4748240	4754320	doing is coming in at the kind of formulaic nature of human creativity and intellect itself.
4755040	4760640	And that's what advanced AI has come to. Now, within the right brain, left brain, complicated
4760640	4768000	dynamic, which was Jonathan was at pains to say, is complex rather than manacheme. What's your
4768000	4775920	perspective on advancing computation and what it does to our sense of appreciation for valuing of
4776000	4786560	the human? Wow. Well, first of all, to start with the rather limited and more focused
4787520	4794240	computation is a very left hemisphere element. And it's different from understanding. So it's
4794240	4802080	clear that the left hemisphere can manipulate words and manipulate figures. But the right
4802080	4807200	hemisphere is better able to understand the overall import of the words and the overall
4807200	4811680	nature of what has been computed and what it means. So in other words, it doesn't have the
4811680	4816320	degree of understanding of the right hemisphere, but it's able to carry out procedures. It's the
4816320	4823360	difference between procedures and inhabited processes. So what we're seeing is an enormous,
4824320	4832960	it is striking and troubling, I agree. But if you can compute so that you can get all the possible
4833840	4839360	permutations and possibilities, this is not the way the human mind works intelligently.
4839360	4849360	But you can then single out certain elements. But I doubt that I may live to eat these words,
4849440	4856160	but I doubt very much that a machine can can produce something that is more than mediocre in
4856160	4866080	terms of creativity. The business of creativity comes out of the business of having a body,
4866080	4875280	having a mortal life that is limited in extent, and having emotions. And I think and being conscious.
4875840	4880160	And there's no evidence that, well, clearly they don't have bodies, they don't have
4880800	4887840	emotions, but they could have consciousness. But I think that's a doubtful but not excludable
4887840	4895600	possibility. But I don't think this is how great creative works are made. There was already a machine
4897520	4902640	created by putting all the works of Bach into it, and then asking the machine to sort of
4903360	4909440	out of this random literature, a new work of Bach. But the trouble is that, although it could pass
4909440	4915600	as, yeah, in the genre of Bach, it's not created by a genius. And it doesn't move one in the way
4915600	4920400	that the works of Bach do and speak to one in the way that the works of Bach do. Only a human
4920400	4926000	being a fellow sufferer can actually do that. Is that something to do in with, thanks, Pat,
4926000	4929680	for the questions? Is it something to do with reverberation? I mean, you mentioned that this
4929760	4934480	notion that we have a similar problem in the chess world about whether a computer can play a game.
4936320	4942880	And there's something about seeing, feeling the other human beings creative acts that is
4942880	4948160	sort of non negligible, difficult to reproduce. And just you're so fond of the word reverberation
4948160	4954240	that that came to mind in your response to the question. Well, there's no need whatever for a
4954240	4959440	computer that's very good at playing chess to have any form of consciousness. I mean,
4959440	4964000	that's just absolutely not required. All it has to do is do an immense amount of computing very
4964000	4969440	fast, which would be a very stupid thing to do, which is why I reject the term artificial
4969440	4974880	intelligence. It's not artificial intelligence. It's artificial information processing that
4974880	4980800	could be done incredibly fast, much faster than humans can process information. But my God,
4980800	4985440	knowledge is more than processing information. Understanding is more than knowledge, and
4985440	4989520	wisdom is more than understanding. Okay, thank you. And you heard it here first,
4989520	4994480	there's no such thing as AI. I'm just kidding. So, Emma, you had your photo,
4994480	4999280	you had your hand up quite early, so you can go next, please. Emma Morrissey? Yeah.
5001920	5007920	Hi, yeah, it's Emer, but don't worry, it happens all the time. First, I just want to say a big
5007920	5012320	thank you. Your work has had a really profound impact on my life. So, just to get that other
5012320	5020000	way first. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the role of creativity,
5020000	5025680	because obviously, a creative act, for example, writing requires both hemispheres of the brain,
5025680	5031040	you know, so the right would be kind of free flow of ideas and the left involved in the editing
5031040	5037040	process, for example. So, I wanted to ask what you think the role of creativity could be as an
5037040	5043680	antidote to the imbalance that we see in the world? I think it's terribly important. I mean,
5043680	5050320	I think we are almost definable as creative beings. And as you know, my philosophy is that
5050880	5055360	we are here to help create reality, that we are, you know, we're not just
5057440	5064880	passive passers-through of a slideshow, we are actually interacting with something.
5064880	5070560	So, we are creating all the time. And emphasising that element is important, but it doesn't mean
5070560	5076640	letting go of what the left hemisphere provides, which are the tools. So, for example, in order
5076640	5081040	to be a good poet, you have to know your language, you have to understand how it works, and you have
5081040	5086960	to read a lot. In order to be a good composer, you have to know the rules. Well, I think you do. I
5086960	5091360	mean, nowadays, all the rules have been thrown out, but it doesn't necessarily produce wonderful
5091360	5097120	works for art. But I think that a composer is at an advantage. Let me put it that way.
5097120	5102800	If he or she understands the structures of music, the nature of music, and the history of music.
5102800	5110240	So, I think, I believe we create out of a living tradition of which we are the new members who
5110240	5116080	will take it in another way or take it further. That is all brilliant. But what I reject is just
5116080	5121520	cutting off the ways in which we might learn a skill. Learning a skill, learning an art,
5121520	5126640	learning a craft, is very important for creativity. It doesn't just happen by sticking people in a
5126640	5133360	room and going bluer whatever comes out. That is not needless to say how anything beautiful or
5133360	5139360	gracious created. But I do think it is very important. I absolutely agree with you. And I
5139360	5147040	think that the way children are educated nowadays is adversarial to that impulse.
5148640	5153920	But again, I want to caution. I don't mean that they should just be allowed to not learn things and
5154640	5159040	let it all quote hang out. They really do need to get to grips with things, understand them,
5159040	5165520	but then allowed to have their own thoughts, their own, you know, that is what my education
5165520	5172160	was like all those millions of years ago in the dark ages when I was educated by wonderful people
5173200	5177520	who were excited about what they were talking about, didn't have to follow a procedure that was
5177520	5183920	sent to them from Whitehall. So, you know, we need to get back to a business of, you know, openness
5183920	5189680	and that the mind of the young person needs to be trained to think differently, not just to
5189680	5194160	be indoctrinated. This is what you must say. And if you don't say these things, you won't get full
5194240	5198960	marks. But no, think for yourself. Turn things on their head. See what happens. It's great.
5201440	5206880	Okay. Thank you so much. And listen, we're going to have a question from Four Arrows,
5207920	5214560	which you've raised a few interesting comments throughout the evening and a chance to ask Ian
5214560	5218560	directly. Ian, I'll let Four Arrows answer the question, but just so you know, what my interest
5218560	5223840	here is something about the nature of hierarchy that's implicit both in or actually quite explicit
5223840	5229760	in the master and his emissary, but also to some extent in the myth with which you begin the second
5229760	5234240	volume of the new book. And I think this is a question that's sort of challenging that to some
5234240	5239680	extent. Can we hear Four Arrows if he's there? Yeah, I'm just asking. I'm wondering if Four Arrows
5239680	5245680	could raise their hand, then it's much easier for me to find Four Arrows because we have so many
5245680	5252320	people here. It's also known as Don Trent Jacobs, PhD. Ah, here I see you now, Four Arrows.
5254080	5257680	Okay, here we go. Here we go.
5260640	5272000	There we go. You found me. I'm a big fan of Ian on many levels. As an indigenous scholar, I appreciate
5272000	5278880	your references to the Uroquois Confederacy as a model also. I have a question that is,
5279440	5285440	you're in that metaphor that Jonathan just described. I just want to be clear
5286000	5291440	that you didn't intend for that relationship of hierarchy to the need to be permanent in order
5291440	5297920	to recognize that each person has limitations. And in the indigenous approach, of course,
5297920	5303920	hierarchy is contextual. For the buffalo hunt, we'll have a leader, but otherwise it's matriarchal
5303920	5309600	and non. So can you clarify what you meant by that using that particular analogy? Because it
5309600	5318160	was a little bothersome. Okay. Well, have you come across the myth that I use? Have you read it?
5319360	5324720	Yes, I have come across it. Oh, you have? Yes. I disagree with it in a way.
5325680	5334240	Explicit in it is that there are these two unequal powers, and one is able to be creative
5335280	5341680	and is able to look after the other one that can do good as long as it's under the supervision
5341680	5345440	of the greater power. They have two unequal twin brothers.
5348480	5352240	Just to be clear about the question, as I understand it, that's not in doubt. And I think
5352320	5357120	that's even accepted. It's just about the permanence of that relationship and whether the
5357120	5361440	hierarchy is a fluid notion that comes and goes according to context, or whether it's...
5361440	5366080	Well, in that myth, it isn't. No, in that myth, it is a permanent fact about the relationship.
5366080	5370720	It's never hinted that the other brother can somehow be the leader because he just doesn't
5370720	5376640	have what it takes. He on his own would be dangerous and his attempts to create a negative.
5377440	5384720	And he's jealous of, envious of his brother's position. He's a rival that is an upstart,
5384720	5390720	basically. This is the same as the story of Lucifer, the brightest of the angels, who became
5390720	5396480	Satan. And the whole story of Paradise Lost is caused by the resentment of the one that can't
5396480	5400880	do what the other one can do. Now, it's a very dangerous human reality, and I wouldn't wish to
5400880	5409360	gloss over it at all. I think the interpretation is incorrect. It's a Western lens through which
5409360	5417520	that myth is taught. And so Joseph Campbell actually talks about that myth in a different
5417520	5424080	way. I take it from Joseph Campbell. I take it direct from Joseph Campbell.
5424080	5428400	Well, then we should have a conversation about that disagree with them, right?
5428400	5433600	Yeah, because the twin heroes, the twin heroes is the key. And the twin heroes, which can be,
5433600	5440560	yeah, that mythology is, is that these twins work in complementarity with different strengths
5440560	5446960	and recognize the different patients in different contexts. And so that's why I like what Jonathan
5446960	5454480	is trying to clarify in terms of the fluidity. But a brief other one. I use the left and right
5455200	5460320	brain here also. I use it all the time. That's the problem with our world, exactly what you're
5460320	5467760	saying. But science really calls our metaphor a myth. And indeed, it is more complex. Can you tell
5467760	5474480	how you are still using that idea of left brain hemisphere without getting too shot down by
5474480	5482960	neuroscience? And then I'll close. I think Ian, briefly on that, because we have several questions.
5483760	5491200	Yeah, okay. Well, gosh, how can I be brief? I think, first of all, that a myth is not
5491840	5500160	an untrue, but it is a way in which the greatest truths can be expressed. And they can only be
5500160	5506320	expressed through metaphors, poetry, myth, and ritual. And therefore, these things are very
5506320	5511440	important elements in language. They're not the stuff of science. That's not a criticism of science.
5511520	5519040	Science starts out by excluding them. So that's fine. And what I've said is robust in neuroscience
5519040	5524800	terms. And nobody has really said that it isn't. Nobody with any authority has ever explained to
5524800	5530400	me that there's anything wrong with it. So thank you, Ian. And we're almost at the end. But there's
5530400	5534160	one final question. I just want to let people know that your questions have been seen. Some of them
5534160	5539600	are wonderful that we can't answer. So do know that they're appreciated. We'll keep a record
5539600	5543200	of them. We may even use them in some other contexts. But there is a very direct question to
5543200	5549040	end with Ian. And I hope you don't mind. It's from Malband. And it simply says, how do you understand
5549040	5560240	God? Oh, that's, we have minus 15 seconds for me to answer. And I wrote a whole about the resistance
5560240	5568480	and all that. So I wrote a 106 page chapter, which is woefully short on it. I can't answer that. In
5568560	5574160	fact, the only decent thing to say is it can't be put into words, certainly not into the sort of
5574160	5578800	expression you would like. So sorry to disappoint you. But actually, that is the best expression
5578800	5586160	of what I can say about it. Okay. And the bell, the bell is the answer also. Wonderful. The bells,
5586160	5594000	the bells. So listen, there are more questions. I see your hands up. I know there are. But there's
5594080	5598960	also good to leave. Once again, more and there is more to come. This is the first of several
5599600	5604400	in this series. I'll be kind of anchoring most of these conversations. But there will be other
5605200	5609280	people speaking to Ian at more length, from different vantage points, exploring different
5609280	5614480	aspects of both the books, getting a clearer sense of what we mean by attention being a moral act.
5616080	5621920	So I do hope many of you will come back. A reminder to will be in touch tomorrow and to
5621920	5626160	encourage you to sign up to Perspectiva's mailing list so you can hear about this series and the
5626160	5633360	other work that we do. And also, again, that we are a charity we rely on philanthropic donations.
5633360	5638000	If any of you feel so inclined, you're very welcome to follow the link that we gave earlier
5638000	5642880	in the chat or that you can find on our website to make us a donation or sign up for a subscription.
5643040	5650640	It's much appreciated. And the next event in two weeks' time is with Zach Stein, a sort of
5651760	5657200	philosopher of education, a really brilliant guy who I've known for several years now. He's the
5657200	5662640	author of a book called Education in a Time Between Worlds. And he is going to be asking Ian
5662640	5667440	about many things, but principally this notion of the direct perception of value in the world,
5668000	5674000	what's sometimes called value-ception. And they'll be going, getting deep into what that means
5674000	5679280	and why it matters today especially. And there'll be other subsequent talks, but that's the next
5679280	5684400	one. So I think unless I've forgotten something, we're good to go as it were.
5684400	5689520	Yeah, if I could just give a reminder, Jonathan, but next week we have a Connection to Priory
5689600	5698320	session, which Ian won't be present at sadly, but it's more focused on connecting with the
5698320	5703600	people that have been here tonight and others in kind of structured breakout rooms and different
5703600	5708160	practices to explore these ideas in greater depth. So to really kind of find the others
5708160	5714000	and to create a space for that. And it will be directly related to what's been discussed tonight.
5714960	5723120	So yeah, if you can make that, I put the link in the chat to register for that, but I'll just stick
5723120	5728800	it in again. And also what I'll do is just put in the link for the main kind of webpage where we're
5728800	5736320	going to host, make announcements for all of the sessions as they come up. So if you're, you know,
5736320	5740080	when you want to check back in, you can just go to that link and you'll see what the next
5740080	5745600	sessions that come up and register for all the upcoming events. Great. Well listen, Ian, as always
5745600	5750800	a huge thank you. I hope this is the first of many of these, well I know I hope it will be
5750800	5758960	first of many of these conversations. And thanks for everyone for coming and staying
5758960	5763520	and your questions and sorry we couldn't get to them all. And I hope now that those who want to
5763520	5769120	copy the chat have done so. And we'll see you, most of you hopefully in a couple of weeks,
5769120	5773600	maybe even in one week if you're joining Michael and Lee for the connection and inquiry session,
5773600	5777840	which I encourage you to do because like it's good to talk, right? I mean, this is heavy, heavy,
5777840	5785440	heady, heady chat, this stuff. So good to be with others who are wrestling with it too and share
5785440	5791520	your life experience and how this work comes into your world to be a little bit less alone and maybe
5791520	5796880	a bit more creative and productive through that. So pleasure to see you all and we'll see you very
5796880	5805680	soon. Bye for now. Bye. Thank you. Thanks Ian. Be in touch soon. Thank you everyone.
5806800	5814800	Thank you. Thanks Jonathan. Pleasure.
