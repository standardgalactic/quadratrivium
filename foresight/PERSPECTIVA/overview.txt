Checking PERSPECTIVA/Are we unmaking the world？ Iain McGilchrist & Bonnitta Roy in Conversation.txt
1. **Communication Quality vs. Quantity**: The discussion highlighted the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to communication, especially in light of how technology has monetized attention and potentially degraded our capacity for deeper thought and imagination.

2. **Technology's Role**: Technology, including communication platforms like this call, is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent the unmaking of the world. It can be helpful or harmful, but its role is complex and multifaceted.

3. **Balance and Mindfulness**: The need for a balance between engaging with technology and maintaining mindful communication was emphasized. It's crucial to use these tools mindfully, especially when they become overwhelming or detrimental to our well-being and relationships.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/First Principles and Second Sight, with Iain McGilchrist & Alastair McIntosh.txt
1. The discussion between Alastair McIntosh and Ian Goldin touched upon the state of the world, acknowledging it as very bad due to various crises such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequalities. They both emphasized that while science provides valuable facts and predictions, it is not sufficient on its own to address the multifaceted challenges we face.

2. Alastair believes that a revolution in the human spirit is necessary alongside practical solutions. He suggests that this spiritual renewal is something that people of all ages are craving and that it offers hope.

3. Both speakers agreed that each individual can play a part in making a difference, starting from an inner transformation that can lead to meaningful action.

4. The audience was encouraged to engage with the ideas presented by Alastair and Ian by reading their books ("Writers on the Storm," "Climate Change," "Poacher's Pilgrimage," "Soil and Soul," and "The Matter with Things"), joining Perspectiva's sub-stack, and potentially becoming paid subscribers for additional perks.

5. A light-hearted moment at the end of the session involved encouraging the audience to say goodbye, which resulted in a loud chorus of farewells as participants unmuted their microphones.

6. The hosts also mentioned the availability of the chat transcript for saving and accessing any provided links, and they humorously referenced Alastair's anecdote about a Christmas tree fairy who can provide his books upon request (though they agreed to follow up on that later).

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Iain McGilchrist at Realisation Festival 2023： The Matter with Things.txt
1. **Responsiveness and Life**: I previously mentioned that responsiveness is a key aspect of life, which magnifies under certain conditions. Life, through its creatures, exhibits a heightened form of responsiveness compared to inanimate objects—it reacts faster, more deeply, and more broadly. This responsiveness is what distinguishes living beings as potentially divine entities.

2. **Time**: In the chapter on time, I argue that our understanding of time is often misconceived. Time appears different when observed from an external perspective versus when experienced firsthand. For instance, if you're in a river flowing exactly at the rate of the water, time seems to cease to be relevant because you are moving with it. I believe time is a fundamental part of the universe, but I am cautious about conflating it with consciousness or suggesting it does not exist without self-awareness.

3. **The Impact of Writing**: My first book, "Against Criticism," had minimal impact when it was initially published, but its value has since increased significantly, now fetching a high price for a copy. The success of my later works, like "The Master and His Emissary," was unexpected. I never anticipated they would reach so many people or influence them as profoundly as they have. Readers often share that these books resonate with them, providing articulation and confidence in ideas they intuitively knew but couldn't explain.

4. **Personal Journey**: My journey into psychiatry was partly driven by a desire to explore the mind-body problem and a wish to continue being close to people through my work, after leaving clinical medicine. The transition from practicing medicine to writing and lecturing was a significant change that reduced my income but opened new opportunities for impact.

5. **Gratitude**: I am deeply grateful to my readers for their support and the positive impact their messages have had on me. Their feedback and shared experiences validate the long and often solitary path of writing and speaking about complex ideas. The connection with my audience has been immensely rewarding and has confirmed that the effort was worthwhile.

In summary, Ivalu Vilem Flusser emphasizes the importance of responsiveness in life, offers a nuanced view of time, and expresses profound gratitude for the impact his work has had on readers. His journey from medicine to philosophy underscores the interconnectedness of our experiences and the value of sharing knowledge and insights with others.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Imagination： A Way to Remake the World - Iain McGilchrist & Phoebe Tickell.txt
1. **Question on Spirituality**: A participant asked about the importance of spirituality, especially considering the challenges of the current era. The discussion touched upon the relevance of spiritual practices such as meditation and mindfulness in today's context.

2. **Personal Views on Spirituality**: The speaker shared their perspective, emphasizing that spirituality can be found in being awake and sensitive to what is happening in the world, especially during times like the Anthropocene. They highlighted that meditation does not have to be more "spiritual" than the act of being present and aware in daily life.

3. **Avoiding Overextension**: The speaker noted the importance of not pushing towards a spiritual goal too hard, as this could create its own set of problems. They suggested that having a routine, such as meditation or reading, can be beneficial but should not overshadow the importance of being present and aware in everyday life.

4. **Upcoming Session**: The speaker mentioned that they would send out the questions from the session to Ian and Phoebe so participants could reflect on them. They also announced an upcoming Connection Session with Isabella Granich, a researcher and facilitator focusing on adolescent development, which would take place in two weeks.

5. **Recording and Information**: The speaker reminded everyone that the session would be recorded and made available on YouTube, complete with a link for replaying the conversation. They thanked Phoebe and Ian for their insights and concluded the session expressing gratitude to all participants for their engagement.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Introducing The Antidebate!.txt
1. The conversation around the question "Is masculinity the problem?" led to a rich and nuanced discussion, where many participants felt that femininity is indeed in crisis and that masculinity, as it is currently constructed, is part of the problem due to its privileges and the issues it causes for women and society at large.

2. The anti-debate format is still in its early stages but has distinct principles compared to traditional debates. It emphasizes audience involvement, emotional expression, a shared investment in the question, and ensuring that the energy and contributions of the question holder are honored.

3. The anti-debate encourages participants to explore their own internal conflicts and contradictions, recognizing that a meaningful question often elicits a sense of dissonance within oneself.

4. The anti-debate aims to facilitate personal and collective growth through the process of engaging with challenging questions in a supportive environment.

5. There is an openness to future iterations of the anti-debate format, potentially extending its duration, incorporating more metaphorical language, and allowing for improvisation and spontaneous interaction to enhance the debate experience.

6. The organizers expressed gratitude to all participants for their contributions and for joining the experiment in rethinking the nature of debates and discussions on complex issues.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Is Value fundamental to the cosmos？ Iain McGilchrist in conversation with Zak Stein.txt
 The discussion between Ian McGillchrist, Zachary Stein, and David Bainbridge revolved around the nature of cosmic evolution, consciousness, and the fundamental values that characterize the universe. Ian and Zachary both acknowledged the importance of consciousness and value in the cosmos, with Ian suggesting that matter could be considered a phase of consciousness, arising to provide permanence and resistance, which are essential for creation.

Ian emphasized the interdependence of matter, time, and space as fundamental qualities of the universe, and highlighted the limitations of human understanding due to our temporal constraints. He advocated for embracing and celebrating the glorious nature of our limited consciousness.

Zachary agreed with the significance of adding consciousness and value to matter, time, space, and motion in understanding cosmic evolution. He pointed out the philosophical importance of recognizing the universe as having intrinsic value, which challenges reductionist views that only consider physical matter.

The event was part of a series hosted by Perspectiva, with future events planned. The next event will feature a mystery guest to be announced shortly. Participants were encouraged to support Perspectiva's work through donations if they found the event valuable. The session concluded with deep appreciation for the insights shared by Ian, Zachary, and the audience's engaging questions, which contribute to the ongoing exploration of these profound topics.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Living in the Metacrisis with Jonathan Rowson.txt
1. **From Nation State to Bioregion**: The shift from thinking about sustainability as a national issue to understanding it within the context of bioregions—natural landscapes and ecosystems—is crucial for addressing environmental challenges effectively. This involves localizing efforts to manage resources, address ecological concerns, and foster community resilience.

2. **Beyond Academia**: Instead of confining oneself to university departments, individuals can contribute to sustainability by directly engaging in practical activities such as running a farm that exemplifies sustainable practices.

3. **Alternative Education**: Establishing alternative educational models, like pop-up schools, that prioritize hands-on learning and real-world experience over traditional academic settings.

4. **New Paradigms of Language and Thought**: Embracing new ways of thinking and expressing ideas, such as Nora Bateson's concept of 'fanny poesis,' which encourages tending to what is latent and unseen in the world.

5. **Individuation and Collective Action**: Finding a balance between personal calling and collective needs, where individuation (the development of an individual's identity) meets collective action solutions (addressing societal issues effectively). This can lead to 'collective individuation,' where the distinction between 'I' and 'we' is blurred, and individuals are deeply integrated into their communities.

6. **Tuning Into Spiritual Calling**: Recognizing the importance of listening to one's own sense of purpose or calling and aligning it with what the world needs, avoiding self-indulgence while being responsive to global issues.

7. **Transformative Potential**: Focusing on work that has the potential to transform the world rather than simply maintaining the status quo. This involves creativity, subversion, and even transgression in a way that is constructive and aimed at fundamental change.

8. **Everyday Life as a Site of Change**: Placing hope in the transformative power of individuals tending to their immediate environments and everyday lives, rather than relying on large-scale actions or plans.

9. **Hyposubjects and Hyper-Objects**: In the context of addressing 'hyper-objects' (like climate change, pandemics, etc.), the focus should be on cultivating 'hyposubjects'—individuals who are deeply informed and engaged in their local contexts, yet connected to the broader global issues.

In summary, the discussion emphasizes the importance of shifting from grand, global plans to focused, local actions that arise from a deep understanding of one's own context and spiritual calling. It suggests that meaningful change is cultivated through individual and collective efforts that are informed by both the particularities of one's environment and the broader challenges facing humanity.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Music, Metacrisis & Metanoia with Michael Bready.txt
1. **The Problem of Disenchantment**: The modern world has become disenchanted, where everything is reduced to mere utility or commodity, losing its intrinsic value and connection to the sacred or the mystical. This disenchantment leads to a lack of meaning, purpose, and connection with the more-than-human world.

2. **The Role of Music**: Music has been historically significant in fostering communal experiences, spiritual connections, and cultural cohesion. However, in the modern world, music often serves merely as entertainment or background noise rather than a means for profound spiritual engagement or social change.

3. **Reimagining the Role of Music**: There's a need to reimagine the role of music in society by creating new forms of communitas that can reconnect people with the sacred and the mystical, fostering a deeper appreciation for the world and its intrinsic value. This involves consciously setting intentions and creating environments conducive to meaningful experiences.

4. **Inspiration from Protest Cultures**: The speaker points to the example of Argentinian protest culture, where music and dance are integrated into collective action, as a model that could be adapted to create new cultural practices that address contemporary challenges.

5. **Psychedelic Therapy Analogy**: Just as set and setting are crucial in psychedelic therapy for a positive experience, the context in which music is experienced can significantly influence its impact on listeners.

6. **Avoiding Dogmatic Traditions**: While reconnecting with the sacred and the mystical, it's important to avoid being tied down by dogmatic religious traditions that may alienate people who are skeptical or have different beliefs. A more pluralistic approach might be necessary.

7. **The Perspectiva Project**: The speaker is exploring the idea of a project called "Perspectiva," which aims to reconnect music and spirituality in a way that addresses contemporary issues, fosters community, and promotes a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world around us.

In summary, the speaker advocates for a re-enchantment of the world through music and cultural practices that engage with the sacred and the mystical, promote communal values, and address modern challenges in a holistic manner. This reimagining of music's role could lead to a more beautiful, connected, and meaningful existence.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/The Antidebate： Experiments in the Art of Sensemaking for a World Gone Slightly Mad..txt
 The conversation revolved around the experience of participants in a workshop using the anti-debate method, which was described as an alive and energizing process that challenged the typical format of discussions. Participants found themselves asking profound questions and recognizing alignment on various aspects of the statement despite diverse perspectives. The anti-debate method encourages deeper personal involvement and allows for a range of expressions, from quiet contemplation to passionate debate.

The method was successfully introduced into schools, revealing high engagement among young people as they navigated their identities, values, and beliefs in dialogue with others. This process is particularly beneficial during adolescence, a time when individuals are figuring out who they are and how they fit into the world.

The anti-debate itself is a collaborative creation that has evolved over time through contributions from many people, making it a diverse and adaptable tool for conversation. The hope is for this method to be widely adopted and customized by communities to address their own specific issues and agendas.

While there was initial skepticism about the audacity of attempting to create a new form of civic dialogue, the value of actually practicing and enacting such ideas socially and culturally was emphasized. The conversation highlighted that while proposing new social practices is essential, it's equally crucial to see them in action and adapt them to the challenges of our times. It's through these enacted practices that meaningful change can begin to take root.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/What is Metamodernism and Why does it matter？.txt
 In this discussion, the participants explored the concept of metamodernism, which is a cultural and aesthetic movement that emerges as a reaction to and a development beyond postmodernism. They emphasized that metamodernism involves a more nuanced and multifaceted approach to the world, where different perspectives are acknowledged and valued. It's characterized by a sense of both hope and despair, recognizing complexity without succumbing to cynicism or naivety.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Metamodernism in Art**: The arts can be a leading indicator of cultural shifts, with metamodern art reflecting the complexities of the current zeitgeist. It often blends irony and sincerity, creating works that are both critical and empathetic.

2. **Cultural Shifts**: The transition from modernism to postmodernism and now to metamodernism reflects broader societal changes, including shifts in our understanding of reality, truth, and the role of the individual versus collective.

3. **Education and Metamodernism**: Education systems that encourage critical thinking and a deeper understanding of context can foster metamodern minds, which are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.

4. **Personal Reflection**: Personal experiences with media, like the show "Bojack Horseman," were used as examples of how narratives can resonate deeply with viewers and contribute to cultural understanding.

5. **Engagement with Metamodernism**: Engaging with metamodern art and ideas can stimulate spontaneous thought and help us imagine new, more hopeful futures, even though we recognize that these futures are fictional.

6. **Saving the Discussion**: The participants encouraged those attending the session to save the chat for further reference, using the 'Save this discussion' feature provided by the platform.

7. **Gratitude and Further Exploration**: The speakers thanked each other and the audience for their participation, emphasizing that metamodernism is a concept worth exploring as it can offer new ways of perceiving context, feeling differently, thinking differently, and potentially leading to politically and culturally beneficial outcomes.

8. **Actionable Steps**: The discussion concluded with a call to action for the audience to engage with metamodern artifacts, written materials on the topic, and to continue the dialogue and exploration of metamodernism in their own lives.

In summary, metamodernism is not just an intellectual exercise but a lived experience that can shape our understanding of the world, our interactions with others, and ultimately, our collective future. It's a complex, nuanced approach that values both the subjective and objective realms, and it offers a pathway for navigating the challenges of contemporary society.

Checking PERSPECTIVA/Zen, Music and Life with Brother Phap Linh.txt
1. **Setting Intention:** Before leading a meditation or engaging in an activity like recording music, it's beneficial to set a clear intention. This helps to focus the mind and heart on what is truly important. For instance, during the recording of an album in Plum Village, the group created a ceremony to bless the space and set intentions for the project, ensuring that everyone was aligned with the purpose of love and healing.

2. **Ceremony's Impact:** The intention-setting ceremony had a profound effect on the group's experience. It provided a sense of protection and clarity throughout the recording process, which lasted three weeks. When tension or negative energy emerged halfway through, revisiting the ceremony helped realign the group and resolve any conflicts.

3. **Adaptation and Personalization:** While the example given was from Thich Nhat Hanh's tradition, the key takeaway is that intention-setting ceremonies can be adapted to suit individual or group needs. It could involve lighting incense, sharing personal intentions, singing a song together, or using a bell as part of the meditation practice.

4. **Practical Application:** The advice given is to create a ceremony or ritual that resonates with you or your group, one that helps to anchor and remind everyone of the shared purpose and values involved in the endeavor. This can be a powerful tool for maintaining focus and harmony throughout any collaborative project.

In summary, setting an intention and creating a ceremonial space to honor that intention can significantly enhance the collective experience and outcome of any project, whether it's recording music or engaging in meditation.
