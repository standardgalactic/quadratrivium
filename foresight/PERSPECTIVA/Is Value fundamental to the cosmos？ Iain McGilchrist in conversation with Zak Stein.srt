1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Welcome, everyone, to this second event. It's good to see you all. I'm Jonathan Ryerson.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm chief executive and co-founder of Perspectiva. Perspectiva is a publisher, and we're very

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,160
proud to publish Ian's book. This is the second volume of the Matter of Things, Matter

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,000
with Things here. Perspectiva has other things, too, though. We're a charity based in London,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,640
and our general emphasis is on trying to reimagine the world from first principles, giving people

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,560
permission to do that, social and intellectual permission, and encouragement to rethink the

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,320
world. We see this as a necessary kind of work that we have to do today. That brings

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,440
with it certain events, and we have an annual festival. We have a European network called

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,960
Emerge. We have a methodology we call the anti-debate, and we're in the business of creating

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,880
some course material that we hope to start sharing with you all soon. So watch this space

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,440
for further developments on Perspectiva, and in the chat, maybe Michael can just share

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,400
our website if anyone's interested to know a little bit more about us. I wanted to say

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,160
a few things before Zach and Ian speak, and then I'm going to disappear in the digital

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,720
sense of no longer being on your screen. The first is to thank, the tonight's event is

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,040
free, and that's partly because we were given a grant to help bring Ian's work to more public

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,560
attention and to inquire more deeply into the material in the matter with things. So

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,360
I'm very grateful to the inspiration incubator, particularly Nikki and Max, which has made

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,200
it possible for these events to be free. And there are going to be, there's already been

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,040
one, this is the second, there's going to be double figures events. We don't yet know

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,520
if it's 10 or 12 or 15, but we're going to be in that sort of magnitude of events, because

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,440
there's a lot to discuss in Ian's book, and because we want to do something a little bit

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:10,880
different. In essence, Ian's work sort of came to public attention around 2011, some

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,400
13 or 12 or so years ago. And since then, as Ian, as someone who's followed his work

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,640
closely, the wonderful thing is that it's coming to public attention, the big idea, the main idea,

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,280
the hemispheric hypothesis. But that's been a good decade now, a good decade of questions

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,640
clarifying what exactly Ian means, what's the difference in the right and left hemisphere,

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,280
how does it play out in the world? And there's still a place for that. There's a lot of people

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
catching up with the significance of that and why it's a world changing insight when you

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,800
understand properly what Ian's saying. But it's also true that Ian has moved along and deepened

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,720
the inquiry and in a more specific way, applied his understanding to particular areas. And they

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,800
need greater attention on their own terms. So in this seminar series, there's a kind of presumption,

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,880
although we will reiterate and restate the argument as we go, we're trying to move beyond, let's

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,360
say McGilchrist 101. We're trying not to be simply, this is the main thesis. Can I ask you again

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
about that, please? We're trying to assume a level of understanding and engagement with the work

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
that allows us to move it on. And when I say move it on, I mean move it on philosophically,

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,960
to really understand more deeply what's being said. But I also mean move it on kind of

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,040
in a more quasi-applied or proto-applied sense, because there's a lot of risk in rushing too

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,240
quickly to understand what might follow for Ian's work. But there's also a need to

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,120
begin to figure out what it means for each of us in our personal and professional and even political

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,240
lives. And with that in mind, the first event was trying to frame the purpose of the series as a

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,000
whole. And that was called Attention as a Moral Act. And I also introduced what I called the

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
McGilchrist Maneuver. And there's a little blog post about what the McGilchrist Maneuver is,

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,320
I think, and that can be shared in the chat too. And that's a way of trying to get people to

44
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,320
orient towards how we begin to think about the places where Ian's work makes sense in the public

45
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,000
realm. What value it might have for civil society rethinking things. And we're continuing that

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
tonight. And just so you know, as a little bit of a preamble, we have future events relating to

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
sanity and imagination. So we're trying to zoom in on particular issues that are dealt with in

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,600
great depth in Ian's books. But which are also of a sort of have a degree of salience and relevance

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,040
and tangibility in the real world. We don't want to be in the simple business of because Ian says

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
X, we should do Y, because Ian would be the first to say that's not how it is. But we are interested

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,640
in the shift of perception that arises from Ian's work, and how that begins to look in different

52
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,840
contexts and in different thematic areas. And tonight, we're on a really big one. Values.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Value. And this is one of the things I want Ian and Zach to help clarify for us. Because

54
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,840
when I was reread, by the way, if any of you are wondering about the reading material for tonight,

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,360
or what's to read after tonight to sort of cover the ground again, chapter 26 in the second volume

56
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,840
of the matter with things is particularly relevant to what you're about to hear. And it's Ian will

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,160
go into it in more depth, but it's a philosophical take on where what value is, where it comes from,

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,160
why it matters, and the extent to which it can be perceived directly. And the reason I think I

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,840
wanted to inquire into this question is because values are mentioned everywhere. If you're working

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,160
in a sort of civil society space as I am, everyone's speaking about trying to work on values for

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
campaigning. There's a values and frames company that think about messaging to try and get particular

62
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,520
values encoded in the language you use. Political strategy is full of tapping into implicit values.

63
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
In the commercial world, the world of commercial ethics, if you order food from, for example,

64
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:21,040
waitrose in the UK, you hear that they have their chicken, eggs, and milk come from farmers who

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,000
share our values. And then of course, if you're working in the business world or the finance world,

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,920
you hear a lot about the value proposition of something and the bottom line being about

67
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,600
shareholder value. So this word value kind of permeates society in lots of different ways.

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,120
But it's used maybe without adequate reflection to really understand what's going on.

69
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,680
I'd like one of the things for Ian and Zach to clarify is this sort of distinction between

70
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
value singular and values plural. I hope that will come up at some point in the discussion.

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,200
And also kind of what I sense is a kind of big transcendent sense of value, almost value as

72
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,440
equivalent with Dower or God or something like that. And then a kind of value that's something

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
to do with truth, beauty, and goodness, and maybe love and maybe meaning and purpose,

74
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,080
the kind of fundamental values. And then there's sort of derivative values like pleasure and maybe

75
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,520
integrity and things like that. I'm curious to understand the kind of reverberations of those

76
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,720
things and the connections between them. With that said, it's a great pleasure to introduce

77
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
both of our speakers. Now, Ian, I think, goes pretty much without saying for the audience here.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,800
He is Inter Alia, the author of The Master and His Emissary and The Matter with Things. He's a

79
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,040
well-known polymathic scholar and public speaker. Zach Stein may be a little less known,

80
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,120
but for those who do know him, it's hugely exciting to give him a chance to speak with Ian.

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,240
I have known Zach now for about four to five years, and we went to the same graduate school,

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,480
although my sense of talking with Zach is always that I've heard of the books that he's actually

83
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,520
read. That's usually my feeling of encountering Zach. He's a very studious, very early diet fellow,

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,640
really engages very deeply with all the material that he touches. So when he speaks,

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,280
he speaks with a great deal of authority because it comes from a lot of study and consideration.

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,320
He is, among many, many other things, one of the co-founders of the Civilization Research Institute.

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,880
He is working on a lot of different books, but I happen to know as publisher that he has a manuscript

88
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,080
in preparation that relates to metaphysics, which is one of the reasons I thought he was

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,280
particularly well placed to talk with Ian tonight. He's also a philosopher of education,

90
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,520
and he's written several essays for Perspectiva, which you can again,

91
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,080
we'll share with you in the chat in due course. So I think that's all for me,

92
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,400
if I haven't forgotten anything. I hope I've made sense of a thank you to our main sponsors,

93
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,920
why we're having this series at all, why tonight's event matters most, and why our

94
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,920
speakers are great. And with that, I can disappear for 45 to 50 minutes and let you enjoy Ian and

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Zach's company. I'll see you later on. Bye-bye. Thank you, Jonathan.

96
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Thank you, Jonathan. It's a pleasure to talk, never spoken before, so it's kind of

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,640
interesting to have a first conversation, so publicly. Jonathan mentioned that I'm working

98
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,640
on a book on metaphysics. I have a training in cognitive developmental psychology as a

99
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
neo-Pijadian, and so when I encountered work, it was actually like

100
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,880
that experience of someone saying something that I almost completely agreed with,

101
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,840
where there was just this complete absorption of the book and both volumes and the prior work.

102
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,400
And what was interesting to me was that in my own experience and in the branches of psychology

103
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,480
that I explored and philosophy that I explored, value was a given. And so the skepticism and

104
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,280
cynicism about value that I encountered in postmodernism and even some forms of modernism

105
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,880
was actually kind of like I didn't understand it. But I also encountered people who didn't

106
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,600
understand value as a given. So when I got to the places in your work where it was clear that

107
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,800
there were hemispheric dominance patterns that were expressing themselves across these different

108
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,760
philosophical positions and even in the personalities of the people who are holding them,

109
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,960
lights went off. And so I'm just kind of thanking you for your work before I get into it.

110
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,520
No, thank you very, very much. I hope the lights went on as well.

111
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes, anyway. No, thank you very much. And yes, I look forward to talking about these things.

112
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,200
Perhaps I should just begin, unless you've got a question lined up. Have you got a question

113
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:18,400
lined up? I had a prompt, which was page 1122. And so this is the second volume. This is the

114
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,240
chapter on value. You say something and it's just a simple sentence, but it's very, very profound,

115
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,080
which is that you're placing value as equally primordial with time, space, matter, and motion,

116
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,600
and consciousness. And so this is when you think about what is the universe? What is reality?

117
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,840
Time, space, matter, motion, sure, everyone kind of buys that consciousness. You can get people to

118
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,400
do that. Placing value as equally primordial to those elements of cosmos is part of the work

119
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,760
that I'm doing in metaphysics at the Center for Enduroism with Gaffney and Wilbur. And it's

120
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,920
core to the work that I was doing as a psychologist, as a Piagetian, where he was in part with

121
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,800
moral judgment and Kohlberg. What they were looking at was value-ception, was the ability of the

122
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,920
organism itself to perceive the field of value. Kohlberg was a moral realist. He believed that

123
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,560
you equilibrated your moral judgment to a moral reality the way you equilibrate your

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,280
socio, excuse me, your sensory motor intelligence to gravity. Gravity exists. So you operate on

125
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,840
gravity as a kid, and you learn to work and navigate space and time with your body.

126
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,640
Kohlberg's basically saying, and you do a similar thing with moral reality, with the field of value.

127
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,520
You learn from it. It's not a simple instruction. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the

128
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,240
philosophical lineage that has always held that as true. Because my sense is that most humans in

129
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,000
most cultures, with most philosophies and worldviews and religions, held this as true. It's only mostly

130
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,320
recently in modernity. That default position has been a value cynicism or value skepticism.

131
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,840
And so I wonder if you could kind of underline that point that, yes, value is life, time, matter,

132
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,320
motion, really primordial, constitutive of universe.

133
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes. Well, I believe it to be so. I felt that people would, and I'm glad you have that reaction,

134
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,680
think, goodness, you've talked about all these things that everyone agrees are constitutive of

135
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,600
the cosmos. But now you're talking about things like value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred,

136
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,480
which are my last three chapters. And I left them to that point, because I thought that if

137
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,960
people understood enough about what I said earlier about the more commonly accepted foundations of

138
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,480
reality, they would probably see why I would consider these things also as foundational.

139
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,320
The chapter is called value, not values, as Jonathan pointed out, because

140
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm not really talking in this chapter about which particular every day values we might consider to

141
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,360
be the more important ones. I think there is a discussion to be had about values, but often

142
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,160
values boils down to objectives. And that objective is often economic, as Jonathan pointed out.

143
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,520
And I don't think values are objectives exactly. An objective is something that in the

144
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,840
left hand is where you target, you find a line to go to it and achieve it. Whereas what I'm talking

145
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,920
about is something that is, I believe, impossible to do without. I mean, it's not an invention,

146
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,760
it is something that is there in the ground of our being. We don't, I think, a very important

147
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:05,040
starting point is I don't believe that we invent values and paint them onto reality in order to

148
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,240
cheer ourselves up, but that we actually discover values. They are there for the discovery. We either

149
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,400
respond to them or we don't. And perhaps that would take us too far from this discussion,

150
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,800
which hasn't even got going on value yet. But I do argue that the purpose of life,

151
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,800
the reason the cosmos brings into being something quite so counterintuitive as life

152
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:41,520
with all its problems is that it is the ability to bring forth in that cosmos something that can

153
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:49,040
respond to these primordial values. So I think I start by saying something like,

154
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,720
so consciousness is not what life brings, because I've suggested in a previous chapter that

155
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,560
consciousness is everywhere in the universe, and that's becoming not an unusual point of

156
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,600
view. It's, of course, very widely been accepted for thousands of years, particularly in the east,

157
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,920
but it's now being accepted much more in the mainstream of analytic Anglo-American philosophy.

158
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,040
But the idea of value is, I think there are a number of aspects to it, really. And perhaps

159
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,320
if I just say something about what I take it that we generally believe in, something about

160
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,680
what I am going to argue or what I do argue there, that would help. There are about half

161
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,360
a dozen of them, and one I've mentioned, which is this idea that we don't invent but discover it.

162
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,520
And related to that is that it is not a cognitive derivation. It is not something that we look at

163
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,160
life and then we attach certain sort of things and we call those values. But we have this ability

164
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,880
to be in touch with something which is an ontological primitive. And we do it through what

165
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,640
you've already mentioned, this concept of value-ception, which I believe is a translation

166
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,960
from the German of Max Schäler, who invented a word in German, which didn't until he made it up

167
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:18,640
exist, which is Warnähmung, no, sorry, Warnähmung is perception, but Wertähmung, which is valuing.

168
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,760
And so Wertähmung is really a version of Warnähmung, which is a perfectly straightforward

169
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,360
German word for perception. But the link with perception is interesting, because when we perceive

170
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:40,640
things, we don't take in a piece of data passively. We're not like receptive plates that absorb

171
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:50,000
data and then do a calculation on it and have a response. We immediately, as it were, get an idea

172
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,760
of what it is that we're dealing with here. And in fact, we go to meet it, which is another

173
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:06,400
interesting idea. So it's disclosed in a precognitive take on the Gestalt of what we're seeing. It's

174
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,520
not calculated. And this is particularly important when it comes to my understanding of morality

175
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:22,320
itself, of goodness. It's now been for a long time normal within the mainstream of Western

176
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:31,280
academia to consider that anyone who espouses another view of morality than utilitarianism

177
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,200
must be making a fundamental mistake. But utilitarianism is exactly the kind of morality

178
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,960
that is made simply out of making a calculation of what results from it. And that perhaps brings

179
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,400
sharply into focus what I'm talking about. It's not about a result. It's not about

180
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:57,440
a calculation towards a known goal. It is something that evokes in us a reverberative

181
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,000
relationship. So it calls to us and it calls to us from in front. So it is in that sense rather like

182
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,520
a final cause rather than efficient cause. Most of our thinking is to do with an efficient cause,

183
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,880
which is what pushes us from behind. The thing that makes us do something in the way that one

184
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,760
would make a machine do something. I know you know all this, but I'm just saying it for everyone's

185
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:30,880
benefit. Whereas a final cause is a cause that brings you to do something because you have a

186
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,760
relationship with it. It's not a self-generated concept, but it is another. And that's a very

187
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,720
important part of what I'm saying. And there are just a couple of things more to say and then I'll

188
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:48,960
hand back to you. One is that this makes it something that is not determined, but is free.

189
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,880
We can choose to respond or not. And we can choose what we believe actually fulfills each

190
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:05,040
of these values. So I mentioned that there are goals or objectives or targets or things we like

191
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:13,040
to do. And which ones we decide are beautiful, good or true is another conversation, an important

192
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,200
one. But I'm talking here about the very fact of the being, beauty, goodness and truth at all.

193
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,480
And the last point I'd like to make is that utilitarian thinking, which is in fact the value

194
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:37,040
of the left hemisphere, that of utility, means that values are designed to make us do something

195
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,760
that is evolutionarily beneficial. So beauty is just a way of making us choose the right mate

196
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:52,960
or whatever. The idea of truth is just something that's made up by a powerful hierarchy to

197
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,800
dragoon people into following it. And perhaps goodness is in the same league. Now what I'm

198
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:07,200
saying is that truly understood, properly understood, these values are fulfilled in

199
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,320
being responded to in themselves, not for any further purpose beyond that. So if I leave it at

200
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:22,480
that as a sort of laying out my stall, you can now pick it apart. No, I think it's like I said,

201
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,280
I agree with so much of what you're saying. And it's one of the things that I think clarifies the

202
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,680
nature of value as you're trying to express it as a basic property of the cosmos. Something I write

203
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,880
about in this work that Jonathan was speaking to, it is that it pre-exists the human, right?

204
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,720
Because if you're a postmodernist, you take value as a social construction, then there's basically

205
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,760
nothing until the human emerges and then we create value systems and we use them to oppress

206
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:02,720
people or whatever you do with that. But the take here is that actually no, life emerged to respond

207
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,800
to value which pre-existent. So I think Whitehead spoke of the appetite of the cosmos,

208
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,640
that the cosmos had an appetite that it wanted something, that it moved towards something.

209
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,920
And so that the evolutionary process responds to value makes it teleological.

210
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,520
It also means that there's a dimension in biological evolution

211
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,120
that is responding to the same field of real value that we are responding to. And that's, I think,

212
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
again, a position that humans have believed before, like I think of natural law theory. It's not a

213
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,000
great instance of it, but natural law is a case of that. And I think of religious systems where

214
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,720
the ordering of the cosmos, you participated in it as a microcosm, so that there was this

215
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:01,680
continuity of value across life and human and divine. So it's interesting that the power of

216
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:10,880
the left hemisphere to reify a worldview that is so much a minority position respective to

217
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:18,240
most of human thought is one of the things that strikes me. Because again, there's something

218
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,200
about socialization or early childhood education or the nature of the things that get the left

219
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,480
hemispheric dominance put in place. There's a type of person that hasn't been domesticated

220
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,320
to that by the educational system. It's not clear why that occurs. And for them, arguments about value

221
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,360
as I'm making here seem, actually, they like them. Makes you feel good. You feel like you're at home

222
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,480
in the universe. Like the things you care about actually matter to the universe. And then there's

223
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,040
another personality type, let me say, which is deeply skeptical, cynical of that view. In fact,

224
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,800
anything that would make you feel at home in the universe is probably proof that it's not science.

225
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,920
Right. And you think that would make you feel comfortable thinking about

226
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,320
the emergence of human value from biological evolution would be odd. So I guess I'm

227
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,120
Yeah, please. No, I'm just kind of that's, that's, of course,

228
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
a case of Petiti Open Kipi, isn't it? I mean, it seems like it must be wrong because

229
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,640
science starts from the standpoint that of course, all this has to be viewed as objectively alien to

230
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,440
us. And so it discovers that it is curious enough alien, you know, after after much looking for things

231
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,960
that it has ruled out from the start, like purpose and real values, it finds that these things can't

232
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,240
exist. Or if you hold that they do exist, you can't be being scientific. Well, I mean, I've tried to

233
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,920
argue from science and philosophy for these very concepts themselves.

234
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,160
Yeah. And it's there, you can see it in the science if you read it from a different angle.

235
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
Can I mention Darwin, because people will, you know, we're talking about evolution, you

236
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,760
raised biology. And one of the things that I love about Darwin, apart from anything else,

237
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:21,200
is that he was motivated in his study by beauty. And that in his earlier writings, beauty is already

238
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:32,000
beauty or beautiful occurs on one in six of his pages. But in his final writings, it occurs in

239
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,640
on average, every other page he uses the term beauty or beautiful, he's constantly referring to it.

240
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,920
And twice he puzzles over it. Because he says, it's all very well to say that birds choose a mate

241
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,760
because they find them beautiful. And that of course, in itself suggests that it doesn't just

242
00:25:51,760 --> 00:26:02,320
arise with us, with us humans. But the existence of beauty itself remains a mystery. I mean,

243
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,280
what that that observation addresses is given the existence of beauty, how can it be made useful to

244
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,360
evolution? But it doesn't answer the question, how does beauty come about? And what does it lie in?

245
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
Yeah, it's interesting. Darwin also writes a lot about love. And I bet they co-occur with beauty.

246
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,800
It's dynamic of allurement and attraction in the animal kingdom.

247
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
Not as much. But yes, yes.

248
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah. And the the plentitude of nature in the creation of beautiful things, because it's not

249
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,080
just that the bird is beautiful to the other bird, it also appears beautiful to us, which

250
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
seems it seems extravagant. Like, why would it be that the human nervous system responds so

251
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:50,640
immediately to completely these things? This is a point I make. I mean, why is it that the

252
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,960
things that birds and animals find beautiful? We also find beautiful, even though they have no

253
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,880
relevant. I mean, the fact that a bird has certain colors doesn't or a plant. In fact,

254
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,480
a plant that is poisonous may be very beautiful. So it's not a matter of, you know, being evolution

255
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,480
really beneficial. It just is beautiful. And another thing is trees, the shape of trees,

256
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,600
the shapes of trees are intrinsically beautiful to humans that have been commented on since

257
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,880
time immemorial. But there's nothing about the shape of a tree that can in any sense be attractive

258
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,600
from a propagation of the species point of view. Of course, they need insects. But don't tell me

259
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,200
insects are going around going, that Elm is just exquisite. And why would my nervous system evolve

260
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,360
to be appreciative of the beauty of the tree and indeed, indeed, and it certainly is. And so that

261
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,600
notion of kind of like moving the utilitarian calculus down into evolutionary explanation,

262
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,080
and therefore believing that something that's here, like my whole body and mind involved for

263
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,120
this very narrow function is in fact incorrect. That if value exists and life responds to value,

264
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,520
then it's reasonable that we optimized actually biologically, neurologically for love, beauty,

265
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,240
or a whole host of values that we actually have the ability to respond to. And so value

266
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:26,640
perception, this gets to a question. Value is like a skill. Like value can be trained. And when

267
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,000
you think of the aesthetic perception, I had training as exactly, it was a music, it was a

268
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,800
music actually where I, I so desperately wanted to have certain albums in my possession, and to

269
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,600
like expose myself to such a beautiful thing specifically jazz and Indian classical music.

270
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Whereas why? When I take a working job at a coffee shop specifically to get money just to buy these

271
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,960
things. So the intrinsic value and the impression. So this question, oh yeah,

272
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,000
how do you build value perception? Why is it that our schools, for example, seem to inhibit it,

273
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,960
that the culture seems to actually create the opposite, where things that happen,

274
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,560
where things that happen are perceived as having value is one way of even describing the commodity

275
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:24,480
form itself, that you perform a trick. Yes, yes, yes. The exchange value overriding the actual

276
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,720
use value as it were. So yeah, how do we get better value perception? How do we get confused?

277
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:41,280
Yeah. Yes, it's a very interesting question because like so many things, it's not black

278
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:51,200
and white in that value section can only exist once it's been trained. But it's also true that

279
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:59,680
it can be trained, but it is intrinsic. So I think children without any instruction find certain

280
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:08,400
things beautiful and certain animals, for example, beautiful. And they also find some ugly. And this

281
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,200
is an important point to make because something that might be said is, well, you know, you find all

282
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,280
these beautiful things in nature just because we're trained that whatever is natural is beautiful.

283
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,840
Absolutely not. Although most of nature manages to remain extremely beautiful, there are certainly

284
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,120
lots of things in nature that are just plain ugly. And in the book, I'm afraid I draw attention to the

285
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:39,520
rather unattractive features of the shoe build stalk, I seem to remember. There it is, it's an

286
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,680
entirely natural bird creation, but it's not a very attractive one, I think to most people.

287
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,360
So I think they're intrinsic and also goodness. I mean, goodness is obviously culturally determined

288
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,800
to a point. But this can be exaggerated. I mean, there are very few cultures in the world

289
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:08,720
where it's considered good to murder and rape. In fact, beauty too is far more culturally universal

290
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:16,080
than is made out by people who want to impress on us that it's simply made up. Most Eastern

291
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,280
peoples, Chinese and Japanese, for example, find no problem whatever in enjoying the works of art in

292
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,520
Western works of art in our museums, coming to the plays of Shakespeare, we find no problem at all

293
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:39,440
in going to in the beauty of their art and their culture. So and interestingly, it's also true that

294
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,520
things can be found that quite specifically mean things that are intrinsic. So for example,

295
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:55,920
certain intervals and shapes and melodies in an Indian raga can be understood by Norwegians who

296
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,720
know nothing about Indian music. If they're asked to say, what is it that this is expressing,

297
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,000
they are remarkably similar to what an Indian listener trained would say that was being expressed.

298
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,240
So I mean, that's a scientifically verified result. So I think it's like so many things

299
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:24,160
that you can have a basic understanding of something. But what we can do is help it to

300
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,360
flourish and grow in beneficial directions. And this is a little bit like anything that grows,

301
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:38,960
a plant. A plant can grow and will grow anyway. But a gardener can actually make plants thrive more

302
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,280
and can make them grow to another shape or to another size or to another color. So there is a

303
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:51,680
way in which whatever is there can be trained by us. But that doesn't mean that it's made up by us.

304
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,600
I believe that Goethe is right when he says that everything properly considered and appreciated

305
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,240
by us calls out in us the faculty with which we can appreciate it. And so for example,

306
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,080
you talked about music, and I imagine your experience is the same as mine, that when one

307
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,520
starts learning to love music, one loves certain things that one perhaps still loves, but one

308
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,760
can't necessarily immediately respond to other things that as one learns more and more, the faculty

309
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,040
in us to appreciate them grows. And the deepening of value, one way to think about human development,

310
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,120
the human development is just that maturation, if you will, is this deepening of creation of

311
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,240
more and more value. And it's not, it's not the making up more things to care about. It's the

312
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,680
getting deeper in touch with reality. It's actually deepening to this field of value.

313
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,080
And again, from a human development perspective, it does seem that it's a disposition that is deeply

314
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:04,560
rooted values. And that a lot of what occurs is just the absence of support for that skill and

315
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,640
things that counteract it, which is to say anti-value. So preference, like preference

316
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,640
falsification is the root of advertising. And advertising suffuses our environment. So there's

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,440
a intentional thing in our culture to actually disrupt the ability to truly perceive value.

318
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,040
So it's a thing that we need to think about, like how do we protect ourselves from being confused

319
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,240
and then sit and appreciate how does that actually work? Even just the ability to hold

320
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,120
attention for a long period of time is necessary for certain levels of appreciation of value and

321
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:52,640
beauty. Which is another reason why attention is a moral act, as we have called this series,

322
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,640
which is a phrase that I think I use in both the master and his emissary and the master of things.

323
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,480
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm right there. But the implication also, another implication,

324
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,440
kind of a question is, so therefore, if we really downgrade value exception,

325
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,400
like let's say value collapses at the center of culture, which is what you could say is occurring,

326
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:27,280
that we've kind of burnt off the fumes of pre-modernity and we're running out of

327
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:37,360
center of value and even the ability to then perceive value. That's very dangerous. Like if

328
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,760
part of what evolution has been is adapting us to perceive and relate to value. If we cut off

329
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,000
that ability, then we become evolutionarily non adaptive, which means we go extinct. So another

330
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,200
place that this work that I'm doing is the relationship between value and existential

331
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,720
risk and civilization on the rise, which is that the patterns you're pointing to

332
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,720
are actually deep generator functions of existential risk. If you will, let me drop

333
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,320
into that. Okay. I'm saying like the inability to see the simplification of problem to narrow

334
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,480
metric. This characterization of a complex thing as a complicated thing that could be fixed,

335
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,920
but actually you can't. All those characteristics are things that are

336
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,360
leading us to a point in civilization that is treacherous. There's an urgency,

337
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,520
I see it as an educational urgency, to figure out how to rebalance the hemisphere. And that's

338
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,720
why I'm focusing on value exception. What can we actually do to allow ourselves to perceive

339
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,400
what's actually valuable again? Because we're clearly very confused about what value is.

340
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,360
If we've been brought to a place where our civilization is about to self-destruct,

341
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,480
and AI is a great example. The core of the AI risk is the alignment problem, which is a value

342
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,320
alignment problem. So that's me kind of saying help us save civilization, Ian.

343
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,360
How do we learn to perceive value again so that we know?

344
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:21,360
Thanks. Yes, I can't remember who it is, but you can probably tell me in Silicon Valley who said

345
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,560
that, yes, the way AI is going will probably render us extinct, but it'll be very good for

346
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,280
the economy in the meantime. And that perhaps sums up the left hemisphere's approach to these

347
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,920
things. It only understands power, control, utility, and as a sort of subset of that pleasure,

348
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,080
which is assumed to be what these things give. Although, by the way, they don't.

349
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,480
People who have as much power as you can conceivably imagine lead unhappy, anxious lives.

350
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:02,320
But there we are. I can tell you for free as a psychiatrist. But yes, how do we get back on

351
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,640
course? Well, partly, of course, you won't be surprised to hear me say that

352
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,720
even below the fixing of values is this business of the hemisphere balance, because you mentioned

353
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,920
there the idea of a complicated machine that can be fixed versus a complex system, which is

354
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:29,120
the difference being that a complex system is intrinsically indeterminate. It is intrinsically

355
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:37,280
free. It is intrinsically not controllable. It is intrinsically able to move in a way that we

356
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,800
can't actually program. So that is, that is a kind of slap in the face to the those who hold

357
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,280
this left hemisphere view that we can make ourselves all powerful. And to me, the most

358
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,960
heinous thing that has happened in the last 200 years, or perhaps even since the enlightenment,

359
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,920
is this belief that we can control everything, that we have power. And if only we could have

360
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,840
humility enough to understand how little we know, how little we really understand what we're dealing

361
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:17,920
with, and how helpless we will be in the face of things that we are now setting loose, and then

362
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,640
if it might not be too late to do something about it. So regaining some sense of humility and

363
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,040
awe before what it is we're seeing, respect for these things, not the whole idea that we

364
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,560
make them all up, of course, is a version of this idea that we are the creators of everything we

365
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:50,720
see. We are the creators of all that we experience. Excuse me, we are not. We are the receivers,

366
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:58,720
we are the grateful or should be grateful recipients of some enormous gift that we only

367
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,400
partly understand. And we have a responsibility to respond to that. That's the root of

368
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,680
responsibility is this idea you have to respond to something. And that that something is calling

369
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:22,160
to us to behave in a different way. So obviously, one of the things I would say is that we need to

370
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,160
open up the minds of those who are both now in control and will control our futures

371
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,240
to the idea of we don't understand this, we don't know what it is, but let us find the good in it,

372
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,920
the beautiful in it, and what is true about it. Because at the moment, I don't think there's ever

373
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,280
been a period since recorded time that I know of when truth has been so profoundly

374
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,160
travested. And with the development of AI, it's going to be almost impossible for education,

375
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,200
for the law, for politics to function if we don't know whether something is a video clip that is

376
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,000
made up by a computer showing a politician saying things he never said. When we get to that, and how

377
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,680
do we know that the children or the young people we're teaching have really understood anything

378
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,960
if they can generate an essay that will satisfy an examiner. And it's going to negate all the

379
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,040
things on which a civilization is built. And what a civilization is for is to guarantee that we are

380
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,200
better at seeing the beautiful, the good, and the true, which to me are with the sacred, which

381
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:46,160
goes above it, is the most important value of all. Yeah, and this is one of the central risks that

382
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,520
people don't see in terms of catastrophic risk, is the true collapse of culture and truth at this

383
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,960
in value. Because what occurs there is basically, I'm not going to steal Benito Roy's thunder,

384
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,320
but basically it's a schizophrenic break at the level of culture where the entire culture gets

385
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:13,680
out of touch with the ability to perceive value. And AI is the thing that could perpetrate that

386
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,560
break. I wonder too, though, about the relationship between depression and the hemispheres and

387
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,480
traumatic experience in the hemispheres. So part of me is like, okay, you think you can control the

388
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,960
world, and you kind of pretend you can for a while until it slaps you in the face and something

389
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,160
occurs that forces your identity to reorient. Because I'm thinking like, what is the actual human

390
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:45,040
development process when someone actually reorients their basic hemispheric dominance pattern?

391
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,880
Maybe that's too simple a way to think. But I wonder if, you know, at various points in history

392
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:00,640
where we seem to step in and speak from, you know, the master, more times, sometimes after

393
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,720
very hard lessons were learned. And so I'm wondering if one of the things that will reawaken the

394
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,560
perception of value is actually the occurrence of catastrophe and tragedy?

395
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Yes, I think that's right. And I wouldn't cast it myself in terms of depression, trauma and the

396
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,160
hemispheres. Because that's just too complicated. I mean, I think there's something in it. And you

397
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,960
know that I devote a whole chapter in the matter of things to showing what the correspondences are

398
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,320
between a left hemisphere dominated picture of the world and a right hemisphere deficient

399
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:49,920
picture of the world. And that of the subject of schizophrenia. So that is very much like

400
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,120
left hemisphere overdrive. And it's been commented before I drew these parallels by people like

401
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,760
Louis Sass, that something seems to be happening to our culture, which is rather like what happens

402
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,040
in schizophrenia. And of course, schizophrenia is a very distressing condition, which often

403
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,480
does lead individually to suicide. I believe that we are actually pursuing our own suicide

404
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,320
very rapidly at the moment, we're disemboweling our culture and destroying all the good in it.

405
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:25,600
We are disemboweling and destroying the beauty and the the vibrance of nature. And we've turned

406
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:32,160
our backs on the sacred and the divine and said that these are just childish fantasies,

407
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,480
whereas they're probably the most important realities that they're not easy to find for us

408
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,000
now. So I don't disrespect somebody who can't find them and can't see what is meant by them.

409
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,480
And indeed, I think that the talk about them is quite problematic. And no doubt,

410
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I'll talk to someone else in another session about that. But nevertheless, I think these values are

411
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,520
hugely important to me are losing them. It might be worth just mentioning, because I think it's

412
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:07,760
something helpful to me, I found, which is Schäler's pyramid of values. I'm talking here,

413
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:16,720
not about Schiller, but Schäler, Max Schäler, S-C-H-E-L-E-R, who was an early 20th century

414
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,720
German phenomenological philosopher, said by Heidegger to be the brightest philosopher in Europe

415
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:30,720
of his generation. And he wrote about values in a way that Heidegger himself didn't,

416
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,680
nor actually did, Victor Constantine to the same extent. Although in culture and value,

417
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,520
I find he writes beautifully about these things. But in any case, Max Schäler had a pyramid of

418
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,720
values, a hierarchy, and at the bottom were those of use, i.e. utility and pleasure,

419
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:59,440
and then somewhat above that were what he called the labents, that are the values of life. And he

420
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:07,360
meant by these things like generosity and courage and magnanimity and loyalty. And then above that

421
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,200
came effectively what he called the geistige, that are meaning either the intellectual, the spiritual

422
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,080
values, which are, I believe, beauty, goodness, and truth, principally. And other values that you

423
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,800
might mention are effectively derivative from either beauty, goodness, or truth, that we value

424
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,320
them because we think they are either good, or we think they're beautiful, or we think they're true.

425
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,840
And then on the top of this pyramid was the sacred. And what I suggest is that in our own time,

426
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,480
we have inverted this pyramid so that the left hemisphere's value is at the top,

427
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:50,000
that of utility, and the other ones are said to be simply in service utility. That is the vision

428
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,280
of the materialist reductionists who until recently have held the floor in the universities.

429
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,480
That, thank goodness, is changing. There is a wonderful move of foot I see in philosophy,

430
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:11,600
I see in biology, that people see that this very simplistic, mechanistic vision is gone.

431
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:19,200
It's over. It just doesn't work. Yeah, thank you for all that. That was intriguing. I'd been saying

432
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,440
for some time that we were dealing with basically a suicidal culture that was running and overdrive

433
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,560
down into those patterns. So it's like this from getting too much into that. But your enumeration

434
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:41,360
there of the hierarchy of values gets into Jonathan's point about values versus value,

435
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,600
and is there some structure to the organization of first principles and first values? Like the

436
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,800
core of the work that I'm doing at the differential wisdom is that enumerating first

437
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,960
principles and first values from a perspective of continuity with evolution itself, so that

438
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,720
there are some values which are periphery, which occur locally, and then there are other values

439
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,760
which are so core that we can actually say that we share them with like animals, and that we share

440
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:17,920
them perhaps with cells. That value pre-exists us, then there's a continuity of value that we

441
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:26,240
participate in. And so things like harmony. Like harmony is expressed very early in physics,

442
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,600
where you either get to land or you do not work. And if you think of multicellular organisms

443
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,760
or complex organisms, a lot of what's occurring there is complex systems of

444
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,880
interest, harmonious things. Humans start to use speech, they start to try to name values,

445
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,200
and you get something like justice or fairness as a continuation of this dimension of. So that's

446
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:01,520
some of the thing we're doing there. What emerges is that there's a paucity of language of evaluation

447
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,960
in our culture. So this is Charles Taylor makes, he talks about languages of strong

448
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,840
evaluation, being the core of the culture together. And that means a language of shared value. We

449
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,360
talk about a universal grammar of value is absent. We kind of have a grammar to talk about

450
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,000
mathematics and science and all of these other things, but when we get together and we try to

451
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,920
have a conversation about value, our tongues are tied. And especially when we've got our culture.

452
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,040
So there's this need to create some new languages of value, I think.

453
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,440
How much do you think that depends on the level at which one is talking about value?

454
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:57,360
And I've sort of set up a kind of an idea of certain values such as beauty, goodness and truth.

455
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:07,200
And it would almost make no sense to say up to a point about these things. We just do think beauty

456
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,520
is good. We do think goodness is good. We do think the truth is good. It's almost a tautology.

457
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:20,560
But if you start talking about the values that we hold as a society and one may go back to

458
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,920
the call of the French Revolution. And these sound like a very good start.

459
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,040
But immediately one finds oneself and this is where one might get tongue tied and there might be

460
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:40,160
conflicts is but what exactly do we mean by these things and in what context and how much and for whom.

461
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:48,640
So liberty is on the face of it highly desirable and I certainly wouldn't admire a culture in

462
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:56,000
which there was no liberty. But obviously utterly untrammeled liberty is anarchy and restraints and

463
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,920
constraints within reason are very important and we have mature societies able to balance

464
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,120
those things. And you know it's true of egality and fraternity. You know what exactly does one

465
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,960
mean by them? Are they always necessarily good in all contexts or do we have to finesse them?

466
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,680
And I think that's what I would think is the difficulty about values themselves.

467
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
Perhaps the only way in which one can

468
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,240
resurrect the good sense of values is in fact by looking at societies that have been stable

469
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,160
for a long time and produced that harmony that you thank you for mentioning that because I think

470
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,920
it's terribly important and it's not only a very important idea in physics but also as you point

471
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:56,400
out in biology and also of course it was foundational in Greek thinking you know from Pythagoras onwards.

472
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,280
And some of those things you can see like it's a yes and you can hear it.

473
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,960
Yeah so it's just it's a remarkable and suffuses I remember this quote by

474
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,320
Whitehead again where he says you know the circle haunts the universe like a ghost and what he was

475
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,720
talking about was just the presence of universals amongst the flux. And so harmony is harmony kind

476
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,960
of haunts evolution at all stages and we yearn for it like in our in our societies we want

477
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:32,400
harmony and it's interesting that. And what Harmony points out is it's all in relations.

478
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,760
It's not unison it's relations between things but beautiful and generous relations that work

479
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:47,920
together to produce only good and beautiful sound. So you know we talk about other species

480
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,880
and humans and one and you talked about how harmony seems to be very much a kind of human

481
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,960
conception I think you hinted that at any rate I hope I'm not misquoting you. But it is also true

482
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,000
that you know birds sing but in essence they sing competitively but only humans can sing

483
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:15,280
in harmony and attune their voices to one another. So this is I mean there's so much

484
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,320
that one can regret about humanity but the trouble with this is that it leads to a kind of

485
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:27,920
disparagement of everything that humanity can be and we need to preserve the ideal of what a human

486
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,360
being and a human life and a human society can be what its meaning is at the same time as being

487
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:41,600
highly critical of many of the things that it's now interpreted as involving and this comes down

488
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:47,680
to my basic point and the reason I wrote the matter of things is that we no longer understand

489
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,240
what a human being is what the world is and what we're hearing it for.

490
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,200
And that's very unfortunate. That's very unfortunate. I believe in the in the Master's

491
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,040
Emissary you cited that research that the vocal cords were more developed before the

492
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,840
language centers so the very first humans communicated mostly through song basically

493
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:17,840
that there was this kind of even state where there was this harmonic vocalization of somewhat

494
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,280
sapient you know bipedal creatures who were basically singing together before they were speaking

495
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,040
and that the function of language the function of language to be denotative and descriptive

496
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,680
piggybacked on the use of the vocal cords for basically harmony.

497
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,920
Well you know I mean this is I have to rely here quite a lot on anthropologists

498
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,440
but there is a prominent school of anthropologists who certainly believe this even my than being one

499
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:55,040
of the most best known exponents of it but what I think is nice is that there is very good

500
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,840
if you like paleo anatomical reasons for believing that this is the case and from the examination

501
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:12,320
of animals that their ability to vocalize and so on the nature of their skulls and their ribcages

502
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:19,040
too much to explain now but it's in the Master and his Emissary but what I love about it is that

503
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:27,440
it inverts this assumption that of course all the business is done with language and music is just

504
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,800
some frivolous exaptation of language but actually it turns out that the science is on the side that

505
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,560
music comes first and that language is a useful exaptation of music.

506
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,000
Exactly that's the idea and were we being stopped was that a bell to intervene Jonathan?

507
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,120
No no it's just that I'm part of my um hopelessly a tech world there's a grandfather clock sitting

508
00:55:53,120 --> 00:56:00,480
just in the next house so it was just yeah. I am ready to I am ready to come in like but carry on for

509
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,320
now. Yeah I mean it's just a very it's a very deep point about what society ought to be like

510
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,520
in things that in fact we listen. It's a knell that summons us to heaven or to hell sorry no

511
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,000
sorry it's like carry on. It's a very pivotal moment in the conversation now.

512
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,880
So the point is both that we misunderstand theoretically the function of language thinking

513
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,920
that its primary function is denotative and descriptive when in fact there's a deeper

514
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:36,880
function which is the resonance that allows for between us. As someone who's done some clinical

515
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,200
work when you listen to someone speak you're often not listening to what they say you're

516
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:47,040
listening to the tone and tenor and anxiety or absence of anxiety and the prosody and the

517
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,520
pace of their speech and all the musical tones basically not the content and in fact the mismatch

518
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:59,040
between content and that underlying musicality is a sign to pay attention to so it's just

519
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,800
interesting to think that in fact we something as basic as language we're not we're missing the

520
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,480
hemispheres are allowing us to misunderstand suddenly and that you know harmony suffuses

521
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:19,360
this organism and it is resonates with it and yeah the chanting and the music

522
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,840
and then the notion that in the human the value of harmony becomes aware of itself

523
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,040
and so we actually arrange and this is the kind of an interesting note that runs through a couple

524
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:37,280
of places in the matter of things that there's a something that occurs with the human as an

525
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,400
evolutionary emergent where value and consciousness become aware of themselves in ways that they were

526
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,760
not previously and this is a big I think that's a really important point and it goes back to my

527
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,720
idea which I think is absolutely constant with my understanding of whitehead which is that whatever

528
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:07,920
we mean by god the creative force logos li burta whatever it may be and that is bringing the cosmos

529
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:15,200
into being and the cosmos is bringing it further into being so that each is unfolding and discovering

530
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,400
more of its potential in this dynamic relationship it's not a story of a static something that just

531
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:29,680
is or of two static some things but of a twofold relationship in which something is ever more

532
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,120
coming into being that seems to be at the center of creation and if there's one thing one can say

533
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,480
about the cosmos it is that it is creative in this way that is one of the primary values if

534
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:48,320
like of the cosmos is simply to make things happen to differentiate out of an enormously

535
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,480
potential unity all that that potential means when it's unfolded and then to refold it again into a

536
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,080
now enriched unity which then carries on this process it's an alternation and of course this

537
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:13,360
is very much in keeping with david bone's idea of the implicit order the explicit order and then

538
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:19,760
being re unfolded into the implicit yeah we speak of evolving evolving value or evolving eternal

539
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:28,880
value yes yes that yes to think about it and in the cabalester tradition there's a saying that

540
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,680
there's more god to come which is basically i i didn't know that if you if you can give me the

541
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,640
reference to that because i'm very keen on the cabala and i've never heard that but i argue of

542
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,560
course that the cabala actually sees that um you know that whatever is the ground of being ends off

543
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,760
is actually coming into being yeah now that's the root of this work because it's the collaboration

544
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,920
with rabbi gaffney and ken wilber both esotericists and gaffney's gaffney's command of the cabalistic

545
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,040
literature you know and and it's part of the through line of the matter with things is the

546
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:11,760
line back through shelling uh you know through bohem to the renaissance basically christian

547
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:19,520
and metaphysics has to be implicit there which is of this is the where god invests in the

548
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:25,520
cosmos the ability to basically further the divine to create new god and so as something

549
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:33,360
like harmony falls or beauty evolves um the intensification of the value evolves forever

550
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,960
and we participate in that self-aware you're creating a value so it's a it's a kind of we

551
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,160
either participate in it or fail to do so and that is the tragedy that at the moment we're

552
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:54,080
failing to do you say right thank you second ian if you i mean i i'm aware that you guys can talk

553
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,160
for hours further and uh i hope you will at some point and i'm very glad you've met and i i feel

554
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,560
very validated by the decision to bring you together and i hope it's the first of many

555
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:12,480
conversations because i'm aware that you're um you share depths um and common interests that are uh

556
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,480
uh are are sometimes esoteric and are sometimes extremely difficult but of fundamental importance

557
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,920
and um you know you're both first principles thinkers in a way that the world currently needs

558
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,120
so i'm very grateful to to have you here and bring you together but i'm also conscious we have 330

559
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:36,160
odd people um some of whom are keen to ask you things um i will before i'll ask you something

560
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:43,680
myself first but just to allow the audience to sort of warm up i am keen as a point of

561
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,760
principle in these sessions that we try and ask a question about what's just being spoken of

562
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:58,720
um not to revert back to the gochus 101 as i say um of course uh you may have you may have more

563
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,480
fundamental queries but it would be good because you've just shared something together that we

564
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:10,720
that we focus on what we've heard um with that in mind i am feeling significantly clearer about

565
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:18,400
my sort of quam inquiry earlier vis a vis the mapping of the relationship between

566
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:25,280
value values and and so on um but i'm also curious about something that is sort of

567
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,120
point related to that and it came up last in the last session too for all the bashing of the

568
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,000
left hemisphere and and i know you you you're quite famous for saying that the left hemisphere is your

569
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,640
second favorite hemisphere um and that it's you know it's one to be loved and cherished and it

570
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,640
shouldn't be you know knocked down i i i feel this work that i feel responsible for and the

571
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,440
perspective is engaged in of working with first principles thinkers like yourselves

572
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,920
trying to make sense of what they're really saying philosophically about the nature of

573
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:04,960
reality and our capacity to know it maybe love it um relate to it there is a certain um dignified

574
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:11,440
beautiful role for the left hemisphere in taking a few moments as emissary just to get clear about

575
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,440
what exactly the master's saying right absolutely and that's why when i occasionally feel almost

576
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:24,000
guilty like when i part of me has a kind of weird socio epistemic guilt about trying to map these

577
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,720
things mentally in a kind of cartography because i feel shouldn't i just be presencing

578
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,720
shouldn't i just be with this shouldn't i be playing some music or doing some art here

579
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,240
instead i'm trying to sort of craft out with these words in a bubble chart how they link

580
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,040
together and i think no surely it's not that nonetheless what i was trying to get at is that

581
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:48,240
you you mentioned shellers hierarchy or or rather structure thereof of the sacred giving rise to

582
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,840
sort of fundamental truth beauty and goodness and then you make mention of this more derivative

583
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:02,640
values um and that's useful but what i what i was left wondering is if value is primordial

584
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:08,880
and pre-human and in some sense something that life is for for us to be in relationship with

585
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:14,640
as you argue in the book you go on to have a chapter on the sacred but help me out here with

586
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,600
the distinction not between values plural and the sacred but values singular and the sacred

587
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,480
how can we make a distinction between them that's useful to make sense of what's being said here

588
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:33,680
first of all i should just comment that shaler doesn't imply that um the sacred gives rise to

589
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,280
the next lower line of the pyramid and so on down to utility and he simply says that there is a

590
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:49,520
hierarchy of values and that um some are simply more important than others they are more central

591
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:58,720
if you like to the business of leading a fulfilled human life and what i would say my answer to it

592
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,440
also touches on what you've just said about the importance of the left hemisphere that it's good

593
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:10,400
that it should um as it were question and and try and make clearer to itself what it is that the

594
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,960
master is talking about but it has to do so knowing that at the end of the day whatever it

595
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,240
can come up with for short of whatever it is the master is saying so the process is useful in that

596
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,880
things come out of it but at the end of the day it's not going to have an equivalent map and say

597
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,760
ah i've got the master's message now and it's all this because that would automatically be wrong

598
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:38,160
so having said that and what i think we can see is that the sacred is something that is dark

599
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:48,480
um it's the mystics talk about it as a kind of visible darkness a light that's so bright that in

600
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:57,040
fact for us it is invisible and penetrable or unknowable now if that is the case what happens

601
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:04,720
is that when it passes through a prison we can then perhaps begin to see it it it the light is

602
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:12,640
somehow um softened felted and the prison through which that light of the sacred comes is the one

603
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:20,480
that generates in my view beauty goodness and truth that these are manifestations of it that

604
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:28,000
the creation can respond to and that are its principal lures that are calling to us to to to

605
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,360
go to it does that help i mean it's beautiful before i can decide whether it has utility in the

606
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:41,600
sense of helping um so already i'm feeling the feeling the right sort of relative importance

607
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:47,040
of things um it does help and i don't it doesn't need to be pristine there was a moment i i shared

608
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:53,920
this with zack prior to the call um many of you will know uh george lackoff and his work on sort of

609
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,520
the representation of um concepts predict being embodied and sort of often often grounded

610
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,040
in metaphors of the body so you know an idea is big for an idea is big for example or um

611
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:14,560
you can um you know you can play with notions of of something being a long shot you know and

612
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,320
there's these sort of expressions which get at the idea that the way the mind organizes itself

613
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,600
conceptually is through these spatial metaphors and i found myself having a moment reading your

614
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:29,680
chapter 26 where i was going okay so you've got this value that's sort of primordial and

615
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:36,800
pre-human and fundamental and then you have love which comes up and you speak about the

616
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,480
relationship between love and then you have meaning and you have purpose and not just

617
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,960
any old purpose but cosmological teleological purpose and and i'm trying my mind to actually

618
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,640
see this in space so i had this moment of sort of you know um whatever that's called

619
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,120
edictic imagery or whatever that word is for this sort of thing in your mind and i was trying to

620
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,120
sort of right trying to picture that in my mind and i suddenly realized how absurd the whole thing

621
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:07,680
was in the sense that i couldn't possibly capture it because it somehow was as you say

622
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,720
always going to be an inadequate representation of what was actually being described and it was

623
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,960
very useful it was almost it was a it was a sort of micro spiritual experience of sorts because

624
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,680
there was a definitely a sense of these fundamental features of the universe love truth beauty goodness

625
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:31,360
value the sacred meaning purpose there's a lot of them right it's a family and and and you've said

626
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:36,000
before the vis-a-vis the mogulcus maneuver just as the one as many the many as one so it's not true

627
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,600
that they're all the same there and there's one sense the same and another sense they're not

628
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,960
and when you try and hold that in your mind and actually see how they map together is if it was

629
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:51,440
some kind of flowchart the only answer is a kind of laughter because it doesn't really work and it's

630
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,320
a liberation in some ways that it doesn't work and yet there's still a part of me that's a little

631
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:03,840
bit uneasy and i'm curious if anyone else feels that way well and if Zach or Zach or Ian has anything

632
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,600
to comment before other people come in i'll start looking at people's questions now while you're

633
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:14,480
answering that okay well i i'd just like to respond since well it's your point is it is

634
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:22,320
aimed at what i've been saying i suppose and i i i agree with that that idea that there seem to be

635
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:32,240
a family of these things but another way of looking at it is that i didn't put love in as a value

636
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:42,880
because i think love is the grounding the nature of being whatever and the sacred is our sense of

637
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:52,480
that ground of being and you could say that that ground of being and call it god whatever

638
01:09:52,480 --> 01:10:02,800
one wants to call it but the ultimate essence of of the creation of of the cosmos is itself

639
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:09,280
purposeful that it in general it generates automatically not as an extra thing not as a

640
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:16,720
sort of subsequently now i'm going to have a purpose but it is purposive love is purposive

641
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:27,760
it is ultimately aimed towards something that it's it's directed it is relational automatically

642
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,520
but i wouldn't again make relation another separate thing the trouble is that we're so

643
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:41,440
in hoc to things and i almost called this book there are no things because it isn't a thing

644
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,960
truth and beauty and goodness but what we're really trying to adumbrate is the nature of this

645
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:56,000
loving core that is in itself true that is in itself beautiful what it does is automatically

646
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,560
good although that is something that theologians could dispute for is it good because god automatically

647
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,760
goes there or does god go there because it's good you know and so forth but what i'm really

648
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:14,080
saying in brief is that these are different unfoldings of a single element the multiplicity is

649
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:21,840
the many strands that do nothing to um in any way imperil the integrity of the whole but in fact

650
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:29,280
enhance it okay the closest the closest thing would be like a field right so we speak of a field

651
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,640
there's a unified field of value but it's not featureless yes basic property by field would be

652
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,600
eros we talk about eros so we talk about cosmorodic humanism in which eros is the foundational

653
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,680
field root of value but then all of these values differentiate out but some have existed

654
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:55,760
since the big bang and others are more or more recent but yeah they're not things and therefore

655
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,400
when you flow chart them and even when you try to sequence them in a strict way you can't

656
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:08,240
um the left hemisphere will do that at lower moral stages of development but maturity as

657
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:14,400
deepening into value perceptions sees inevitable value conflict and again it's not a harmonious

658
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,400
picture in its totality whitehead speaks about the the intensification of polarities not about

659
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,320
everything getting better but about the intensification of the polarities and dynamics of

660
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:35,280
values all co-evolving in tension right erotic kind of like basically self-disclosure

661
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:46,000
so erotic self-disclosure okay um i i i'm very good in a flash yeah yeah the questions the questions

662
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,680
are very good um and we'll come to them very quickly moving swiftly along so um i'm conscious that

663
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,120
we may not get through all of them but we're going to try and get to the best ones at least

664
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:03,200
i'm also conscious that for many who are of a philosophical mindset um some of this discussion

665
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:09,440
will have been delicious and um exactly the kind of their staple diet if you like but for others

666
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,400
we're more practical mindset perhaps less philosophically um you know adept it can seem

667
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,240
a little abstract so i have a really good question here which is principally for zack actually although

668
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,800
i'm sure you will have thoughts on it and because i happen to know that zack has written a great

669
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,640
deal about propaganda and thought about it at length and written about it on the conciliants

670
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,560
project website and we're in a time of intense propaganda zack the question here is from kevin

671
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,760
cotwas if i've said that correctly and he just says can you talk about the weaponization of value

672
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:48,560
in propaganda and uh i'm sure he has thoughts too but if you could begin yeah i mean a few things

673
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,320
to say there one and i mentioned already that preference falsification being the foundation

674
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,680
of advertising just clarify what you mean by that because i didn't quite get at the first

675
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:04,080
falsification when you think you value something but you actually don't truly value it you've kind

676
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:12,960
of been tricked into valuing it sometimes through coercion sometimes through uh tricks of psychology

677
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:20,320
so so it's like preference falsification is the goal of psychology excuse me of advertising

678
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,240
advertising was one of the main places where psychology was operationalized after world war

679
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:32,480
two coming out of large-scale propaganda programs that were built during the cold war and so you're

680
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:38,800
looking at a science of persuasive communication and if everything we're saying is true about the

681
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:44,320
intrinsic nature of value and the way the human nervous system responds to value then if i'm trying

682
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,360
to get you to do something and i'm a psychologist and i know that then the first thing i do is

683
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:57,040
manipulate your value systems and your value preferences so without even speaking about

684
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:06,800
propaganda just staying on advertising we can see that the saturation of that kind of persuasive

685
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,720
to the point of being coercive style of communication uh is one of the things that

686
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:19,520
has undermined our ability to perceive actual value right so that's the idea that if you're

687
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,280
if you're succeeding as an advertiser you're not just getting them to value what

688
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:29,280
you want them to value like coca-cola right like why did we drink coca-cola right it's actually bad

689
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,600
for you but people really want to drink coca-cola the main reason you want to drink coca-cola is

690
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,080
because of advertising and they're incredibly they've been doing it for decades and they're very

691
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:46,320
good at it it's very subtle so the making you want something making you perceive value but it's not

692
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,160
actually value just to play devil's advocate for coca-cola here i feel like i'm on the bbc or

693
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,920
something trying to be impartial i mean all all know how that goes but i was going to say it's

694
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,760
not just caffeine and sugar don't i just want the caffeine and sugar and some some some sweeteners

695
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,760
yes but that's again part of the falsification of value what you want is to feel good

696
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,520
what you actually want is to feel good and the falsification of value goes right down into

697
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:18,000
your actual body and limbic system and so like when so when we sent our boys over there with

698
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,200
world war two they were not in a position to position to really know geopolitically what was

699
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,600
going on they were in a position to have been told what was going on right and they fought for

700
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:34,560
their country with love with full flux of value as a result of propaganda and again propaganda

701
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,840
is very complex to discuss because there's a thin line between propaganda and education

702
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:48,240
and it becomes the evil twin of education is propaganda both of them piggyback on value

703
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:55,040
section both of them deploy strategies of getting you to value something right that's what i was

704
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,160
going to ask you zach that's why your question to ian earlier about how one begins to cultivate,

705
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:06,000
refine, develop the capacity for value section is culturally critical almost a matter of

706
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,640
civilizational survival and it doesn't just apply sort of in the classroom but you it also applies

707
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:19,360
more in the front line of culture influencing our everyday activity and then because values

708
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:27,040
are values they are also explicitly thematized reflectively by propagandists so like the culture

709
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:36,160
wars are a result of both sides trying to create conflict around value and values so to get that

710
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,960
one of the things that makes it hard to talk about values is that they've been subject to

711
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,880
in the united states to a kind of internal informational civil war where just like in the

712
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,560
30 years war the different visions of heaven and hell and other things were used by propagandists

713
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,280
to get the Protestants and the Catholics to really fear and hate one another similarly

714
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:06,560
digital propaganda is working us into a frenzy mostly along these value fall lines which are

715
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,880
identified and then cleaved and like salt is thrown on the wound and they're they're trying

716
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:21,120
to make value conflict as polarized and difficult as possible so there's tons to say but because

717
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,840
I know you have yeah you have no lack of things to say on propaganda and for those who are interested

718
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,800
if you go to the conciliants project there is I believe three very considered early day essays

719
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,080
on propaganda that Zach's written there maybe Michael if you can put that in the chat if you

720
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:42,480
can find it but it is there um Ian any thoughts on propaganda before we come on to other things

721
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:50,160
I think I think Zach covered it perfectly and I agree with him over and I thought the point about

722
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:55,280
education and propaganda being evil twins and sometimes being confused with one another

723
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,760
particularly important at the moment right I agree um this is quite a more refined sort of

724
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,240
philosophical question but a pretty important one because I've fallen into this trap myself

725
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:13,200
it's by Andrew M Davies or Davis sorry much of this conversation has bounced between aesthetic

726
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:20,720
and moral value a lot of bouncing whitehead makes the claim that moral order is merely

727
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:26,720
certain aspects of aesthetic order here aesthetic order is wider and deeper than moral value

728
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,200
how do you understand the here's the question how do you understand the relationship between

729
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:37,360
aesthetic and moral order is one more ontologically primitive than the other so it's an eight

730
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,160
and a plus for the question there Andrew what's the answer is that can Ian do you want to go first

731
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:50,640
yes okay um it's a good question and it's one that I do um tackle a bit in in the in the uh

732
01:19:50,640 --> 01:20:00,640
at least in in this chapter I think um beauty is a difficult one because you know I'm I'm a great

733
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:07,440
admirer of Keats but he did die when he was 26 and he was a poet um he wasn't on oath as a

734
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:13,280
philosopher as it were when he said that beauty is truth truth beauty this is all you know and

735
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:20,880
all you need to know um if it were as simple as that we wouldn't have two quite distinct terms

736
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:28,160
and the questioner wouldn't have used them um nor would whitehead have thought that these words

737
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,960
were worth preserving because I can think of things that are beautiful and definitely not good and I

738
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,560
can think of things that are good that are definitely not beautiful unless you I mean it's

739
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:46,800
always open to somebody to so twist the meaning of a word that it will now encompass but in the way

740
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:53,760
we normally use them they're different um so it causes caused me more trouble than anything to be able

741
01:20:53,760 --> 01:21:01,040
to um deal with these and it's interesting that whereas moral values seem much more distinctly

742
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:10,240
carved up between the right and left hemispheres as David Hecht at UCL says um the um the right

743
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:18,160
hemisphere basically deals in in good and and the left in in what is morally bad I mean that that

744
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:25,600
that's that's his words um or a paraphrase of them and and um so it's much easier whereas with the

745
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,560
with the matter of beauty both hemispheres do get involved with it and do contribute to it

746
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:37,840
although to go into the niceties of it I would take us too too long and too far I don't agree

747
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:45,920
in short um with whitehead on this particular point um uh Andrew uh knows that I'm a great white

748
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:53,680
hedion um but on this one I just can't really agree with it because it seems to me that in a way

749
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:02,160
we value beauty because ultimately it is good but we don't value good ultimately because it's

750
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:11,040
beautiful I that's the way I see it maybe that's a product of my um modern western european education

751
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,960
and a degree of Protestantism in the background that I've overlaid heavily with other strands

752
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,880
but I don't know that's my take on it what do you say is that I mean I'm not sure either but I think

753
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:29,040
about just the big three the good the true and the beautiful having been differentiated for quite a

754
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:34,720
long time uh so there's something to the value of that differentiation that in modernity they became

755
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:42,320
disassociated and you know you had science running running hegemonic over the over the good and the

756
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:48,560
true um but I also think of Kant and the structure of the three critiques right and then at the end

757
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:55,440
Kant basically is saying that you know it reduces down to this very complex form of aesthetic judgment

758
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,800
which is which is more than just the judgment of beauty it's also the ability to perceive the

759
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,400
teleological to basically to perceive value per se would be my reading of the third critique

760
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:14,320
in which case there is something that is neither of those three that's more deep so if I think

761
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:20,480
about the sacred I think sometimes that's just an intensification of all three at once and that

762
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:27,520
there's something like a deeper field of allurement or arrows that is primary to the emergence of

763
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:33,760
even the differentiation of those three and there's a story that um Weber tells and Habermas

764
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,600
tells about the differentiation of those value spheres after their pre-modern synthesis that

765
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:47,360
there was a time when they were merged in the idea of the sacred uh that slowly they were differentiated

766
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,200
out uh Habermas talks about the linguistification of the sacred and the differentiation out of those

767
01:23:53,200 --> 01:24:00,880
three and then eventually the asymmetry that emerged with uh the unbounded rationality of

768
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,600
modernity so that's me not really answering the question but talking about what I know about the

769
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:13,840
person um like what if I could just quickly um come back for a couple of things um the first

770
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:21,280
is that your um invocation of Kant shows perfectly what I mean by what one can achieve by redefining

771
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:28,080
what one means by beauty and because if you call this aesthetic then you are enlarging the meaning

772
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,640
beyond what most people normally use it to mean in order you know like Humpty Dumpty you're allowed

773
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:37,840
to do that but then have you really achieved anything by applying this particular term to it

774
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,240
and and the other is just to say that I think your illumination that the sacred is all the

775
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:48,400
three of these combined it's just perfect because this is what I was saying about the light being

776
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,480
differentiated through colored glass um but when the the colors are separated one doesn't call red

777
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:05,440
blue you know but nonetheless in the light they are together right and it occurs to me Zach um

778
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:09,200
and I know Ian you know Daniel Schmackenberger as well a little bit but Daniel has said in

779
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,280
a couple of his talks I've heard him say I don't know whether he still holds to this philosophically

780
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,920
but it's a very elegant line he says I wouldn't really care about goodness and truth if it wasn't

781
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:24,320
for beauty that was his way of putting it it was something about the charm and sort of um

782
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:31,200
intuitive elegance and attraction of beauty was sort of primary that it sort of drew you and you

783
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:36,880
know this is how I understand his claim and there was something about beauty that that was the prior

784
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,160
motivation to to look at goodness and truth I'm not saying it's right I'm not saying it's exactly

785
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,680
of how he means it but for what it's worth he said it and I find it quite quite an elegant

786
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:52,000
a proposition or provocation to to think about but Ian you've already answered adequately why

787
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,160
that might not be the whole story and likewise that yes and I want to get to some other questions

788
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:05,040
and I can see we still have let's see quite a few more Michael do you want to take a shot um and ask

789
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:14,320
it yourself yep yep I'm happy to Jonathan thanks for that um yeah so I guess my question stands

790
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:22,240
from the fact that I feel this view that is being put forth here that value is ontologically

791
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:29,360
fundamental if that was to take hold more broadly in society and culture I feel it could be very very

792
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:40,400
powerful like a very very powerful view to transform our way of relating to life um and I guess and

793
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,760
you know before I ask this question I'm aware that it might be my left hemisphere grasping

794
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,640
after certainty but I'm wondering and this is really for both of you Zach and Ian

795
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,520
how likely is it do you think that in time the the evidence for this will become more and more

796
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:05,200
compelling like do you see that the new scientific findings um will start to make a compelling case

797
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:10,160
for the fact that that we can actually quite convincingly say no value is ontologically

798
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:18,160
fundamental um Zach you mentioned about how we see maybe um in biology values that seem to be

799
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:25,680
existence existent out with any need for human beings to exist um so I'm kind of thinking in

800
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:37,680
those terms um yeah I'll leave out that and I have something to say first and then then use that

801
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:47,120
yeah sure go ahead um well as I always say prediction is is a fool's game but I don't

802
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:53,360
think that science will ever answer this question or shed a great deal of light on it it's a

803
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,960
philosophical question of a kind that science is not really equipped to answer I would say

804
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,600
and you know that's no disrespect to science but there are certain places

805
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:11,040
science won't take us profitably I think though that it may become more vivid to us when the

806
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:20,560
over sophisticated over technical over scientific way of conceiving ourselves has been blown away

807
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:31,360
by a collapse um some kind of cataclysm that will lead to suffering and here I

808
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:40,800
go back to something that I think uh Zach um was I think getting at when he talked about

809
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:47,520
or hinted at the idea that suffering might actually enable us to see certain things

810
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:54,480
that otherwise we wouldn't and I do think that in a paradoxical way but then you know that I

811
01:28:54,480 --> 01:29:02,640
profoundly believe in the coincidence of opposites that the um the way in which things will get better

812
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:12,240
is actually by getting worse that in doing that our our vision will become clearer our responses

813
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:19,040
will become more natural and we will see what matters and that that which matters to us and

814
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:25,600
which will enable us to survive will to be to be able to trust people and to achieve something

815
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:32,240
which really exemplifies goodness truth and beauty and I you might say but in circumstances of

816
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:39,040
dereliction would beauty matter and in the book I emphasize that the earliest human artifacts that

817
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:48,000
we know about are are beautiful and seem as um what was he called the chap who did 100 the

818
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,760
history of the world in 100 objects suddenly forgotten his name Neil um the the director

819
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:59,600
of the British Museum for heaven's sake what was he called I don't know anyway well anyway

820
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,480
you surely know about the history of the world in 100 objects anyway no yeah yeah yeah but not the

821
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:11,280
author no no okay I mean he's very well known but his name suddenly gone but anyway he he said

822
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,040
one of the things that he noticed was that when we first started making things the simplest you

823
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,640
know hand actors we required them to be beautiful as much as we required them to be of utility

824
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:32,080
right and I quote a a consultation on a school in Mexico where the parents in a very poor area

825
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,160
were going to be gifted with a school and they were asked what above all they would value in

826
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,760
that school and the first thing they said was that they wanted it to be beautiful

827
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,400
yeah I mean the return the return to value at the core of culture is inevitable if cultures

828
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:57,120
to survive that's one almost uh like a a symptom of the state of our civilization is the degree to

829
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:05,280
which we are removing value from the center of culture and what's interesting is that uh the

830
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:12,960
native disposition of the human is to respond to value still so we haven't been completely dehumanized

831
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,960
yet and there's evidence to show that like during natural disasters and when other things occur people

832
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:25,120
spontaneous spontaneously do heroic things they spontaneously collaborate that the number of

833
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,600
people who go completely sociopathic and actually much smaller than you'd think that our spontaneous

834
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,680
action under complete adrenal overload is basically to respond to immediate value and save that baby

835
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:40,560
and get this person water and just do what needs to be done so there's a fallback position of the

836
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:48,800
human nervous system that's involved to respond to basic value so I'm isn't green and paxton have

837
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,320
also demonstrated much to their surprise that the default position for us is to be honest

838
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:59,200
and that lying is actually stressful and difficult not that we are naturally deceitful

839
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,760
so I think these things are really important that you you've just said sorry and just just that we

840
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:12,400
have a few minutes left and I I've been brought to task and quite rightly for the genuine balance

841
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:18,800
in the questions and it was entirely because I hadn't seen askable questions um but I believe

842
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:25,120
there's one from clear I can't see you clear very easily on the screen but if you're there please

843
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,000
let it be known to us with a hand up and that will make it easier to find us

844
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,600
have find you I know what your question was roughly but it would be better if you can ask it in your

845
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:40,160
own voice it's early morning here and it's in Wellington New Zealand um and welcome

846
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:50,560
me thank you no it just sparked my attention was that um when you were saying I'm a PhD student

847
01:32:50,560 --> 01:33:00,240
and I'm I'm I'm dealing um with these topics and um I've very much focused on the idea that you

848
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:07,680
know of the paradigm shift to make consciousness fundamental to matter um and you know um matter

849
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,440
as secondary and consciousness as primary I'm looking at that issue um and then you said that

850
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:20,160
value is fundamental and I thought well how many things can be fundamental and if value and consciousness

851
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:26,320
are both fundamental um what's the relationship between the two of them and are the other um

852
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:33,520
qualities that are can be defined as fundamental good question and perhaps I could just have a

853
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:41,520
quick stab at that um uh I myself hold that consciousness is an ontological primitive and

854
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:49,680
that matter is an aspect of consciousness um but it seems to me that consciousness is intrinsically

855
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:55,840
relational that um consciousness is always consciousness towards or consciousness of

856
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:02,640
something else and therefore immediately comes into the question the nature of this

857
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:10,720
relationship and if it if there is a relationship um and maybe if one would say that it is intrinsic

858
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:16,320
and here I'm not multiplying entities but just saying these are other facets that one can talk

859
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:21,920
about about love love is intrinsically relational it is intrinsically beautiful it is intrinsically

860
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:31,040
good it's intrinsically true when it is a true love so that these things are I mean we get tied up

861
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:36,960
in in linguistic knots but it's not that there are a whole cupboard full of entities and we come back

862
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:43,040
to my point that there's a problem when we verify things whereas all we're really alluding to is

863
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:50,160
different qualities of this primal whatever it is that's would be my answer

864
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:58,880
Zach thank you Zach it's a very deep question um and as I alluded to before you know I would take

865
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:07,200
consciousness matter time space motion value as differentiations from an underlying field

866
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:12,560
which I would characterize probably as being a field of value if I had to pick one of them

867
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,680
which is interesting that again the basic root of the cosmos is like a desire like an

868
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:28,400
appetite like a wanting to be and so and then once you get after those the question is there's

869
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,400
some more fundamental set is one of the things that we're working on a limited set of first

870
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:37,920
principles and first values that would characterize cosmic evolution basically from the beginning

871
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,640
which we can either choose to self-consciously align with these first principles and values

872
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:49,280
of the cosmos or not and this is the view of cosmorodic humanism as we're articulating it recently

873
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:55,200
so I'm not clear how to I don't it's kind of above my philosophical pay grade to make the final

874
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:00,080
decision about about those fundamental categories but I but I do think like if I

875
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,520
that the list that Ian gave where you add consciousness and value to matter time space

876
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:13,600
and motion that's a very important basic list and the addition of value is just

877
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,400
one of the most important philosophical moves that that can be made in our culture today because

878
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:23,440
people kind of buy consciousness they're kind of even physicists are willing to buy consciousness

879
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:30,320
but the idea that the universe matters and has a purpose and that the universe responds to value

880
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:36,320
is intrinsically valuable is a little bit like that so the addition is just so critical I believe

881
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:44,400
and puts the press on puts the press on the the hardcore left view reductionist view it puts them

882
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:52,960
into a corner okay thank thank you Zach is that a good enough response to the question yes I will

883
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:58,880
ponder that but the the only thing is I was thinking is that matter time space of all three

884
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:05,520
dimensional activities or qualities and I'm just you know I always thought things like

885
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:15,520
consciousness value beyond maybe three dimensions so that's again a deep question Ian I have the

886
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:20,160
same similar experience while shifting between these things in the second volume yes that there's

887
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:25,680
there are different kinds of things going on that are all fundamental yes you're asking

888
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:33,920
a very deep question and my attempt to answer it very briefly will not be satisfactory but

889
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,640
what I would what I would say at the moment is this that

890
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:48,640
I believe that matter is a phase of consciousness that could be considered secondary to consciousness

891
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:54,160
or could just be a way in which consciousness can manifest under certain circumstances

892
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:59,120
its reason for doing so is to provide two things that consciousness can't which is

893
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:04,640
a degree of permanence and a degree of resistance and the degree of resistance and permanence up

894
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:11,520
related to one another and why resistance is important to creation would take me a long time

895
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,760
but it's a thing I deal with in the book and once you've got matter and it cannot

896
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:25,440
we cannot talk about anything material at all or imagine it without the need for time and space

897
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:32,000
so when people tell me that by some mathematical jiggery-poetry they find equations in which time

898
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,680
disappears I would say well you've just cut the rug from under science and indeed philosophical

899
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:43,120
discourse because without the existence of time we can't say anything know anything and we can't

900
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:50,560
rely on anything that we empirically experiment with and so we get into knots because of the

901
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:57,680
limitations of our language but also of our consciousness we're limited beings let's enjoy it

902
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:04,240
and let's celebrate it and but what we have is glorious and it's up to us to you know respond

903
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:10,640
well to what we've been given thank you Ian it's a great thought to end on being limited beings

904
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:16,960
time is one of our limitations and we were trying perspective or trying to be disciplined

905
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,600
about our 100 minute events 100 minute 100 minute moments we're thinking of calling them we're

906
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:27,760
still working on it internally but really glad that you've all shared this one with us and

907
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:34,160
there will be further events coming up we will have one in two weeks like I say we're not

908
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,840
quite certain who the mystery guest is but it's one of two people we're currently clarifying

909
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:44,000
that in the next couple of days that will become clear and and this will carry on for several

910
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,400
weeks and we the event is free and Perspectiva is a charity but if you've enjoyed this event and you

911
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:55,120
want to support our work please go to our website and there is a donate button there if you feel

912
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:00,240
like giving it additionally to allow us to carry on doing this kind of event carry on publishing

913
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:08,240
this kind of work and all that remains for me to say really is a very deep heartfelt thank you

914
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:16,960
to Ian McGillchrist and Zachary Stein thank you very much both of you thank you to David

915
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:22,240
and thank you for those who put questions in the chat if it could be saved and sent to me later

916
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:28,800
I'd like to see them because I'm very interested in new light on what I'm trying to illuminate myself

917
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,480
yes and yes thanks a lot for the questions and we'll hopefully see most of you again soon and

918
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:42,480
I think over and out thanks a lot take care and see you again soon
