WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
Listen, it's wonderful to see you all, all 334 and rising. I'm Jonathan Rison. I'm chief

00:10.680 --> 00:15.600
executive and co-founder of Perspectiva, who are putting on tonight's event. We're also

00:15.600 --> 00:19.900
very proud publishers of Ian's most recent book, The Matter With Things. I'm going to

00:19.900 --> 00:26.740
work on the assumption that you know Ian pretty well, but he is as well as a now quite famous

00:26.740 --> 00:32.740
author and I use quite there more in the North American sense of very rather than the sort

00:32.740 --> 00:42.720
of British sense of not so much. Really, you know, very much famous and celebrated writer

00:42.720 --> 00:48.420
and thinker with an increasingly international reputation. So it's no wonder that so many

00:48.420 --> 00:51.900
of you are here to see him.

00:51.900 --> 00:59.540
Tonight we're going to carry on our series called Attention as a Moral Act. And we've

00:59.540 --> 01:03.140
spoken already in the first session about what we meant by that. We might sort of reiterate

01:03.140 --> 01:08.980
it a little bit tonight. Some of you may know the first session was between Ian and I. We

01:08.980 --> 01:14.940
were sort of trying to reassert, reaffirm, reestablish the nature of Ian's most fundamental

01:14.940 --> 01:21.580
argument. We spoke a little bit about my own take on it, calling it the McGilchrist manoeuvre.

01:21.580 --> 01:26.220
And we tried to establish what that was. And we just more generally sort of updated ourselves

01:26.220 --> 01:32.700
prior to the plunge into the more specific aspects of the book. In the second session,

01:32.700 --> 01:38.460
we spoke with Zachary Stein, who had an amazing conversation with Ian about value as a fundamental

01:38.460 --> 01:47.380
feature of the cosmos. It was a very richly metaphysical, somewhat spiritual, fundamental

01:47.380 --> 01:51.220
conversation about the nature of reality. And we've had a great deal of positive feedback

01:51.220 --> 01:58.940
about it since. As some of you may know, in between our sessions, we also have bi-weekly

01:58.940 --> 02:03.020
connection and inquiry sessions, which are run by Michael and Lee, my colleagues. And

02:03.020 --> 02:07.300
so if you have questions or you want to have further conversations, you're welcome to just

02:07.300 --> 02:13.300
go to those events. And they're quite informal and you have a chance to reflect and do some

02:13.300 --> 02:19.700
practices and get to know the work a bit more deeply. Tonight we have an unusual situation,

02:19.700 --> 02:24.700
which is that earlier today, I was in touch with Benita Roy, whom I've known for quite

02:24.700 --> 02:31.300
some time. And she gave me chapter and verse on how she's prepared for this evening's event.

02:31.300 --> 02:36.580
And she will be joining us very shortly. For some reason, we can't currently contact her.

02:36.580 --> 02:42.900
And we're waiting for her to arrive. So I'm going to briefly introduce her. I hope that

02:42.900 --> 02:47.740
she shows up. And if she doesn't show up, I'm going to begin speaking to Ian myself, partly

02:47.780 --> 02:52.780
based on Benita's notes. But it's just a matter of time until she shows up, because we have

02:52.780 --> 02:58.460
now reminded her. And my only assumption is that she may have got the time zone conversion

02:58.460 --> 03:04.020
mixed up because of some daylight saving time change, which we thought we were on top of,

03:04.020 --> 03:10.500
but evidently not. So give us a few minutes as she manifests herself. Benita, many of you

03:10.500 --> 03:16.180
will know already, but many of you may not. And she's really a rather extraordinary human

03:16.220 --> 03:25.260
being with a multitude of different character traits, skills, assets, interests. It's quite rare

03:25.260 --> 03:30.420
for someone to get deeply into metaphysical philosophy. And by that, I don't mean so much

03:30.420 --> 03:36.020
the metaphysical and the sort of new age sort of irrational kind of philosophy. I mean, more

03:36.020 --> 03:41.540
profoundly in engagement with metaphysics as it's studied in classical philosophy and in

03:41.860 --> 03:48.340
analytic philosophy. And she's written papers on why metaphysics matters. She wrote one of the

03:50.020 --> 03:55.140
one of the most profound chapters in a book released by Perspectiva Press called Dispatches

03:55.140 --> 04:00.100
from a Time Between Worlds. And it was about the idea of metamorphosis. And a lot of Benita's work

04:00.100 --> 04:05.780
is about emphasizing not just the kind of how we have to improve things, but also a little bit

04:05.780 --> 04:10.100
of how we have to allow things to end. Michael, are you showing me signs of life there? Or am I

04:10.100 --> 04:19.620
imagining it? I'm imagining it. Okay. So Benita is also a horse trainer, a farmer. And like Ian,

04:19.620 --> 04:25.940
she describes herself as a Taoist. One of my favorite conversations with her was when she

04:25.940 --> 04:32.740
spoke about the enormous tomatoes that she had in her farm after using some new unsuspecting

04:32.740 --> 04:37.220
variety of manures to make them grow. But she'll switch from that to speaking about

04:37.300 --> 04:44.420
whitehead and heart short and so on. So Benita is a rather extraordinary person and I'm very

04:44.420 --> 04:53.940
much hoping she'll join us in just a second. I'm just noticing I have a problem with my battery.

04:53.940 --> 05:00.020
So if I disappear too, Michael, you'll have to take it up. I think I've got it covered,

05:00.020 --> 05:05.220
but just a second. So I want to start Ian with a question that Bonnie was going to ask you.

05:05.940 --> 05:11.060
She had something else to say first, but I'll let her say that because it's very personal to her.

05:11.700 --> 05:17.380
She was very interested in your subtitle. She wants to understand a little bit more about

05:18.100 --> 05:21.860
after the matter with things, which you might want to remind us why you chose that title.

05:22.820 --> 05:27.780
More precisely the subtitle, our brains, our delusions, and the unmaking of the world. And I

05:27.780 --> 05:32.420
know it took you quite a while to come up with that. But if you can share anything about why exactly

05:32.420 --> 05:35.780
those words and what you're getting at, I know that's one thing Bonnie wanted to ask you.

05:37.380 --> 05:44.420
Well, of course, in choosing the title in the matter with things, I was addressing myself

05:44.420 --> 05:50.580
to the idea that we often have problems understanding elements of our experience because

05:50.580 --> 06:01.620
we thingify them. We see them as things and in essence, many of the things that we think of in

06:01.620 --> 06:08.900
this way, I think a better thought of as adverbs probably, in other words, they are not elements

06:08.900 --> 06:15.300
that we have to pin down or we can find in certain places, but they are ways in which we relate

06:16.020 --> 06:29.540
to everything else that exists. And so the idea would be that you don't look for an entity,

06:29.540 --> 06:36.900
but a web of relationships that allows what this entity is thought to refer to to become real.

06:36.900 --> 06:43.940
It's always a reverberative relationship. And why I chose the subtitle is, of course, it has a

06:44.820 --> 06:50.980
kind of glancing nod towards the subtitle of the master and his emissary. But what I'm talking

06:50.980 --> 06:57.780
about there is that I believe that we've started to use our brains in a particularly limited way.

06:58.740 --> 07:03.060
When I say started, I think we've been doing it now for a couple of hundred years at least,

07:04.100 --> 07:09.780
in which we disattend to whatever it is the right hemisphere is able to tell us and instead

07:09.780 --> 07:17.700
focus on what the left hemisphere would have us believe. And the delusions comes from, as I

07:17.700 --> 07:24.100
demonstrate in the first nine chapters of the book, which are all dedicated to neuroscience.

07:24.180 --> 07:29.140
And it's more fascinating, I hope, than that makes it sound. It's not abstract. It's looking

07:29.140 --> 07:35.460
at what actually happens to people and their lives and their world and their whole way of being

07:35.460 --> 07:42.100
when part of their brain is not functioning correctly. And this may be because of an injury

07:42.100 --> 07:47.940
to the right hemisphere or a stroke in the right hemisphere. But it may also be because of

07:47.940 --> 07:54.980
developing a disease such as schizophrenia, which has many, many, many parallels with a

07:54.980 --> 08:03.620
right hemisphere deficit state. And I go into all of that in that chapter. And the left hemisphere

08:03.620 --> 08:10.500
is literally deluded. And that's not just me who says that. I mean, I'm very happy to quote

08:10.500 --> 08:15.700
other, and I do other neuroscientists who say, yes, the left hemisphere is on its own deluded.

08:15.700 --> 08:19.700
Sorry, Jonathan, are you just just for a point of clarification, because the word delusion is

08:19.700 --> 08:23.540
used a lot. And I know you're very precise with your words. It's one of the reasons people love

08:23.540 --> 08:30.260
your words much. And what exactly is a delusion? I mean, as opposed to an unreality and illusion

08:30.260 --> 08:33.780
and lots of other concepts around it, what makes a delusion a delusion as such?

08:34.900 --> 08:43.380
Well, I think that the standard definition is something like an incorrigible false belief

08:43.380 --> 08:52.820
that is not explained by the person's culture or other context. So, you know, there are things

08:52.820 --> 08:58.180
that we would call unexplained false beliefs, but they're part of somebody's religion. And

08:58.180 --> 09:03.220
it doesn't mean that they've become crazy. It means that because of belonging to that religion,

09:03.220 --> 09:12.180
that's the way they think, for example. And so it's got to be something, and it's not just

09:12.180 --> 09:21.940
false, but it is in this sense incorrigible. Because there are false beliefs, which can be

09:21.940 --> 09:27.540
corrected. But in the case of a delusion, it is pointless arguing with somebody about it, because

09:28.900 --> 09:33.780
you're relying on a shared way of seeing the world, that is, as it were yours and mine,

09:33.780 --> 09:37.700
and the patient's in order to explain to the patient that this cannot be the case.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.980
But you've got to remember that for the patient, the whole world that they are experiencing is

09:42.980 --> 09:49.860
based on this certain way of, that certain disposition towards it, this way of experiencing it.

09:49.860 --> 09:56.340
And so it's a very obvious and common observation that however bizarre a delusion is,

09:56.340 --> 10:01.540
it is absolutely fruitless trying to argue with the patient about whether this is evidentially

10:01.540 --> 10:12.900
likely. And also, there's a sort of gray area where, for example, you may believe that your

10:12.900 --> 10:21.940
spouse is unfaithful to you, and your spouse may be being unfaithful to you. But there is

10:21.940 --> 10:26.820
still a delusional way of believing it, because you believe it not in the way that somebody would

10:26.820 --> 10:35.140
normally frame this, but you believe it with a sort of determination and on the basis of evidence

10:35.140 --> 10:41.540
that other people would not consider a reasonable basis for making decisions. So there's no very,

10:41.540 --> 10:47.140
very clear way of putting it. But when you meet somebody who's deluded, you sure know what you're

10:47.140 --> 10:56.500
encountering. And I believe that we as a society have started to believe obviously false things

10:56.580 --> 11:02.900
about ourselves that experience, intuition, the business of living, would tell us must be false

11:02.900 --> 11:08.500
and have always been seen by people as false, but we now believe them to be the case. So that's

11:08.500 --> 11:14.340
that bit about the delusions and the unmaking. Joe, before you get to the unmaking, I just want to

11:14.340 --> 11:20.260
get the delusions very clear, because again, as with last week, or two weeks ago, when we had the

11:21.140 --> 11:25.780
necessary, but sometimes confusing, a lesion between value and values.

11:27.860 --> 11:32.580
With delusion and delusions, I'm just curious, you're speaking in the subtitle about

11:33.380 --> 11:40.020
particular delusions that you outline in those chapters that you mentioned. But there's also

11:40.020 --> 11:45.860
something you say about shared reality here. So I'm just wondering the relationship between

11:45.860 --> 11:49.540
particular delusions, which might make it difficult for people to interact in a shared

11:49.540 --> 11:55.860
reality, and the idea that the whole perception that shared is somehow deluded. And what it's

11:55.860 --> 12:00.180
like, are we living in both of those kinds of delusion? Or, and if so, what's the relationship

12:00.180 --> 12:03.700
between them? And if you don't mind while you answer that, I have to go and get another charger

12:03.700 --> 12:07.780
for my computer or they will disappear. So I'm still with you and I'm turning off my video,

12:07.780 --> 12:10.420
and I'll be back. So make it a long, good answer. I'll be back in two minutes.

12:10.420 --> 12:20.900
Okay, I'll do my best. Yes, I see the distinction that Jonathan's making there.

12:23.140 --> 12:29.700
And, you know, for example, if we are as a whole society seeing things in a certain way,

12:29.700 --> 12:35.860
is this still delusional since part of the idea of delusion is believing something that cannot be

12:35.860 --> 12:44.340
explained by your societal beliefs? And I suppose this is a very new situation. I don't think there's

12:44.340 --> 12:52.500
been an example in the past, where a whole society has been in the grip of ways of thinking that are

12:52.500 --> 12:58.900
frankly delusional, and like those that are held by patients with major psychoses who are

12:58.980 --> 13:06.580
out of touch with reality. And so this, this is a new era that we've entered where,

13:07.700 --> 13:14.660
as it were, there is a mass psychosis. And I don't think I'm the only person actually who's used

13:14.660 --> 13:25.860
that conception of a mass psychosis. But what we see is that, for example, people with delusions

13:25.860 --> 13:31.220
based on the fact that they have got a psychotic illness will find many things

13:32.660 --> 13:38.820
apparent that we would not think apparent and make things that we do see apparent as completely

13:40.100 --> 13:49.300
probable or impossible. And I could go back to chapter nine, which is the chapter in which I do

13:49.300 --> 13:56.420
look at schizophrenia, but just illuminate the, I don't know, possibly I would say about 30 different

13:56.420 --> 14:04.340
ways in which people with schizophrenia demonstrate the same sorts of aberrational thinking that we do.

14:05.460 --> 14:10.820
And one thing that's interesting about this is that it, I mean, a lot of it, one might think

14:10.820 --> 14:15.940
is because we're interacting with machines. People with schizophrenia see themselves as machines

14:15.940 --> 14:22.340
often and call themselves machines and have been known to do things like cut open their

14:22.340 --> 14:29.460
wrists to see whether there's blood or engine oil in their veins. So they can often have this very

14:29.460 --> 14:36.660
disturbing feeling that nothing is right. It's all mechanical. It's all abstracted engineering

14:37.300 --> 14:42.660
rather than anything embodied. Sorry. I put my hand up because I've got an email notification

14:42.660 --> 14:47.940
from our esteemed guest that she's waiting to be let in. Yeah. Oh, good. Yeah, I just want to say

14:47.940 --> 14:54.420
Hey, so here we go. You've managed to bring fabulous. Yeah. And I'm just gonna bring it up

14:54.420 --> 15:00.740
to speed then and let you take over from there. Hi, Bonnie. Nice to see you. Are you with us?

15:01.780 --> 15:07.940
I am. Sorry. I'm so sorry about my tardiness. No, that's okay. That's okay.

15:08.820 --> 15:14.900
Good to have you with us. You may not, I know you've been in touch with Ian by email, but

15:14.900 --> 15:23.140
nice to introduce you. I'll be in front of 300 odd people. So, you know, I've spoken with many

15:23.140 --> 15:29.780
times and I think you'll know, Bonnie, I've already introduced you to some extent to the audience.

15:29.780 --> 15:34.420
What I didn't mention is that over the last year or so, you've maybe more than a year now, you've

15:34.420 --> 15:40.500
created something with a lovely fetching straightforward title, a pop-up school. And

15:41.540 --> 15:45.300
just briefly tell us what a pop-up, what your pop-up school is so that before we get into the

15:45.300 --> 15:53.060
discussion, people get a better sense of where you're coming from. Well, hi, Ian. Nice to see you.

15:53.060 --> 16:02.500
Hello, Bonnie. So, for almost 15 years, I taught a master's course in consciousness studies and

16:02.500 --> 16:08.980
transpersonal psychology or transformational psychology, which we called it at the end.

16:09.700 --> 16:17.620
And COVID pretty much was the straw that broke the back for that program, which was always kind

16:17.620 --> 16:31.780
of an off-broadway struggling private program. And so, I graduated my last cohort in August of 2022

16:32.340 --> 16:41.140
and in August of 2021, kind of anticipating the end of that, I wanted to offer something similar

16:41.140 --> 16:47.940
that was equally robust that could speak to what people were starving for, but had a much lower

16:47.940 --> 16:58.820
onboarding threshold. So, instead of paying $17,000 a year, you could pay like $40 a month. And I

16:58.820 --> 17:05.540
kind of modified sub-stack so people could enroll on and off or enroll on a yearly basis. And I

17:05.540 --> 17:12.740
called it the pop-up school because in Zach Stein, whom you met a couple of weeks ago, Ian, in his

17:12.740 --> 17:18.740
book, he predicted that schools might be these little pop-up initiatives. And I wanted to give

17:18.740 --> 17:27.860
it this sense of like serial learning, like you could pop in and pop out. And yeah, so it's been

17:27.860 --> 17:34.980
almost two years now and it's quite a growing, growing community. And I suspect there's several

17:34.980 --> 17:40.260
of the students or our community on this call today. Okay, great. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.700
And, Bonnie, while you're getting settled, just as far as I understand it, where we were in the

17:43.700 --> 17:50.180
conversation was, I didn't say anything about your observations about the book, but I did use your

17:50.180 --> 17:55.540
email from this morning to ask Ian about the subtitle. And so, we spoke a little bit about

17:55.540 --> 18:01.460
why the matter with things. We spoke a little bit about brains, which could be somewhat self-evident.

18:02.100 --> 18:05.940
We spoke a little bit about delusions and the difference between delusion sort of

18:06.580 --> 18:10.580
singular and delusions plural and individual and collective delusions, but only really

18:10.580 --> 18:14.900
scratched the surface of that. And Ian was just about to come on to the unmaking of the world

18:15.460 --> 18:20.900
when various things kicked off, including my computer running out of battery. So, Ian, if you

18:20.900 --> 18:26.180
want to finish that thought on why the unmaking of the world allowed me to get settled and once

18:26.180 --> 18:31.700
you finish that, I'm happy to disappear until the Q&A. So, if you can go on the unmaking of the

18:31.700 --> 18:36.180
world, Michael, you can allow me to disappear. Yes. And then you carry on talking together

18:36.180 --> 18:38.420
and I'll be back with the Q&A in about 50 minutes.

18:41.060 --> 18:49.380
Yes, what I wanted to indicate by the phrase the unmaking of the world is that the various habits

18:49.460 --> 18:58.900
of mind that I believe are toxic, which we've adopted more in the last few decades, but certainly

18:59.620 --> 19:07.460
going back further than that, the last century or two, lead to us no longer having a world. And

19:07.460 --> 19:12.900
a world is a very special thing. If you like to put it that way, it's an experience really,

19:12.900 --> 19:18.980
like all the things I talk about, that it's not really a thing. But it's a place in which we

19:18.980 --> 19:30.020
dwell. It's a home. It's a living thing. And therefore, in schematizing, mechanizing, abstracting,

19:30.580 --> 19:38.340
decontextualizing, ignoring the uniqueness of individual cases, in ordering, ignoring the

19:38.340 --> 19:45.780
individual uniqueness of people, we have come to inhabit an enormously impoverished version

19:46.420 --> 19:53.380
of what that world should be. We're in a sort of lost place, which has none of the

19:54.100 --> 20:03.540
feel of a living, vibrant world in which we are committed, orientated, and find a place of being.

20:04.180 --> 20:12.660
That's really what I was getting at. Yeah, so thank you. When I read that, I was struck by,

20:13.460 --> 20:18.900
I just had this impression, you put a lot of thought into the subtitle, and that it was very,

20:21.140 --> 20:30.980
it was a more poignant message, maybe, than a lot of people might think about at first. And

20:34.820 --> 20:40.340
something that strikes me as being of grave concern, I think there's a lot at stake. I think you

20:40.340 --> 20:45.620
would agree that there's a lot at stake. And I think sometimes people think, they take you

20:45.620 --> 20:52.260
seriously, but they think it's like a metaphor. And I think that it's more than a metaphor. It's

20:52.260 --> 20:59.380
more than a passing concern. It's more than almost a sci-fi movie, let's say. Some people with all

20:59.380 --> 21:06.500
these crises go into their consciousness like it's almost a sci-fi movie. It makes us nervous, but

21:07.300 --> 21:13.300
I think that, like for me, a lot of what you're talking about, I see every day. I've seen the

21:13.300 --> 21:20.100
erosion of the adult mind through the 15 years that I've been doing teaching. And, you know, of

21:20.100 --> 21:28.660
course, my course selects some people who have maybe a little bit of spiritual emergencies and

21:28.660 --> 21:37.940
stuff, but the nature of the question of whether reality is real is extraordinary now. And these

21:38.980 --> 21:44.900
programs that people go to, that question whether we share the same world or we all have different

21:44.900 --> 21:51.060
worlds, you know? There's this, and I know the sense in which we all live in our own perspective,

21:51.060 --> 21:56.580
but the emphasis is always on that the world is a simulation, that we share different worlds,

21:56.580 --> 22:03.540
like the sense that the humanities and the science are teaching this extraordinary

22:03.540 --> 22:10.420
fragmentation, I call it locked-in syndrome, that we can't perceive the world really.

22:10.980 --> 22:25.300
And my question for you is where is the fever? Why are we so feverishly trying to convince ourselves

22:26.580 --> 22:35.060
that we live in a simulation? I mean, where is that pain coming from? That we don't want to live in,

22:36.260 --> 22:37.700
let's say, the natural world?

22:40.340 --> 22:47.540
Gosh, there's so many things to say about that. Well, one is that the natural world imposes limits

22:47.540 --> 22:54.980
on us, like we die and we have bodies that have certain inclinations and so on. We're busy trying

22:54.980 --> 23:00.100
to pretend that none of this is true and we can remake everything according to our whim,

23:00.100 --> 23:10.180
but that is not the case. And in fact, the limits that are imposed by life are extremely healthful

23:10.180 --> 23:14.900
and important. It's a mistake to think that we ought to be railing against them and trying to

23:14.900 --> 23:25.860
get rid of them in my view. But of course, like everything, it's a matter of degree. Nature is

23:25.860 --> 23:35.700
something that medicine has always interfered with. Nature tries to overcome some of the

23:35.700 --> 23:43.540
unnecessarily adverse effects of disease and so forth. So we are always juggling these things.

23:43.540 --> 23:50.420
I think another reason why we're addicted to this idea of a representation is because

23:52.020 --> 23:57.620
the left hemisphere is a representation of the world. The right hemisphere has

23:57.620 --> 24:03.940
a presencing of the world. It allows the world to presence to us. That is a vibrant two-way

24:03.940 --> 24:11.940
experience. But once it is taken up by the left hemisphere, it is dislocated, dismembered,

24:12.020 --> 24:18.100
analyzed, categorized, and turned into something abstract, a map of the world. And you cannot

24:18.100 --> 24:24.500
live in a map. You've unmade the world once you do that. But the left hemisphere can only trust

24:24.500 --> 24:32.020
the things that itself has made. Heidegger actually said that he was, of course, not talking about

24:33.780 --> 24:40.580
hemispheres at all. But he did say that modern man needs to be able to tell himself that he is the

24:40.580 --> 24:47.060
giver to himself of everything that he has. And that is part of this problem that we have,

24:47.060 --> 24:54.180
that we must be the all-powerful and we must be the one that can do anything. This is extraordinary

24:54.180 --> 25:03.300
in a way because, you know, for decades I've been puzzled by the kind of paradox that at the same

25:03.380 --> 25:09.700
time we believe ourselves to be capable of doing almost anything we want to,

25:10.660 --> 25:18.740
and believe ourselves to be basically pointless, worthless. So the dignity of humanity has hugely

25:18.740 --> 25:25.140
plummeted, and so is its happiness and its sense of longing and everything else, at the same time

25:25.140 --> 25:32.980
that our hubris about humanity has gone through the roof. So adopting a certain degree of

25:32.980 --> 25:41.860
modesty and a sense of proper limits to what we can do and what we can know would actually

25:41.860 --> 25:48.420
perhaps help us to regain a sense of respect for what we in fact are and what we can do. But

25:48.420 --> 25:54.420
those would be some of the thoughts I'd have about why that is so promoted. And I'm afraid it

25:54.420 --> 26:00.740
is very much promoted, and I just like to say that there are a number of philosophers quite

26:01.460 --> 26:07.380
amongst the foremost at the moment is Donald Hoffman, who says that what we see is a readout

26:07.380 --> 26:15.060
of an instrument panel. This is an idea that has been offered many times in the past and was really

26:15.060 --> 26:20.740
in Damasio's early work as well, for which I criticised him and for which he hasn't forgiven me.

26:22.820 --> 26:26.340
But this idea that actually what we're doing is reading out something,

26:27.060 --> 26:32.660
which is what the left hemisphere does, but in fact we're experiencing something real. There are

26:33.380 --> 26:38.500
things in the cosmos that correspond to all those things that we perceive and value.

26:39.380 --> 26:44.420
Now I'm not saying that there's only one way of seeing them, but once again in our culture what

26:44.420 --> 26:51.620
we've done is we've taken a partial truth and made it the whole story. So it is true that everyone

26:51.620 --> 26:57.940
to some extent sees the world differently and that's an important and beautiful fact. But

26:57.940 --> 27:05.460
it is also a very important and beautiful fact that generally speaking we see things in a common

27:05.460 --> 27:11.940
world. We don't all live in so vastly different worlds that we have no common ground. And at

27:11.940 --> 27:19.860
the moment there's a general tendency to say that if something is the case up to a degree,

27:19.860 --> 27:26.420
which wasn't thought to be so perhaps recently, then it's true to the max across the board. We go

27:26.420 --> 27:31.940
to extremes. We have black and white positions and I'd like to present myself as a photo of

27:31.940 --> 27:37.060
black and white positions. It's very important that there are masses of degree and things that are

27:37.860 --> 27:40.420
implicit and not fully made explicit.

27:40.980 --> 27:50.580
You know so you said that you know we kind of have this hubris that we imagine ourselves

27:50.580 --> 28:00.100
are all powerful, that all the gifts we have we've made ourselves. And it seems to me that

28:01.220 --> 28:08.100
there's a pickle in this because somehow deep down inside we do know that we haven't made the

28:08.100 --> 28:14.740
earth and we haven't made the trees and we haven't made ourselves and everything that we actually are

28:15.540 --> 28:21.700
has been given to us freely by nature through no account of our own. I mean this is more it's

28:21.700 --> 28:26.020
you know people will when I say that they say oh that's very spiritual and I say no it's just a

28:26.020 --> 28:34.180
strong naturalism. It's just actually the case it's rather mundane and for me there's something that

28:34.740 --> 28:46.020
if I thought I was responsible for booting up my enthusiasm every morning I would be overwhelmed

28:46.580 --> 28:54.420
you know. It's like so much of who we are that gives us the possibility to pretend we're all

28:54.420 --> 29:03.300
powerful comes to us through this intelligence that we don't we we don't maybe you know we don't have

29:05.700 --> 29:15.620
you know it's not it's not been it's all given to us and and so it seems to me like the thing I

29:15.620 --> 29:23.300
can't understand is that and I don't know this is seem off topic to you or is this kind of interesting

29:23.860 --> 29:31.140
to talk about. Yeah so I went to a conference the other day and this young man was presenting an

29:31.140 --> 29:38.100
argument that that the world is intelligible and that communication between people is possible

29:38.980 --> 29:44.580
and to do that he took this huge journey through theoretical cognitive science and

29:44.580 --> 29:54.580
opponent processing and and free energy principle and I thought something very odd he's a very nice

29:54.580 --> 30:03.620
man and I thought something very odd is happening here like if if people had to understand all that

30:03.620 --> 30:09.220
to understand that the world is intelligible it's a possibility of communication then most people

30:09.220 --> 30:16.980
would be lost and I thought like I told my dog you have absolutely no no chance at all for being

30:16.980 --> 30:25.940
in the world you know and so this question this crisis of how so this is an example of something

30:25.940 --> 30:34.180
that looked like a well presented presentation but it really was to me a sense of collective madness

30:34.180 --> 30:44.980
and and yeah no well this kind of thing goes on all the time it's just that we've completely lost

30:45.700 --> 30:54.900
any kind of contact with the the live intuitive reverberative business of experiencing the world

30:54.900 --> 31:02.020
in which the world approaches us becomes available to us and we to it and it's in this encounter

31:02.020 --> 31:13.300
that whatever it is that we we we know comes about so what you're describing is this unnecessarily

31:14.180 --> 31:19.140
complex way of approaching it and there's a lot of this in science in which frankly the

31:19.140 --> 31:26.500
extraordinarily opposite is sorry obvious I meant to say extraordinary obvious is is demonstrated

31:26.500 --> 31:32.820
at costly and great length where at the same time oddly there are things that are completely

31:32.820 --> 31:38.100
obvious that are wholly denied and people go around believing them because they think oh well

31:38.100 --> 31:45.140
people say this so I better believe it but I want a bit of the touch of the the little boy who

31:45.940 --> 31:51.860
said the emperor's wearing no clothes yeah I mean I'm sorry guys he's nude

31:52.180 --> 31:59.460
and there's just so much rubbish talk these days and it's very confusing disorientating

31:59.460 --> 32:04.980
to agreeable and leads them to a sense of desperation they don't know what to believe who

32:04.980 --> 32:12.020
to believe what to believe in the intuitive spirituality has been dead and by the way

32:12.020 --> 32:16.580
they've been brought up and by everything they experience in the world their capacity to pay

32:17.540 --> 32:23.860
um continuous sustained vigilant attention open attention respectful attention the sort

32:23.860 --> 32:32.660
of attention that leads to real sense of meaning and or is has been undermined and they've been

32:32.660 --> 32:41.060
told they have thousands of choices that in reality are not helpful and it it's a well-known

32:41.060 --> 32:49.380
fact in in psychological research that beyond a few choices too many choices make people less happy

32:49.380 --> 32:56.820
more stressed than they would have been content with fewer choices so it's not as I'm always saying

32:56.820 --> 33:01.140
it's not an argument for having no choice but it's an argument for saying that choice doesn't

33:01.140 --> 33:06.660
get better and better if you try and say well you can be anything you want you can't I mean

33:07.620 --> 33:15.780
get real it's a horrible fantasy that creates enormous stress and the fear of missing out

33:15.780 --> 33:21.060
and the fear of having failed and the need to do all kinds of incompatible things at once

33:21.060 --> 33:27.940
in order to prove that you're okay it's a horrible world to bring up young people in I mean I I just

33:29.300 --> 33:34.180
feel for young people whose rates of mental illness I was just zooming through the roof

33:37.140 --> 33:45.060
yeah so we do live live in a mad world my master's when you think of young people it's really very

33:45.060 --> 33:56.580
sad and and I've read a statistics that one out of very 16 kids in the United States is diagnosed

33:56.580 --> 34:02.500
with a severe mental illness and whether it's because the DSM has gone mad or the children

34:02.900 --> 34:12.420
gone mad it doesn't really matter it's an alarming alarming fact and you know I talked to sometimes

34:12.420 --> 34:22.420
I coach some young parents and we we we try to teach parents how to have unstructured time with

34:22.420 --> 34:32.420
their children and and I often get the response you know I I blocked out time she she was playing

34:32.420 --> 34:37.540
I was there nothing was happening but I got bored I don't know what to do with my body I don't know

34:37.540 --> 34:46.420
how to put my body in a in play I don't I'm just stiff and I pretend and and and this is all by

34:46.420 --> 34:52.100
way of trying to say to the listeners like it's not a joke and it's not science fiction

34:52.100 --> 34:59.380
and something really disturbing is happening right in front of our eyes

35:00.820 --> 35:07.220
but I thought you know I have this this note here and there's this beautiful word that you use

35:08.180 --> 35:18.420
if I don't know how to say it city if city if say it if say it and you have a quote from sass

35:18.420 --> 35:26.340
in his book about this crucial self sense of self sameness a fundamental and therefore nearly

35:26.340 --> 35:33.780
indescribable experience of existing as a vital and self identity identical subject of experience

35:33.780 --> 35:44.820
and action and and I thought um this is one of these experiences that we can no longer take

35:44.820 --> 35:54.980
for granted that people have any intuition of and so I thought maybe you could if you were talking

35:55.940 --> 36:06.500
to aliens who had had had not this experience what what what is what is that experience

36:08.100 --> 36:13.460
the trouble is that it's not something that's improved by being put into words it's something

36:13.460 --> 36:21.940
that has to be experienced and I take the word it say it largely from louis sass um a very great

36:21.940 --> 36:33.220
mind I think um and what he's talking about there is the natural um unselfconscious awareness of a

36:33.220 --> 36:40.100
continuous functioning self we've so eroded our intuition and we've been encouraged to attack

36:40.100 --> 36:47.540
our intuitions to reject our intuitions that we can no longer act unselfconsciously and this happens

36:47.540 --> 36:52.660
in schizophrenia people say I don't know how to walk I have to think put one foot in front of the

36:52.660 --> 36:59.380
other and so on I don't know how to sit down um or whatever it may be so they've become paralyzed

37:00.020 --> 37:07.940
by a kind of gorgon stare of the intellect on everything they're doing and the beauty of life

37:07.940 --> 37:14.660
is that things work well only when it's not like that imagine um how bad the performance

37:14.660 --> 37:20.100
of a piece of music would be if the pianist was thinking all the time consciously about what he

37:20.100 --> 37:27.460
was doing with his fingers imagine how um how diminished an act of sexual love would be if it

37:27.460 --> 37:34.500
was entirely contrived according to a plan an algorithm or a worked out schema it's this way

37:34.580 --> 37:44.420
of thinking that is absolutely crazy and a huge affliction and makes life impossibly difficult

37:44.420 --> 37:51.780
for us the trouble is that if we adopt a legalistic frame of mind I mean a lot of this comes back to

37:51.780 --> 38:04.660
a sort of legalistic um incorporation of um the redress in the the redress for any kind of

38:04.660 --> 38:11.140
wrong that happens to you is to accuse somebody so nowadays we we we have this sort of idea or

38:11.140 --> 38:17.780
some people seem to have this idea that we're owed a pain-free life and if there's pain there's

38:17.780 --> 38:22.180
suffering things are not good in it there's somebody to blame for that and they must be

38:22.180 --> 38:30.980
brought to account preferably through the law this has a deleterious effect on whole sways

38:30.980 --> 38:38.660
of life where in fact we need to trust and to accept that there will be ups and downs and

38:38.660 --> 38:46.020
things but not to become um you know reaching for our handy attorney at every turn in events

38:46.020 --> 38:54.340
this is the problem and this is why schools find teachers harder to recruit hospitals are finding

38:54.340 --> 39:00.260
doctors harder to recruit because first of all they've been told that unless they follow certain

39:00.260 --> 39:05.540
written procedures they will be vulnerable to being sued and that will completely destroy their

39:05.540 --> 39:11.700
career and and that's you know nothing any longer can be done according to the wonderful way in which

39:11.700 --> 39:19.220
I was taught and it was taught medicine too which was from experience from people who'd had you

39:19.220 --> 39:25.780
know 40 years of experience of whatever it was talking to me from that base of what goes well

39:25.780 --> 39:32.260
and what doesn't and and you know the teachers at school were people who had had an enormous

39:32.260 --> 39:38.100
enthusiasm for things that they had learned to love and they communicated that to me and that's

39:38.100 --> 39:44.580
in itself worth a thousand hours of just following rules and procedures it's this

39:44.580 --> 39:53.700
awful business of rules procedures theories that have overtaken our ability to be naturally responsive

39:54.660 --> 40:01.860
creatures and when we can try to recover that we may be able to get back some of our moral self

40:01.860 --> 40:07.220
because that's also a very important thing isn't it I mean since we have rules about absolutely

40:07.220 --> 40:14.660
everything now I think back to when I was was young and one I mean it's a it's a cliche but one

40:14.660 --> 40:20.180
didn't need to have the same numbers of locks and the cameras watching everything and so on

40:20.180 --> 40:26.500
but on the whole although certainly crime existed it didn't seem to exist on the level that it would

40:26.500 --> 40:32.660
if we now took away all the the locks and the and the cameras that we've since instituted and

40:32.660 --> 40:39.220
there's a sort of belief that if you can get away with it then you're entitled to do so there's no

40:39.220 --> 40:45.620
kind of strong innocence of I would never do this because I'm not that kind of person and I don't

40:45.620 --> 40:51.540
want to live in a world where human beings do this kind of thing that seems to me one of the most

40:51.540 --> 40:58.100
important moral act um stimuli to action I don't want to do this because I don't want to be in a

40:58.100 --> 41:04.100
world where we can assume that people will do this unless some law restrains them from doing it

41:04.100 --> 41:12.180
so we've moved such a terrifically long way from anything intrinsic and spontaneous and intuitive

41:12.980 --> 41:17.780
um to the world of somebody who is unable to stand unless they've got

41:17.780 --> 41:24.820
scaffolding all around them a support and of course such a person is a feeble version of a

41:24.820 --> 41:29.860
healthy living individual yeah and of course that's what you think about that yeah and of

41:29.860 --> 41:36.260
course that scaffolding is actually fragmented right just like this so I was thinking of the

41:36.260 --> 41:43.860
other day we were talking about wisdom like what is it to cultivate wisdom and I was saying that

41:43.860 --> 41:52.820
years ago both of us will use that phrase quite a bit I think um doctor for example could grow

41:52.820 --> 42:00.180
wise in his career right so he would give birth to children he'd watch them grow he put their

42:00.180 --> 42:07.700
help their parents in the dying process he'd be in the community and this kind of embedded

42:07.700 --> 42:16.100
in the community in the local with his expertise um having what I call a voluntary obligation to

42:16.100 --> 42:26.180
his practice um through the thick and thin and the difficulties this is a formula for having wise

42:26.180 --> 42:36.180
people embedded in relationships but a doctor's career is not a formula for wisdom today not at

42:36.180 --> 42:41.380
all it's completely fragmented and they're systematically standardizing things so all the

42:41.380 --> 42:45.300
doctor does is go on the computer and tell you some things are pretty soon you don't need the doctor

42:46.020 --> 42:53.780
and we feel we we've we've slowly redefined intelligence as something machines are good

42:53.780 --> 42:59.300
at and so you see the standardizing of teaching the standards of this is what machines are good at

42:59.300 --> 43:05.860
and now we have you know chat gpt is going to be our teachers because it's better at that than we

43:05.860 --> 43:14.500
are but we've been we've redefined intelligence is what people are good at well we need to redefine

43:14.500 --> 43:23.060
intelligence I mean yeah yes I I mean I I always say AI is not artificial intelligence

43:23.060 --> 43:29.060
it's artificial information processing and that's what it does but intelligence involves

43:29.060 --> 43:37.140
a full understanding and that can only come if you if you are embodied if you have emotions if you

43:37.140 --> 43:42.580
form um relations on the basis of that and if you're aware that you were only here for a while

43:42.580 --> 43:49.060
and are going to die the all these things are very important to making us what we are we need all

43:49.060 --> 43:54.500
these elements including the element of death which is not our foe but in many ways our friend

43:55.620 --> 43:59.220
that's a whole other topic but but I what I'm really saying is that

44:00.980 --> 44:08.260
intelligence isn't is is at risk and I think you're saying this as well um have been replaced

44:08.260 --> 44:15.220
by just very rapidly and mechanically following every kind of pathway that a computer can find

44:15.220 --> 44:22.100
but having no sense of a context in which to properly evaluate these things and and will

44:22.820 --> 44:28.340
fill in things which are absolutely not true on the basis that it looks like in this pattern

44:29.300 --> 44:34.260
this ought to be happening so it actually states that certain things have happened in a person's

44:34.260 --> 44:39.860
life for example based on a probability but they didn't and that person rather specifically

44:39.860 --> 44:46.500
didn't do those things so I mean not only have you got the problem of telling true from false in

44:47.140 --> 44:53.380
educating children and and students who may waste their time and their teacher's time by

44:54.100 --> 45:01.780
using chat gpt to write their essays um but it will also make the the sphere of the law very

45:01.780 --> 45:09.220
difficult our is the evidence fabricated what do we really believe here um can we believe

45:09.220 --> 45:15.300
something we see our politicians saying when you can't believe and you can't trust the civilization

45:15.300 --> 45:25.220
collapses and you know that's this wonderful saying uh Chinese third century is saying um

45:25.220 --> 45:34.980
one of the emperors that for a society for a civilization to thrive you need guns food and

45:34.980 --> 45:40.820
trust and if you have to do away with one of them do away with guns and if you have to do

45:40.820 --> 45:47.620
another one do away with food but the one you cannot do away with this trust and we've done away with it

45:56.180 --> 45:59.300
sorry I hope I haven't depressed you too badly don't you think of something

45:59.300 --> 46:08.900
no no no I I see something good for the end um um and no I think that I what I'm trying to

46:10.900 --> 46:20.340
collaborate with you on is it's really to open people's eyes we know we get so habituated to

46:20.340 --> 46:30.820
the way things are and open people's eyes to see how extraordinarily unmade the world is

46:31.460 --> 46:40.820
I mean we we think we think we have to encounter people who are paranoid schizophrenics to

46:41.380 --> 46:46.340
understand what you're talking about and yet this kind of unmaking of the world

46:47.060 --> 46:53.460
is the world that is being unmade right right in front of our right in front of our very eyes

46:54.500 --> 47:02.740
and um it's the world is an organism it's not a machine and the trouble with the way we think

47:02.740 --> 47:08.260
is that we think it's just a machine and can therefore be reduced to parts and all we find

47:08.260 --> 47:15.220
after you've done this is a lot of of material elements that have been broken out of a hole

47:15.220 --> 47:21.860
and the hole cannot conceivably be reconstructed from these bits these inanimate bits and what I

47:21.860 --> 47:27.620
mean by the unmaking of the world is all that structure all these relationships that enable

47:27.620 --> 47:35.060
things or people and the feelings that they have experiences they have to interrelate with one

47:35.060 --> 47:40.900
another are being shorn away the world view is becoming simpler and simpler and simpler

47:40.900 --> 47:46.900
not because it's approaching truth but because it's moving away from truth it's it's running away to

47:47.620 --> 47:53.780
a blatant falsehood which it feels it can't escape because of a certain way of thinking

47:53.780 --> 47:59.140
which is that the only thing that matters is that we should be able to be in control

47:59.940 --> 48:06.820
and amass material goods those are the values of the left hemisphere and all the other important

48:06.820 --> 48:11.220
values are better served by the right and it's anyway that was what I talked about last week so

48:11.220 --> 48:19.300
we won't go there now I think that another thing that the way to another way to look at it and of

48:19.300 --> 48:28.340
course you've done incredible detail on this is people a lot of times people are let's say their

48:28.340 --> 48:36.900
teachers or educators or their psychiatrists or their spiritual teachers they assume that the

48:36.900 --> 48:46.980
kinds of minds we have is the nature of mind and then they try to work with that or or you know

48:46.980 --> 48:52.900
people will say because our minds are constructing reality and and I always say no that's the kind

48:52.980 --> 48:59.300
of mind we have thinks it's a simulation but what I hear you saying is that this integrated mind

48:59.300 --> 49:06.340
and of course we have to we're off balance so we're going to emphasize what the what we've lost

49:06.340 --> 49:15.700
with the right brain a contribution this kind of mind looks at nature and sees home and and and

49:15.700 --> 49:25.620
moves around the world and sees that every act of life is a gift from nature from my home from

49:25.620 --> 49:36.900
where I've become this kind of mind trusts that there's such a larger intelligence that an envelopes

49:36.900 --> 49:44.500
envelopes all of us and that's like a tissue from which we dialogue is possible you know the left

49:44.500 --> 49:50.180
hemisphere like the difference between concepts as you know you hold your baby like this and it's

49:50.180 --> 49:57.300
right hemisphere to right hemisphere and yet we're talking at odds like we think that if we can come

49:57.300 --> 50:04.580
to some conceptually agreed upon solution then there's a possibility of a communication and I'm

50:04.580 --> 50:12.420
saying that like because we our bodies are inhabit the tissue of the living world then this is why

50:12.420 --> 50:20.260
this communication is possible not because it's an effort in this direction it should be a joy in

50:20.260 --> 50:28.900
this direction and and yeah I I totally agree with that and I think you know the phrase constructing

50:28.900 --> 50:35.060
the world is very important because it's a fashionable conception has been since the 60s

50:35.060 --> 50:43.220
that effectively we make up the world according to you know who we are then what we what we want

50:44.180 --> 50:51.700
but I reject this idea that we fabricate it because that is dependent on this idea that

50:51.700 --> 50:58.100
we are cut off from any kind of reality and that all we have are the bits that come to us in our

50:58.100 --> 51:03.860
in our mind and we put together a world out of those but that is not in my view the case because

51:03.860 --> 51:10.820
we do have contact with something beyond ourselves and unless you tell yourself that that cannot be

51:10.820 --> 51:15.140
and cut yourself off from it in which case of course you won't find that there is anything

51:15.140 --> 51:22.180
beyond yourself if you don't do that but cultivate a kind of humble awareness of things that are far

51:22.180 --> 51:30.820
beyond what we know right now you start to feel experience those things they start to to give

51:31.140 --> 51:36.660
something with which to build the world and so it's not a fabrication or a construction of the

51:36.660 --> 51:42.580
world it's a helping to bring into being something that is there to bring it more into being and

51:42.580 --> 51:48.420
we play a part in that and so the world comes about for each of us in a slightly different way

51:48.420 --> 51:53.460
because if each of us brings something different to it but this is wonderful it's not a negation

51:53.460 --> 51:59.540
of the idea that there is a common core to the world it's the idea that each person's contribution

51:59.540 --> 52:04.660
brings a slightly different uniqueness to an aspect of the world we still have something

52:04.660 --> 52:12.180
that is vibrant living evolving it's not a finished product it's a thing that is in process

52:12.180 --> 52:18.020
as we ourselves are in process and that process is a resonant thing between our consciousness

52:18.020 --> 52:23.860
and whatever the rest of the conscious cosmos gives that's my my view of it so instead of

52:23.860 --> 52:29.380
saying that we construct the world we make it up in some mechanistic engineering way which

52:29.380 --> 52:34.500
is exactly how the left hemisphere we would think was the only possible way we are in fact

52:34.500 --> 52:40.820
if you like midwifing into existence helping to burst something that is natural something

52:40.820 --> 52:49.060
that is nature which is that which is always about to be yeah so i want to move on a little bit and

52:49.140 --> 52:59.140
um there's this notion this philosophical notion which i think is is true and that is that

53:00.820 --> 53:06.740
reason i'm going to use the word reason because rationality is is associated with just like left

53:06.740 --> 53:14.580
brain typically that reason is isomorphic to reality in the sense that there's something about

53:15.540 --> 53:22.580
human reasoning and i'm not just talking about the brain but you can unpack this that is

53:24.020 --> 53:31.700
isomorphic to reality such that there is the possibility for a direct attunement let's say

53:33.380 --> 53:35.300
yes and um

53:37.620 --> 53:42.660
and so that's the first question and if you can speak to that then there's a question just to

53:42.660 --> 53:50.900
build after after that to kind of yes i think that's a wonderful observation and i certainly

53:50.900 --> 53:56.180
believe this and i think i've made it myself and in a way it was what einstein was saying when he

53:56.180 --> 54:05.620
said what is so wonderful and so unexpected is that the world is understandable why should the

54:05.620 --> 54:12.340
world be understandable by our minds and the idea that our minds um

54:14.580 --> 54:21.140
would evolve naturally to understand the world is not necessarily correct it might have adopted

54:21.140 --> 54:30.260
various kind of um entirely false positions for a while um in order to deal with a certain situation

54:30.260 --> 54:37.460
but over time our understanding of the world has increased i mean we i'm not saying that we

54:39.220 --> 54:44.340
most of us in in the modern world are making the best of that fact but there is something heroic

54:44.340 --> 54:50.820
about the degree to which over thousands of years we have come to understand more and more of the world

54:50.820 --> 54:58.340
and the world is um as david deutch says speaking to us in english i mean he means if english is your

54:58.340 --> 55:03.780
natural language why is it that when you approach the world the world speaks to in your own language

55:03.780 --> 55:09.940
which is another way of putting einstein's remark about extraordinary fact and i think what this

55:09.940 --> 55:18.660
gives us is the opportunity to trust what reason tells us not as you say i make this distinction

55:18.660 --> 55:23.540
between it's not really one that's a core english distinction but we have to have two different

55:23.540 --> 55:27.780
words for it one is for simply the following of rules and procedures in the way that computer

55:27.780 --> 55:32.900
would and the other is tempering all that with the wisdom that comes from experience

55:32.900 --> 55:37.860
the understanding of context and so on and so forth in fact what a wise judge would do you know

55:37.860 --> 55:42.340
you're talking about wisdom and wisdom and interestingly judges are being more and more

55:42.340 --> 55:47.380
constrained by mechanical sets of rules and procedures so that they're no longer free

55:47.380 --> 55:54.900
to use um wisdom that they've acquired over an arduous training and and decades of experience

55:54.900 --> 56:01.460
so that's what i say is that these things are naturally resonant and i do also believe the

56:01.460 --> 56:06.900
imagination is like this and unfortunately we haven't got time to go into that enormous topic

56:06.900 --> 56:13.060
of what is imagination but with courage and with shelling and so forth i take the imagination to

56:13.060 --> 56:19.300
be a faculty which enables us to be in touch with reality beyond the things that we can reason about

56:20.180 --> 56:25.300
it's not fantasy which takes us away from reality he makes a very strong distinction

56:25.300 --> 56:30.820
between fantasy and imagination and imagination on the other hand is our one chance of actually

56:31.780 --> 56:38.260
feeling our way into the inside of the world and experiencing it yeah that's that's beautiful

56:38.260 --> 56:46.740
so my last question actually somebody asked me to tag on and that is so we have this notion that

56:46.740 --> 56:53.700
reason is isomorphic with the world so there's a possibility for not only attunement but

56:54.420 --> 57:01.460
yeah for deep mutuality um so the question and then is what is the relationship between

57:02.260 --> 57:08.980
goodness and reason because it's a little hard tricky to say they're isomorphic

57:08.980 --> 57:19.780
um well we're talking in a different way than we were about whether reason is isomorphic with

57:19.780 --> 57:26.820
reality or perhaps even with truth i i distinguish between different kinds of meaning of truth

57:27.540 --> 57:33.620
one being something abstract that we have an analytic past towards and we get closer and

57:33.620 --> 57:39.540
finally we get it and a different one which is a form of attunement of coming together of meeting

57:39.540 --> 57:46.340
of resonating a completely different kind of sense of truth and of course the word truth has

57:46.340 --> 57:52.740
as a core this idea of being true to something of surfaces being true to one another as a carpenter

57:52.740 --> 57:58.820
says or a couple being true to one another if they love one another so it is about a relationship

57:58.820 --> 58:07.860
that is that is truthful and real and goodness um well all i would say is that reason is obviously

58:08.580 --> 58:16.100
another tool that we can use in helping work out what is good but it shouldn't be the only

58:16.100 --> 58:23.220
or the limiting tool because there is very much more to goodness than calculation and one of the

58:23.220 --> 58:30.900
things that um i i write about in chapter 26 i think is the way in which in academe in the west

58:31.940 --> 58:37.700
the philosophy of utilitarianism has more or less ousted every other kind of way of thinking about

58:37.700 --> 58:45.220
what is naturally good and the odd thing is that what is being praised is a way of thinking which

58:45.220 --> 58:52.900
is archetypally not good in moral to always calculate about things is is immoral and often

58:52.900 --> 58:59.700
leads you to um horrible conclusions that it's okay to kill one person in order to um harvest

58:59.700 --> 59:06.180
their organs and give them to five other people awaiting transplants for example so um reason

59:06.180 --> 59:13.220
has a dual aspect as it's there often that it can be extremely helpful but if used in a rigid

59:13.300 --> 59:18.420
fashion it approximates what people who are mentally ill do with it people who have frontal

59:18.420 --> 59:24.020
they've damaged right hemisphere damage who are psychopaths and who have schizophrenia all have

59:24.020 --> 59:31.620
in common that their idea of morality is based on rationalizing calculations whereas i hope that most

59:31.620 --> 59:38.900
of the rest of us see it in a broader sense yeah that was the trick i think now that i now i

59:38.900 --> 59:46.500
understand it thank you very much because what what what was the tension in his question was

59:46.500 --> 59:52.740
in the assumption that goodness is utility right so that he it was like well when i'm

59:52.740 --> 01:00:00.820
reason when i reason i don't always get the good but i but that was more like he yeah so now i

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:09.700
understand what that tension was but when i reason and i don't get what i want it may be

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:16.900
the good and so then you start to see that there is the potential for more attunement between reason

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:23.380
and the good versus reason and then thinking of the good as a utility especially an ego

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:28.820
referential utility so that was that was very helpful thank you very much i knew there was a

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:34.420
thank you that kind of tension where there's an assumption that is yeah yeah creating the

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:41.780
tension in the question so yeah thank you very much thank you bonnie and um i hope you mind

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:47.060
if i come in yes you could you can uh i'm aware of bonnie that another question might come to you

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:54.420
as you're um you know watching the questions that follow um but i want to give a chance for

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.780
the audience to come in now um before that i just want to i want to ask you one question

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.900
um about something bonnie alluded to earlier vis-a-vis what's at stake here

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:13.700
um because we don't often flesh this out you know the source of the sense of mattering

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:22.260
um because you know there's a certain intuition about moral acts and our proximity about good

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:27.220
behavior with our peers and then our society and then you get into the health of the planet

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.980
you might think about the cosmos you might think about the ultimate nature of reality

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.940
you might even wonder about life on other planets and other forms of intelligent life as many do

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:42.020
and i say all of that because i've noticed between the two of you a sort of difference in tenor

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:51.220
um if i can if it's i think it's reasonable to say that in you um although there's you you

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:56.100
offer a great deal of uh emphasis on beauty and love and goodness and there's a great deal of

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:01.460
positivity in your work it's also true that you lament a great deal about the world and there's a

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:10.340
a certain um spirit of let's say melancholy about about how things are turning out and a sort of

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:16.100
urgency to to redirect things and we perceive them as the premise of your work bonnie with us

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:20.900
sense something altogether more chipper at something altogether more kind of lively and

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.620
playful and i don't know i don't want to sort of make this too personal but i am just trying to

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:31.780
get at this idea of you know when we what's at stake are we talking about the end of human

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:37.300
habitation on planet earth are we talking about um the capacity to destroy ourselves with

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:44.020
exponential technology are we talking about the intrinsic value of things that will be destroyed

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:50.500
pointlessly can you give me some sense when you this question of what's at stake both of you please

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:56.420
like what's your sense of um why we should care about any of this if i can ask such a

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:03.540
big context question like ultimately at the end of these searches what are we trying to protect

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.420
what are we trying to safeguard what is it that actually matters to you both and i think even

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:12.340
years will be more more familiar to people so i'm going to come to bonnie first

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:22.980
it's a great question um so for me i'm trying to say i'm trying to

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:33.380
say don't think what's at stake in the future don't worry about what's coming don't take what

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:41.220
we're saying and and draw it out in a narrative arc and figure out what's going to be left right

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:51.060
we just be with reality right now every single person alive is going to die is that a crisis

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:57.220
it's just just you know what i'm saying if i put it within all the middle crisis and everybody

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:04.660
will die you have a different reality to it if we put it in right here now what's at stake

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:15.140
is every person in this call could be deeply wedded with reality deeply feel belonging to the earth

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:24.980
feel the generosity of having been given a life experience the beauty of the perceptual world

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:32.100
um when you listen to read ian's writing on music

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:42.740
that people don't have those experiences anymore they completely robbed of who people are

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:51.620
the fantastic joy and voyage of being a human being is not present in people's lives

01:04:52.500 --> 01:05:00.660
they don't know how to get to it this is what's at stake and in young people

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:08.660
there's a struggle because they haven't yet forgotten something

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:19.380
and um you know used to be when i worked with young adults going through the individuation

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:26.260
stage let's say their problems were like problems with the intergenerational change

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:32.420
between their families different how societies conventions like change now they say things like

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:39.380
when i was seven i felt like i was hooked up to a machine that was sucking out my blood

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:46.740
this is like the the metaphors that seven year olds use like it's so bad now that young people

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:52.900
who are still kind of like organisms and then they don't blame their parents because they're like

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.580
their parents are sucked into the machine you know they use these metaphors it's extraordinary how

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:08.180
poignant the lack of world living world is for them and so for me what i think what's at stake is

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:18.820
you know trying to connect with young people make a world for them but right here and now

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:28.420
all the things that you may imagine were possible are possible

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:37.460
as long as you're still a living breathing organism and people don't believe that anymore

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:46.980
thank you bonnie and um it's lovely to hear you say that i've heard you say similar things but

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:52.420
great to hear it again um you know makes me think of the unmaking of the world again are we to

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:58.100
understand that the world is inevitably being unmade that it has to be unmade for it to be

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.860
remade or that we're called in some sense to protect what is already made

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:10.420
well i think what i'm saying is is that we are in the process of unmaking the world not

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:16.740
that it has to and not that it can't be reversed or but that we are we're simply unmaking it

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:22.820
and and that's the the predicament we find ourselves in and that's not i can't just to

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.780
be clear there's some people who the reason i asked that question in that way is there are

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:34.500
some people who want to tear it all down you know i have met people of persuasion and are they

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:41.300
entirely wrong i mean how how do you see this quite simply anybody who wants to just tear down

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:50.180
a civilization or tear down a world is is crazy foolish arrogant and what we need to do is to

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:57.540
work with what is in fact as i say not a machine but an organism to change the parts that we feel

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:04.980
need to be changed and to respect the wholeness of it and i find myself um after your um perfectly

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:13.620
accurate portrayal of me as a miserable old git i find myself i find myself curiously more um

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:21.700
optimistic perhaps than um bonita in that uh i don't think that people lack all these things

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:28.580
i mean i'm i'm sure she's right that the world is a much less hospitable place than it was for

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:35.060
finding these things for being encouraged to to to nourish oneself on them and we're offering

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:42.180
children a diet of gruel and which is a great shame but but there'll always be people who

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:47.940
will gravitate towards the magnificence of what the you know what there is and who will see life

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:55.780
as you and i i think both see it as an awe-inspiring gift and and that this is a very important

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:02.260
way to be i i often think you know if you say what do we do and this is a famously difficult

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:08.820
question to answer but i was thinking that there would be some value in saying pray

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.100
and what i wouldn't mean by that is well the only thing that's left open to us now is to pray

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.740
and hope that there's some divine being that will change it all that's not at all what i mean

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:30.980
what i mean is by adopting a devout and awe-filled compassionate vision of the world not striving

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:38.580
to know alter take and all the rest but actually so first of all to understand is in all its awe

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:45.140
inspiring complexity and that if we did that a lot of things would start happening differently

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:51.620
because so much of what's wrong is due to simple hubris the pronouncements of people who

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:56.100
think we can do it all and only a few more tweaks and we'll be able to achieve this that and the

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:02.260
other well this is this is how things get destroyed it's in all the old mythologies

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:09.860
the the arrogant know-it-all upstart who doesn't realize what he's destroying and becomes that

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:17.300
demi-edge that that brings the cosmos to ruin so that that's that's my thinking about that

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:24.980
i'm not surprised though that you ask jonathan so what is it that is worth saving or what is it

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:30.260
that we're trying to save because surely the answer to that is everything that inspires in us love

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:38.420
and beauty and and it speaks to us of all these things that are so life-enhancing i mean you can

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:44.020
live in a world in which everything is is is bleak meaningless pointless i mean you can create

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:49.860
that for yourself but don't kid yourself that that's necessarily the reality you can also live in a

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:59.220
world where you are maximally responsive to what is what is good beautiful and true and and worthy

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.900
of our love and respect and and that don't get me wrong good beautiful and true there's a reason

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.300
we have three different words they're not interchangeable with one another they sometimes

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:15.140
conflict with one another but nonetheless they have this family relationship with one another

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:20.980
in which all these positives come together they don't have to be mechanically related they don't

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:26.580
they hasn't doesn't have to be an algorithm saying go to beauty then if this then go to good or it

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:33.300
just doesn't work like that i got a lot out of that answer because um you know to be maximally

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:38.820
responsive to the possibility of love or those weren't your words but but but paraphrasing the

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:46.260
idea of being maximally responsive to what is good beautiful and true um is what's at stake in some

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:52.020
sense and also reminds me in one back in the day at one at some seminar or event you were at

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.460
i once remember writing something down quickly because the turn of phrase was so beautiful when

01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:02.100
you put it you said that life is life is a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:07.220
and you said it off the bat as if it was one of many lines but i'd love that particular formulation

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:12.500
a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness with that thought i want to bring in

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:18.420
the others now the the technicalities of what's about to follow are not altogether trivial so

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:25.860
please pay attention and if you have a question you'd like to answer ask and please type it in the

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:31.700
chat while also putting your hand up it's a double whammy we're asking you to do both because it

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:37.140
helps us to find you you might think it's just self-evident but we are we do have a 380 participants

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:42.580
and we can only see them on a relatively small screen a certain number at a time so if you raise

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:49.300
your hand through the reactions icon i believe um or at least one of the icons down below while

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:54.100
simultaneously typing your question um in some cases we'll ask you to speak it in some cases we'll

01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:02.020
read it out um also let me say this quite important point um we're very keen to hear from all kinds of

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:10.340
people um that i mean men and women i mean young and old um and so if if you're in any doubt about

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:16.740
answering asking a question um can i particularly encourage you to do so if you're feeling that

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.780
you're somewhat uncomfortable or not too sure if you should um we're very keen to get from here from

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:28.260
a wider variety of people as possible and we'll do everything we can to make that happen okay with

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:34.100
that thought in mind i'm going to look at the google doc that michael has helpfully prepared for me

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:42.180
um and i'll take a take one and while you're asked while you're answering i'll look for others

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.420
okay um

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:58.580
um the questions so far are very technical um but actually there's one here from jane's van

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:04.340
leuwen which i think is a good one it's a direct message he says um and this comes to the premise

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:12.340
of tonight's talk is there a root mass delusion um is there something is there some i think that

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:17.780
it's i understand the question he's trying to get a um is there something inherent like a premise

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:26.500
or an axiom or a fundamental part of the delusion that we need to take stock of collectively

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:31.380
and if so what is it and that's initially a question for ian while i look through the other questions

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:42.820
well i i suppose that um i would say inevitably that the there is a core

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:52.340
mass delusion which is indoctrination into the vision of the world which is delivered to us by

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:59.060
the left hemisphere untempered or relatively untempered by the right and so which is one

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:08.260
orientated towards um greed gain power i mean effectively it's about power and control

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:16.180
and it's lost intellectual subtlety because the left hemisphere doesn't have much intellectual

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:23.300
subtlety and is literally less intelligent than the right it also has no nowhere near

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:31.700
the understanding of social and emotional matters of intelligence and so inevitably once this

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:39.300
this way of thinking becomes the standard way in which all discourses is carried on in the public

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:47.300
sphere and children are brought up no longer to believe in or take pleasure in all the the beautiful

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:53.380
things that are now associated with the past because we've now moved into this brave new world

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:59.220
where we we have technical machines we don't need to read literature and look at painting and listen

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:08.260
to music and do drama and all the other things or for goodness sake develop some kind of spiritual

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:17.380
sense of something beyond you know that's if we're like that then that is it is a mass delusion

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:26.660
which will lead to great unhappiness conflict and and destruction the destruction of the valuable

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:34.180
that's what i see around me people at loggerheads much more than they were um 30 years ago interestingly

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:40.660
the relationships between all the societal groups that are now so strictly policed and and and

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:47.060
boundaryed and so on have become worse rather than better through this process so anyway there we are

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.420
okay thank you bonnie do you have a direct answer to that question or should we take some more

01:16:52.420 --> 01:17:03.620
questions i think that um if you want to think of root um causes or or the root problem i think

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:11.460
it's one of fragmentation in alienation at all scales so um the the left hemisphere wants to

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:18.420
analytical analytically reduce something to study it and so it feels fragmented and separated

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:27.300
we feel that matter is different than life and in a kind of alienated way we feel that humans

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:33.700
are separate from nature we feel individualistic we feel our countries are separate and sovereign

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:40.420
so this whole notion i guess the left brain thinks it's separate from the right brain i would say

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:47.540
that the lack and loss of any kind of sense of understanding a deep continuity at all levels

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:55.780
vertical and um vertical dimensions and horizontal dimensions uh could characterize the

01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:01.540
the sum total of the problem okay thank you bonnie i'd like to see a question from lisa

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:07.460
maros maroski if i said that correctly lisa you're welcome to ask it yourself but yeah there you go

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:16.020
hi uh thank you for hosting these wonderful talks i've really enjoyed them um the context

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:25.140
for my question um to to both of you is imagine is the imagination so i'm not really looking for

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:34.180
a factual response um but given uh as you've said that the world is an organism

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:45.860
and yet is being unmade uh are there models such as uh the caterpillar becoming butterfly that

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:59.380
uh barbremark's hubbert refers to um that uh you know show us um or could help us understand what is

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:10.660
what is happening to us um help us get through this process of unmaking and remaking um and

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:24.100
and then second to that what might be we what might we be remade into like as the next phase

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:33.620
of evolution um my my own hunch is that endosymbiosis might give us a clue um but not the answer

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:42.580
so so this is an imaginative question thank you very much and bonnie i know you might have an

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:48.340
angle on the butterfly uh caterpillar metaphor from a piece of writing that i'm familiar with

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.140
um ian if you have any thoughts initially

01:19:54.740 --> 01:20:04.340
well um the the caterpillar butterfly flightings is is extraordinary in in nature and as we know

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:09.700
the butterfly actually has a completely different genome from the caterpillar so what one's seeing

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:17.540
there is a transmogrification what um what i think i'm being asked to do is to say what this

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:25.140
butterfly is going to be like and um how we can bring about its release and and i first of all

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:32.500
what it what it is like i will be extremely cautious in predicting because i do believe

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:40.420
that one of the glories of existence is that things are not determined fully and that we when

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:48.100
we predict the future we are very often wrong so i i i would resist being asked to make any

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:53.860
prediction about that i mean although i have my own hunches which are limited by my imagination

01:20:53.860 --> 01:21:02.500
which are that probably some people will survive and will survive by leading much more simple

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:08.820
modest lives closer to nature and closer to one another than our human lives have become

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:16.020
um so i i i don't know quite how to exercise the imagination that you are asking me to exercise

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:22.180
except that i guess that my books are i hope works of an imagination and that i appeal

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:29.060
to many great works of art and literature to illustrate my my drift but i i think i'm not

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:34.900
entirely in tune with the the drift behind that there's a little thrust behind that question

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:39.300
thank you ian and bonnie i want you to answer this because i know you've got a great take on

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.460
this but while i'm doing that if celeste flavan could put her hand up please because i want to

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:48.820
take your question but we can't find you um after this but bonnie first of all on uh

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:56.260
caterpillar butterfly and what lies between yeah i'll start with that but i wanted to answer

01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:04.660
the question also in a larger context so um we and i think this is a little bit

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:10.580
building on what ian said is that we can't we we shouldn't imagine that the caterpillar

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:16.580
imagines itself to be a butterfly it's much more scary than that right like if we if we

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:24.900
had to voluntarily go through the metamorphosis process without understanding it um that would

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:35.220
truly be an act of imagination um to be to be open and welcome and inviting surprise um but you

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:40.900
said something beautiful you talked about endo i think endo symbiosis and what i wanted to say

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:48.740
is there's many places where people are using their imaginations to thread a different story

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:58.260
through the scientific facts so ian uses scientific facts any any threads a beautiful

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:05.940
story and other people can use the same facts and they'll thread a different story um and so we need

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:13.060
all all science is based on what are called interaction metaphors they're deep metaphorical

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:21.700
um assumptions about the way things are and what we need are people who are uh understand the science

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:29.860
and using it to thread a different story um and so that actually separates i think imagination

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:36.180
from fantasy so that's that's one thing and the work on counterfactuals is very important so

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:44.340
you might say but what if what if the Darwinian attitude of the survival of the fittest

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:52.260
and complex adaptive systems is not true is there a story that threads the same evidence

01:23:53.540 --> 01:24:01.780
that is more aligned with goodness truth and beauty so i've done that in writing speculative

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:08.260
philosophy on complex potential states it takes into account everything that the Darwinian attitude

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:15.460
takes into account but it tells a different story so endosymbiosis is one of those great

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:22.340
imaginative things that are emerging in our culture that want to be true to the science

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.500
but understand that there's a different story that can thread it and that's a power the

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:34.660
imagination and the other thing i'm going to say that is something that i think is

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:42.260
we should do i see there's a question of education um there's something called empathic projection

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:48.740
and kids do it really well when they're young and that is they imagine what it might be like

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:55.780
to be a pencil and they imagine what it might be like to be an ant and they imagine and in this

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:03.540
experience it's not like fantasy where you go away from the world you enter the spaces in

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:15.860
between the world that you don't understand and this is a valuable exercise in um in becoming

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:24.180
attuned to the reality of things and nature and animals so it's the process of the imagination

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:29.860
it's called empathic projection thank you bonnie i'm just going to get other questions in um

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:34.020
celeste you're welcome to ask it yourself if you're happy to do that i think we find you now

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:47.460
can we hear you i'm not sure we can hear you i can see you but maybe your volume's not on or

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:54.420
what's the shall i just ask it for you are you ready to go yeah okay thumbs up okay i can ask

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:59.540
it for you well thank you celeste it was really a question about poetry i'll i'll it's to do with

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:05.540
precision of language being a kind of antidote i'm going to get the exact wording here um

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:13.140
what celeste asked here we go can language especially that which is used with extraordinary

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:20.260
deliberation and care i.e poetry be an antidote to this wide-scale delusion can we use the tool

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:27.140
that makes us feel tethered to our humaneness to combat feelings of robotic or uninsuitive

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:33.860
existence so you can already see the poet in the question um i'm assuming the answer might be yes

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:41.060
but what's the what's the sort of bigger answer it's very much yes i i would say um

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:48.980
and it's interesting this idea of the carefully considered uh or precise because of course

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:57.460
both here and in science there is this interplay between the the precise and the imaginative which

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:04.900
which means that although in science you're working with something that seems very strict

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:10.820
in its structure in fact the discoveries come through the exercise of intuition and imagination

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:16.980
there's just so many examples of this in the history of mathematics and science and something similar

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:23.780
um could be said of course about poetry but what i was alerted to by your question was the idea

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:29.460
there's a certain sort of precision involved as well and that we need to be precise

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.380
as the situation will allow us to be but not a wit more than that

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:43.620
otherwise there is a word that is precisely right because it opens itself to a number of

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:50.100
possibilities being experienced or felt at the same time so the great thing about poetic language

01:27:50.100 --> 01:28:00.740
is its ability to be single and multiple at once this is really a theme that should be throughout

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:09.300
everything we've talked about this evening that i feel at some points there was a tendency to say

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:16.580
that you know it's bad that there are individuals um but i'm sure that wasn't what was was was meant

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:23.220
by bonita um but but individuals are terrifically important what's important is that the distinction

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:33.780
and the um um the differences don't imply a severance in fact they imply a something bigger

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:39.860
out of which they come and to which they contribute in turn so it's always this alliance of division

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:48.180
with union of the individuation with togetherness and integration and so i would say that poetry is

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:54.580
an example of this because in poetry we are trying to bring together or not trying but

01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:00.420
allowing things that are multiple to come together in our minds in a very clear and

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:06.020
precise way that if you've changed a little bit of it would ruin it so it has a very individual

01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:12.820
existence but it arises from a process which is unconscious and which is about the coming together

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:19.700
of the many into the one thank you ian bonita don't have to add to that if you don't want to

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:26.340
but you're welcome to okay i am i know it's a beautiful answer but there's a lot of questions

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:33.860
thank you bonita i'm madalina machado a great question you're welcome to ask it yourself

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:38.980
or give me a thumbs up if you're happy for me to ask it but you're welcome to you i'd rather you

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.740
asked it much rather you asked it you can do it yeah so you're unmuted now you're welcome to go ahead

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:55.780
well um i'm i'm actually quoting gregory baitson he says this question what have we here um 400

01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:03.300
plus people on a zoom call is this not radically new what sense does it make to speak of what we've

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:11.940
lost does this mostly apply to accidentals and a cosmo vision of domination which is now

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:20.420
eroding is it not about time we learn planetary interdependency for the first time together

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:27.460
as online ancestors because we're all online ancestors this is basically 10 years old

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:35.460
this duality of technology versus life is manachistic nothing on this planet is not natural

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:44.660
there's nothing not natural as spinoza said the 24 years old 400 years ago with the printing press

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:51.380
we began propaganda propaganda pd that was the Vatican now we are in a participatory age for

01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:57.780
the first time ever can we give ourselves permission not to know and honestly this is what

01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:07.700
i feel bonita is teaching at the pop-up school which i've joined and it has for me for example

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:15.220
i'll just add one little footnote in the two p language in the amazon there's no word for sin

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:23.700
there's no word for temptation there's no word for kingdom i mean what would our language

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:35.540
be languaging had those concepts not you know abducted our capacity to think differently

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:43.460
thank you wow well i would love to ask you some questions medelina another time maybe

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.380
but for now ian do you want to respond to that

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:54.100
bonnie you ian if you want to pause for some thought bonnie do you have a more immediate

01:31:54.100 --> 01:32:01.700
response yeah because i i think it ties into the previous question on poesis so she so medelina

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:10.020
is saying what would our language be like and i think um you know there's poetic language

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:21.380
is a contemplation on ideas or things that language seems to contradict right so how can

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:29.140
everything already be nature and is nature then destroying itself is nature unmaking the world

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:35.140
is like the question if everything's nature then isn't this just make nature unmaking the world

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:42.100
and i think this kind of tension if you sit with it in a certain way so you so you have

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:51.860
both trust and doubt and belief and skepticism and confidence in the in the intellect the

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:59.060
intelligence of the world and humility then something like poetry comes out and we might

01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:05.780
imagine that that's something that shares with earlier languages so i would say that

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:11.220
that's that's how it seemed to me that as the question came up right after the last question

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:22.340
ian i wasn't really quite sure what the question was i i heard that we that we were in a more

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:27.860
positive way we could communicate with one another and so on then there was a sudden remark about

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:33.060
the word sin which by the way not only in the toupee language but also across many parts of

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:42.180
the world there isn't such a word um but what am i supposed to okay if i if i dare give my own

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:46.980
interpretation the reason i chose medellina's question it it actually was it was it reminded

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:52.580
me of a colleague and friend idra adnan who was on a zoom call a bit like this one with several

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.900
hundred people from across the world and one of the speakers was lamenting how disconnected we

01:33:56.900 --> 01:34:00.660
all are all were how how we've lost connection with each other and she's saying what the hell

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.900
are you talking about look at this extraordinary process that we're part of who knows where this

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:09.700
might lead this is the beginning of something amazing and we should all get over ourselves and

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:15.140
stop complaining and start using the technology we have to you know reckon with the no doubt

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:21.300
profound problems we have um but also to trust that something is emerging that's of great value

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:25.940
and promise um and as i understand medellina's question i think she's just using that as a

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:31.220
counterweight to the sense that the things are inevitably collapsing something is also arising

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:39.860
that that is right and if we could find a way of using the interconnecting capacity sparingly

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:46.820
when it is really important and not allowing all the dross that comes with it to drown out the good

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:53.700
then that would be a marvelous thing but i remember when i went to johns hopkins in in 1922

01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:05.780
1922 1992 i'm not that in 1992 um we were i was in a in a in a lab um looking at scans

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:13.940
of brains and the head of the department came in and said you guys are great you know work you're

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:20.580
doing is great but you know what we need is more communication and i was already aware that in

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:28.980
england had started this sort of over communicative style and in america it was already a huge problem

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:35.300
people spent so much time um recording communicating and so on that the actual business of what they

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:41.220
were doing got somehow left behind and i said actually what we need is to communicate less

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:47.140
but to communicate when it's really important so i do think this is a i'm not saying this just to be

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:55.220
sort of a bit flippant um there is a huge problem with what technology is doing to our attention

01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:01.140
it is it is fighting for our attention which has been monetized and destroying our attention

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:07.220
is destroying our intelligence destroying our capacity to imagine it is degrading at the level

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:13.700
of our experience and the being so this is a worry to me i i love the fact that we're all

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:21.620
here on this call and so it's best to focus on the good bits and um but but there are mighty

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:28.260
problems as well and and and also i'd just like to say in the way that the coincidence of opposites

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:34.580
works is that if there is too much cacophony and too much actually people fall out with one another

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:40.660
and don't actually become closer to one another it's a really difficult one to to call that life

01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:46.980
is complex it's not just a simple question of there being more or less communication what is

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:53.220
the quality of that communication is a very important question can i just follow up i think

01:36:53.220 --> 01:37:00.820
i think to put it short i think um i think communication like this is neither necessary

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:10.740
nor sufficient for to to stop the unmaking of the world and so when but it can be helpful or it

01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:17.860
can be harmful but to think that it's either necessary or sufficient i think is is both of

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:26.500
those are a mistake um and i agree with you and the the the the cost in general is currently

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:34.420
out outweighing the benefit the new the new chipper non-hyperaclitian ian says um well it's

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:41.140
it's not um uh sufficient but it might might be necessary to have these sorts of conversations

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:49.140
but i mean technology technology yeah okay well i i do like the i do like the chipper ian as you

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:55.300
know um listen um there were i can i encourage everyone here to please take a look at the chat

01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.100
um because there are some mind-blowingly good questions in there and i'm really very grateful

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:07.300
for all of them um back in the day when i worked at the rsa i um i chaired quite a lot of events

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:12.020
and before i started doing that matthew taylor who was the chief executive at the time taught me

01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:17.140
that it's always better to end an event leaving people wanting more rather than drag on with

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:22.180
further questions even though there are great questions to come so i'm going to leave leave

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:26.580
you with that thought and end now um i'm very grateful for all the questions that haven't been

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:32.180
aired but they are there in the chat you can write them down we will take note of them they

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:37.540
may come up again i notice some about education about parenting about love great stuff there will

01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:44.660
be more there will be another of these events um in two weeks and another two weeks after that and

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:50.180
another two weeks after that watch this space for more information um there's also a connection

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:55.060
and inquiry session as i say um those of those of you on this event will now be signed up the

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.700
perspective as mailing list so you will hear from us about all of those things very shortly

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:04.260
but i really want to just thank you all for being there it's been a great attendance

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:11.700
and some lovely questions um and i'm very well particularly grateful to bonita roy for beaming

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:17.620
in from kinetic it to in the go chris of course for beaming in from sky um and i just want to

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:23.540
thank you all for coming and i hope you'll come back and bring your friends so uh with that thought

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:33.540
enjoy the rest of your day or evening and see you again soon take care thank you
