0	14280	Well, welcome everyone. It's lovely to see so many people from all around the world and
14280	18000	it's really an enormous pleasure to introduce tonight's speakers. I'm keen to get out of
18000	23960	the way as quick as I can tonight, not to steal their time. Just briefly to say who
23960	29280	we are and what the context of this event. Perspectiva recently celebrated its seventh
29280	35280	birthday. We're a charity based in London and we play with our elevator pitches and
35280	40880	they change over the years. But the essence of it is that we're interested in the relationship
40880	45880	between three kinds of world. The inner world of the human being, the psyche, the soul,
45880	50960	the spirit is very important to us. We see it as something sort of culturally neglected,
50960	54560	something we need to understand better. But we also want to have that in conversation
54560	60000	with complex systems at scale, the economy, politics, technology and so on. And we're
60000	63560	interested in how all of this plays out in society and contexts like this when we're
63560	67760	trying to navigate together what's going on and make sense of the world. So our tagline
67760	72520	is systems, souls and society as a way of covering the kinds of relationship we're
72520	76800	trying to make sense of. And that's reflected in our public conversations like this one.
76800	80800	But we're also a publisher and although we won't announce all the details now, we do
80800	85880	have some very good news about a significant ramping up of our publishing arm next year
85880	91320	based on a grant that we earned and this year just passed. So watch the space for further
91320	96080	perspective of books to explore these themes in greater detail. And we also can announce
96080	101480	that in June we have the Realization Festival perspective or co-founders of that with St
101480	107200	Giles House. That's right at the end of June. And we have already confirmed to speaker
107200	112880	Ron Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. And there are other things to share. We have
112880	117120	a perspective of a community you can find online. And we do have a sub-stack if you're
117120	122720	interested in our writing and we publish ourselves but also bringing other people to share the
122720	126200	space with us. So do check out perspective of a sub-stack. And if you want to support
126200	131000	us as a charity, not least at Christmas, do consider becoming a paid subscriber. That
131000	140320	really helps a lot. So, well, Ian and Alastair are people I know personally, but let me just
140320	147480	share who they are to the outside world. First of all, Ian is, I think, one of not many people
147480	155960	who can reasonably be called polymath. And he has a background as a literary scholar
155960	159800	and not just, you know, read a few books but actually taught literature for seven odd years
159800	165520	I believe. So a really deep grounding in the humanities subsequently became more interested
165520	174520	in science for a period of time and later became a neuropsychiatrist, to put it technically
174520	179520	correct, I think. And that led to, over the years, to him realizing one big thing, one
179520	183760	really big idea that I've jokingly called the McGillchrist maneuver, but it's based
183760	190120	on the hemispheric hypothesis, an understanding of the different hemispheres of the brain,
190120	194280	not so much what they do but how they are and what follows for how they attend to the
194280	197800	world and the world that's brought into being as a result and everything that follows from
197800	202400	that. And we're very, very proud to publish his book, The Matter With Things. If you don't
202400	208640	have it already, it's a mammoth two-volume book but very highly recommended and I hope
208640	212560	tonight's event at least doesn't discourage you from buying it and hopefully, you know,
212760	220000	send you on your way. Alastair is, well, I know him most recently as someone who took
220000	225640	my son's fishing and I share that with all candor because it gets to the heart of the
225640	230560	man, I think. He wanted them younger generation, he knew they were coming through Scotland,
230560	234800	we were not so far away. He wanted to show them where the food came from, took them out
234800	240080	on his boat. The delight in my son's was off the charts and it's a sort of testament
240640	246320	to Alastair's grounded spirituality that he's very much interested in questions of
246880	252000	meaning and purpose and the sacred but at the same time extremely earthbound, giving a great
252000	258000	deal of his time, energy and attention and brilliant mind to significant issues of land reform
258880	263520	and protecting those who can't always protect themselves, speaking up for those who are in
263520	270000	poverty and fighting on their behalf. So an extraordinary mind and heart and it's really
270000	276720	an enormous pleasure to bring these two wonderful people together. And tonight, we are technically
276720	282000	part of the series, Attention as a Moral Act, which this is now the ninth chapter of that. However,
282560	287200	I've given complete permission, not that they needed it, to speak about whatever they wanted to
287200	292000	and I know that over the last few days, since we decided on this event quite last minute,
292000	297760	only about a week ago, there's been some sending of books across Scotland on both parties
297760	301600	and they're both studying each other's work. So I want to leave it to them to follow the
301600	308240	conversation. The title is First Principles and Second Sight and I'll leave it to them to decide
308240	313280	where to go with that. And whoever feels most moved to speak first, you're welcome to do so.
313280	318400	I will join you again in about an hour. Take care and forward to listening. Over to you, Alastair and Ian.
322000	331200	Will I listen? Here we are. Here we are at last, which is wonderful. And you've got a,
331200	337600	I'm drinking the fine telescope, but I think you're drinking a little known whiskey called the
337600	348320	Hera. I wanted to say we're allowed to do this. But my daughter, who is a clinical new psychologist
348400	354320	you might be interested to know, she sent me a bottle of the Hera, which you'll see,
354320	360800	one that is newly produced in the house. So I will have a small drop of this while we are
361440	374800	talking. Let's not go wild. Very much to you, Alastair, and to our listeners too.
375040	383680	So I wanted to, I mean, I didn't make this title, I think Jonathan did, but it occurred to me as I
383680	389760	was reading your work that it had something quite interesting to say about the Scottish mind, because
390640	396000	in your book, I found that you quoted, I can't remember the name of the man,
396400	405840	Pharah, who said that there was a Caledonian antizygie, which is a lovely word. Sizzigie means
405840	410560	a coincidence of opposites, and he could have got away with that really. But there is something about
410560	415280	the scots that is puzzling. You know, my dad was a scot, and he was a very down-to-earth sort of
415280	420080	scot. And he said the thing about the scots is they're very hardworking, they're very precise,
420080	423840	they're very down-to-earth, they make great engineers and doctors and so on.
424000	428960	And yes, that's true in a way, but there's another completely different side to the scots,
428960	435120	isn't there? And that's the bit that encompasses second sight. So they do nice to do this split,
435120	440400	and it occurred to me, perhaps you'd like to pick me up on this or not, but there's something here
440400	446320	that reminds me of my feeling about the Germans, that they're both, you know, magnificently precise
446320	450080	and make very good engineers, but they were also really the first romantic.
450160	458640	Well, what a way to plunge in. If I might say, first of all, for people who don't know
460080	464960	your book in double volumes, I mean, look at the sickness of that, nearly 1600 pages of that,
465920	477200	with things. You're deeply wrestling with that problem as a philosopher. I'm not coming at it
477200	485920	as a philosopher, I'm coming at it more from a poetic perspective and a culturally rounded
485920	492240	perspective, an experiential perspective. What you were doing in the 1600 pages, which I should say,
492240	496240	I've only skimmed, I've only had it for a couple of days, I've just skimmed it.
499120	503760	You're very badly behaved because there are some chapters to which you gave no conclusions.
503760	513920	I had to presume that they are inconclusive. I only gave conclusions to the first part,
513920	517440	because it's science, and I wanted people who weren't comfortable with the science
517440	521920	just to get the drift. Anyway, yeah. What you're doing is you're putting so many
521920	528320	strands together, you're coming at it from a new psychiatric basis, which is fascinating.
528800	537120	You're also going into the philosophy of time, into wave motion, physics, the whole shebang.
538560	544320	You're doing so in a way that gives a wonderful grounding in these disciplinary areas for people
544320	552800	who haven't got it. The person who came to mind, as I was reading you, was Clarence Glacken,
553520	561200	Tracy's and the Rhodian show. When I was a student at Aberdeen in our first year geography classes,
561200	567840	that was one of the set books. It's often been remarked that Glacken, who said that it was when
567840	575200	the shipwrecked soldiers came ashore on roads, and he saw geometric patterns on the sand, knew
575200	580800	that this must be a sign that there were human beings here, because who else could make geometric
580800	586960	patterns on the sand? And it's often been said that Glacken was one of the last of the scholars
586960	594000	who could really pull together an immense interdisciplinary perspective and bring it
594000	599280	to bear in the matters of the world. And that, it seems to me, he wasn't the last, but you're doing
599280	606720	that here. Now, I hugely congratulate you for what you were doing, but you asked me there about the
606800	618080	Caledonian anti-sissigy, A-S-E-I-S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y anti-sissigy. It's a philosophy's gift to scrabble.
620160	627120	And basically, this was an idea that Professor G. Gregory Smith came up with in his book,
627120	635120	Scottish Literature, published in 1919, in which he said there were two moods in the Scottish psyche.
635120	640080	On the one hand, as your father just said, there is the engineer, the mathematician, the accountant.
641120	649360	On the other hand, there is this crazy world, as he puts it, where you are tossed in the horns
649360	657120	of Earthland, the imaginal world. And I think in many respects, what he is describing there
657120	663200	is what you describe when you speak of the left and right hemisphere, the left hemisphere,
663200	670480	the mechanic, the engineer, the doctor, etc., the right hemisphere, the artist, the musician,
671440	677760	the one who is away with the fairies. You could see it that way, but of course,
677760	684480	as you and I know, the fairies are not to be taken lightly, so that it's not a matter of
685360	692720	being somehow scooped up into some unrealistic fantasy. I believe that there's something
693200	700480	in the Scottish psyche, and you have more than I have because you grew up here, but I know stories
700480	710400	of and have had some experiences of people making unbelievably unlikely prophecies that turned out
710400	718400	to be entirely true. They were able to see things here, and my partner is of Scottish descent,
718400	724960	and she has her head screwed on, don't think otherwise, but she has the most amazing
725920	731760	capacity for a second sight, which she takes very much in her stride, but it is something
731760	737280	that is very real, I think, and we only don't recognise it because if you stop believing in
737280	742480	something and stop attending to it, you don't see it anymore. The faculty for seeing it withers,
743280	749600	you can't do it anymore. We need to ask, why is this important? Because here we are,
750560	755600	we've got 500 odd people on here just now, and we're diving straight into the fairies in the
755600	763440	second sight, which most philosophers would not take incredibly. Most philosophers would think
763440	771520	we are off the wall in this, and why are we taking it so importantly? That we're talking about first
771600	778160	principles and second sight. We're talking here about epistemology. In the warm-up here, I said to
778160	783920	you that right beside me here, I didn't have a plan, this is just on the shelf, I have the Institute
783920	791360	of Metaphysics by the Professor of Moral Philosophy at St Andrews University, he was writing this
791920	805040	in 1875, and Beria invented the word epistemology, which is about the theory of what knowledge is
805040	810640	and how knowledge is structured. How do we know what we think we know? What is the meaning that
810640	816960	gives meaning to meaning? Is there any sense in what we say, these kind of questions? And we're
816960	824240	diving straight into second sight here. You're speaking to me from Taliske House in Sky, I have
824240	831040	here, this was planned, a book recently published in Sky by Steve Taylor, the seer,
831040	837840	Visions, Dreams and Prophecy, I Love Sky and the Heprides. Now I know two of the now deceased seers,
837840	843760	or I knew two of them in here, two of them are good friends of mine, Norman McLeod of Bridgehouse
843760	849600	and Harris, and Taukel McLeod of Grim Shadow, the next village to me in the Isle of Lewis. So I've
849600	856640	sat with these people and had first hand accounts of their seership. Why does this matter? Because
856640	863360	if we are concerned with first principles, what is real? What is reality? Anomalous phenomena,
864240	871680	like these telepathic, clairvoyant type, precognitive phenomena, are of huge importance,
872400	878400	and they may not appear to, to many of the people listening to us just now, because of how they
878400	884800	might be situated culturally. But as you've already indicated Ian, if you are living in an
884800	893360	indigenous culture, such as those of the Heprides, then you cannot not be aware of it. No, you cannot
893360	899040	not be aware. And so you've got to factor this, you can either deny your own culture, and indeed
899040	907520	deny you, as you've just indicated, deny your own reality. Or, well then you're in a state of denial.
908960	915680	We're talking about very, really, when I was 18, I had failed my first year of physics
916320	922400	at Aberdeen University, I had to reset it, and sitting there swatting in my father's,
923200	929760	well, surgery, because the doctor's house and the surgery were united then, so I was sitting in
929760	936400	the, you know, in our surgery house at Glenmore in North Lawson Lewis. And my father was ill,
936400	944880	he was away in Rigmore, he was in hospital there, and my mother had driven off from the car to go
944880	951680	to Stornoway, seven miles away, she went there nearly every day, this was not unusual, and she
951680	959040	was going to go and fly over to Inverness and visit him in Rigmore. And about 10 minutes after
959040	966800	she left, there's me sitting studying my physics texts, and I look up, only to see my father's
966800	975520	beloved whippet dog, Sheba, who he had rescued from abuse, jump up out of the ditch, run it for
975520	985120	several, and smack into a passing fan and killed outright. I ran out, I told the driver, I'd seen
985120	991440	it, there was nothing he could do just to drive on, and I did what any rural child would have done
991440	998560	in that age, I went to the buyer, the cowshed, I got a hessian sack and a spade, placed Sheba's
998560	1004880	limp body into it, and walked out to the moor to dig a hole and start burying her.
1006480	1014000	And I would say, although that I was 18, I psychologically regressed. I needed my mother
1014000	1019920	to be there, so that she could tell my father, because this was before, this was 1976, summer of
1020800	1028880	1974, the summer of 1974, I needed my mother to be there, so that she could pass the news,
1028880	1033360	because she couldn't just pick up a mobile phone and tell my dad in a hospital in those days.
1034640	1042080	And I'd no sooner got the whole dog. When my mother's car reappeared at high speed
1042080	1048800	over the brow of the hill, I ran towards it, she screeched to a halt, she got out looking white as
1048800	1056480	a ghost and shouted at me, what's the matter? I said, the dog's dead. She said, thank goodness,
1056480	1059680	I thought it might have been a child, she thought it might have been me or my sister.
1061280	1067440	She doubled back, managed to catch the plane to Inverness, got into Rakemoor, said to my dad in
1067440	1073600	his hospital bed, Ian, I've got bad news for you. I know he said it's Sheba, isn't it?
1074000	1081360	How did you know she said it? He said, because all last night, I kept on being awake,
1081360	1090160	walking up by Sheba, jumping up on my bed and pouring me. Now, Ian, when I tell that story in
1090160	1096720	Lewis, or if you told that story in Sky, people would tell you another couple of stories just
1096720	1103040	like it, quite likely some of it experienced themselves. And this is where what you writing
1103040	1111440	about time, you culminating with that, what is it, 114 pages or something chapter on the sacred
1112560	1119040	is so important because you're opening the ground for these things.
1119360	1124080	Well, I see them as separate really, but connected, if you know what I mean.
1127440	1136880	I have very little experience of paranormal phenomena directly. But I am quite clear that
1136880	1142720	there is a realm of the sacred and it is that that perhaps this in some ways bridges in many
1142720	1148560	people's lives. I mean, I sometimes say whenever original people in Australia say that they can hear
1148640	1153280	the voices of ancestors, that they can see things happening hundreds of miles away, which turn out
1153280	1158560	to be true, who are we to say that they can't do these things. And again, I think it's atrophy
1158560	1164960	of a faculty which we have taught ourselves not to use. Richard Dawkins, a man of whom you've no
1164960	1172400	doubt heard, has a dogma that children wouldn't normally think in terms of anything to do with
1172400	1178880	the sacred or the religious or particularly the paranormal, except it was drummed into them by
1178880	1184800	our culture. But the reality, which is, you know, I quote the scientific evidence for this is that
1184800	1189600	children when they're little automatically do think in these terms, and they only stop doing
1189600	1194560	when they go to school and find that it's no longer considered smart to talk like that.
1195120	1200800	So I think that's interesting. And a couple of other things that care to me. One is that you
1200880	1205360	in sending our initial exchange of emails, you weren't mind my mentioning that you said
1205920	1212960	that Johnson and Boswell when they were up here sort of mocked this. And I don't
1212960	1217840	to didn't remember that at all. In fact, I thought it was rather the opposite that they
1217840	1224080	had exactly the cast of mind that the proper scientific person should have, which is open,
1224080	1229440	there may be something here, and they would be interested in hearing more, but they weren't sure.
1229440	1233920	And they certainly weren't dismissive. And they were very impressed by the stories that they heard.
1235040	1240720	One story that I can tell, but then perhaps we can move on from second sight to more to do with
1240720	1248000	the more general sense of the sacred is, well, there are some things that are a bit too personal
1248000	1254800	to mention, but they're absolutely riveting. But one is from my partner, who was at the opera in
1254800	1260240	London, I think with her husband, and saw a friend that she knew who was in France,
1260880	1265920	who is there and said, what are you doing here? And I don't remember the rest of the conversation.
1266800	1273840	But the next day she got news from France that he had died. And I mean, she's not
1274880	1282800	my partner, given to seeing things as it were, or I mean, she's a very, very rational down to earth
1282880	1287440	person. And I find that people who have this faculty don't make a big thing out of it. They
1287440	1293280	take it along with their rationality. And I wish we were able to have this balanced way, this
1295040	1301360	sissigie of these two things, which complement one another. I remember in also reading something
1301360	1308000	I just want to mention that you told in part of your book about, I think you had a bus of 18
1308400	1316400	archaeologists and engineers you brought from Glasgow, Edinburgh, I can forget where,
1316400	1321920	and you were in the Chossacks, I think, I mean, you've got this wrong. And there was a big question
1321920	1329280	with a last about going out at a certain time, because this was the fairest time, the twilight,
1329280	1337680	the gloaming. And you went to a sheen, which is a kind of holy place for where you see fairies.
1337680	1343200	And you were there in your sleeping bag, and you looked out and you saw, well, you should perhaps
1343200	1350800	tell it, but you saw this disc of light that was close to the ground, and was coming down the path,
1350800	1356000	it was moving along the path, as though it were sort of walking almost, and came to you and went
1356000	1362880	back into the sheen. So I thought that was, let me say, at least very interesting and not to be
1362880	1369840	just dismissed. Well, I've had your two or three experiences like that, which I've written about
1369840	1377360	at various points, you're talking about my book, Portia's Pilgrimage, the book where I really go
1377360	1383120	into the nature of the spiritual and the spiritual embodied in the land. And what interests me about
1383200	1395840	these experiences is that this opens us up to the nature of imagination. And the question that I
1395840	1403840	address in Portia's Pilgrimage, do we merely have imaginations? Or are we moving in imagination?
1404720	1412160	Are we moving in cosmic imagination? And this is where you're writing, where you open a pathway
1412240	1421200	to profound interconnectedness in your analysis of time, and how it interacts with how you see the
1421200	1429760	right hemisphere of the brain is very relevant. Why does this matter? It matters because it's
1429760	1435120	about our relationality together. It raises the question whether we're parts of one another.
1435440	1442960	Yes, and when you have time to read my book, if you ever have time to read my book at Greater
1442960	1447680	Lank, you'll see that one of my grounding, in fact, probably the central message, is that everything
1447680	1454000	exists in relation, that relations are prior to the things that are related, which is why there
1454000	1461440	was a problem with things, because things are secondary to the relations that they exist in,
1461440	1466480	the network that they exist in. So I very much agree with that. And I think the important point
1466480	1472000	about imagination is one that you make using, I think, a now customer distinction between the
1472000	1481920	imaginary and the imaginal. But I would say that there is nothing fantastic about the imagination.
1481920	1488320	Words of some courage to very important figures for me intellectually made the big distinction
1488320	1495120	between fantasy and imagination. And fantasy takes you away from reality, but imagination
1495120	1501120	takes you into the depth of reality, so that you really see it. And I think what you're seeing and
1501120	1510720	what you're describing in Lewis is that meaning of the word imagination, not a fantasy world,
1510720	1514400	but a world more real than the one we imagined is the only real one.
1515040	1526400	And I'm thinking here, I recently read Henri Corbaill's work alone. So he was a great French
1526400	1534000	Islamist. And he's writing about the scholar Ibn Arabi. And he has this wonderful line that prayer
1534560	1542640	is the supreme act of the creative imagination. Yes, I love that. Creative and he capitalizes
1542640	1552240	creative imagination. That we pray to God or pray for God, God prays for us all in a oneness.
1552240	1557600	But before we dig into that further, can I ask you the question that fascinates me? Because
1557600	1565120	I spent a number of hours with your books, giving it, as I say. But I kept on wondering,
1565120	1570880	what is motivating you here? Because, I mean, you've reached the top of your career
1570880	1578640	in conventional neuropsychiatric terms and so on. You're clearly well positioned as a philosopher.
1578640	1584000	And yet the longest chapter in your book, over 100 pages, ends up being on the sacred,
1584000	1590160	which is the risky ground. What is motivating you? What experiences have you had that opens
1590160	1596320	you to the importance of this? Well, I don't know. I mean, I can describe experiences,
1596320	1603280	but really, I think what motivates me is something rather unusual and probably prejudicial to a career,
1603280	1609280	which is the truth. I mean, it sounds grand to say that. But I think the thing that we have most
1610720	1617760	importantly lost in our lives is any sense of truth. We now believe and say the most absurd
1617760	1623120	things that have ever been said by moderately intelligent human beings. We have lost track
1623120	1628160	of truth. Even in science, we are now being constrained by all kinds of things. You can't
1628160	1636080	say this, you mustn't do that. We are losing truth. And I wanted to be truthful to the reality. I was
1636080	1641840	trying to get that. This is my life's work, this book. And I was begged by philosophers who read
1641840	1646560	my book, not to write a chapter on the sacred, because he said the philosophy in these books is
1646560	1652000	very interesting. And it can be taken seriously. But if you write about the sacred, nobody will
1652000	1660000	take it seriously. And yet in many ways, what I'm writing about leads rationally to, I wanted to
1660000	1666160	take people who couldn't countenance any idea of the sacred or the divine, perfectly reasonable
1666160	1671920	position for many people nowadays, take them by the hand and show them things that are scientific
1671920	1677840	and that are reasonable and bring them by stages to a place where they could accept it or see it.
1678800	1683680	And one of the things I feel very much about this kind of neck of the woods is something
1684240	1690480	I can't put my finger on to do with the sacred, whether or not one sees it as specifically to do
1690480	1698480	with a religion or not is another matter. But in the very natural world here, which called to me to
1698480	1704960	come and live here, is something very, very special. People who come here say there is something,
1705040	1711120	there is a new man, there is a feeling, there is, I don't know what they call it, but there's a sort
1711120	1719280	of something that speaks. And I think that, and you can't deny that, I think, unless you willfully
1719280	1725760	blot it out. And I often ask myself the question, perhaps you can reflect a bit on this. Why did
1725760	1733360	those Celtic saints have to come so far to find peace and solitude? After all, in those days,
1733360	1739360	it was before Easy Jet, you didn't have to go too far from Londinium a few miles to find total
1739360	1747600	peace and seclusion. So what drove them through wildness, through adverse climate, through taking
1747600	1753440	their precious books on little coracles across the water, pushing on and on towards the outer rim
1753440	1760160	of the known world? What were they doing? Well, Sinterdammnen in his biography of St.
1760160	1767040	Colomber, written a century after Colomber's death, around about 697, I think it was, he
1767040	1772880	testifies to that, he testifies to people coming from far and wide to go out in small books and
1772880	1779840	find little scaries, little rocks in the sea, where they could sit and be alone with God and nature
1779840	1787200	and pray for the world. You said about coming to telescope where you are just now, and I would
1787200	1792160	imagine it's probably a glass of telescope whiskey that you've got with your written also,
1792160	1797360	certainly have it in your cupboard. What else could it be? I actually did a naughty little bit
1797360	1805520	of homework here, because I dug out a poem by the Isle of Vassie poet, Sauli McLean, Samuel McLean.
1808320	1816000	I mean, talk about deep ecology. I dug out one of Sauli's poems called Tyon Beaches.
1816640	1826720	It's from his poems for Emma, who is the wife of Kuhulun, his mythical muse, his figure of love.
1827440	1833920	And I just need to explain some place meanings here. Telesca meaning the sloping rock,
1834960	1842880	the north, coming into the garlic there. Who are the story points? I know the bit you're going to
1842880	1854160	read. The bit of the reddish rock, the picture being painted here, is of the sloping rock and
1854160	1862000	then down on the sea, these two rocks and beside them there's the white sea churning in. Now listen
1862000	1868240	to this, you know what I'm going to read. Wonderful lines, but only read the first
1868320	1870720	stanza, because we haven't got time for the whole poem.
1870720	1875360	Don't worry, it's already a short bit. And pre-Charlie, is that how you pronounce it?
1875360	1878400	Pre-Charlie? Pre-Charlie?
1878400	1887520	Looks like an animal here. If we were in Telesca on the shore where the great white mouth opens
1887520	1901200	between two hard jaws, ruin and clash, and the bitter roar, I would stand beside the sea, renewing
1901200	1911920	love in my spirit while the ocean was filling Telesca Bay forever. I would stand there on the
1911920	1922320	bareness of the shore until Prishul bowed his stallion head until the rocks are worn away.
1922320	1928800	That is the place we are living. That is the integration of people, poetry and nature.
1931200	1936880	It's mind-blowingly beautiful. I mean the poem, we mustn't give the impression the place is,
1936880	1940000	otherwise the place will be overrun by tourists, which we could never do.
1943840	1949120	You know, the other thing that I think is very relevant is that haunting line with which
1949920	1963280	he begins a poem about Halle, the ruined village there, and he begins,
1963280	1972880	time the deer is in the woods of Halle. And the interesting thing is, I hadn't really picked up
1972880	1981680	until reading you, actually, that the word deer and wild are one of the same in fear, meaning
1982400	1989760	the wildness and the deer. And the deer, you know, here I am, I'm sitting underneath the
1989760	1994880	fairy on the Christmas tree, and I'm sitting at the foot of the sheen, the fairy tale, as I talk
1994880	2002560	to you, metaphorically speaking, and the deer is a cattle of the fairies. Dr John McKinnis,
2002560	2009520	there's Michael Newton's book of film. Oh, too high up. You know, in his essay on the Supernatural
2009520	2015280	in the Gallic World, he says that fairy is a metaphor for the imagination. So in other words,
2015280	2019440	fairy is an indigenous way of talking about what you call my hemisphere.
2020720	2029120	Well, it's being open to whatever is listening and being honouring of whatever comes to you,
2029120	2034000	not constantly saying, but I know better, it's like this, I already know this, I'm going to put it
2034000	2040880	in my box of knowledge. And it's getting away from that that is in our world so difficult,
2040880	2048000	it's getting back to all that is meant by Jung's unconscious mind in which the powerful
2048720	2055360	symbols. And the thing about them is that once they're made explicit, they lose their power.
2055360	2063440	So they it's a deeply implicit, unexplicit knowledge. And that is why it will always seem
2063440	2070400	lacking or fantastic to somebody who's determined to dismiss it. And as Johnson himself said,
2070880	2074560	for those who want to be skeptical, there are many reasons and he lists them, but he also
2074560	2079200	beautifully says that there are other reasons for standing back from that position as well.
2079200	2084720	He was so wonderfully unpredictable man, he was in fact, in some ways, the first romantic,
2084720	2092000	the first appreciator of Shakespeare. And he was also a rational thinker, a very down-to-earth man,
2092000	2097360	he managed to bridge these worlds we're talking about. And I'm honoured that he came and stayed
2097360	2102560	in my house. And it's not many people. He came out two nights in your house. He did. And he just
2102560	2107440	slept in what was then called the Low Bedroom, which is now my library. And as I say, not many
2107440	2113520	people can say that Dr. Johnson slept in that library. So you put me right on that because I
2113520	2120160	had picked up that Johnson was a bit incredulous. And what he says basically is that some people
2120160	2127120	are incredulous about it. But as you rightly corrected me, he himself was very open to what
2127120	2133840	he was seeing there. And to his reflection on Martin Martin, who wrote about 40 pages on the
2133840	2139040	second site. Can we take this to a slightly different level? Because one of the feelings
2139040	2146640	that I had reading or skimming your book Ian, is that it was as if there was a gradually
2146640	2155600	sloping swimming pool going into unfathomably deep water at the deep end. And you were taking
2155600	2162080	you a reader in each of your chapters by the hand and leading them round to the deep end
2162800	2170240	and saying this is actually real. This is where you swim. This is where you swim. This is where you
2170240	2176240	learn to dive. This is where you even perhaps learn to breathe underwater. Is that... Well, thank you
2176240	2184480	for saying that. I think that's exactly what I hoped. So I'm delighted, thrilled that you feel that.
2185760	2190400	But I feel that you're taking people to the same place just by a different means, a more
2191520	2198400	narrative and more poetic means. I mean, after all, one of the things that is so central to your
2198400	2206640	work, I mean, the title Soil and Soul itself tells us is this link, two links, really. One is between
2207360	2214480	the earth and whatever is above and beyond it. And the other is to the sense of the place,
2214480	2221600	the importance of place. And that's something we've been taught no longer to feel an allegiance
2221600	2228560	to a place. It's not fashionable. It doesn't fit with the post industrialized society where we were
2228560	2234320	all uprooted and taken away from our culture and thrown into a hugamugga world in a city
2234320	2240880	where we had to reinvent meaning because those meanings had been left behind deep in the places
2240880	2246240	that we came from. And you know, one of the things that staggered me when I was writing The Master
2246240	2257040	and his emissary was to discover that animals such as rats bond as much with their nest as they do
2257040	2265200	with their mother. So their nest is like their mother. I mean, that's pretty important. And your
2265200	2271120	work unveils this what's there in this landscape. I found myself and you mentioned this concept,
2271120	2277360	which I hadn't heard of. I will get the pronunciation probably wrong. Is it Keanalas?
2277360	2283840	Keanalas, yes, a deep yearning, a kind of homesickness for place, a yearning, a longing for your
2283840	2290080	place of belonging. And you know, all the cultures that have not been uprooted and
2290080	2296480	deracinated and thrown around the world have this feeling. And it's not just a useless yearning.
2296480	2301680	It's a sense of connection, a longing, which literally means a stretching out of yourself
2301680	2306880	from someplace that you wish to be close to again. See if Lewis writes very well about this.
2306880	2311520	Well, you know from soil and soil that my best known work is just land reform.
2311520	2318240	And my involvement in the 1990s was the organization that brought egg. And I mean,
2318240	2320800	you will look out your window. Can you see it from where you are?
2321440	2323840	Not, no, it's from the other end of the island, but I can.
2323840	2327360	You've probably got rum, but the mountains have rum just blocking.
2327360	2330160	You can see rum. You can see rum if you're up on the lights.
2330160	2332080	Just behind, just behind. I know.
2334080	2339440	So to me, I suppose having drawn up in the Isle of Lewis and having experienced real life
2339440	2345680	communities of place. And then as a young man, when I was 22, being sent by voluntary service
2345760	2352080	overseas to Papua New Guinea and finding exactly the same cultural understanding of community
2352720	2357600	in Papua New Guinea, as we had in Lewis, to the extent it helped me understand my own home
2357600	2364560	place properly for the first time. You know, you don't see the water till it steps into a different
2364560	2375280	water. That experience opened me to this work with people in place, which I think
2375280	2381520	is germane to our modern environmental predicament, that we have become de-racinated,
2381520	2387680	or as Anthony Gooden's sociologist puts it, disembedded from the place of our embeddedness.
2388240	2393440	And so one of the practical applications of the kind of work I'm doing and that you're doing
2394320	2397440	is the ways in which it can help to re-embed us.
2398400	2406880	We need to be re-embedded. We need seriously to be re-embedded in place and in time. These are
2406880	2413440	the two things that are most important in where we are in this world. And I don't mean that they
2413440	2419040	should confine us, but in fact, they liberate us into this other world that we're talking about.
2419040	2425440	It's through them that we find the greater, the eternal, the whatever. We don't do it by turning
2425440	2431600	our backs on place and time, but by inhabiting them. And it's the continuity of time, i.e. those
2431600	2436880	who came before us and those who will come after us, and the continuity of place that have been
2436880	2445120	disrupted for us and have made us, I don't know what to say, pilgrims wanderers, people who are
2445120	2455360	fleeing from their own being. The theory on top of my free hands be down just a very book.
2455440	2462800	And here's what they do as time is. And there is a wonderful line early on in the time is
2462800	2468640	where Socrates, I think it is, defines time as being a moving image of eternity,
2469760	2479520	a moving image of eternity. And when I first read that at the age of 20, early 20s, it kind of blew
2479600	2487760	my mind because it is so much the sense of time that you get in Hebridean religious people. We're
2487760	2493360	talking here of free church, free church of Scotland, those sort of people that are the
2493360	2500800	indigenous people of the communities. Earlier, I mentioned the retired policeman now passed away,
2500800	2506640	Norman the Loud of Bridgehouse of Harris, and he wrote, I forget my single page of notes for
2506640	2511920	tonight, so I could quote him exactly. But I've got him quoted in Poachers Pilgrimage, where I
2511920	2516720	discussed my meeting with him, in which he's describing to me the vision, the second site
2516720	2522960	vision he had of events in the Falkland war several weeks before they happened. And eventually,
2522960	2529520	he was so afflicted with the second site, that he prayed to God to have it taken away from him.
2530240	2535440	And as Steve Taylor in this book that I mentioned here, there's got a whole chapter on Norman says,
2535440	2541440	and indeed, as Norman's own daughter told me, when she came to a talk I gave in Brunbecula
2541440	2546880	a few years ago, that was successful. He was then relieved of the predicament of seeing what was
2546880	2552960	going to happen to people before it happened. But Norman said, yeah, isn't it interesting,
2552960	2558960	isn't it? Because Norman said to me, he was criticizing a book by Ludovic Kennedy in which
2559520	2565680	Oh, yes, yes, I read that bit, yes, yes, yes. But carry on, yes, yes.
2565680	2573360	And, you know, Kennedy was poo-hooing the idea of God. And this is what Norman said to me, he said,
2573360	2584560	my God, Alastair, it's a high and lofty one who inhabits us eternity. His name is holy.
2585520	2591680	Now, there you have hepody in metaphysical religion who inhabits us eternity.
2594400	2602240	I mean, it's all there, really, in that. And this sense of, you know, these things that are
2602240	2608960	double edged slightly, the high and mighty, the awe-inspiring, and the thing that can also inspire
2609520	2613600	Melancholy, or Kianlas, how have you pronounced it? Kianlas.
2616800	2622080	That seems absolutely core to the feeling one has here of
2623280	2629040	contacting something very profound. And without the sort of tinge of the Melancholy or whatever,
2629600	2636400	there wouldn't be the depths of it. And I'm wondering if you and I both, it turns out,
2636400	2642880	as I discovered, as far as I can tell, anyway, from my brief reading of you, that we both
2643600	2650800	embrace Panentheism, not Pantheism. And the important, you pointed out in what you had
2650800	2655920	to say about that, I have things to say about it in my work, but you pointed out that in some ways
2655920	2667760	that perhaps explains how so much that seems to our eyes to be painful, destructive, whatever,
2667760	2674320	is also taken up into the realm that has meaning, that has ultimate meaning. And I think that is
2675600	2679680	a way I would very much embrace with you. Yeah.
2679760	2686000	I mean, this is why Hebridean people, for those who don't know, the Hebrides are islands like
2686000	2693680	Skye, where Ian is speaking from, and the Isle of Lois, where I grew up and had my primary
2693680	2699120	connections with. The Hebridean people have really experienced hardship in the past.
2700480	2706560	They've had, you know, in an extreme environment, terrible losses in the first and second World War,
2706560	2710720	because there were such competent mariners and practical people.
2718640	2721680	Sorry about that, Ian, it looks like we've just lost Alastair.
2722640	2728080	He might be trying to come back on in. I might ask Jonathan if he wants to step in.
2729680	2733280	Well, yes, yes, I was hoping to talk about some other things with the...
2734080	2739520	Don't worry, he'll be back. He'll be back. Yeah, yeah, I'll play temporary substitute.
2740800	2745600	I was struck there for a second. I know this is not literally what Alastair said,
2745600	2748960	but it sounded awfully like for a minute he was saying the right hemisphere is a fairy,
2749840	2753120	but I want, just for a second there was, you know, were you really saying that?
2754400	2759600	No. I'm not saying that. I know you're not saying that. I know I think everyone listening
2759680	2764320	knows you're not saying that. Just I guess we keep an eye out for him entering the room up there.
2764320	2770240	Yes, yes, of course. What I was curious to understand, Ian, better was what not everyone
2770240	2774400	watching may know, and even Alastair, because he hasn't had so much time with the books yet,
2774400	2779920	may not know. In the second volume of the matter with things, although the sacred comes right
2779920	2786800	at the end, it doesn't come out anymore. There is a sort of cumulative argument that
2787520	2794240	includes rethinking many metaphysical principles from the nature of time,
2794240	2800640	the perception of value, sort of cosmological purpose, the nature of the world, and so on.
2800640	2805200	Can you talk us through just a little bit what that story is, how you end up at the sacred,
2805200	2808640	and a lot of people want to go straight there, but I feel in some ways even more interesting
2808640	2814800	is how you bridge the scientific premise to, you know, fill that out towards the sacred.
2815760	2820800	I suppose it offers two things. One is it shows that it's not disconnected from, but actually
2820800	2826880	consequent on. Hello, Alastair, and understand, I'll just finish answering Jonathan's question,
2828240	2835120	but consequence on a reimagining that we which we must make in any case of what we think our
2835120	2842480	reality to be. And I suppose the other thing is that it offers a way of bringing people who might
2843040	2849600	not be entirely close to the possibility of the divine, but don't as yet experience it
2849600	2855280	to coming to a place where they can find something that resonates. So that's really it, yes, yes.
2855280	2859600	I will take my leave again momentarily, but just to say that part of the book,
2859600	2866000	the first phase of the second volume for me is my favorite part, just for those who are
2866000	2871200	watching or interested. I can disappear for a second to let them carry on for another 10 minutes.
2872000	2877280	Alastair, I wanted to ask you, unless you have something pressing, but I wanted to use the
2877280	2882720	bit of time we've got left to talk about wildness. I don't know if you like the poem
2883760	2889120	Gerard Mandy Hopkins, but he wrote wonderfully about wildness and wilderness and how important
2889120	2895680	it is to us. And I don't think we understand this. We think that as long as there is land,
2896320	2904320	it's okay. But it being wild, untamed, undominated by the human spirit is very,
2904320	2910400	very important. And there's almost nowhere left in these islands where this is true. There are
2910400	2916880	bits of sky and bits of the outer hebrides. And you probably know something that really,
2916880	2924720	I think it's so awful that everybody watching this should write to their MPs or raise it in public
2924720	2930880	is that a Danish company who have bought parts of sky are going to erect enormous wind farms on
2930880	2940400	sky, dethroning the last really great place of wildness in this part of the world, or one of
2940400	2947440	them anyway. And this is a crime. It's not something that any human being should be contemplating.
2948160	2952480	If it costs more to put them in the sea, then do so. Or it might even mean that we become less
2952560	2958560	dependent on electricity altogether. But to destroy the beauty of these wild places
2958560	2963520	is an unforgivable sin in my view. I feel very strongly about it, I can probably tell.
2964640	2971600	Well, am I back on? Can I just say that what cut me off there is that although I had my phone
2971600	2976480	supposedly switched off, so somebody was able to get through, ironically, who is from the Isle of
2976480	2982560	Harris, one of the men in the Galgale Trust, a local organisation here in Government,
2984000	2992320	who wrestles profoundly with alcohol, with ill health, a wonderful man, a wonderful man,
2993520	2998880	who can burst into garlic song at a moment's notice. So that was the Isle of Harris. They must
2998960	3007600	have known we had to have a whiskey on the second site. Well, I hope it doesn't come on again and
3007600	3020320	fool me off. Can I engage your considerable prestige, imagination and energy in helping us
3020400	3024560	fend off this disaster? Or perhaps it's too late. But it is really.
3024560	3033040	Okay. So basically, my view is that terrestrial wind farms, as distinct from one's far out to see,
3033840	3039840	should only be where the local community decides that it wants to have them under its control
3039840	3044480	for its benefit. Like you have the Point and Sandwick Trust in the Isle of Lewis,
3044480	3049040	putting a million pounds a year into the community, whereas if it were the commercial
3049040	3055520	one, it would only get 45,000 pounds a year or something like that. So that is my position
3055520	3061520	on wind farms. The situation we're caught in just now is that the urban world is saying, well,
3061520	3066320	we need to get carbon free energy. So we'll go to places like the Highlands and Islands. We're not
3066320	3070880	going to have it from nuclear. So we'll go to places like the Highlands and Islands and we'll
3071840	3077760	we'll wire it down from there. And the problem I have with that, Ian,
3078400	3084640	is that if you destroy the beauty of nature, which in my view is this is doing, it is turning
3084640	3091760	a natural landscape into a mechanical landscape, if you destroy the beauty of nature on that scale,
3091760	3097280	because some of those sky turbines will be standing two thirds of the height of the Cullen,
3097280	3102960	the highest mountains and sky from the platform level that they'll be on. If you destroy that,
3102960	3109040	you start to destroy people's capacity to appreciate beauty and to care about anything
3109040	3116640	that really matters in this world. And destroy their access to awe and wonder, and thus erode
3116640	3122400	their imagination and destroy part of their vitality. It is a really, really serious thing.
3122400	3127920	It's as serious as it gets, in my view. So there we are. I just want to say that because so much
3127920	3134960	of what you write about and what you alerted me to is this importance in the folklore here
3134960	3140480	of the wild, how they too, you know, it's often said, oh, only kind of educated, romantic people
3140480	3146240	like you see this, but actually the ordinary people of sky and of these places also see that
3146240	3151760	wildness as crucial. But let me put a caveat in here, because a lot of my work this year has
3151760	3158160	been engaged with Community Land Scotland. You'll find two of my papers if you go into their website.
3158160	3163440	And the whole rewilding thing, well, again, wealthy people, what we call the green layers,
3163440	3170160	are buying up vast areas of Scotland to rewild them so that they can sell the carbon and maybe
3170160	3175680	later on the biodiversity uplift credits on it. And the problem that we have with this,
3175760	3180960	is that it is taking control of place out of the hands of local communities
3180960	3186560	by permanently buying it up for a purpose that the layer was parachuted in.
3189120	3197040	I'm sure you know that I wouldn't be speaking for that. And life is complicated. And one has to,
3197040	3202080	yeah, well, that's a quite different issue, frankly, from the one I'm talking about,
3202080	3206480	which is the deliberate destruction and violation of the few places of natural
3206480	3212480	wildness and beauty that we have left. I think that is appalling. And so I'm not talking here
3212480	3220160	about the rewilding by green landlords from elsewhere. But there are many sides to most
3220160	3229040	questions, but some are so clear that we really ought to be doing something to defend our world.
3229040	3236160	Well, I think you have to have what I would call ecological restoration alongside the people.
3236160	3239440	Many of these places were cleared of their people historically.
3240320	3241200	Exactly.
3241200	3244400	Young people cannot buy places to live in a place like Scotland.
3244400	3245360	I know, I know.
3245360	3248880	Because second homers and what have you, price them out of the market.
3250080	3256800	How do you pull that together? At the deepest level, you pull it together by reactivating
3256800	3263920	imaginative potential. I've been working this past month on an SE for Dark Mountain Journal,
3264640	3270880	which I have titled A Sermon to the English on Land Reform. And it's set out in the structure
3270880	3275520	of a traditional Scottish sermon. It'll be out in Dark Mountain Journal, I think probably around
3275520	3281360	Easter time. And it's basically suggesting to the English what they need to do to achieve what
3281360	3288720	we're doing in Scotland was now about 3% of our land and community land trust, so 500 community
3288720	3294720	land trust. But that comes from the artists and musicians. It comes from the poets. It comes from
3294720	3302000	the songwriters. It comes from the visual artists who inspire a vision, your right hemisphere.
3302560	3309520	Inspire a vision of what the future can be so that we remember what has been dismembered.
3309520	3315600	We revision how the future could be. And then we do the political and practical left hemisphere
3315600	3323520	work of reclaiming how to bring it into being. And we're in a perilous political time just now
3323520	3330080	because these massive amounts of money and the desperate imperative of action and climate change
3330640	3337920	is powering up forces, which in my view are recolonizing our land and should have no place
3338000	3343120	in modern Scotland. And you're so right that it is also important that this is to do with
3343120	3349360	a cohesive community and a cohesive society. But I don't think that speculators from other
3349360	3356080	countries coming in and the Chinese are behind the dispoliation of many Greek islands. They put
3356080	3361520	money into it and these unutterably beautiful and sacred landscapes are destroyed. Anyway,
3361520	3366800	there we are. I'm not arguing here that we don't need green energy, we do, but we have to do it
3366800	3375200	in a different way. Yeah. Thank you both so much. I'm here to usher in the next phase of the evening
3375200	3381520	to bring in the, you know, feeding the 5,000, but it's going to say feeding the 500, but it's
3381520	3387920	about that. And I want to ask a couple of things, partly to give people time to write their questions.
3389040	3394080	Because of the numbers here, choosing people from the audience is far from straightforward.
3394160	3398160	So we'd much prefer if you could please write your question. The chat is now reopening.
3399280	3404240	And we have colleagues who will be looking at those questions and choosing among them.
3404240	3408640	It's not as simple as first come, first serve. We're trying to get a range of viewpoints,
3408640	3413680	a range of kinds of people. And we're trying to kind of keep in mind what's been asked before.
3413680	3418320	So if we don't pick your question, please don't take offense. It's not personal.
3418480	3423920	I'm really glad with where you ended up in a way. I know it was a bit tense,
3423920	3429920	but it's sort of interesting because I began introducing Perspectiva in terms of systems,
3429920	3434480	souls, and society. And you kind of got there at the end because, you know, if you begin with
3434480	3441280	second sight and premonitions and possibly the paranormal and the sacred and you, but you come
3441280	3447920	around to, you know, a real live political issue in a beautiful place with contested values and
3448560	3454000	competing economic logics and so on. And for me, this is really in some ways where it's at.
3454000	3461360	It's the challenge of how do you navigate these different things? So the question is,
3461360	3465200	first of all, for Alastair, and I have a slightly different one for Ian, although you can both answer
3465200	3472000	them both. I'll say you invoke imagination. And I know Ian would be a big fan of imagination in
3472000	3478240	general as well. But I wonder sometimes if people expect too much of imagination. If it
3478240	3483680	if it's always assumed to be filled with goodness, because there's also dark imagination. There's also
3483680	3489360	the imagination of those who long for world domination and so on. What is it in the nature
3489360	3494880	of imagination that gives you hope? Or rather, what what forms of imagination need to be brought
3494880	3500400	into being such that they're actually beneficent and positive and not destructive?
3502240	3504800	Tell me more about what it is that gives you faith and imagination.
3505760	3512640	I think that as Henri Corbass says in his book on Ibn Arabi, it must be grounded in the divine.
3514800	3521840	Hebridean people take God very seriously. They take God as a matter of fact, a matter of experience.
3523840	3531280	In Bernard Shaw's play, Joan of Arc, which is somewhere behind me, like, don't turn around
3531280	3538560	to get it. No, no. We know it. We know it. With my fairy god. You see, what a wonderful fairy I've got.
3540080	3546720	Her inquisitor says to her, how do you know that the voices of God that you hear
3547360	3552720	are not just your imagination? And Joan says, but that is how God speaks to us.
3554560	3560080	That is how God speaks to us. So on your question about dark imagination, I would say
3560160	3565920	that if imagination, if I work with imagination, if our work of art and of intellect
3567200	3572240	is not grounded in the God space, if it is not grounded ultimately in prayer,
3573040	3578400	we must be very careful. Otherwise, as many native peoples will tell you,
3579360	3589040	the gift or charism can very easily turn toxic and poison both its processor and those around it.
3589040	3592320	So I would say that if we are working with imagination, Jonathan,
3593520	3599360	consider starting from a place of prayer, consider starting from a place of offering
3599360	3606800	yourself and your works to that which will serve what the Russian Orthodox call the fellow Kalia,
3606800	3611440	the love of beauty, the divine beauty, our relationship with each other.
3613520	3616960	Thank you, Alastair. Ian, do you want to come in on that? I've got a direct question for you as well.
3617840	3624240	Yeah, well, I would say, I think Corrid said something like that the imagination is the
3624240	3632240	repetition in the finite mind of the infinite I am. So he's really saying the same thing that it is
3632240	3638320	the way in which God speaks, but you're right that it can be perverted as all things in the
3639200	3644720	human realm can be perverted. And I don't want to go there now because it would take us too long,
3644720	3650400	but I would stand up for the idea that there is a drive which wishes to thwart and pervert,
3650960	3656320	and that it's what is traditionally meant by evil. I think it is a real thing that has power
3657360	3666720	in human doings. And people think I'm mad, but I defend myself on another day. But that's what
3666720	3671840	I would say about it. So Ian, it's up to the follow up question to that. And this is the last one
3671840	3678800	I'll ask. My sense is that very few people will think you're mad, but some might find you coy
3680000	3686480	in the sense that we had a moment there. Well, we had a moment there where we were
3686480	3695120	alighting between the paranormal and the sacred. And I understand with your scientific background
3695680	3701520	and due caution about misinformation and being misunderstood and so on, I fully respect and
3701520	3708160	understand that to keep things grounded and real and yet open as well at the same time. And we've
3708160	3712800	had this kind of conversation before. But it's intriguing for me that as we're talking about
3712800	3716640	fairies and you're joking with Alistair about fairies, I think there must be some people in the
3716640	3723440	audience who are like, what are they? Are they really saying they're fairies? And on second
3723440	3729280	sight and premonition, are we actually, is it okay now in a public conversation for reputed people
3730160	3734800	to entertain these possibilities? I'm just saying, is that indeed the case?
3736640	3742320	Well, fairies and second sight are perhaps not the same thing. And it depends exactly what you
3742320	3751760	mean by fairies, not as they're commonly imagined, but more messengers perhaps from another realm,
3751760	3759600	such as angels were thought to be. Although I'm not conflating the two, I have to answer so quickly,
3759600	3769120	I can't really make the niceties I want. But my view on second sight and the paranormal is exactly
3769120	3776720	that of my hero, Johnson, which he ended up saying, I came away not entirely convinced,
3776720	3781520	but willing to believe. He listened to the evidence, he was interested in the evidence,
3781520	3785520	he asked more questions, he didn't dismiss it, he thought there's probably something here,
3785520	3791120	I don't know quite what it is. And that's, it's not coinage, it's, I think, a natural
3794160	3799360	discrimination between types of issues about which one can be relatively certain and those
3799360	3805120	that one can't. Right. Okay. Thank you very much. So listen, can I just say, Johnson, you know,
3805120	3810560	there's a huge amount, I mean, that's just three I could reach just now. There's Ted Cowan, the
3810560	3815440	late professor of Scottish history at Glasgow University with Lizanne Henderson and Scottish
3815440	3821520	fairy belief. In Scottish scholarship, this has taken very seriously because it is understood
3821520	3828320	as being about ways of seeing into and talking about the imagination. It's like it's a symbolic
3828320	3835360	way of speaking about things. Okay. I appreciate that and I appreciate both of you
3835360	3838880	being both open about it and discerning and discriminating about it. We have some great
3838880	3845120	questions. If it's better to hear from the person if possible, so we're going to try this initially
3845120	3849120	and if it doesn't work out, I'll just read them out. But first of all, Catherine Lord, do you
3849120	3853680	want to try and raise your hand and if we can find you, we'll unmute you. Hello. Okay, that's
3853680	3862720	have your question. Thank you. Yes, I'm interested in how we educate children and the implications of
3863920	3868640	the seeing in whole ways and seeing with our imagination and what we do with our children's
3868640	3873280	schools. And I'm just interested in how you feel maybe our education system might need to change
3874240	3880000	so that we don't take, stop us being able to see things in with our right hemisphere.
3880880	3888720	Well, naturally, I feel very strongly about that. And I've talked many times about how I think
3889440	3894720	education in this country and in the West generally could be reformed. I think the loss of the
3894720	3902160	humanities, the prevalence of only STEM subjects is disastrous. And I think that education is about
3902160	3908800	awakening a mind that is seeking, not about sating a mind with information and then checking
3908800	3913760	whether it can be regurgitated. I think teachers should be freed up to talk about,
3914880	3920000	I mean, not go wild, but to talk about the things that really interest them. That was how I was
3920000	3925200	educated. And it worked because the spark came to me, if you like, that was right hemisphere
3925200	3931680	speaking to right hemisphere. So I think all those things really in brief. Thank you, Ian. Appreciate it.
3931680	3936320	I would come in at that. Here's what you're kippling puck of pooks. He'll just hand it down to me by
3936320	3943920	the Christmas tree fairy. You know, it's fascinating because what's going on in the first chapter of
3943920	3948880	this book and kippling's mother was one of the McDonald's sisters, four sisters who had their
3948880	3956400	family roots in sky. What's going on there is that puck appears when the when the children say
3956400	3961360	by oak and thorn and ash or something like that, puck appears, he's the last fairy in English,
3961360	3966160	England, because he says the English have frightened the rest of us away. And he says,
3966160	3972320	I too will go when the trees are all gone. What does he do to reconnect the children,
3972320	3978000	but he reactivates their imagination. Okay, he starts telling them their history. It's a very
3978000	3983280	robust your history as you'd expect from a writer of the empire, not the kind of thing you'd read
3983280	3988480	to children today, perhaps. But that is what's so fascinating. He starts telling stories. So in
3988480	3997440	answer to the question of question, I would say the way you reactivate imagination in children is
3998880	4008000	story, is beauty, is creativity. Yes, I'd just like to say though that I'm
4008000	4014880	certainly I don't can't speak for others, but I'm not saying that rigor, clarity, logic, and all these
4014880	4020480	things are not important. They're under taught actually these days, children are indoctrinated
4020480	4025120	rather than taught how to think on both sides of a question. So I'm not saying that I'm just
4025120	4031600	saying that we need to get back into the curriculum, imagination, narrative, myth, poetry, music,
4031600	4037520	drama, all the rest. Yes, history, our own history above all, but history of other places too.
4038080	4042960	Thank you, Ian and Alistair. And thanks for the question Catherine. Caroline Thompson,
4042960	4048560	if you could please raise your hand and let yourself be known. We'll try and unmute you.
4048560	4054640	And while you're getting ready, if Anne-Louise Wolters can also do the same. But first of all,
4054640	4064400	Caroline, if we can find you. Hi, hi. Thank you so much for answering my question. I'm a composer
4064400	4073520	and I write music. And I always feel people appearing in my music who has recently died or
4074080	4080640	people who I'm very interested in while I'm writing. And since you are both like the
4081760	4090000	heart and ratio in the philosophy and poetry, I was thinking, maybe you could have a poetic
4090000	4098800	discourse about how people who died in front of my music and where the music comes from anyhow.
4098800	4105120	So that's a bit broad. Yeah, I know. It's it's a bit of a complicated profession.
4107600	4109280	Yeah, I don't want to either of you want to take it on?
4110960	4117280	Well, I'll kick off if you like. I mean, of course, immediately I thought of
4117360	4121840	Elgar's Enigma Variations, which were pieces of music inspired by people some of whom had
4121840	4126480	recently died. But I don't think that's what you're talking about. I mean, I think that
4127440	4133200	the question where these things come from is very interesting. But the answer seems to be that they
4133200	4140240	do not certainly originate in our conscious mind. They come through us in some sense. How far away
4140240	4146480	that that thing originates, I don't know, from my consciousness. But it certainly comes through
4146480	4152240	my unconscious mind. And I think it comes to all artists in that way. And it's probably something
4152240	4157600	bigger than ourselves that we don't appreciate that is speaking to us in forms. So I mean,
4157600	4165120	that's really what I would briefly say. I have a whole chapter on creativity, by the way,
4165920	4172320	in the matter of things. Yeah. Alastair? Well, just I know that when I'm writing,
4173360	4183280	and I really start tripping out. It's like, I don't cry easily, but a few tears will come to
4183280	4191440	my eyes. And it's just like, I'm immersed in something. And I'm telling it as it is, Ian
4191440	4197840	talked about the importance of truth. Truth with a capital T is so important, because
4199760	4206160	in the Greek, the word, the Greek New Testament, the word truth, Elysia, also means reality.
4206880	4216720	In the Sanskrit, the word truth, Satya, your Gandhi Satya Graha, truthfuls. Also, as Gandhi
4216720	4222960	points out, means realityfuls. So we're talking here about real creativity. We're not talking
4222960	4230240	about narcissistic art, egotistic art. We're talking about real creativity is about being
4230240	4238640	receptive to listening to cosmic truth. And allowing that to come through in whatever our art or in
4238640	4246000	Ian's case with his book is intellectual creativity. It is trying to give expression to
4246000	4253920	honouring that honouring that. Thank you. Thank you. A little shade of something that Jonathan
4253920	4258480	and I mentioned, I'll just say this quickly, which was that sometimes there is also a slight
4258480	4266720	dark side to this. My own experience of the diamond that works in me when it does is that
4266720	4273360	it's pretty ruthless. I don't really care about my health or happiness. Yeah. Yeah. Ask my wife
4273360	4280480	the same question. I mean, Ian, I was giving you a talking but becky and an old woman came up
4280480	4287840	afterwards and said to Viren, my wife, are you his wife? Viren said yes. And the old woman said
4287840	4296800	he must be very hard to live with. Surely not. Okay. Caroline, I'm just trying to get through
4296800	4302640	a few more questions just to respect the audience. So Caroline, I think you're unmuted now if you
4302640	4312560	want to ask a question. Yeah. Your discussion of Sianolas was about the place of longing,
4312560	4323280	and it kind of made me remember the concept of thin places and that idea that in those sacred
4323280	4331120	places, spiritual places, you are very close, like a hair breath away from the divine. Do you
4331120	4336640	have any comments on that? Am I getting close to what you were referring to? Absolutely is what
4336640	4340880	I thought. So I don't mean to jump in ahead of you again, Aleister, but I mean, that is exactly
4340880	4345920	what I mean. That's what people say when they come here. This is one of the thin places. It is.
4345920	4352640	It absolutely is. And the other world is closer here, and no wonder therefore one can hear,
4352640	4358480	feel, and see things that the noise of the city drowns out. Thank you very much. And then we have
4358560	4366160	a question from our old friends. No, no, no. George McLeod of the Iowa community.
4368880	4374240	One of George's things was George's big question, what's the matter? And he said matter is the
4374240	4383680	matter. It is when we forget that the divine is incarnate in matter. That's when we have to
4383680	4388960	ask what's the matter, because we've forgotten that incarnation. You may have forgotten that I asked
4388960	4395760	what's the matter with things. Yeah, just to briefly remind us the meaning of your title,
4395760	4400800	the matter with things, because that appears to be pertinent. Since you're saying there's
4400800	4405600	something going wrong that needs sorting out, what's the matter? And there's a lot of the
4405600	4412000	matter is to do with our privileging of a kind of very debased idea of matter, devoid of any
4412000	4417520	imminent spirit, simply lumpen matter, and our belief that the world is composed of things.
4417520	4422080	It isn't. It's relational, and things have secondarily emerged from a web of relations.
4423040	4427360	Okay, wonderful. Thank you for that quick answer. Rupert Reid, our old friend, Rupert Reid, come
4427360	4437440	and give us a question. Good evening, both. Yeah, so I wanted to pick up on Ian's remarks about how
4438400	4444880	we are disconnected, estranged from truth in this civilization. And I wanted to suggest
4445600	4451520	that while that's completely true, there's also a tendency which is opposite, maybe equal,
4451520	4458000	that's what I'm kind of asking, which is of an enormous hunger for truth that you can sense here
4458000	4463200	tonight in the audience, but also in the two of you. For me, one of the ways this has come through
4463200	4468960	very strongly in recent years is in the absolute determination in the climate movement to break
4468960	4474880	through in a new way by truth-telling and not staying in the normal confines of a sort of
4474880	4479520	conservative risk analysis of where we are at. So if there's a question, the question would be,
4479520	4485120	I'd love to invite you both to comment on, well, firstly, whether you agree. And secondly, if so,
4485760	4491520	how do we enable this second tendency, the tendency of the love for the truth and the
4491520	4496560	authentic, to overtake the first tendency which Ian was so powerfully mentioning?
4498240	4499440	You go ahead, Alistair.
4501600	4506080	I missed the very last, because we're getting lots of captions coming up over my transcripts,
4506080	4509760	I'm very deaf, I missed your very last point of your question. Could you just repeat it?
4509760	4513360	So the very last point was how do we strengthen the tendency to
4513360	4519760	for the truth, the love of truth, to disconnect from it? Yeah.
4522320	4529040	You be truthful. You make an ethic of trying to be truthful. It's very difficult. We're in a
4529040	4534320	culture where we are all expected to tell little white lies because they help to lubricate our
4534320	4545360	relationships. Well, bugger that. That starts to distort. It's the whiskey speaking.
4548720	4553920	It's very difficult. It's very difficult. And with, you know, I don't think any of us always
4553920	4561840	succeed. But you really work being truthful. You work on being honest. I had a dream last night
4561840	4565440	about this. I had a nightmare last night. I woke up about three in the morning.
4566320	4572560	I was at the end of our house, the surgery in Louisbus. I was standing by the road. And there
4572560	4579120	was, it was dark. It was pitch black. And what we would call a poor Trojan, a poor soul, a very
4579120	4584400	simple man in the village who used to wander from house to house, was standing there. And he
4584400	4593280	pointed out across the moors. And he said to me, there's a madman raging out in the moor over there.
4594320	4599440	And I went back into the house. I started locking all the doors to my father's medicine square and
4599440	4605920	all the rest of it. And there was a sense of discretion, this fear coming in over me and a
4605920	4613920	sense of that the madman was out to get what my father, the doctor, represented and the national
4614080	4620800	health service. And then I woke up and for a while I was lying in bed spooked. But when I woke up
4621520	4627040	this morning, it all fell into place, Ian, in terms of the questions you've been raising about the
4627040	4633120	dark side of the creatives. Because who was the madman out in the wilds? The madman was your
4633120	4639760	right hemisphere. The madman was what the doctor's surgery and medicine and the NHS cannot control.
4640720	4646640	And the dream was saying, don't forget the madman, that is, madman is part of me.
4647760	4654720	Yes, I well, if you see the truth, the truth is facing that the truth is acknowledging that.
4655760	4662000	Okay, no, I get what you're saying there, but I don't want anyone who to run away with the idea
4662000	4666320	that I think that the right hemisphere has anything to do with madness, the left hemisphere is much
4666320	4673760	closer to that, or with just a fairy not fairy nonsense, it's a it's our truth telling organ,
4673760	4681440	actually. And I go into that for great length in the first part of the book. What I would say
4681440	4689040	in our answer to you, Rupert, is that you don't have to teach a hungry person to love food.
4689840	4695840	And people are starved of truth and they know it. And that's why there's a hunger for people to buy
4695920	4702080	an incredibly long book which aims to help them on a journey. And from the messages I get from
4702080	4707040	people all over the world of all ages, they don't feel they've been let down on that. They feel
4707040	4711280	they have been taken somewhere that has made a difference to how they think. So that's really
4712400	4718240	what I'd say. I've just finished reading that hideous strength by C.S. Lewis. I don't know if
4718240	4724240	you've read it, it's quite a good book really. And it really is about how when people see something
4724240	4730960	desperate happening and destroying everything beautiful and imaginatively rich, they eventually
4731760	4737520	the falseness crumbles. I hope that we'll live to see that happen. Thank you both.
4737520	4743360	Thank you both. And thank you, Rupert, for the question. Just in the interest of time, Gary Hoover,
4743360	4749520	I'm going to slightly paraphrase your question, which is a great question. In effect, Gary is
4749520	4755360	arguing, and I've noticed the same thing, that many describe the modern world in terms of an
4755360	4761200	anthropogenic extinction event, that the world as we know it is ending, typically ecologically,
4761200	4768160	but sometimes technologically. And this may or may not be an accurate scientific prognosis,
4769040	4775600	but it's limited, sort of reductionistic and technical in its perception. There are other
4775600	4780480	ways of framing this in terms of, I don't know, apocalypse, Armageddon, or something more imaginal
4780480	4787360	or this kind of thing. How would you see it both sort of scientifically and more spiritually?
4787360	4791040	How would you describe the state of the world and the predicament that we're in?
4792400	4798560	And I'll go with that. Alistair first, please. I don't think we're going to, as human beings,
4798560	4803040	become extinct. Many other species are already becoming extinct because of their actions.
4803040	4810000	I don't think we're going to become extinct as some people make out. I think the challenge of
4810000	4817440	these times is to take in the suffering of the world that we are all participants in creating
4818800	4826000	and to use this as a wake-up call to building community and creating beauty or being open to
4826000	4832880	the creation of beauty through us. In my most recent book on climate change, Riders and a
4832880	4837200	Storm, I've written two books on climate change, but the most recent one, the final two chapters
4837200	4843920	are about community land trusts in Scotland, because that is where on the ground I see beauty
4843920	4850400	being recreated, both with nature and in human nature. And that is something we can all do,
4851360	4855680	you know, whether we're in an urban context, like I am here in governing Glasgow or in the
4855680	4861520	Hebrides or whatever, we can all work on our relationships with each other and our
4861520	4868320	relationships with nature, making beauty, making love. It's not rocket science, it's just about
4868320	4873360	sharing, making a meal, cooking, sharing a book, having a chat like this tonight.
4873920	4876880	Thank you, Ian. How about our things?
4876880	4883200	Well, I guess I'm also interested just in your sense of how bad things are,
4883200	4884800	like, you know, the state of the world.
4884800	4888480	Well, I would say, first of all, I meant everything that Alistair said there,
4888480	4894400	those words could have come from my lips. I do think things are very bad. I think it's possible
4894400	4900320	to use various techniques we have of soothing ourselves and thinking that it's probably not
4900320	4906560	all that bad. And it may not be that bad because prediction is an imprecise art.
4908160	4915600	We usually are not entirely accurate in our predictions. And science and imagination
4915600	4923600	need to be in dialogue. Science alone cannot really tell us what's wrong with the world we're in
4923600	4929760	or where it's going next. Imagination has possibly more to say about that, but the facts that science
4929760	4935520	can give us, when it can give us facts that we can rely on, which is not as often as people think,
4936080	4942640	is very valuable. And you know, my whole epistemology, Alistair, in the second part of my book,
4942640	4947280	is that we need to bring together science and reason with intuition and imagination,
4947280	4952240	that none of these is dispensable, and we need to bring them all to bear. I think if we do,
4953280	4959040	we see both that things are very bad. And in my view, that there is the possibility for something
4959120	4964000	unforeseen to happen, which is a revolution in the human spirit. And that may sound all
4964000	4968640	very well when we're facing these practical problems. But actually, the practical problems
4968640	4976080	won't be solved by simply practical solutions. They also need to be coupled to a renewal of a
4976080	4984000	spiritual dimension to our lives. And I think the signs that that is very much craved by the young
4984000	4991680	and the old now, and that this is a sign of hope, and that also just to say, because you said something
4991680	4996880	like we can all play a part, this is hopeful for everyone, because people say, oh, what can I do?
4996880	5001200	I'm so small, the world's so big. And by the way, our world is so small. Look at the size of the
5001200	5005840	cosmos. That's got nothing to do with meaning. That is the left hemisphere's way of thinking,
5005840	5012480	measuring. But actually, how big is love? How big is the divine? How big is the sacred? And they're
5012480	5017600	all in here, and they can all begin from here, and you can unleash them, you can grow them.
5017600	5022480	And that is what we can all begin that work tonight, not even tomorrow morning.
5027680	5032800	Yeah, I mean, if this was an auditorium, applause with breakout at this point. Listen,
5032800	5041440	thank you. We've reached our 101 minute mark. And I'm very grateful to you both. I'm grateful
5041440	5047600	for the audience questions. I would encourage those who've enjoyed the chat during the Q&A
5047600	5054640	to save it. There is a way of doing that whereby you look for the dot dot dot sign, the ellipsis,
5054640	5058880	and click on that, and it usually lets you save the chat. That will give you access to any links
5058880	5065680	that were given there. And I'd also encourage you to search out Alastair's books, particularly the
5065680	5069520	ones he mentioned, Writers on the Storm and Climate Change, I very much recommend.
5069520	5076560	Poacherous Pilgrimage and Soil and Soul. For Ian, of course, the matter with things,
5076560	5082320	particularly highly recommended. And if you want to check out Perspectiva,
5082320	5087440	we've also given our link to the website. Here we have a sub-stack which you're welcome to join.
5087440	5091680	And if you become a paid subscriber, there will be perks forthcoming for those who do so.
5092240	5098960	Thank you very much. The other thing you need is the email for the fairy on the top of Alastair's
5098960	5103600	Christmas tree. You'll find all the books that you need at the very moment you need them.
5103600	5108480	Yeah, if you want the books at hand, I'll get that contact information for the Christmas tree
5108480	5113680	fairy later, Alastair. But for now, I wish you all a thank you. And you can just briefly unmute to
5113680	5117440	say bye. It's going to be a bit cacophonous, but let's enjoy the merriment for a second.
5117840	5121600	If we can do that, guys, if not, then we just have to enjoy the silence.
5122720	5124800	Thank you. Bye.
