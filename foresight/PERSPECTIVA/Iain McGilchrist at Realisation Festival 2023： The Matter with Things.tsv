0	8760	Thank you very much.
8760	14120	And I'm conscious that you've all had already a very full day, and I'm also conscious that
14120	20480	many of you came expressly to hear Ian talk and meet him in person.
20480	26680	And Ian has prepared a lecture, you know, something substantive directed at this event,
26680	29920	the theme of difference from his work.
29920	33280	So I'm going to introduce him, introduce the context of his work a little bit for those
33280	40720	who don't know it, then step aside, let Ian take the stage, speak to him for 15 or so
40720	44160	minutes myself, and then pass on to you for Q&A.
44160	48000	And I'm guessing we're going to have more questions and we'll have time to answer.
48000	53520	So do think not only about what you want to ask, but how you want to ask it while Ian's
53520	55360	talking.
55360	58160	It's a real honor to introduce Ian McGilchrist.
58160	61600	I've now known Ian since 2011.
61600	66280	There was a moment when I was working at the Royal Society of Arts in London, when the
66280	70240	chief executive there, Matthew Taylor, who normally chaired events, just couldn't do
70240	72000	the one with Ian.
72000	75600	And two days before, I was given his fairly large, but not quite as large as the current
75600	79160	book, The Master and his Emissary.
79160	80160	And I was very excited.
80160	83320	I thought, well, very interesting bold thesis here.
83320	84320	Started reading it.
84320	88200	The evening of the event, Matthew actually showed up backstage just before we were about
88200	89680	to go on stage.
89680	91840	And I was like, oh, please tell me I can share this event.
91840	93680	Please, like, last minute.
93680	95480	But actually, it worked.
95480	100440	I went on stage, spoke to Ian, and that was the beginning of a very important professional
100440	101440	relationship for me.
101440	106600	And since then, I've done a great deal of work promoting Ian's ideas.
106600	113520	I feature in a documentary about him, visited his house on Sky, and now, by many strange
113560	118240	twists of fate, became the publisher of his most recent book, The Matter with Things.
118240	121840	Now, as some of you may know, and even if you don't know, you can just glance at it
121840	127120	here if you can see the, I might hold it up if I have the strength in my left arm.
127120	134520	But this is two very significant sized tomes, two volumes of The Matter with Things.
134520	140720	And I believe Ian may have the precise details, but the words alone are roughly 600,000.
140720	144200	And then that's just really kind of where it's getting started, because you also have
144200	152200	quite significant appendices, notes, bibliography, references, index.
152680	157480	So by the end of it, it's something approaching a million words, I believe, for both volumes
157480	159600	together.
159600	164920	But they're wonderful, wonderful, wonderful words, and many have read every one of them.
164920	169320	And some have described it as, you know, really the book of our times, the book that everyone
169320	173080	must read, of course, there's many of them, but this is one of them, I think.
173080	178520	And it's very, very deep, and it does deal with very fundamental matters about the nature
178520	184720	of life, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life towards the end of the second book,
184720	185720	especially.
185720	191720	And so I just wanted to share one more thing, which is that when I was describing my experience
191720	196840	of reading this book, I posted a photograph of a large pencil that comes from the United
196840	201960	Nations, so one of these sort of souvenir pencils, and it was put along the spine of
201960	206600	the book diagonally, so it looked, you could sort of see the sort of significance of the
206600	212720	book somehow in the image, you know, it's the social media age, I was doing what I could.
212720	218280	And then somebody said to me, ah, yes, this is actually a three-pencil book, and I said,
218280	219280	three-pencil book?
219280	222200	He goes, yeah, that's the sort of, you know, the might of times if you have to scribble
222200	226600	and take notes and underline and write in the marginalia, all the different things about
226600	227600	the book.
227600	231440	This was Damien Walters, I think his name is, who's a science fiction writer.
231440	234640	I said only three pencils for the book to this size.
234640	239520	He goes, well, the complete works of Shakespeare are only two and a half.
239520	245720	So you can see there, it's really a commitment to read the book, but one that's richly rewarded,
245720	249200	and I believe Ian's going to speak to some major themes from it.
249200	254040	So I think for now that's all I can say, and look forward to talking to Ian later.
254040	256040	Ian McGillchrist, everyone.
256040	270680	Thank you very much, and I hope you will tell me if I'm not audible, and I'm telling the
270680	274160	thing is to have it as close to your beard as possible without touching it.
274160	278520	I'm going to try and do that for however long I speak, and I'm also rather sorry that I
278520	282160	have to do a sort of Tom Jones impersonation.
282800	289280	I'm slightly beyond that, but this is the way the system works.
289280	291080	I'm very pleased to be here.
291080	297720	I'm delighted, and I think that this is the right audience, the ideal audience, to engage
297720	305160	with what I felt I was doing in writing this inexcusably long book.
305160	309600	I myself have told that this book was terribly important, and I really got to read it, but
309600	313640	I had to say how long is it, and when I was told, well, the text goes to 1300 and something
313640	316640	pages, I had to say, well, forget it.
316640	320680	I hope though that you can be encouraged to dip into it.
320680	327920	It covers a lot of ground, and I think it's quite permissible to dip into chapters and
327920	333920	see how that works, and then I'm rather hoping that in the end you'll see that it's a single
333920	338680	story if you like, and it's best if you can read it that way.
338760	341400	Why did I write it?
341400	350360	Like many people here, I feel that we reached a crisis point in which, frankly, we no longer
350360	353480	know who we are.
353480	357040	We haven't the foggiest idea of what we're doing here in this world.
357040	363440	We don't seem to understand any kind of directional meaning in our lives, and if we find anywhere
363440	371000	told that we've just painted them on the walls of our little cell in order to cheer ourselves
371000	379720	up, I can't tell you how profoundly I disagree with that formulation, which seems to be a
379720	384960	pervasive one these days, that of reductive materialism.
384960	385960	And A.N.
385960	391840	Whitehead, who's a philosopher I very greatly admire, said, as we think we live, and I think
391840	397000	there's something wrong with our thinking processes, and that's what I was hoping to
397000	403040	have a little influence over.
403040	408280	You may know that I wrote an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary, and that
408280	415800	concerns the division of the brain into two hemispheres, and this book, the newer book,
415800	418080	also begins from that standpoint.
418080	424440	This is not reductive in any sense, and it has been put to me by one person, only one
424440	428240	person, but he does persistently say it.
428240	434160	He's a philosopher who will remain nameless, I want to spare him his blushes, but he seems
434160	438680	to think that just because I talk about the structure of the brain, I must be reducing
438680	439920	mind to brain.
439920	444440	However, I've now over pretty much 2,000 pages between those two books, made it very
444440	450880	clear that my whole thrust is anti-reductionist.
450880	454220	Why would one be interested in the structure of the brain?
454220	459000	You might well say, I'm really interested in the mind, but I don't really care where
459000	464120	things go on in my brain, it's not relevant.
464120	468120	And I'm sympathetic with that, but I also think there's something very, very important
468120	473720	about the way the brain is structured, and whether the brain gives rise to consciousness
473720	480400	which I can't believe, or it transmits consciousness which it might, or it permits consciousness
480400	485840	which is what I do believe, it will shape the nature of that consciousness.
485840	492280	And it's therefore quite relevant that this organ is divided in two right down the middle.
492280	496360	If you've never seen a brain, it's rather like a walnut, and it has that division down
496360	497680	the middle.
497680	506760	If you have an organ which is said to be a computer, I mean that's an image that I very
506760	512040	much detest, and it's entirely wrong on a whole range of grounds, but if you do think
512040	517320	of it as having computing power, why would you make an enormous division down the middle
517320	523840	of it, since its computing power exists in the number of connections it can make?
523840	526520	Why is the brain asymmetrical?
526520	533400	The world around us isn't asymmetrical exactly, and the skull is pretty much symmetrical.
533400	535240	So what's this about?
535240	540400	Why is the right hemisphere broader at the front and larger altogether, in fact the biggest
540400	546000	asymmetry in the entire brain, is the largeness of the right frontal cortex?
546000	550320	And why something that one did learn about in medical school and never heard about the
550320	552120	right hemisphere?
552120	557000	It's broader towards the back on the left, and this was always said to be because of
557000	562960	the invention of language, which is a very important part of the history of humanity.
562960	571680	But that can't be right, because we know that plenty of the great primates, Bonobos, Gorillas,
571680	578800	chimpanzees have these expansions, but they don't have language.
578800	582560	And I suppose the final thing is these two hemispheres are connected by a band of fibres
582560	589400	at the base of the brain, over which 2% of the neurons in the brain actually cross.
589400	595560	So it's set up for two rather distinct conscious nexuses.
595560	597680	Why is that?
597680	598680	Is it just us?
598680	600520	No, it isn't.
600520	608200	The difference between us, or at least mammals, and other living creatures, is that they don't
608200	609720	even have a corpus callosum.
609720	615480	So the corpus callosum was a mammalian invention, and it's gradually getting smaller in relation
615480	616720	to the size of the brain.
616720	621240	So our brains have expanded, but the corpus callosum remains small, and a lot of its traffic
621240	625440	is saying, I'm dealing with this, you keep out of it.
625440	631480	And that's true as you go down, as we like to think of it, down the evolutionary tree.
631480	636440	So it's true of amphibians, it's true of reptiles, it's true of insects, it's true
636440	644600	of every creature that we know of, including the most ancient creature, still extant.
644600	650320	It's 700 million years old, nematostelovectensis, and it lives off the Isle of Wight, where
650320	656800	it only marginally raises the average age of the inhabitants.
656800	663080	And it already has this asymmetry in its neural network, described by Thomas Holstein, who
663080	668760	discovered it at some Heidelberg, as the origin of the mammalian, and eventually the human
668760	669760	brain.
669760	674560	Well, I think there is an answer to that, and it's quite a simple one, and I've never
674560	680360	heard any explanation that goes near doing as good a job, and nobody's told me I'm wrong.
680360	685840	And it's this, every living creature has to be able to do two incompatible things at once.
685840	691320	They have to enable themselves to survive by eating, and they have to enable themselves
691320	694320	to survive by not being eaten.
694320	700080	And for the first, you need to have highly targeted, precise attention to a detail, for
700080	706440	a bird to pick up that seed accurately and swiftly, for an eagle to be able to catch
706440	707440	that hair.
707440	712520	Whatever it is, you lock onto your target, you know what it is, you go for it.
712520	718560	And that attention is very, very precise, but it's only about three out of the 360 degrees
718560	722640	of the per view that we might have.
722640	727840	Meanwhile, the right hemisphere, sorry, I haven't mentioned yet that the left hemisphere
727840	733840	is the one that does the targeting, the right hemisphere is tasked with doing the whole
733840	738280	of the rest, basically, of seeing the whole picture, looking out for predators, looking
738280	743720	out for corn specifics, looking out for offspring that need feeding and protecting.
743720	749360	And so, this can't be done, actually, it's not just like trying to pat your tummy and
749360	753240	rub your head or whatever it is you're supposed to do, pat your head and rub your tummy as
753240	754240	well.
754240	759200	It's actually impossible unless you have two ways in which you can dispose your consciousness
759200	766480	at once, and that requires two neuronal masses capable of being conscious at all.
766480	771880	So that explains this division, and it's based, as I say, on attention.
771880	777640	And when I realized this, the penny didn't drop immediately, because I had been chained
777640	786320	in a rigorously analytic, cognitive way, and I saw attention as another interesting cognitive
786320	795800	function like memory and language and so on, but no, attention is something very, very special.
795800	798320	It's how we bring the world into being.
798320	803560	Let me just explain a little about that, because it's central to what I'm going to say.
803560	811440	I repudiate either of the two main alternatives that are put up these days in the public arena
811440	814160	as possible ways of understanding the world.
814160	820440	I think most of us detect that it's not quite true that there's just a world out there.
821200	828240	First of all, it might not be out there, and secondly, it's not just out there in that
828240	836800	we are connected to it somehow, and how we experience it changes at least the weak claim
836800	839240	as it changes for us what it is we experience.
839240	840240	That's obvious.
840240	847440	I believe it actually helps to mould what is there in a less personal way, in a more
847440	853920	universal way, eventually, but it also makes us who we are.
853920	858800	If I get in the habit of attending to things that are living as machines, I will see only
858800	865440	their mechanical aspects, and I will see that this works very well, and so it worked last
865440	870920	time, it'll work next time, and soon I can't see any alternative to seeing living things
870920	874080	as mechanism.
874080	881360	I call attention a moral act, by which I mean that we have a responsibility, and that word
881360	886560	responsibility is important because it suggests the coming and the going, the giving of something
886560	892200	and something responding, a reverberative relationship.
892200	899680	I actually also claim in this book, and argue for the position, that relationships are primary,
899800	906200	relationships are prior to the things that are related, the so-called relux.
906200	907760	How can that be, you might say?
907760	912320	How can you have a relation before you've got the things that need to be related?
912320	916960	Well I take the view that actually everything is related, and that it gets its being from
916960	921600	the context of all the other things to which it's primarily very directly related, but
921600	928680	ultimately to the rest, and that therefore you can't tell what that thing is until you've
928680	935000	understood the network of webs of relationships out of which it arises.
935000	942720	In any case, attention is important in this way, and I have this view that it's neither
942720	949360	what I call rot reality out there, and we are just passive receivers of it, nor is it
949360	954640	mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves.
955600	958600	Sorry, those were acronyms in case you're...
958600	964240	It's something very important, an encounter.
964240	970280	So every experience is an encounter, and it's not made up of things, it's made up of encounters
970280	974960	with what are effectively processes, relationships.
974960	984320	For this reason, the way in which we attend to the world matters enormously, and the
984320	992040	title of my latest offering, this enormous book, is the Matter with Things, which is...
992040	996720	We read on several levels, I mean on the first level obviously, I think we probably all agree
996720	1001160	there's something that is the matter with things, and I think that what's the matter
1001160	1007400	is our obsession with matter, partly, and at least if you assume matter is the simple
1007400	1012320	stuff that has nothing to do with consciousness, if you think it has a bit of consciousness
1012320	1018520	about it, then you've already smuggled consciousness in, and we don't have to explain how it somehow
1018520	1021320	mysteriously arises out of matter.
1021320	1027080	But if you think of matter as simple, well you're on to hiding to nothing, because if
1027080	1032840	matter has nothing of consciousness about it, and has no direction, and no knowledge of
1032840	1037480	any of the things that make life worth living for us, how is it that after a few million
1037480	1044000	years this completely blind collision of senseless particles gives rise to Bach's St.
1044000	1045400	Matthew Passion?
1045400	1050720	This is a miracle, if ever there was one, and reductionists always end up having to do
1050720	1053480	it, and here a miracle happens.
1053480	1058080	I don't do that, because I believe, and I may come onto that later, I believe that consciousness
1058080	1063240	is foundational, I think it is what the philosopher's called an ontological primitive, which means
1063240	1071680	it can't be derived from anything else, it is the primary stuff of the cosmos.
1071680	1079760	But if attention changes what we experience, how we relate to it, how we act, how we think,
1079760	1084240	it's pretty important, and if the two halves of the brain have manifested different ways
1084240	1091120	of attending, and there's not a single neurologist, psychiatrist, physician, neuroscientist anywhere
1091120	1095760	in the world who will deny that these two hemispheres have this greatly different way
1095760	1101000	of attending, if that's the case, then it follows that they produce two different kinds
1101000	1106360	of experiential worlds, they'd have to, and I haven't got time to go through all the things
1106360	1113840	that differentiate them, but let me just give a sort of lightning sketch of how they differ.
1113840	1119200	So you can see that if you are paying attention to something that you already know is important
1119200	1124600	for you, and latching onto it, and then later latching onto something else, and then seeing
1124600	1134960	one of those two, it produces a picture of isolated fragments that are already known,
1134960	1142840	familiar, useful, they're decontextualised, they're abstracted because they're an example
1142840	1148200	of a kind, it's another seed, another rabbit, whatever, the differences between Peter Rabbit
1148240	1154720	and his brethren are not available to the left hemisphere, and this picture in the left hemisphere
1154720	1161760	is one which is effectively inanimate, literal, it takes language literally,
1161760	1170320	because it's not very good at reading subtle signs, so body language, facial expression,
1170320	1176120	tone of voice, you don't even need to get into the complexities of metaphor,
1176160	1180200	but already the right hemisphere is much more skilled at this than the left,
1180200	1185160	but the left hemisphere simply takes poetry, metaphors, literally,
1185160	1190040	and then pronounces, as some philosophers have, that they're lies.
1190040	1195880	However the ancient Greeks thought that metaphors were the key to understanding, Aristotle says
1195880	1202680	that this is the key to every kind of thinker, the strength of that thinker or of that artist,
1202720	1209600	is to be able to produce new metaphors that illuminate, and indeed I think it's very well
1209600	1216280	accepted now that all language is metaphorical, in particular scientific language and philosophical
1216280	1221920	language are metaphorical because they're often dealing with abstractions, and we don't have
1221920	1225240	the words for those, we have the words for the things we encounter in daily life.
1225240	1231640	So you've got on the one hand this picture of isolated fragments that have no meaning,
1231640	1239120	purposeful direction until we put them together, that are inanimate, decontextualised, abstracted,
1239120	1248120	and they co-together to form a picture of a lifeless diagram, a theory, a map of the world.
1248120	1253240	Now there's nothing wrong with a map, and there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere, we need it,
1253240	1261440	but it won't give us the full story, just as consulting a map of this area before you've
1261440	1266040	came wouldn't tell you what you see outside the window, what you would experience in this house,
1266040	1272600	that's all left as it were in the realm of the right hemisphere. So what does the right hemisphere
1272600	1279720	see? It sees that nothing is ever certain fixed and fully known, that there is always a degree of
1279720	1285600	possibility that it may be something slightly different, and indeed since it sees unique cases
1285640	1291880	rather than just general categories, it's aware that actually every blade of grass is different.
1291880	1305000	So it sees a picture of these undrasped before, but processually knowable, not known already
1305000	1311200	completely, but something we can come into a knowing of, it sees them as interconnected with
1311200	1318200	other things, constantly flowing, not fixed down so that we can easily grasp, and as I say
1318200	1325760	individual, implicit, and embodied. Now all that implicit and embodied stuff is terribly
1325760	1332840	important, and it's all the kind of things that a computer won't be able to understand until it's
1332840	1337840	got a body, and until blood is flowing through its cheeks, and it knows that it's going to die,
1337880	1345400	and it's suffered, and so on. So the left hemisphere is, I hate the idea that the brain is like a
1345400	1351640	computer as I've already said, but there is something about the left hemisphere that is
1351640	1356560	rather like one's personal computer, in that its level of understanding is very low, very poor,
1356560	1361560	but it's very efficient at carrying out procedures. There's a division of labor really. The right
1361560	1366480	hemisphere is rather like you when you've gathered data, and you want the computer to process it,
1366480	1372760	to shove it into the computer, the computer wears away cleverly for a short while, and produces an
1372760	1377680	answer. The computer doesn't know what the answer means, but you take that back into the real-life
1377680	1383840	world and reinterpret it. So it's this dynamism in which you begin from the right hemisphere,
1383840	1388720	move to the left, and move to the right, and I'm indebted to Jonathan for having christened this
1388720	1393880	and McGill christened maneuver. I don't believe it's a maneuver, but anyways, whatever, and it's
1393880	1398680	best imaged by the idea of learning a piece of music. You're first attracted to it as a whole by
1398680	1404080	the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere sees the whole picture, the left hemisphere sees parts,
1404080	1409040	and analyzes. So then you start to play it, and you realise that you've got to take it apart,
1409040	1415240	you've got to really keep practising that passage of bar 18, and then you sort of understand the
1415240	1419840	theory of this structure of the piece. So you see how it's here that we return to the tonic,
1419840	1425320	and that's all very well. It's important, it's good. But when you go out to play the piece,
1425320	1430080	finally, you must forget all of that. You'll give the most terrible performance. And there's very
1430080	1434880	much in life that is like this. But at the moment, I believe we live in a world in which we take the
1434880	1441440	lived experience. We then turn it into a map, a theory, a diagram, take it apart, leave it bits
1441440	1447200	all over the floor, and then go, well, it doesn't seem to mean anything to me. And this is surely a
1447200	1454160	very bad way to be understanding the vibrant, living, complex, rich, beautiful world around us.
1454160	1462440	So that's the sort of neurology part of it, if you'd like. And I begin the book. It has three
1462440	1472600	parts. In part one, I talk about the neuropsychology. And I begin with looking at the ways in which we
1472640	1478040	could gather some knowledge about the world to gather it, not to process it, but just to begin
1478040	1484920	the process of having anything there. And I take these to be attention, but also perception, which
1484920	1489960	is not the same as attention, judgment, which is formed on the basis of what you've attended to
1489960	1496360	and what you've perceived, emotional and social intelligence, and cognitive intelligence, IQ,
1496360	1504680	in other words, and creativity, because nothing ever comes to us just as a blank. It comes to us
1504680	1510120	as a something. And sometimes we need to be able to revision what that is before it sets. And we
1510120	1515240	can do this very, very rapidly, so that we don't even know what we're doing. But all those faculties,
1515240	1525240	all those portals to the world, as I call them, are more reliably exercised by the right hemisphere
1525240	1532360	than by the left. All of them, including cognitive intelligence, IQ, it's very, very clear. And
1532360	1539480	that might surprise a lot of people. And you may well say, well, that's ridiculous. That can't be it.
1539480	1544360	I mean, how on earth would we get by with a brain that only half of which is really reliable? Well,
1544360	1552440	the answer is that the very important business of getting stuff accumulating power is the job of
1552440	1557400	the left hemisphere. And that it does exceptionally well. So that when you have a stroke in the left
1557400	1564200	hemisphere, the right hand with which you manipulate the world and use tools and operate machines is
1567160	1575080	dysfunctional or nonfunctional, you may lose the power to use language. And one way of looking at
1575080	1579320	language is we didn't need it when we lived in small communities where we understood one another
1579320	1584280	directly and lived together. But we needed it as communities became larger and larger. And instead
1584280	1591320	of having I, thou communication, we had to have I, it communication, and I, they communication.
1592040	1598840	And that is also damaged. But get this, it's much easier to rehabilitate somebody after a left
1598840	1603320	hemisphere stroke, despite all that, than it is after a right hemisphere stroke, because somebody
1603320	1608360	who has a right hemisphere stroke may well not understand the world at all. It's not that they
1608360	1615400	can't manipulate it. They just can't understand it. And people complain that their partner,
1616440	1621960	they have a father who suffered such an injury or stroke is no longer empathic in the way that
1621960	1627000	they used to be, doesn't seem to understand a joke, doesn't seem to understand what's going on around
1627000	1637080	him, doesn't understand the conversation. So that's kind of important. In the second part of the book,
1637640	1644760	I deal with epistemology, which is how do we get from our findings, our data, our information,
1644760	1652360	our percepts, our judgments? How do we get from there to broader conclusions about the world?
1653240	1657880	And how do we build up a picture of the world? And I suggest that there are four of these,
1659320	1666760	science, reason, intuition, and imagination. And in the world in which we live, none of these
1666760	1672200	is quite perceived right. So excessive claims are made for science. And at the same time,
1672200	1676840	science is not scientific enough. If science were properly scientific, it wouldn't be as
1676840	1682200	dogmatic as it is. It wouldn't dismiss things that don't fit the current paradigm, because the whole
1682200	1687240	history of science is of people finding things that don't fit the current paradigm and then revising.
1689160	1693720	And again, we don't respect science enough. So there are now movements that disrespect science
1693720	1698280	or disregard science or refuse to publish science if it doesn't happen to fit with your political
1698280	1708040	view. This sounds remarkably like 1930s Germany. Then there is reason. And reason is very important.
1708040	1713560	And again, I think the world has lost its reason. It's lost its reason of boldness.
1713560	1719320	How rarely do we hear that concept, which seems to be central of the reason of bold,
1719320	1723720	not just the rationalistic. And I'm making a distinction there, which is made in other
1723720	1727480	languages between different types of reason. In German, there's a difference between
1727480	1733320	Vernunft and Verstand. And there's a kind of procedure or logic, which is not
1733960	1739560	unnecessary. It's very important that you ought to be able to synthesize that with the products of
1739560	1745560	a life well lived for kind of experiential wisdom. And that is reason. And then there's intuition,
1745560	1749640	which has had a very bad press lately, because there are lots of psychologists who go around
1750600	1755320	to companies making a lot of money, telling them they must never trust their intuitions,
1755320	1762680	because they're all wrong. And psychologists rather like the feeling of having power over
1762680	1768920	other people and seeing things they don't see. And so there's a kind of a chauvinism about
1769160	1776760	their wish to dispense with intuition. When I say the examples they come up with,
1776760	1780440	which is quite true, our intuition would probably guide us to the wrong answer. There
1780440	1785400	are such things that can be set up, and our delivery is set up by psychologists. They draw on
1785400	1789880	principles that would normally lead us to the right conclusion, but on this occasion just don't
1789880	1795880	happen to it. And I can show you optical illusions, which are so extraordinary, that you can't believe
1795880	1802760	it until it's demonstrated. And yet, I don't know many people who say, well, after seeing that,
1802760	1807800	I'm never going to open my eyes again, because they might mislead me. We need these fantasies.
1807800	1813240	And imagination, I just want to make an important distinction between imagination and fantasy.
1814040	1820280	Fantasy is something that takes us away from where we are. And it sometimes
1820280	1825480	thought that imagination is like this as well. But imagination is not. Imagination
1826360	1834680	is the only way in which we can truly enter into and understand the life, the existence
1834680	1842440	of whatever it is we're contemplating. So it's a completely different thing, imagination.
1842440	1846440	Words from the Coleridge wrote about this very interestingly. I haven't got time to talk about
1846520	1852360	that now, but they did. And they contrasted the sort of dressing up of something in a fancy way
1852360	1860520	in order to make it look different and funny or moving or sentimental. They contrasted that with
1860520	1870200	the sort of deep gaze of attention in which the thing at last is permitted to come to be itself
1870200	1876920	in your presence. In a word of Heidegger's translation of what Heidegger used in German
1876920	1885320	unreason, it presences. And that's slightly different from being present. Being present is
1885320	1889720	very passive. But the idea of presencing is the thing comes into being through the encounter.
1892280	1896840	Now, in the world we're in at the moment, I just think there's an awful lot already that one could
1896840	1903160	say that we're missing here. But what I do, and I just finished the counter through the book,
1903720	1909320	not three years. So we've looked at which hemisphere is more trustworthy. And the answer is
1910280	1916280	in almost every case, the left hemisphere will mislead us, is literally delusional. I'm not
1916280	1921720	using that word in a pop sense. I'm using that in a psychiatric sense. It gives rise to Frank
1921720	1928760	delusions left with self. It's not reliable. So we know that. We know we should be paying
1928760	1935640	attention to what the right hemisphere tells us, even if it's harder to grasp. And we now know that
1935640	1941240	we need to bring at least three out of these four science, reason, intuition and imagination,
1941240	1947320	if not all four to bear on all our problems. But I find that generally we divide into camps
1947320	1953400	who use either the first two or the last two or nothing at all. That's three camps. And then we
1953400	1960680	come on to the last part of the book. And in that I sort of say, well, how do we understand the
1960680	1966280	cosmos and ourselves? How do we understand our position here? What do we think the cosmos is like?
1967080	1971960	And I begin with a couple of chapters about its structure. The first one is on the coincidence
1972040	1978200	of opposites, which is a very, very important point, which has gone out of our culture and with
1978200	1986040	it has gone some massively important insights, wise insights. We think that things are arranged
1986040	1990520	in linear fashion. So on one end of a line, there's something you like. On the other end,
1990520	1994680	there's something you hate. And it's just where you graduate yourself on this position. But this
1994680	2000680	is not true. If you pursue something that you think is good more and more, you will definitely
2000680	2006760	end up with the thing that you were fleeing from. Thus it's famous that anarchy leads to tyranny.
2008120	2014680	And we don't understand this. It was obviously as a child that people on the extreme left of
2014680	2022120	politics were awfully like people on the extreme right of politics. But the answer in calibrating
2022120	2030040	these things is not just to find a midpoint where things go flabby as it were. The secret of making
2030040	2036120	a good apple tart is have sour apples and lots of good honey. And this produces a wonderful apple
2036120	2041880	tart, but just bland apples won't produce any of this. And the image I like to give here is one
2041880	2049880	that is made by my favorite philosopher of all time, Heraclitus, 6th century BC, far more interesting
2049880	2057880	than Plato. They're called pre-Socratic philosophers. I think the so-called Plasonic philosophers
2057880	2063800	should be called post-Heraclitian philosophers, but anyway. In this realm there were a lot of very
2063800	2069480	interesting voices and then we got thrown off track for about 2,000 years. We began to recover it in
2069480	2079240	the 19th century. I'm being brief and flippant. I'm a great admirer of Plato. I studied him in
2079240	2084920	Greek at school. I don't know all of that. But nonetheless, I think that there's a lot about
2084920	2093720	the way in which Plato has been interpreted, his legacy and Aristotle's legacy, that we have had to
2093720	2103320	try and finesse and make more complex and pass on from. The image from Heraclitus is that of the
2103320	2109800	string of a light, the musical instrument, or the string of a bow. And the point he makes is it
2109800	2116520	must be pulled apart in both directions very hard. And you might say, well, that's a waste of energy.
2116520	2122280	Why don't we just let it go slack? And then, of course, the string will not let fly the note.
2122280	2128840	It will not let fly the arrow. So the tension between these opposites held together, but not
2128840	2135960	collapsed into one or the other. But both genuinely held is very important. And some people get around
2135960	2141000	this by collapsing the two. It's just saying they're all one. They're not all one. They're
2141000	2148840	importantly rather different. Or they say they're so different from one another that you can't say
2148840	2155640	that they coincide. I would suggest that both of these positions is wrong. And then I talk about
2155640	2159960	the one and the many. I won't go into that, but that's another whole famous philosophical problem
2159960	2164280	that I think is very interesting about the relation between the general and the unique.
2165080	2171080	And the particular and the eternal. And the insight I just want to pass on briefly is one that I
2171080	2177000	think is best expressed in the work of Goethe, which is that you find the particular, sorry,
2177000	2181880	you find the general and the universal, not by turning your back on the particular, but by
2181880	2188520	going through the particular more deeply. And you find eternity, not by turning your back on the
2188520	2196840	temporal, but by going through the temporal and seeing eternity there in the temporal.
2197640	2202760	That of course is itself a paradox, but I'm no foe of paradox. In part two, I have a whole
2202760	2209800	chapter on logical paradox, which I think explains, I take about 30, one's known to philosophers,
2209800	2215560	and suggest that the reason that these paradoxes arise is that there is a conflict here between
2215560	2220200	the way the left hemisphere sees it and the way the right hemisphere sees it. And guess what?
2220200	2223880	The way the right hemisphere sees it is more in touch with reality.
2225240	2229800	Thank you. I'll give you an example of Achilles and the tortoise. Achilles was famously swift
2229800	2234680	to foot. The tortoise challenged him to a race. Achilles said, no, I don't think so. Come on,
2234680	2240280	you can never catch me. Achilles thinks, well, okay. And being a generous kind of guy gives the
2240280	2246520	tortoise a head start. The tortoise, however, is right. Because first of all, Achilles has
2246520	2250200	got to get where the tortoise now is. But by the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved on to
2250200	2254600	a new place. Now his job is to get to where the tortoise has gone to. But by the time he gets
2254600	2259560	there, the tortoise has moved on. And this is an infinite series, so he can never actually
2259560	2264680	overtake the tortoise. However, we know that he'll overtake the tortoise in two strides.
2264680	2268120	And the problem there, which I can't unpack now because I've got to get to the end of my talk
2268200	2275160	quite quickly, is that effectively the mistake is thinking of a continuum
2275960	2283960	retrospectively as fragmented and analyzed. And then in the rest of the chapters of part three,
2284520	2295960	I deal with the trivia, time, space, matter, consciousness, value, purpose,
2296840	2303240	and the sense of the sacred. And most people are with me when we get time yet, very interesting,
2303240	2310120	yes, space, matter and consciousness are very important. What a hell, why do you put values,
2310120	2314920	purpose and the sense of the sacred in there? And I believe these are things that are absolutely
2314920	2321800	essential to our understanding of the universe of the cosmos and of life. And they've been dismissed
2321800	2328920	from discourse by science not out of malice, but out of a very good principle.
2329640	2333880	It decided that the way it wanted to investigate things was what it calls objective,
2333880	2338200	and in that it didn't want to introduce values, it didn't want to introduce any kind of purpose,
2338200	2344600	it just wanted to see what was there. And then it reports back solemnly after its investigation,
2344920	2352120	it couldn't find any values, couldn't find any purpose. But to borrow an image from C.S.
2352120	2356840	Lewis, this is like a policeman who stops all the traffic in the street and then solemnly notes
2356840	2364520	in his notebook, the silence in this street is very suspicious. Science has not proved that
2364520	2369640	light is meaningless, that there is no purpose, that there are no values, it's not its job to do
2369640	2375160	that, and we need to see that and it needs to see that. But I believe that all consciousness,
2375160	2379720	and let me say it briefly, I think the consciousness matter relate like this. I believe
2379720	2383720	that consciousness is the primary substance of the universe, if you like. Although substance is
2383720	2388840	exactly the wrong word because nothing needs to be under it, it is the stuff, if you like,
2388840	2393720	of the cosmos. But again, it's not stuff, our language, stuff says when we try to talk about
2393800	2402600	this matter. So consciousness is that elementary stuff, and consciousness is always directed
2402600	2408760	towards something else. We are seeing something, we are taking it, being aware of something,
2408760	2416040	we're examining something, we're just contemplating something, but that is directional and it's guided
2416040	2425080	by value, and it's guided by purpose, and these things are throughout in the living world, and
2425080	2431480	I would say having read Jude Caravan's latest book, which is very interesting, that in the
2431480	2438200	cheese, a lot of the book is about the preanimate world, that there is evidence of clear purpose
2438200	2445320	and value in terms of beauty already present in this cosmos. I think what life does is not just
2445400	2451080	bring consciousness, because as I say consciousness I think is everywhere, but it brings two things.
2451640	2458760	It speeds up the process of responsiveness and intensifies it and broadens it. So
2460200	2465800	unlike the Roth in my garden, I can appreciate more of what there is in the cosmos, that's
2465800	2475160	life given to me, and what that life means is something that I can come to understand very
2475160	2480760	much faster than any of the processes that would have existed pre-life. There are animate processes
2480760	2485720	that can happen a thousandth of a second, that if they were in an inanimate context would take
2485720	2493000	billions of years. So what is matter? Well I think matter is a phase of consciousness. I think that
2493000	2499720	consciousness exhibits matter to us, that's indisputable, we wouldn't know matter if we
2499720	2505560	didn't have consciousness. However it's not true that we wouldn't know consciousness if we weren't
2505560	2511960	material, we don't know that. A lot of scientists assume the brain somehow nobody has ever got
2511960	2520360	even with a whisker of explaining how it could possibly happen, but if matter were to give rise
2520360	2527800	to consciousness it's a matter of dispute, and I for one reject it, but we can't deny that matter
2528040	2533800	is something that's in our experience, and I say why is matter there? I think it does
2534920	2541400	one main thing that can be seen in two ways, it allows things to persist for a while,
2542840	2548520	always only for a while, and it also offers some resistance, and I believe that creation,
2548520	2555640	creativity depends on resistance, in the face of resistance it can't happen, and resistance is
2555640	2561720	paradoxical like everything else. What is friction? Friction is what stops motion,
2561720	2566360	that's what a physicist will tell you, but it's also what starts motion. I'm not able to move
2566360	2573720	at all without friction, so things have dual roles and this resistance is highly creative,
2573720	2580280	as has been seen by many of my favorite philosophers including Whitehead and others.
2580280	2586840	So where am I going with this? I could talk to you about the sense of the sacred, I included a
2586840	2593080	chapter on that, and many of my philosophical friends who'd read the draft said don't include it,
2595000	2598920	you've got some really important philosophical things to say here, but nobody will take you
2598920	2604920	seriously if you talk about the sacred, and they'll go oh he's a faith head, and so I almost,
2605880	2611720	for a nanosecond, wavered, but I realized that I couldn't not write it, even though it was the most
2611720	2619000	difficult thing I've ever written in my life. It cost me more blood, sweat, and tears than anything
2619000	2626440	else I've done, because I wanted to be honorable to what was there, I wanted to be truthful to it,
2626440	2638200	I wanted to be faithful to it, and neither oversell something or understated, and of course I believe
2638200	2644360	that all that realm of the sacred and divine is not, is not expressible in ordinary language,
2644360	2650440	and is not grasped by our common concepts, it is itself beyond such things, but that doesn't mean
2650440	2656680	it's unreal, I mean it's just an elementary logical mistake to say well we can't talk about it,
2657640	2663800	we can't conceive it, then it can't exist, but it can, and we can't measure it in the lab,
2664440	2669640	I know that, but we can't measure love in the lab, I can't demonstrate love to somebody who's never
2669640	2676120	experienced it, and the sacred is like that, you can't get it from, it's like trying to learn
2676120	2679880	how to swim by sitting on the bank of the river reading a book, you actually have to get into
2679880	2685880	the stream, but if you do you will find that something responds to you, I swear that it will,
2686600	2691720	it may not be what you expect, but there will be this responsive encounter, and it's that that we
2691720	2699640	are made for, and I believe that it's that, the business of seeing, experiencing, reflecting,
2699640	2706200	doing our best to magnify in the world what is beautiful, good, and true, that is the reason
2706200	2713800	we're here at all, so we have an important, if you like, role, and we started rather late, so I'm
2713800	2721640	just gonna, I'll wind up in five minutes, and you've probably heard of Pascal's wager, yeah,
2722600	2726440	and Pascal's wager for those of you who don't know it was, the maybe a god or the may not,
2727240	2734520	if there is a god and you decide to deny him, you made a big mistake, but if there isn't a god
2734520	2739960	and you think there is, well no harm will come of it, it's always seemed to me not really to cover
2739960	2746920	the basis and to be a little bit venal in its, in its motivation, but there's something called
2746920	2753000	the Galperist wager which goes like this, either there is a god, in which case, yep, we'd better
2753000	2759640	get to know that god, or there isn't a god, in which case no harm is done, ala Pascal, but
2760600	2767640	there is this possibility that whatever the divine and the sacred is, it is exploring itself,
2767640	2775160	it is coming to know itself in its creation, one might ask why did this logos, this
2775800	2785400	ble, this ultra, this ala, this god, why did it bother with the creation, and the answer in most
2785400	2790440	religions is that god is love, and love is relational, coming back to my idea that everything,
2790440	2797160	everything is actually relational, and relations are two way relations, so you have to have a
2797160	2805880	cosmos in which something can come that can appreciate that divine ground, and it's exploring
2805880	2814840	that, unfolding the beauty of it, that is the purpose of the creation, and here at the very last
2814840	2820200	minute I come to the question of division and union, which I would love to give a whole hour's
2820200	2826840	tour of them, because it's very, very important, but let me be very brief. Goethe, again another
2826840	2835320	person I very greatly admire, said, dividing the united, uniting the divided, this is the business
2835320	2841960	of nature, and it is like he says, the sisterly and diastole, which are the two beats of the heart,
2841960	2849560	it is like the inhalation and the exhalation, and he also suggests, or hints that it's like the
2849560	2857480	warp and weft of a fabric, into which our being is woven, he said. Now I think that is extraordinarily
2857480	2863240	important, and perhaps I'd just leave it there and we can explore it a bit, but in my view,
2863240	2868760	everything depends on seeing this importance of having division and union, but of having them
2868760	2876200	unified, not divided. This is an example of the meta position that I held on many things,
2876200	2881640	for example, I think it's great that we have both and, but we also sometimes need either all,
2881640	2890360	but we don't need either both and, or either or, we need both, both and, and, and I, of course my
2890360	2894520	whole works about symmetry and asymmetry, which I think goes much further than the brain, goes into
2894520	2899640	the substance of life, and I believe there that we need not just symmetry or asymmetry,
2899640	2906520	but we need the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry. That really is a lot of work,
2906520	2918280	and it's all there in the postage of one of fire.
2925240	2931880	I'll give you a chance to take a rest in for a second or two. Yep. Quite a tour de force,
2933240	2938600	and I'm keen because of time to really involve the audience quite quickly, so I'm going to just
2938600	2946360	have one question on the sacred, and it relates to an experience I had with you
2946360	2952840	on the out of sky. A little minor tragedy is that before the book came out, I traveled up to
2952840	2957880	the sky to film a day, a day long interview with Ian about every aspect of the book,
2959080	2962360	which was recorded, of course, but for a range of reasons that won't go into,
2962360	2966760	we could never retrieve the recording, but there was a moment towards the end of that,
2966760	2972120	that time that I particularly wished we'd, we'd got on camera, and it was a moment where Ian
2972120	2978040	started welling up with, with tears, and it was speaking about Christian mythology
2979000	2984760	and how beautiful you found it, and one question I have for you here is, it's,
2985800	2992280	to speak of the sacred, might be threatening to scientific peers in a scientific context,
2992280	2999080	and it might be risky, risky because you're invoking quality of life that's, well, you can
2999080	3001320	tell me in a minute whether you think it's supernatural or not, or whether that's the
3001320	3007960	right expression, but it's invoking something entirely natural, but outside of our normal
3008040	3016040	sort of capacity to empirically perceive things that would be a more sort of orthodox
3016920	3023000	way of looking at things, but in that moment, you know, I felt you emotionally were,
3023000	3028360	you know, very deeply invested in this, and I've also noticed in some of the reviews,
3028360	3032920	perhaps by Rowan Williams, perhaps by a few others, they wonder if you're sort of pulling
3032920	3039640	your punches a bit, that actually, far from not including this in the book, you culminate in the
3039640	3049640	sacred, and yet, even in the sacred chapter, it's quite cautious and quite tempered, and we just,
3049640	3053640	I just wonder what stops you from saying what you just said towards the end there,
3053640	3059000	something in, of the order that like, God exists, it's very important we come to know
3059000	3063720	God, and our life should be directed in that, in that sense. What's, what's pulling you back from
3063720	3070760	that? Yeah, I, I, I consistently, as you say, pull my punches for a good reason, and actually,
3070760	3077480	at the end, I don't say, and I say that although I'm very suspicious of a lot of God talk, and
3077480	3082680	although the very word God produces all kinds of complications that need to be dispensed with,
3083000	3091720	but I think we're too quick to say we can bypass this or dismiss it, and that I think it's our job
3092440	3098920	to try harder to understand what this ancient truth that people have always believed is about.
3098920	3105880	Why do we think we're wiser than they were? And I do actually say that nothing I have experienced
3105880	3113560	is in a sense more certain to me that there is some meaning to this idea. And that's expressed in
3113560	3119960	that way carefully, because as Jesus said, we should be as wise as serpents, but as gentle as
3119960	3127880	dubs. And part of my job was not to draw people to Christianity, I think I'm a rather bad Christian,
3127880	3133480	and I'm not a committed Christian, and I don't go to church. On the other hand, I cannot think of a
3133480	3140680	more wonderful mythos, and I use that word without any implication that is false. The mythoi by which
3140680	3146360	we live are the most important kinds of truth, and if you think you don't have one, you've probably
3146360	3151240	bought into the one of our age, which is that everything is a machine. That's a myth as well.
3152200	3162200	And I think it's such a powerful myth about a God who is involved in the creation in such a way
3162200	3168600	that he actually also experiences suffering, although there's a complex concept in theology,
3168600	3172760	by the way, because he may be so-called impassable, but I don't want to go into all the details.
3172760	3185560	But the beauty of this idea, and the extraordinaryness of the art, and the music, and the poetry,
3185560	3192840	the architecture, the words of the liturgy, the words of the King James Byron, I think these are,
3194360	3199880	they speak to me directly, and I came from a family that were neither very well educated nor at all
3199880	3207640	religious, and I sort of first encountered all this in my early teens, and I just thought whatever
3207640	3213400	it is that I've been taught to believe about the world is not right. I need to commit myself
3213480	3217240	to understanding this, and I thought that I would probably actually become a monk after I'd
3218680	3224600	gone to Oxford and graduated, but by then I saw sense and realized I'd be a very bad monk,
3224600	3229160	and would also make a very bad monastery. So there we are.
3230360	3234920	Just a little follow-up. We heard from Linda this morning about fortune telling,
3235800	3240600	and in my group afterwards we spoke about astrology, and there's a sort of
3244120	3249160	book you may know by Jeffrey Kreipo called The Flip, which is premised partly on seeing
3249160	3253960	consciousness as primary, but not just that. There's also a lot of parapsychological data in it,
3254520	3258920	and he's arguing that really there's a moment at which suddenly the world looks very, very different.
3259560	3265320	Now my impression, knowing you for many years, you care very deeply about your scientific
3266120	3271080	authority and respectability, and for good reason, but I also wonder if, you know,
3272040	3278600	to what extent can we go there as it were? To what extent is it legitimate to wonder if the
3278600	3283640	eaching might actually speak to you, or the tarot cards might actually have something to say about
3283640	3289800	your psyche that's meaningful? Is this beyond the pale, or is this...? Well, not to me.
3291560	3298440	I'm far from being able to say that I know or experience or have in my world picture the whole
3298520	3308040	story. I haven't, none of us has, and it's the hubris of modern humanity that seems to me it's
3308040	3316040	worst trait, and what we need is a massive dose of humility which may come, alas, with societal
3316040	3325320	collapse, but we certainly need to re-embrace modesty, war, and compassion rather than anger,
3326200	3335480	division, power struggles, and all of that. There are a couple of things really, and
3337000	3341720	one of the things I forgot to say, and I just want to say this about why I didn't bang on about
3341720	3346760	Christianity is that as I say I'm not necessarily sure I'm a Christian, but I also didn't want to
3346760	3351080	be exclusive. I didn't want people to get there and go, oh God, he's a Christian, so now we've got
3351080	3357400	one of all that, but I wanted to draw on religions worldwide, and I found that they had enormous
3357400	3362200	wisdom and that these wisdoms cohered, and what's more they cohered? With the position I'd been
3362200	3372840	arguing for through neuro psychology, philosophy, and, um, slightly physics. I have a band of what
3372840	3376440	I call tamed physicists, and when I want to say something in physics I, there are people who
3376440	3381960	approached me and said, far more than biologists, this book is terribly interesting to us as physicists,
3381960	3385800	I know that's good, so then I tend to, is this okay to say, and they go very up, probably.
3387800	3396920	So why am I saying that? I just don't want people to think that anybody should be excluded from this,
3396920	3402200	even though to a very, very tentative, and I often think that the honest agnostic is the closest
3402280	3404920	to somebody who's really honestly searching for God.
3407560	3408840	Sorry, where were we before that?
3408840	3411080	Well, just that, um, I think,
3413240	3419480	yes, um, well it depends what you define as natural and supernatural, and I think that
3419480	3424680	lots of the stuff that we've now sequestered in the cupboard mark supernatural is not at all unnatural,
3424680	3429960	it depends how you look at things, if you happen to notice certain things and things,
3430040	3434760	events in life or reading something can make you open your eyes to it, you start to see it,
3435480	3439240	and that doesn't necessarily mean that it's real, I think we should be skeptical,
3439800	3443240	I think that scientists are not skeptical enough about their own findings,
3443800	3448840	and I think we should be skeptical as thinkers, as philosophers, as scientists,
3448840	3452600	but I also think we need in the end to be skeptical about skepticism,
3452600	3456600	in the sense that you can take it too far so that you're paralyzed and don't really know
3456600	3460840	that you can believe anything, that would be a mistake, but you see, it's not,
3462200	3467560	what one believes is not something one worked out in a seminar room, it's not just the
3467560	3473320	culmination of a series of propositions, the root of the word belief is from love,
3473320	3481240	it's liven, you know, and the old English word leaf, dear, and um, what we believe
3481800	3488680	is very importantly what we are attracted to is right, what we have faith, faith is uncertain,
3489800	3495480	faith is incompatible with certainty, and faith is more valuable than certainty, certainty means
3495480	3501080	you're certainly wrong, it's one of the only certainties we can have, and so it's very important
3501080	3506200	to maintain this idea, I mean I want to say this whatever, because I think it's so important,
3506200	3511640	a reconceptualization of truth, truth is not something out there, a distant goal that we
3511640	3519160	can work our way towards, truth is something we can encounter in this world, and it's not a thing,
3519960	3526760	it's a process, it's a journey, and it's about not something being definite, but of a continual
3526760	3532840	unconcealing, so we are unconcealing the truth, we are sweeping away misconceptions as we find
3532840	3539960	our way to it, as we find our way to God, whatever you mean by that word, and this idea of truth
3539960	3545720	is very important, because truth is at the basis of fidelity, when we talk about truth,
3545720	3551960	and Calvin just talked about two surfaces that are true, indeed they say they marry, and truth
3552600	3559560	is what happens when warring factions stop fighting with one another, and come to what
3559560	3567400	we call a truce, a truce is derived from the word true, and truth is something that we uncover
3567400	3572280	in the business of living, so it's a very different thing from what goes on in the seminar room
3572280	3578280	usually, but if the seminar room takes into account pre-socratic philosophers,
3578280	3581160	modern phenomenological philosophers, it may get close.
3583480	3588120	Okay, thank you, so questions now from the audience, if you can put your hands up, I think
3588120	3593000	I'm going to have to do this roving for the recording sake, so the mic is there to be recorded,
3594200	3597160	I think if you want to ask a question, but you don't want to be recorded, let me know,
3597160	3602200	but I'll assume you do, so I'm going to bring the mic to you, and I'll begin,
3603400	3611960	yes, does anyone else want to play the roving role? Nick are you sure? Okay, so then we'll take
3611960	3616360	these two at the front, if we can take a few together, it helps, not too many because it can
3616920	3620280	become overwhelming, but maybe two at a time, and we'll see how it goes.
3621400	3626920	Thank you Ian, I think we all want to thank you for persevering with the million words.
3630680	3636520	You live on sky, I live in a tiny house on wheels in the Derbyshire Dales,
3636520	3640360	and I'm very careful what goes in, and your book is in, so thank you.
3640360	3649720	Thank you. You say consciousness is primary, for you is consciousness mental or material,
3650440	3660600	or neither of the above? Okay, is that one? Thank you Ian, I'm looking at the two lights behind
3660600	3665720	you which are on all the time, and it made me think about the right hemisphere and the left
3665720	3671960	hemisphere, do they flicker one on then the other, one on the other, or are they both
3671960	3676440	on at the same time, or do they fade in and out, do you have a sense of that? We take those two
3676440	3684440	together. I'll deal with that question first, and based on our hemispheres are operating all the
3684440	3698680	time. Which one is guiding our attention is more a matter of a divided role, and so effectively we
3698680	3703800	don't need to be thinking and shouldn't be thinking that we are just using our left hemisphere or right.
3703800	3708760	What I'm talking about there is a short hand, I believe that in this world when we enter into
3708760	3713400	discourse we don't like contradictions, if you contradict yourself that's almost worse than
3713400	3718920	talking nonsense, anyone will listen to nonsense as long as it's coherent with itself, but actually
3718920	3723880	truths are often very very complicated and require different things that we go, well that
3723880	3727800	doesn't add up, I mean the left hemisphere is very quick to dismiss anything that seems
3727800	3732440	contradictory or paradoxical. The second question, or the first question actually,
3733000	3738680	and is very good, but I think that what you've done there is reinforce a division that I don't
3738680	3744680	think is correct between the mental and the physical. So consciousness is the ground of
3744680	3750600	both mental and physical life, and the physical life is the material expression of consciousness
3751160	3760200	which we also have in an immaterial way. So consciousness, let me give you this image,
3760760	3767400	and what is water? Well you think you know what water is, it's that translucent stuff that flows,
3767400	3774200	but it's also that very hard opaque white stuff that's extremely cold and can crack your head open,
3774200	3778840	and it's also in this room, I mean this upper part of this room is filled with water,
3778840	3784280	but we're alive and we don't see it. So there are different ways in which consciousness can be
3784280	3789800	manifest, and if you like a congealed form of consciousness is more of a matter. I want to
3789800	3795720	get to the position where I don't collapse the division between my mind and the consciousness of
3795720	3803400	the rest of the universal garden law with you, but we don't collapse the two, but we don't entirely
3803400	3809240	divide the mind. We live in a country in which we think division means separation, but it doesn't,
3809960	3814520	it doesn't mean actually having to separate. It's being able to see the difference, and the best
3814520	3818920	example of this is in a bar magnet, where there's another north pole and the south pole, they're
3818920	3823240	completely connected to one another, but they never separate. In fact night and night can possibly
3823240	3828920	exist without the other, it isn't a hard division where they cease. Okay, thank you. Wow, more
3828920	3838600	hands. Okay, Isabella and Milky, just opposite. Yeah, thank you again for this great talk. I moved
3838600	3847720	again to hear your story, and I'm most interested right now to hear whether you had an experience
3847800	3856120	that brought you to the place you are right now in terms of your feeling of the sacred,
3856120	3863160	or was it purely through studying? So from my experience, reading you and poetry has brought
3863160	3870840	me as close to a religious experience as I've ever had, and that sounds too much, but it is true,
3870840	3876040	and I'm wondering whether it's for you becoming a scientist and doing the work and thinking
3876040	3882680	concessually and feeling something that you didn't get from that that brought you to digging
3882680	3887080	deeper and then having an experience or the other way around. Okay, thank you, and take Milky's
3887080	3891880	question as well, please, just there, Nick. I believe you kind of touched on it with your
3891880	3899320	conversation with Jonathan, but you mentioned four elements, science, rationality, imagination,
3899320	3902920	science reason, reason, reason, yeah, and I forgot the other one. Imagination, intuition,
3903640	3910200	but there is, I think there is a missing, at least it appeals to me, memory, memory,
3910200	3917560	remembrance, footprints of people who have been, you touched on it at the end, I think, in your
3917560	3922840	conversation, and another thing I wanted to add was if you give an advice to a technologist,
3922840	3927880	someone working in the tech sector, what would that be? Okay, I'll just speak that one in the end.
3927880	3933560	How do you save the world from AI quickly? So Isabella's question, where did the sense come
3933560	3937960	from, from ratiosination and study, or from some kind of revelation or experience?
3940600	3945880	It's never come from revelation, and oddly, I didn't think I've had any revelations in
3946920	3951720	I mean, other than suddenly, wow, when I experience a work of art and something like that, I don't
3951720	3956360	know whether that counts, or just a very beautiful scene. I've been saying, oh wow, all my life,
3956440	3961480	are these really revelations? Not in the kind of way that I think you're suggesting. So it's
3961480	3967000	been an equation of experience that has been cohesive since I was a teenager. I mean, I
3967000	3971160	remember as a teenager having a very strong view that the whole was not the same as the
3971160	3975640	sum of the parts, and I couldn't explain it, and people would say, so what's this mysterious
3975640	3980120	something else that gets put in when you put the parts together? And of course, I didn't know how
3980200	3986280	to answer that, I wouldn't know now, but so he was continuous as a piece of life.
3986840	3997640	The question that you asked, Milti, yes, memory. You see, the way I think of that is that he's
3997640	4005080	a sort of subset of all the things I've mentioned. So science needs to remember to amass, and to
4005080	4012360	bear in mind past experience. Reason is based, in my view, not just on logical working of things
4012360	4018520	out, but being able to make the right analogies to see the correct context, all of which comes from
4018520	4024040	experience, and one way of talking about experience is memory. And I would say the same thing about
4024040	4029880	intuition and imagination that they're fed into by memory. But thank you for drawing my attention
4029880	4035400	to it, because I think memory is a very interesting topic. And I'm thinking hard about
4035400	4041640	actually what I think about memory now, because we're beginning to think that living organisms
4041640	4049800	must respond to imprints that we can't find in DNA, and they may be in fields that bear such
4049800	4055560	memories. This has been considered rather wacky in the past. I hope Rupert Sheldrake will live
4055560	4060280	long enough, dear man, to see himself indicated, as I'm sure he will be.
4060920	4066520	Thank you. And just a follow up on Isabella's question, because it was such a profound one.
4069080	4073000	You did say that you're not enduring the talk. I thought I heard you say words to the effect
4073720	4077240	that if you there was something along the lines of if you listen, if you attend,
4077800	4081960	you will feel a response. It wasn't it wasn't quite if you listen for God, you'll hear,
4081960	4086760	but it was a little bit like that. And so I just wondered to push back slightly on what you said
4086760	4091000	about the accretion, because that makes it sound still quite safe. There is a sense in which you're
4091000	4100840	experiencing a relationship in your life, is there not? Many relationships with the divine,
4100840	4109000	if one can say that, I believe, with nature, with people. And I sometimes think, you know,
4109080	4116040	you mentioned, if you listen, you'll hear God speak. I do listen, and God doesn't speak. And
4117800	4127640	I sometimes said, look, it wouldn't hurt you just once. They something. Does human family
4127640	4133320	you are there in communication with me? And then I made it, I think, and maybe that is God speaking
4134120	4139480	but I spoke to you this morning when you looked out of the landscape. I spoke to you this morning
4139480	4145560	when you got a phone call from your door. I speak to you all the time. What's the problem? Okay,
4145560	4151240	wonderful. Thank you. More questions. Darius and Zordek, just one over this corner here,
4151240	4154520	because then we'll get the cluster. You can see a cluster emerging. We're coming to you.
4154520	4160920	We'll take Darius and then we'll move to the cluster. Thank you. So you've been using two
4160920	4166040	sets of terms. One is ground of being, and then you've also talked about God. So
4166840	4174280	is that a distinction that is clear to you? I mean, God is generally like a personification,
4174280	4180600	some entity with a personality, while ground of being connects to other traditions like Taoism,
4180600	4188520	which do not personify the ground of being. It's a profound mystery. And once we personify it,
4188520	4192200	we're actually over defining it and making too many assumptions about it.
4199560	4202680	I think we'll take this. No, you're not such a big one, I think. Basically, we just asked,
4202680	4207880	is God a person if I understood it correctly? I think so, because it's too big to get with
4207880	4215880	another question. A very good one. Of course, what I mean by the ground of being is that which,
4215960	4223480	in a way, doesn't kickstart being in a temporal sense. It's not the cause in the sequence,
4223480	4231400	but that underwrites all being. So it is there as the ground of being. And
4233560	4238760	this is where I want to mention the Trinity, a Christian concept, although I discovered that
4238760	4245400	it's actually a very ancient concept that was in many pre-Christian belief systems.
4246200	4250280	But at school, this always seemed to be manifest absurd, and I always felt
4250920	4255560	a squirm factor when the Trinity was mentioned. I mean, what is this about the man, the boy,
4255560	4264120	and the bird? It doesn't make any sense to me. As I matured in my thinking, I realized it's
4264120	4271960	extremely important as an expression of what I was much more able to accept, which is Panentism.
4272920	4275720	Just to gloss out for people who are not familiar with the term,
4275720	4279560	Panentism is the belief that God is just the sum of everything. I don't believe that.
4279560	4286280	But Panentism is the belief that God is in everything, and that everything is in God,
4286280	4292600	has its being in God. So that God is never separate from anything in the cosmos. And
4294680	4300520	the way in which that manages to work for me is that it manages to bridge
4302120	4310040	the debate about whether God is... What's the word? I certainly lost the word.
4312280	4315800	Female? Female? I'm just kidding. That wasn't the word.
4317320	4321240	No, whether God is... I hate this.
4323080	4328760	With transcendent, whether God is transcendental or imminent.
4329480	4336120	And I believe that it's important to be able to hold both of these things without
4336120	4343160	collapsing into one or the other. And in that sense, God is both the sort of ground of being
4343880	4350200	and the process of this cosmos. I said that it was in, or he, or however you like to put it.
4350200	4355800	I mean, it's unsatisfactory. She is also unsatisfactory. I just stick with he because it's
4355800	4364600	conventional. And he or whatever is that other is also in the process of creation
4365240	4375400	and is present in within us right now. And it was made clear to me by a simple Franciscan monk
4375400	4380840	in my teens who said, well, think of it like a book. Where is the book? Is it in the mind of the
4380840	4386840	writer? Or is it in this book on the table here? Or is it what happens when you read the book?
4387400	4392360	And those are the three things. And it's also in Rumi. I like to be able to bridge these things.
4392360	4399480	Rumi says it is the water source. It is the water that flows to the cup. And it is the water that
4399480	4404920	is drunk. Thank you. I can just check with the audience. I'm conscious of time and energy.
4404920	4408600	And so at the beginning of the end, there's a cluster of questions here that we will take.
4409160	4417960	But I'm just conscious that we're talking about God. And there was a time when I first met Ian,
4417960	4423560	maybe a decade or so ago, where that would have created quite a strong degree of discomfort.
4423560	4429160	And I'm just wondering if anyone cares to put their hand up. If you feel that talking about God
4429160	4435480	is somehow discomforting, uncomfortable. Okay, thank you. Anyone else? Yep. Any more? Don't be
4435560	4440520	shy. I'm sure you have lots of allies. Right. Because some people might, yeah, this is sort of
4440520	4445240	tacit coercion, sometimes baked into the conversation. Just good to know you're, you know,
4446040	4450680	that's not surprising. And many would feel it. Other questions now, the cluster.
4451320	4457400	Can I just comment on that? It's exactly avoidance of coercion that led me into the position you
4457480	4460200	put me with first, because you don't seem to come out.
4462680	4466520	I don't want any, I didn't want any of my readers to feel he's got design.
4467160	4473080	But I don't, and I'm constantly, you know, going, it doesn't have to, nobody has that view.
4473080	4478040	I do appreciate that's the intent. I'm also wondering, though, whether it's felt so palpably
4478040	4484280	that the intent is somehow less important than the experience that this is in the room, as it were.
4485000	4489480	And so, okay, we have a cluster here. Let's take it. Yes, the hands have been up for a long time.
4490680	4499080	Thank you, Ian. I wanted to follow up and dive a bit deeper into what you mentioned about friction,
4499080	4504360	as not only that, which creates resistance and conflict, but that which propels it sort of
4505000	4512360	the heart, at the heart of the fabric of drama and expression in the cosmos. And particularly in
4513080	4518200	within your work, how you see deception as an essential part of this friction.
4519880	4525560	I want to differentiate it in two ways, perhaps the left brain side of deception being that which
4525560	4532920	is asserting a particular story to enable a certain way of being to sort of self-justify itself,
4533560	4539560	and the perhaps more right side, right side of deception, which would be
4540520	4546040	that which you find in the greatest forms of art, whether it's poetry or comedy or even science,
4546040	4552840	where it's a form of deception that unearths its own limitation, speaking to its own limits of
4552840	4558680	language, or it's something that unravels into further creativity. And I'll be curious how deception
4558680	4562360	ties into your work. Okay, Ian, thank you. We'll take a few more questions if you don't mind
4563000	4566680	hold the question about deception. One bridge was just in front of there, Nick, and thank you.
4566920	4577000	Thank you, Ian, for your very important ideas. My thoughts are in Alice in Wonderland and Moby
4577000	4584840	Ticks, some very important ideas were hidden and passed on to a public that might not go very deep
4584840	4593080	initially. In the age of shortened attention span, which we have now, how would you feel and have
4593080	4603320	you thought about if your ideas were packaged in, say, a Netflix show or something that would
4603320	4609240	make it more accessible? And for what age group would you feel it would be most appropriate and
4609240	4615000	effective? Okay, thank you. So let's take those two then deception and then genres.
4615480	4618680	The first thing I'd have to say about perception is to go back to the neuroscience.
4621720	4626360	It was deception, right? If I heard correctly, not perception, but yeah, no deception.
4627800	4632920	And the different kinds of deception that there was might be a kind of creative deception in the
4632920	4637720	right hemisphere, as I understood it, whereas the left hemisphere's deception is invariably
4637800	4646840	maladaptive in some way. If I've done justice to the question. To understand if I can relate to
4646840	4665000	right hemisphere deception. Well, yeah. The trouble is that I think that, as even Mike
4665000	4674120	Gazzaliga, who's the biggest mechanist in the world, believes the left hemisphere is not really
4674120	4682920	interested in truth. And so it does project the most massive lies. And it's also vastly
4682920	4690840	overconfident that it's right. So it is the home of mistakes and deception. I'm trying to think
4690840	4696440	how the right hemisphere would deceive us, except in as much as it would not contain what it is the
4696440	4702360	left hemisphere can say or would say. So the left hemisphere is different from the right hemisphere
4702360	4706600	in its relation with the other hemisphere. So the left hemisphere is exclusive of the right
4706600	4712200	hemisphere, but the right hemisphere is inclusive of what the left hemisphere knows. And actually,
4712200	4716520	in the image of the master and his emissary, the title of my earlier book, it's the master that
4716520	4720920	actually instructs the emissary to go and do this work, expects the emissary to report back,
4720920	4730600	but the emissary goes off on a thing that it's the master. Okay. Yeah, I would just feel that
4730600	4735080	there's so much more to come. I don't know how to present. Yeah, it's it's it will hold the question
4735080	4740680	in the air. And but the subsequent question about genre, I mean, you have had almost like I see a
4740680	4745160	sort of, you know, many different kinds of, I was about to say Russian doll, if I'm honest,
4745160	4749480	then I suddenly felt that sort of political weight of that. But I was thinking that the
4749480	4756040	number of different kinds you've had, you know, RSE animate that there weren't seeming any millions,
4756040	4761960	there's been a kind of documentary, there's been yeah, all that. And I have Jonathan very
4761960	4768600	much to thank for this, because he said after I'd given this talk, we have somebody who will turn
4768600	4773640	it into a cartoon. And I said, Oh, God, no, that's the absolute worst thing they can have, because
4773640	4778760	this stuff is already, you know, in most people's mind, the pop idea of the two hemispheres is
4778760	4783880	ridiculously caricature. I don't want that. And then after a while, he said, No, I've talked to
4783880	4789320	the guy and he's read your book, and he really understands it. Okay. And then on the day the
4789320	4794120	thing came out, the actual talk, it's about 11 months after the talk had gone up, my talk had
4794120	4801400	12,000 views. That afternoon, the animate had 46,000 views. And so I'm completely converted to this.
4801800	4807880	And I'm delighted to report, I don't know if you've known this, actually. You do, yes. The guy who
4807880	4813080	did it contacted me and said that he wanted to come and interview me for the purposes of making
4813080	4819720	some more. And he came and interviewed me for three or four hours. And he's going to make, he says,
4820760	4827320	five or six very short animus. And that will, that will be a very helpful move, I think. I don't
4827320	4831880	think it's that people have become incapable of this kind of attention, but they, you're quite
4831880	4836440	right that they need some kind of weigh in. They need a lure. Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. We
4836440	4843560	have a few more questions. So Nick, yeah, a lot. Yeah, thank you at the back. We've noticed you
4843560	4846360	at the site. I've noticed the two wings here. We have Dominic. I know Dominic, you've been trying
4846360	4852440	for a while, I get it. And we have, take one at the back first. Quick question. You, you're a very
4852520	4858120	observation. You're a very convinced monotheist. Whereas very convinced monotheist.
4858120	4864680	No, isn't it? Monotheist. Whereas most religious people entertain the existence of many spirits
4864680	4869000	and beings and gods and goddesses and demons and so on. So that's an observation. The question is,
4869960	4878040	different traditions and communities use the word spirit or energy. And you use consciousness.
4878920	4882200	Are they talking about the same thing? Or is there a reason? Is consciousness somehow
4882200	4887800	different? Talking about something different? Yeah. I think that's a big one, Nick. We'll take
4887800	4893560	that one first. I mean, ultimately, I say that these things can't be neatly carved out from one
4893560	4898920	another. But I still think it's very useful to use different terms. It's very important to use the
4898920	4904840	terms North Pole or South Pole correctly of a magnet. But, you know, effectively, they exist
4904840	4913160	together. They co-create one another and so on. I mean, polytheism is interesting. But I think
4913160	4919080	that it's a step behind what I'm trying to say, which is that is the union of division and union.
4919640	4930120	So it's not unreasonable for this God that is, if you like, ever present in the world to take
4930120	4935960	different manifestations at different times. And maybe when I have an experience that I think
4935960	4941000	is of the sacred, then that is a very particular thing. And in the past, if it had taken place in
4941000	4946680	a wood or a mountain, it would have been a different God. I don't think that's really necessary.
4948840	4954680	And I think that there are differences between spirit and consciousness and God. I mean,
4955640	4964280	consciousness is part of the cosmos that God is the ground of. What I mean by spirit is not just
4964280	4971560	my consciousness. My consciousness could be engaged in something absolutely nefarious or horrible or
4971560	4977640	trivial. But that is not spirit. What you mean by spirit, I believe, or what I mean by spirit is
4977640	4982200	something rather special, not just any other consciousness. And so we have a word for it.
4982280	4985880	That seems to me okay. Okay. Thank you. There's so many other questions, Nick.
4985880	4988520	And also, you've described yourself as a Taoist, but we'll come back to that maybe in
4988520	4994520	subsequent question. Yes, thank you. Yeah, I know. I know Dominic. Don't worry, saving the best for
4994520	5002680	last. I just want to thank you for the ways that you articulate and bring to language and things
5002680	5011560	around. Maybe I'll have a quiet voice. Just extending gratitude for the ways that you're
5011560	5020840	bringing to language. Matters of the sacred. Okay, try again, Zoya. Sorry.
5032760	5039000	Okay. Just expressing deep gratitude for the ways that you're bringing to lexicon
5039800	5046840	ideation of the sacred and innate ways of knowing. I feel like the colonization of God
5046840	5051000	is like one of the greatest unravelings that many of us experience in this age.
5051560	5059000	And I found the metaphor of the violin and that duality being important and of the
5059000	5066200	poles being really important, really poignant in this time of what we witness all around or what's
5066280	5073480	bombarded all around us around division. And I wanted to ask this, I wanted to like
5073480	5079320	zoom in on this duality of division and unifying or how you might bring that to words.
5079320	5085720	What does that mean for each of us acting in this age in response to the extent of the divisive
5085720	5092680	epistemologies of material reductionism? What kind of rigor does that require of each of us
5092680	5097640	acting as agents? Okay, thank you, Zoya. Before you answer, we need to take the last
5097640	5101560	round of questions, okay, because I think just because of time. So I've got this question
5102120	5108040	in mind and hopefully you have too. Okay, quickly, please. Yeah. What's driving you? What's your
5108040	5114040	life's mission? Okay, good one. Good one. We'll hold that thought. And a few more, please. Yes,
5114040	5116760	Dominic, okay. Well, Dominic's going last because I've already promised that.
5116920	5124920	Yeah, this is sort of related to what Linda was saying about. I was very struck by her talking
5124920	5132600	about this morning about things like fortune telling and which is a long way from the sense
5132600	5138840	of the sacred that I was getting from your book. But it's a lot more closer to what every day
5139480	5147480	understanding of the spiritual is. And there's one part in your book where you touch on near
5147480	5154680	death experiences, but say you're not going to go into that. And I suspect for the reasons you've
5154680	5160520	already explained around other stuff with the spiritual. What I'm fascinated by is that near
5160520	5169240	death experiences are actually very, very well documented now. And in a way, if that were better
5169240	5176200	known, that might be a way of pushing us past this sense that the place we're in at the moment,
5176200	5180360	where basically humanism rules and says, when you're dead, you're dead. We've got the question
5180360	5185480	near death experiences question mark. And okay, Steve, and then Oh, we got one, two, three,
5185480	5189160	and then we're done. Okay, yes, please won't be able to answer all of them. But Ian's such a
5189160	5193000	brilliant synthesizer, he'll get to the gist. Okay, so question.
5196760	5203560	I'm interested in how you feel this work is landing in society. So how have you been most
5203560	5211240	touched by the receipt of this work and most disappointed? Okay, great. And then Steve.
5212040	5216840	Yeah, we'll go. Yeah, we'll take two more of them or them or really. Okay, okay, okay, okay,
5216840	5224520	let's let's answer that. So yeah. Okay, we can do two sets then if people can. Yeah, fine, go ahead.
5229880	5232600	So kind of what I'm here for, but that's okay, go ahead.
5235800	5241080	So Zoya has a question about the violin metaphor, the tension. What does it mean in real life?
5241080	5242040	How do you put it into action?
5247320	5252840	It's the technique, I suspect, not the microphone. Why is this? This always happens to me that the
5252840	5258040	person who's interviewing has a good microphone. This has repeatedly happened. There is a God,
5258040	5264760	after all. And also, I was amused when I was at the Chalk Valley Festival. I was being interviewed
5264760	5269880	by Jonathan Gaysman and he had 25 questions and we had about 30 minutes. And he said,
5269880	5273000	I'm going to try and be concise. And he said, well, I've never seen that before.
5274200	5279640	But the trouble is that I'm trying to compress a lot. And that's my excuse anyway. I think that
5279640	5285400	the idea of the division and union is very important in resolving tensions because we're not,
5286920	5292120	but almost more important because I'm short of time, I'm going to say this. I think that the
5292120	5300920	elements that are required are humility, charity, or compassion, and a degree of awe before the
5300920	5307160	extent of the things we can't know, don't know. So people certainty that they're right, that the
5307160	5311400	other person must be wrong, that they must be terrible because they held an opinion that they
5311400	5318360	don't hold. This is all utterly horrible. And nobody should be forbidden to say what they
5318440	5323800	honestly and truly believe as long as they don't say it in a very inflammatory and horrible way.
5323800	5329000	So I'm really worried about that in society. And I think the answer is not to ban people all the
5329000	5333640	time, but actually to do the precise opposite, but to sit people down and listen. And look,
5333640	5338040	it's not very complex. You can have marital therapy between a couple that are at one another's
5338040	5343080	roads. And you get the person to speak and then you say, no, your turn's coming. Now,
5343080	5349240	what did your partner just say? No, that wasn't what I said at all. Now, that actually would be a
5349240	5355640	very, very useful exercise. I'm going to be really annoying to you because I wonder why I'll say
5355640	5358760	something else while I'm on this topic because I didn't have a chance to talk about, which is
5358760	5364440	values. Effectively, there is only one value for the left hemisphere and its power. And the entire
5364440	5369480	debate about everything since about the middle of the 19th century from Marx onwards has been
5369480	5374360	about power. Every way we look at things is about power. It's the only value that counts.
5374360	5379080	If you're an artist, it's no longer good enough to be beautiful. To have beautiful work is almost
5379080	5384920	a put down. It's powerful. And that's the only thing we respect nowadays is power. And you may say,
5384920	5390680	well, that's the way men have left it. But don't let's embrace that. Let's try to get away from it.
5390680	5397000	Let's not just drill further into power. Let's talk about beauty, goodness, and truth. Until
5397000	5404840	we talk about beauty, goodness, and truth as our guide, we are stuffed. Now, there was another
5404840	5409800	question on another one and another. Yeah. Well, the big question was the purpose of your life.
5410680	5413880	There was a big question about what's driving you and what's... Oh, yeah.
5413880	5419560	Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's quite easy to answer. I don't know. But in retrospect, my life has
5419560	5425880	made sense at the time it never did. Yeah. I mean, why did I... I wanted to do philosophy
5425880	5430760	at university, but for various reasons I didn't. It wasn't an honest degree, the one I wanted to do
5430760	5436040	philosophy and theology. So instead, I read literature. Why did I do that? I know. Why did I
5437000	5443240	switch to science in medicine? Why... In retrospect, it all makes sense. But what drives me is,
5444280	5450680	if you like... And it is a driver. It's a demon. I mean, I have a diamond in Plato's sense. It is
5450680	5455720	very cruel and won't give me time off and says, no, you might want to do that, but no,
5455720	5460680	you're sitting down at this desk and you're going to write. But the reason I want to do that is
5460680	5466040	because I believe that I have a vision that is coherent and I believe that it changes the way
5466040	5471560	people look at life. I know this. I absolutely know it from all the feedback I get. And so,
5471560	5476120	as long as I've got breath in my body, I'm willing to go around trying to promulgate it.
5477080	5487480	My impression is that it's landing very well across the educated, intelligent reading public.
5489160	5495560	There's a deafening silence from neurology and... No, not from neurology and psychiatry,
5495560	5502920	but from neuroscience. So I've had tons of wonderful messages from neurologists and
5502920	5508280	psychiatrists all around the world, but not from neuroscientists, except for Roman Chandran,
5508280	5514600	but he's a clinician as well. And so some very big names in the field have responded,
5514600	5519240	but what hasn't happened is I've been able to move on neuroscience. And neuroscientists are
5519240	5524520	people who let spend their life in the lab, but neurologists and psychiatrists actually encounter
5524520	5532840	people. And the brain has got nothing to do with people, but it has. And I've got
5532920	5538680	Mike Gazaniga on the film, The Storm, The Divided Brain, and he actually says, you know, he takes
5538680	5544440	these findings of neuroscience and so on, and then he applies them to the lives of real people.
5544440	5550200	I'm not comfortable with that. Well, I'm not comfortable with you, Mike, because you're not
5550200	5557080	doing the job you should be doing there. Anyway. Well, is there really another one there? Are you
5557080	5561160	sure? Or do we just not get to it? No, there is. There's a man who asked me over here.
5563720	5569560	There's one more question over here, which was, what has pleased me or displeased me? Yeah.
5574520	5580120	Well, it's not the same. I want to respond to it. I was just asking about that thing about
5580120	5590040	near-death experiences. I'm not against them. I wouldn't mind having one. None of these things
5590040	5598440	ever seems to come my way, but maybe one day it will. But no, I'm appropriately detached from it.
5598440	5603560	I'm prepared to believe the evidence. I know there are very good scientists involved in the area,
5603560	5609400	but I have enough battles to fight without people going, oh, I see. So he's one of those people
5609400	5615400	who believes in seances and things. I don't know what I think about seances. But I really have to
5615400	5621720	fight my battles a bit, and it's about restricting. I've got enough to cover without having to cover
5621720	5627080	things that will only land me in the soup. Okay. Okay. Stephen and Dominic. But I want, yeah,
5627080	5635640	who was the man who asked me what pleased me? Stephen and Dominic. All right. I want to say
5635640	5643240	what pleased me and what didn't. You can answer that at the end. I can say, all right.
5647160	5653240	Hey, and my question is, it might be a little late for this question now, but I'm curious,
5653880	5660440	why do you think we went in the direction in the Western world after the pre-Socratics in the
5660520	5668040	direction that we went and didn't follow what, you know, some of the profound, because I'm with you,
5668040	5672360	I think the pre-Socratics are extraordinary. So why did we take that direction?
5678840	5687080	Dominic. So actually, my question is quite quick, I think. Do my tongue. Perhaps it's quick,
5687080	5691720	but I wanted to go back to the brain. And you said something, you were talking about Jude
5691720	5698280	Coravan, and you said that animate life enables the speed of consciousness. And I wondered why
5698280	5703480	that's important. And then it was kind of a follow up on that question, which was related to what
5703480	5708520	Linda said, which was, could we, you know, you're talking about consciousness and matter,
5709240	5716120	and could consciousness be another way to think of time and that matter enables the flow of time?
5718040	5727560	Okay. If I could remember all of that when we get there. So history of ideas, yes.
5728680	5735480	I mean, really, so is not to waste time. I don't really know. I think what happened was there was
5736760	5742040	a great deal of commerce with the East, with India, with Persia, and so forth, and that many of the
5742120	5747560	ideas one finds in those cultures and in Greece at the time of the Pre-Socratics are very consonant
5747560	5753400	with one another. And then something happened in which we took a step back and started to inspect
5753400	5761080	ourselves more self-consciously. And that's what gave rise to this process. And I found something
5761080	5765960	very interesting in Whitehead the other day, which is a society thrives until it starts to
5765960	5776520	overanalyze itself. I believe that's where we're at now. Yes. Well, rather as I said before,
5776520	5779080	there's a reason why we have these different words because
5779080	5793640	yes. Yes.
5800120	5805960	Yes. All right. I think probably the way I put it was suboptimal. Thank you.
5806440	5817800	What I would have been better to say was that responsiveness is what life magnifies. So
5818520	5824040	there is a way in which inanimate matter is responsive if water comes, eventually it moves,
5824040	5829400	and so on. So there's a kind of very slow process, but it's not going to give rise to a satisfying
5829480	5835080	sense of the divine. So you need to create, as it were, creatures that are much,
5836360	5842040	much more responsive. And they respond faster, they respond more deeply, and they respond more
5842040	5848360	broadly. So that's what I meant to say. And I think that's what life brings to the party.
5849080	5856760	Finally, I think we have a chat. No, no, no, there's a time thing. Yeah. I mean,
5857320	5862520	in the chapter on time, I think we miss, I suggest that we misconceive time because we don't
5862520	5867720	understand the nature of flow. And consciousness may be a kind of flow. But first of all, I'd
5867720	5871640	have to talk about how flow is different when you're inspecting it from the outside,
5871640	5877560	and when you're actually in it. And so when you're standing on the edge of a river with
5878360	5883880	stopports and a clipboard, time and the river seem to be passing. If you get into that river and
5883880	5889880	move in the exact flow of the river, time will appear no longer to be an issue, because you're
5889880	5897720	moving with it. And so time is in itself absolutely fascinating. But I wouldn't want to say collapse
5897720	5907640	it into consciousness. I think time can exist without our self-consciousness. If you say that
5907640	5911640	it's part of the structure of the universe, which I believe it is, and consciousness is the origin
5911640	5918040	of everything there, then I see what you're getting at. But I'm just nervous of conflating
5918040	5926040	things that ought to be kept separate. No, I just wanted to say, I mean, I really,
5928360	5933000	my first book I wrote in my twenties was called Against Criticism, and it sold about 400 copies,
5933000	5939080	and it then got unceremoniously remained it. It's slightly satisfying to me that if you now
5939080	5947720	try to buy a copy, it will cost you £2,000. But I didn't believe that the master and his
5947720	5952200	emissary would take off. I genuinely didn't, and it caused a change in my life, because I actually
5952200	5957800	gave up the day job in order to lecture and write further. And the good side of that was I could live
5957800	5966600	on sky, and the bad side of that was that I took a 90% cut in income. But what has really
5967720	5974920	staggeringly moved me, and it really does move me every day, is people who write to me saying,
5974920	5982520	this book changed my life. I mean, if an author gets that once in a lifetime, they should be
5982520	5990520	overjoyed. But I do hear it time and again. And people also say, which makes me feel I must be on
5990520	5998600	to something, somehow I knew all this, but I had no way of articulating it, defending it,
5998600	6005480	but you have given me confidence. This is so moving. I mean, after all, one of the reasons
6005480	6009320	I went to the psychiatry, I can say is because I wanted to investigate the mind-body problem.
6009320	6014920	That's true. That's very sort of top level. But another level, I had wanted to be a monk. I
6014920	6019960	decided I didn't really want to be a priest, but I felt very happy being a doctor. And I had a very
6020520	6025080	warm relationship with my patients. And one of the things that crossed my mind is if I'm going to
6025080	6031160	retire from that, that's going to give a huge hole in your life. Actually, it didn't, because I've
6031160	6036520	met so many people through this work, and I was freed to do other things. But anyway, I just wanted
6036520	6043960	to say that I'm enormously grateful to them for that. And I hope that people will continue to write,
6043960	6050200	because everybody's contribution is somehow different and increases the feeling that it was
6050200	6055320	okay to go through all the loneliness of the long-distance runner, because it really has been
6055320	6061800	a very, very, very long and hard grind at many times. And I don't really, although I may appear
6061800	6066840	to be confident, I don't really have that kind of imposter syndrome. And when people say, no,
6066840	6071640	this thing really means something to me, that means something very great to me. So I just
6071640	6075480	want to thank you all very much.
6101640	6102540	you
