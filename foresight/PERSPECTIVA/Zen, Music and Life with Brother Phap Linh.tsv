0	13640	Firstly, I just want to say thank you again to everyone for being here.
13640	15760	My name's Michael Brady.
15760	20000	If you've been at Perspective Event at any time in the last year, you may have seen me
20000	21000	before.
21000	32320	I'm delighted to be joined by my good friend, long-time friend, Fat Lin, who's a senior
32320	43560	Dharma teacher in the Plum Village Zen tradition, which is the tradition of Teek-Nut-Han.
43560	45280	What can I say about Fat Lin?
45280	50720	I first met Fat Lin I think it was 2010 when I went to Plum Village for a treat for the
50720	58560	first time and I can share I've been reading a lot of Teek-Nut-Han's books and really falling
58560	65680	in love with this path of practice and I was very excited to go to Plum Village and when
65680	72640	I got to Plum Village saw Teek-Nut-Han and that was wonderful but one of the things that
72640	78280	surprised me that really struck me was the kind of way of being of the monastics there
78640	85160	and they seemed very happy and very relaxed and I thought I want to have some of that.
85160	89040	Something that really embodied that for me was Fat Lin and so he's been a good friend
89040	98040	to me for many, many years and he's a wonderful Dharma teacher at Plum Village and gives wonderful
98040	109680	talks on Buddhism but also integrates a lot of wisdom and fields of knowledge that are
109680	117600	also outside of Buddhism so philosophy and science and many of you here are fans of Ian
117600	123640	McGillchrist and Fat Lin is also a fan of Ian McGillchrist and there's been a conversation
123640	128360	with him I think he came to Plum Village or beamed in for a neuroscience retreat during
128360	133960	COVID when it was online retreats but Fat Lin is also a wonderful composer and cellist and was
133960	144440	a composer before he became a monk so I'm really excited to talk with Fat Lin and yeah engage in
144440	150120	this dialogue so welcome Fat Lin to this space. Well thank you thank you Michael for such a
150120	159240	generous introduction. Yeah with everyone. So I thought what would be nice to start I want to
159240	163960	get into a conversation and if you haven't been at one of these events usually what we do is we
163960	169320	have a conversation for about an hour and then we'll open up to Q&A. What I'd like to do today
169320	176200	is actually start a little bit differently and I'm very grateful that Fat Lin's given me permission
176200	182600	for this before we started so what I'd like to do is we're going to start with a little short
182600	188440	practice that Fat Lin will guide us in just a few minutes three or four minutes and just to bring
188440	193240	us into a kind of a quality of awareness and attention and then I'm going to play a piece of
193240	203720	music that Fat Lin... I think did you write this or was this a translation of a Plum Village
203720	209400	chant? I think the piece with you on piano and channel. Yeah I wrote it. Okay nice nice nice.
210520	219720	Yeah so thank you everyone for being here and yeah this is a piece of music which is
221000	228920	an instrumental version of a chant which is actually in French so it's based on a text which
228920	236120	was originally in Classical Chinese which my teacher translated into vernacular Vietnamese
236120	245000	and then was then translated into English and then into French and every time it was translated
245000	252120	my teacher Thay just means teacher in Vietnamese that's Tiggian Han. He wanted it to be set to
252120	260760	music and the thing he told me he always said this in relation to music and in any kind of cultural
260760	269880	expression he said use local materials which I took to mean you know find a musical language and
269880	279720	style which is you know rooted here somehow whatever that means so I didn't really know what
279720	288680	that meant but I kind of went... I suppose I went digging in a feeling of Celtic roots because I'm
288680	295960	kind of Welsh, French, English, some mishmash of all of the above and yeah there's just a feeling
295960	304600	of rootedness in with yeah a familiarity with those roots somehow a feeling of home so I felt
304600	315000	like maybe that style or that kind of musical language would connect and so we have a chant
315000	319160	for it in French and this was the melody that I composed and then during the right at the beginning
319160	327000	of the pandemic I actually was in lockdown and sort of out of loose sense I just thought well
327000	331880	why don't I transcribe it you know make an instrumental version I wrote a piano accompaniment
331880	338120	and then I recorded myself playing the piano part and then added the cello part on top just
338120	345560	because it was just a way for me to connect with people in the world and just to offer to feel like
345560	351000	I could offer something maybe a little moment of solace for people who were going through really
351000	359480	tough times as I think many many were at the time so yeah let's just just take a moment to
360200	369960	kind of see if we can cultivate a deeper kind of presence a deeper kind of listening
372280	378840	we know that the presence is something which is of a variable nature we can be more or less
379400	385880	present and and there are ways that we can establish our presence so for me one of the
385880	392760	ways that I like to employ that I learned from my teacher is to bring my awareness to my body
393320	401480	to my sensations in the body so we can start just noticing whatever position our feet happen to be in
402920	408840	however those sensations are we don't have to sit in any special way but just noticing the feet
409720	416360	feel like that the legs feel like that the buttocks feel like that the back
417320	428680	the shoulders the arms the hands the head face eyes and forehead and ears and nose and cheeks and
428680	435640	mouth and tongue and just bringing all of these sensations which are always there
436520	441480	but just bringing them back into the sphere of our awareness and what that does is that that then
443320	449240	grounds us and connects us to the present moment because all of those sensations are only ever in
449240	459320	the present and so as long as we are with those sensations the feeling of weight
459800	467720	maybe is tiny little micro movements and changing of the balance and the curvature of our spine as we
467720	474920	breathe you can even feel the air on our skin even if it's barely moving even if we're indoors
477000	483560	you can feel the tiny tiny little movements and currents of air because our skin is so sensitive
483960	493560	and these are all the sensations that we might otherwise just overlook or disregard
494920	498600	because they're slight but when we bring our attention to them they can grow
499560	507240	and we may realize oh even if there's a little bit of tension there might be a little bit of pain
507240	513400	somewhere in the body but overall perhaps it's it can be quite pleasant
515960	521960	just to be in those sensations now we can just notice the breath coming in
525000	532520	the movement of the in breath the movement of the out breath and we're just coming deeper and deeper
532520	542440	as though we could sort of sink ourselves into ourselves sink ourselves deeper into our own
542440	547880	sensations into our own weight and just sit ourselves deeper and deeper
550040	555880	arriving more and more in this moment in these sensations
556840	567240	and yeah I suggest as we turn on the music maybe just allow yourself to stay to just keep
567240	579240	the little thread of awareness of the breath coming in and coming out
585880	587240	you
765880	767880	You
796880	800880	Thank you for that. Thank you for that, brother
805880	807880	Do I need a little bit of time?
809880	813880	Oh, you're muted. Can you hear now? Can you speak?
814880	816880	Ah, there we go. Go.
818880	824880	Yeah, I feel I need a little time to launch into a conversation after after that
825880	832880	It's really beautiful. It's quite it's quite something to listen together in presence
835880	844880	And I think it's yeah, it's it's weirdly rare, you know that we that we allow ourselves to do that
845880	851880	We see that in plum village that you will you know plum village is a monastery where I live in the south of France and
852880	860880	We have big summer retreats that maybe like a thousand people show up for four weeks in the summer and a lot of children maybe like 150 kids running around
862880	871880	And one of the practices that we have is walking meditation everyone walks in silence and presence quite slowly just aware of every step so they're basically doing what we were just doing
872880	876880	Sitting being aware of our feet being aware of our body, but you're doing it in motion. So you're just
877880	885880	Bringing your attention back again and again to the present to the sensation of your feet touching the ground and so on the legs moving the whole body moving
887880	894880	The environment around you the other people yourself your feelings your thoughts everything in the present to cultivating that precious
895880	900880	But sort of under appreciated resource of presence you could call it mindfulness
900880	909880	And then so tie our teacher loved he sort of this was one of his favorite inventions and I just I wasn't planning to talk about it
910880	920880	But it just seems to fit so perfectly with the topic of this conversation he once a week we would walk down the hill from Upper Hamlet to another part of the monastery with a little courtyard and
921880	935880	If we could if we were lucky enough there would be some musicians that there's a I'm a chalice that we have a sister wonderful violinist and then sometimes there were some other professional musicians who would come so sometimes we could pull together a string quartet
936880	952880	And we would be there under the trees waiting for a thousand people to appear walking very slowly and silently who would then surround us at this fast silent ocean it's quite something a thousand people in silence and sitting down
953880	973880	And we would start playing Mozart and Bach and and Schubert and you know and people would have this transcendent experience so there's listening to music they were very familiar with but they'd never really, really listen to before in that way because
974880	991880	The you know the field of presence is a collective phenomenon as well so when you have a thousand people all generating that awareness and presence, suddenly the music lives and breathes in a completely different way and people will be crying and so
992880	1008880	Yeah, I feel like that's one of the great joys of my life that I get to to offer music in that kind of setting when people are very deeply present.
1009880	1021880	Yeah, and as you say this is something that seems to be more and more rare in the modern world.
1021880	1047880	I think, I think the kind of initial impetus for this series of conversations was the the the short hand we were throwing around the perspective of music in the metacrisis, right, you know, which is, you know, music and the state of the world, you know, and I think one thing that seems, I mean the metacrisis has so many aspects to it.
1048880	1060880	It's like I think of it as somewhat like an entangled kind of karmic knot that we seem to not be able to really disentangle ourselves from you know this complex system that kind of hardens and not gets tighter each time.
1060880	1082880	But if there's one thread in that it would seem that it's it's habits of attention in the way that we dispose our attention and the way culture and society and technology increasingly and the economy pulls us into words habits of attention that are the exact opposite of what you describe.
1083880	1089880	You know, so yeah, we've jumped we've jumped right into the heart of this.
1089880	1091880	Yeah, yeah, it's beautiful.
1091880	1104880	And part of part of this part of this this inquiry is is how can we how can we make those kind of qualities of of togetherness.
1104880	1106880	And we communicate as could be a word.
1106880	1115880	Those kind of experiences come more alive because they seem to be the lifeblood of the soul and something that's deeply necessary for us, you know, absolutely.
1115880	1117880	Yeah.
1117880	1118880	Yeah.
1118880	1120880	Yeah, I think about concerts.
1120880	1122880	We used to go to concerts.
1122880	1124880	I was at a music school in Edinburgh.
1124880	1133880	When I was a man from age 11 and they had this wonderful idea which is to to offer a season tickets to the.
1133880	1143880	I guess it was the music or the Scottish National Orchestra, probably, I think something like that and they would play in the big hall there.
1143880	1159880	It's called it's called Waverly Hall or some kind of hall and so every Saturday night or Thursday night or whatever night we would go there and you know there'd be some grand production, big, you know, orchestral symphonic concert and our, you know, aged 13.
1159880	1162880	Yeah, usher hall there you go RS and yeah, thank you.
1162880	1164880	Somebody's on the ball.
1164880	1180880	And so aged sort of 1415 we thought it was very clever to stand on the tickets to stand on the steps and sell our tickets and go and do something else, being very diligent music students that we were.
1180880	1185880	But it's because actually the whole experience often was so stultifying.
1186880	1194880	And you get a lot of very well dressed people who are probably sleeping, like I'd say, at least 50% asleep.
1194880	1205880	The other 50% said I mean they didn't have mobile phones at least they weren't looking at screens but they were kind of really discreetly trying to read the program or, and also just maybe daydreaming like and it's not.
1205880	1211880	This is not a judgment, like, it's actually quite hard to pay attention.
1211880	1217880	You have to learn how to do so you have to and I found it myself I'd be there.
1217880	1220880	And then my mind would wonder and I'd be like I'm not even listening to this.
1220880	1227880	So, and then you start thinking about the players and then as an as a classical musician, you know that sometimes you can play.
1227880	1232880	And your mind is also wondering, you know, you might not even be there.
1232880	1237880	So, if nobody, you know, nobody's there, thank the players on the audience isn't there.
1237880	1240880	So what's happening.
1240880	1243880	The question for me is how to be there.
1243880	1253880	Everyone from the players, even the composer to the to the to the sort of setup of the space the listening the presence.
1253880	1257880	And then I think that's that's when the magic happens when you're there.
1257880	1264880	And sometimes it just happens by accident sort of by a kind of by a kind of grace.
1264880	1275880	Even with an orchestra, you know, I would go to concerts in London and just every so often you get a conductor who isn't using authority, but is using love.
1275880	1280880	And you feel it like the whole orchestra is just like, we love you, you're amazing.
1280880	1286880	Like, and so they will do anything for that conductor.
1286880	1288880	And, and then it's electric.
1288880	1289880	Everybody's there.
1289880	1293880	Everybody's fully present.
1293880	1301880	When you say that your doctor is using love, but then are you are you talking about is that how is that expressing itself?
1301880	1304880	Like, is that is that a love and a care for the musicians?
1304880	1305880	Is that a love for the music?
1305880	1311880	Are they kind of in a in a flow and a symbiosis with the music?
1311880	1315880	I have a I have a I can have a sense of how authority and I conduct might use fear.
1315880	1316880	Yes.
1316880	1323880	And to control the musicians and how that would be very destructive.
1323880	1328880	But I'm a bit say a bit more about how a conductor uses love.
1328880	1332880	Well, they're quite rare.
1332880	1340880	Because I think it's quite a it's my sense of it is quite hard as a conductor, you know, you put in this position and and the expectation.
1340880	1343880	I mean, the whole culture is a little bit driven towards authority.
1343880	1344880	This is your interpretation.
1344880	1346880	You're going to take control of the orchestra.
1346880	1347880	They're your instrument to play with.
1347880	1353880	And, you know, so it can be quite a it's a culture also that feeds the ego that builds up the persona.
1353880	1354880	It's quite male dominated.
1354880	1358880	It's quite kind of there's a lot of power plays in that.
1358880	1367880	But every so often you get lucky and somebody has just transcended all of that and and is there kind of just for the right reasons.
1368880	1374880	Yeah, from a love for the music from a kind of
1374880	1387880	something transcendent something spiritual but maybe they're not maybe they wouldn't even say it like that, you know, maybe it's not consciously thought of as being a spiritual thing but it is a spiritual thing for me.
1387880	1397880	And and just like when there's respect and and generosity and kindness in the rehearsals, you know, in the way of treating each other.
1397880	1401880	And suddenly you get into this positive dynamic.
1401880	1412880	A lot of my classical musician friends actually find themselves much happier playing being session musicians.
1412880	1421880	For you know, for pop artists, because they can often it's not always the case but often they find it's just everyone's much they just treat you much better.
1421880	1423880	Everyone's kinder.
1423880	1433880	There's less pressure and classical music can be a very violent, you know, emotionally abusive world kind of going off on a tangent.
1433880	1434880	Well, I'm curious.
1434880	1442880	I mean, yeah, I mean, it maybe can bring us back because where I wanted to start was you were obviously a composer before you were a monk.
1442880	1448880	And for most people, being a composer as a profession.
1448880	1454880	Well, for some people could be like a dream life that you get paid to create art.
1454880	1457880	Why would you give that up to become a monk?
1457880	1458880	So that's my question.
1458880	1459880	That's a question to you.
1459880	1460880	Why did you?
1460880	1461880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1462880	1464880	And especially did you feel it?
1464880	1469880	Did you feel with that you were leaving music behind?
1469880	1471880	Or was that a fear for you?
1471880	1476880	Yeah, it's so it is a really it's a really good question.
1476880	1485880	I see it as being fundamentally because of a kind of very deep stubbornness in me.
1485880	1489880	I didn't really reckon I wouldn't have put it like this at the time but now looking back.
1489880	1495880	I realized that this I can trace this stubbornness back to when I was a child.
1495880	1506880	And there was a just a complete refusal in me to participate in certain kinds of music.
1506880	1516880	So when I felt like it's just for the sake of showing off, you know, technical, you know, facility.
1516880	1520880	Kind of, you know, musical bravura.
1520880	1522880	Yeah, totally uninterested.
1522880	1524880	Just, I don't care.
1524880	1529880	I just like, no, sorry, it just leaves me completely cold.
1529880	1539880	When people started talking to me, you know, and this is like a hot house kind of music school where you're supposed to go off and become a soloist and, you know, they start talking about the music industry.
1539880	1542880	I was probably 13 when I first heard that term.
1542880	1546880	And I was just like, no, sorry, I don't know.
1546880	1553880	I don't know what you're talking about, but that has nothing to do with whatever it is that I'm going to do and I have no idea what I'm going to do.
1553880	1555880	I'm just not going to do that.
1555880	1569880	So, so this, this just total refusal to participate in this kind of sausage factory thing of, you know, you're going to get technically Britain, you're going to pass all the things, you're going to win the competitions.
1569880	1574880	You're going to do the stuff and you're going to compete, you're going to be the best.
1574880	1575880	No, I don't care.
1575880	1577880	I'm not interested.
1577880	1578880	That's not what I'm doing.
1578880	1582880	I don't really know what I am doing, but I just know that it's not that.
1582880	1594880	And so when I actually got to sort of, you know, university age, I think another aspect of that refusal was actually I turned away from music.
1594880	1601880	I said, I, I just don't want to do it in the way that it's being offered to me because that, you know, there was a pathway.
1601880	1604880	It was a probably like chamber music or something like that.
1604880	1610880	There was definitely a pathway.
1610880	1612880	But I just, I just didn't like it.
1612880	1613880	It was too competitive.
1613880	1614880	It was too mean.
1614880	1617880	It was too, it just, I didn't feel the love.
1617880	1620880	I didn't feel the care and what I would now call spirituality.
1620880	1627880	I wouldn't have called it that then and I wouldn't have known how to characterize what I was looking for, but I just, I knew it's absence.
1627880	1629880	I didn't know what it was in a positive sense.
1629880	1632880	I just knew the lack and I wasn't interested.
1632880	1633880	So then I switched.
1633880	1641880	I studied mathematics, which maybe seems like an odd choice, but I, I felt like I was trying for me.
1641880	1644880	I was trying to find out what's at the root of it all.
1644880	1649880	I know that seems a bit arrogant, but it's kind of like.
1649880	1654880	There's something important going on, something important and mysterious, and I want to understand it.
1654880	1657880	And, and I feel like maths has something to do with that.
1657880	1665880	But, you know, it's very deeply in meshed in the nature of things, type space and consciousness.
1665880	1677880	So I want to try to understand it, but then I go to Cambridge and find it's dry as dust, completely, you know, no room for creativity.
1677880	1686880	You know, it's again quite like, yeah, just kind of ended up sticking in my craw.
1686880	1693880	Like a similar kind of competitive, the hard, kind of egoic driven space.
1693880	1694880	Yeah.
1694880	1703880	And again, at some point, just another sausage factory and now for the city, you know, so all of the best mathematicians of my generation ended up being quants and hedge funds.
1703880	1715880	Literally, you know, many of my friends who are just absolutely incredible mathematicians, instead of being drawn into a love of ideas and research, they end up just being pulled into the city.
1715880	1718880	And so I felt like, again, something wrong.
1718880	1726880	So I graduated, I was going to then come back and do the master's thing or whatever, you know, to starting preparing for a PhD.
1726880	1734880	But again, I had this moment of revulsion, I just don't want to engage, I just don't feel like that's the kind of thing I want to do.
1734880	1745880	So then went back to music, and I'm more or less just in the summer just sort of started calling my friends and saying, I'm a composer, which, which I plainly wasn't.
1745880	1753880	Maybe if I just say so, then they'll ask me to write stuff and I'll kind of have to be a composer because then I'll have things to write.
1753880	1759880	So that's kind of what happened. And I had, you know, it's a lot of wonderful, generous friends.
1759880	1779880	And, and they played my, you know, my early messes and, and they, you know, I gradually forget stuff. I had some lessons and just did a lot of listening and, and then gradually got to the point where I could, yeah, I could make a living and, and I was having bigger
1779880	1789880	commissions and, you know, things that getting to write for, you know, really wonderful, wonderful musicians.
1789880	1800880	And again, I had this moment of just kind of no, I don't, I don't want it, I don't want to do that.
1800880	1806880	And I'll, I'll use them. I can't.
1806880	1814880	Yeah, so I actually, I watched a film with my father a while ago, which some of you may have seen it's quite a dark, difficult film.
1814880	1816880	What's it's what's it called.
1816880	1820880	It's Cape Blanchette as a conductor.
1820880	1822880	It's just the name of the conductor.
1822880	1828880	It's like a three let tar tar. That's it.
1828880	1848880	And it's, I think it's a very, very scarily accurate portrayal of, of what the culture of celebrity in music can do to somebody when you feed their ego because they are brilliant and they have something and you, you then praise them and praise them and
1848880	1860880	you reify this personhood, this self to the point where it becomes practically demonic. It's, it's like really toxic.
1860880	1871880	And then there's abuse and, you know, that people do terrible things and they just behave really badly and, and often are told, you know, everything's condoned, you know, maybe now in the age of me too, it's changing.
1871880	1875880	But I think for a long time.
1875880	1888880	I think it's part of our culture almost that the genius is permitted, almost anything in terms of behavior, they're kind of outside the normal expectations of morality.
1888880	1899880	And it's like as long as the music's good, you can be a monster, doesn't matter, you can treat people badly, but as long as you produce a work of genius.
1899880	1917880	Ah, then, you know, it's all fine. All is forgiven. You have to be like that. You're a twisted, you know, tortured genius and maybe you have to be that difficult person, that unpleasant person, but it's all worth it because look, you know, a great symphony.
1917880	1926880	And I just felt like I wasn't anywhere near that level, but I just felt the beginning of that.
1926880	1940880	And it was around me, and it was in me. I felt like I was being encouraged to compete, first of all.
1940880	1961880	I was being told that I was writing, I was the one writing the music. And that might seem like, well, of course, you were the one writing the music, but from my point of view as a meditator, it was very clear to me in the present moment experience of putting things, putting notes on the page, that there was no me doing anything.
1961880	1979880	Right. There was a whole system of clouds, trees, earth, ancestors, something mysterious, and music would come and I'd be like, well, I'll just try to get it down there without messing it up. But I never felt like I wrote this.
1980880	1998880	No, I'm the one who put my kind of grubby paw prints on it. And I, like, I distorted it. And I hope, like, something survived the process. I didn't write it. You know, that's how I would say things like that to people and they'd look at me like I was an idiot.
1998880	2009880	They'd be like, or they'd ask me to write, you know, those program blurbs and you'd have to say what your inspiration was for the music. And I would always write things like, oh, I didn't write this, you know.
2012880	2027880	And then everybody that would get edited out and they say, but what do you mean nobody understands and don't be so, you know, you're just being annoying now. And, you know, it was just so inconvenient because the whole world was set up to praise me for being the one who did this thing.
2027880	2045880	And then people come up to you after the concert and they say, oh, you wrote this. You. And there's part of you that kind of goes, maybe, maybe I did. Tell me once more. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.
2047880	2051880	You know, and it's part of you likes it. Yeah, tell me once more.
2052880	2064880	And you were already getting a kind of an allergy. Like you were having some kind of awareness in yourself that no, I don't want to go in this direction. And this is this is quite young and you're kind of like Dharma life, so to speak. Yeah.
2065880	2067880	So you're still you're already get that awareness.
2068880	2095880	Well, I was very lucky that I went to Plum Village. The first time when I was 19. So I was at Cambridge, I was still doing the math thing and it kind of got me through Cambridge and I you know, I went to Plum Village at least a couple of times a year and and so by the time I started becoming you know, getting into that I was doing bigger concerts and as a composer I was 20, 25 ish 26 and so by then I was doing longer
2095880	2112880	concerts in Plum Village. I was meditating quite regularly. And so it was really like an important part of my life, my daily lived experience. And so thanks to that, really, like, really, really, really thanks to that I had the capacity to compare
2113880	2132880	two kinds of happiness, I suppose. So one was the happiness of being praised, or being acclaimed or being recognized or being, you know, just sort of like, yeah, great people or people you know it was like one particular moment which I think I've talked about before, maybe with you is
2132880	2161880	the moment of just taking a bow at the end of a concert. So it's a big concert I've been working on this piece for a long time. You know, the audience loved it, it's like standing ovation you go up you take your bow. And it's a thrill for sure it's a rush. But it was very interesting because I just come from Plum Village for this concert. And so the, like, the sensitivity was quite high. So I could taste like, Oh, I'm enjoying this.
2163880	2178880	But I already want more. I could already feel it's a rush, but it's already not enough. And it's not I know it's not going to last very long, probably about five seconds, you know, kind of want another hit, you know, somebody's going to have to tell me again why it was so great.
2178880	2194880	And, and at the same time, I could compare with my inner experience of sitting meditation, primarily sitting meditation for me where I knew I could, I could basically have fulfillment.
2195880	2217880	Well being freedom for nothing for free without needing anything or anyone, not dependent on anything. And it's so different. And I could feel like here is a well being that does me no harm and in fact is just a kind of bomb to my soul.
2218880	2226880	And here is a kind of thing that is cold happiness, but it's actually just a poison.
2227880	2228880	It's a drug.
2229880	2249880	There's an interesting fact in what like, just to step back a little bit, what I hear in your story is from an outside perspective, you know, music seems like a wonderful thing. And the more of it, the more that we have of it, the better for our society.
2249880	2262880	But, you know, what you describe about the kind of culture of classical music and the, and the, and the culture that's within classical music education, and how toxic something that can be.
2262880	2275880	And then also you talk about this then this movement towards studying math, which springs from something that's very beautiful that just this natural human desire to understand life to understand reality to get closer.
2275880	2285880	And then you find something again, then you experience revulsion towards the culture of that. And then you find yourself in this a little bit more free space for your own composer.
2286880	2296880	But then there's still this, as you described, this kind of toxin of celebrity, of a claim, all that kind of stuff.
2296880	2303880	But especially the, the, the rarefication of a, of a self, of a, of a, like, this is a person who did this thing.
2304880	2305880	Yeah.
2305880	2306880	Yeah.
2306880	2307880	Yeah.
2307880	2309880	Because it's not true.
2309880	2310880	Yeah.
2310880	2311880	Yeah.
2311880	2323880	It just makes me what I'm reflecting upon is if we are interested in, in, in how to respond to the child, the various challenges of our times and how we kind of
2324880	2336880	try to amplify the good parts of our culture, the stuff that's already good, that we have to be aware that even all these attempts can be co-opted, co-opted by all of these other
2337880	2345880	kind of streams of human collective consciousness towards a claim towards egoism, towards all of this kind of stuff, you know.
2345880	2350880	I think, yeah, I mean, that's capitalism's major skill set in a sense.
2350880	2360880	Appropriation, you know, appropriation, decontextualization, commodification, decentralization, it's brilliant.
2360880	2361880	Does it?
2361880	2362880	Yeah.
2362880	2363880	Very effective.
2363880	2373880	And so can you tell us a little bit about your conscious that there might be many people who've never been to Plum Village, who don't know Plum Village, who doesn't know anything about that.
2373880	2383880	So could you say a little bit about life at Plum Village and your life at Plum Village and what it's like and what the practice is and what the orientation is and yeah, that kind of thing.
2384880	2385880	Yeah.
2385880	2387880	We can dive a little bit more into the music after that.
2387880	2388880	Sure.
2389880	2401880	So Plum Village is a monastery, is a Zen Buddhist monastery in the Vietnamese Zen tradition founded by my teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh, when he was exiled from Vietnam.
2401880	2408880	He was eventually given French nationality and he was able to establish himself there.
2408880	2420880	And initially it was just set up as more or less like a refugee camp because it was in the middle of the boat, people crisis and France was at that time being quite generous in receiving Vietnamese refugees.
2420880	2422880	But then they were kind of rootless.
2422880	2436880	And so my teacher wanted to create a place where they could, you know, where their kids could learn Vietnamese, where they could learn Vietnamese songs and dances and just be connected to their roots and their culture, as well as Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism.
2437880	2450880	And so, but it was so magnetic that Westerners started arriving and people just sort of started begging my teacher to teach and to ordain them as monastics and eventually sort of relent.
2450880	2465880	He refused for a long time and then eventually he said, okay, and he started ordaining people as monastics and then he had a kind of, yeah, a vision for, well, maybe, you know, this, this society does actually need monasticism.
2465880	2485880	Maybe monasticism can, can play a role in healing some of the brokenness, you know, and it's important, I think, to put it in the context of the war in Vietnam, which there is not called the Vietnam war, it's called the American war for obvious reasons.
2486880	2500880	And so I think my teacher's peace activism was directed at trying to understand what is the root cause of this war, of this violence.
2500880	2522880	And so when he came to the West and he went to visit the Pope and he went to visit Robert McNamara and Martin Luther King and, you know, many, many other people and, and was trying to understand, you know, the consciousness, why was America engaged in this war, what was the root of this, this violence.
2523880	2528880	And so all of his peace activism also operates on a very long time scale.
2528880	2546880	So people were a little bit confused when he founded Plum Village and thought, oh, he's trying no longer doing engaged Buddhism, but no, like this Plum Village, the monastery, founding a monastery in the West is Thai's peace activism, because he's saying,
2546880	2564880	you need more people like this who are trained not to react in a situation of conflict who are trained not to take sides who can help people to reconcile and get over their anger and their hatred, who can get over the anger and the hatred in their own hearts, who can heal their
2564880	2572880	own sort of deep rooted ancestral legacies of suffering.
2572880	2583880	And so it's kind of like aimed at maybe preventing a war, not that war, which maybe he couldn't prevent, but he could maybe stop a war in 50 years time.
2583880	2589880	And who knows, it's like, maybe seems like not enough, but it's, that's the, that's the direction.
2589880	2604880	And so we receive people from all over the world, maybe like in Plum Village itself in France, I think it's about 15,000 people a year to who want to usually come into a week of retreat of meditation.
2604880	2612880	And so it's still a refugee camp, you know, we're receiving the refugees from the meta crisis.
2612880	2629880	And, and, and just like surrounding them with love and care for a week and looking after them and then we send them out hopefully a little bit more resilient a little bit more loving also able to offer and radiate that love around them very much like what you're doing.
2629880	2634880	So that's the idea that we, it's like train the trainers.
2634880	2641880	Kind of model. So we train the carers, the therapists, the teachers, the doctors, the nurses.
2641880	2648880	And then hopefully that sort of ripples out. And I think it does, it does ripple out.
2648880	2653880	So that's what Plum Village is about. And in terms of music.
2653880	2664880	The reason that I could ordain there was that music was always a big part of life in in Plum Village and art in general. So all kinds of art.
2664880	2672880	So my teacher always said Zen and art always go together. Many, many greats and masters masters have been calligraphers or poets.
2672880	2689880	And so there was no kind of dislocation, you know, it's not, not a separate thing. It's actually going deeper into the thing that I really want to do, which is music, but in a particular way.
2689880	2700880	So having said that still wasn't easy because I knew to some extent, even maybe to a great extent, I would have to give it up.
2700880	2710880	Right. So I'd have to give it up at the professional level that I was accustomed to, like working with the highest, you know, the greatest musicians, young musicians of our era.
2710880	2719880	And just that very intense high level kind of, I mean, that there was very joyous aspect to that, which I had to renounce.
2719880	2735880	And so it's kind of like, okay, so now I'm doing music, but it's with an out of tune guitar with, you know, one string miss thing and 100 people who have never been trained to sing and don't know how to read music.
2735880	2752880	So here we go. So I had to give up a lot of expectations or ideas about what music even is and a lot of my kind of preciousness aspects of music.
2752880	2769880	But I also, yeah, and also just in the monastic training, there's a kind of like a big part of it is just becoming a beginner again, the cumbling yourself, becoming the one who doesn't know, rather than the one who knows or thinks he knows lots of things.
2769880	2777880	So maybe right at the beginning, there's a kind of like, it's better actually if I don't play.
2777880	2788880	I don't want to immediately be seen as somebody who's very capable at something or has a talent because then that makes me, you know, again, I'm still back in this whole ego game.
2788880	2802880	And I have to kind of just be really, really simple for as long as I can and just, you know, clean wash up sweep do just do everything, all the normal monastery stuff.
2802880	2814880	And, and hopefully that that that can start to transform some of the bad habits that I was accumulating otherwise.
2814880	2817880	Yeah, it's interesting.
2817880	2824880	That point about, I said about Zen and art being, you know, not separate.
2824880	2839880	It seems like in our, in our culture in the West, you're probably familiar with the book, and conciliants by E. O. Wilson, about the kind of jumping together of knowledge and this kind of this kind of he had this idea just for those of you don't know that there's,
2839880	2853880	there's going to be a kind of a knitting together or coming together of different streams of knowledge, whereas for most of maybe the last 500 years or so the West has kind of fractionated out the knowledge and specialized specialized specialized specialized.
2853880	2868880	And it seems that we've done that as well, not just with endeavors and knowledge in the university, but also with culture more generally, you know, so you have religion here, and then you have art here, and then you have
2868880	2873880	commerce and forms of economic activity here and it's all kind of split up.
2873880	2892880	And Plum Village was interesting as the art and the spiritual practice are much more woven together as as mutually supportive and affording of each other, which is quite alien to I think in for us in the in the West.
2892880	2908880	Yes, I mean there has been a kind of secularization of music, obviously, and in a way, importantly, so a separation of music from from a kind of
2909880	2928880	from dogman. So maybe there was a good thing happening there, but there's also a great loss, which is the professionalization you then go in the direction of the professional professionalization of music and this culture of celebrity and genius and so on.
2928880	2943880	So there's kind of pluses and minuses I mean like when I say that something is lost what I'm thinking of in particular is the kind of anonymity that was afforded to maybe the monks who wrote the great Gregorian chance.
2943880	2953880	Nobody, almost nobody knows their names, you know, and didn't matter, but it was just this the purity of that offering to God.
2953880	2967880	And the lifting up of the spirit in that act of music was so far removed from kind of, you know, personality and
2967880	2979880	yeah, the cult of celebrity is something very protective because as a monastic you're not dependent on earning an income becoming famous, having a reputation having a following I'm talking now in the modern age.
2979880	2992880	There's something very privileged actually about what you can do as a monastic, because you don't have to make a living, and you don't have to be famous you don't have to succeed you don't really have to.
2993880	2998880	You don't have to engage in the whole in the whole capitalist enterprise.
2998880	3021880	Not say that some you know some monastics do but but you don't have to. And so that's what I'm really fascinated by by this possibility of doing something like music and it's not just music can extend to many different domains but for me, primarily music to be able to come together as a group of people.
3022880	3036880	To say hey, let's make a piece of music let's even record an album for example, whereas we recently done and we're going to do it, not to make money.
3036880	3049880	We're not we're not going to get famous we're not going to do it to be popular or to be liked. We're going to do it for love. We're going to do it because we believe that a certain kind of music made in a certain kind of way.
3050880	3052880	Can help.
3052880	3055880	It can just help people to feel better.
3055880	3064880	It can be a very real offering into difficult spaces, you know into into difficult lives.
3064880	3069880	And it can be a real meaningful support to people.
3069880	3074880	And when there's that purity of intention.
3074880	3084880	And for me it's that's very very special now of course you can do that. And I think many great artists do do that they do. They are in service.
3084880	3099880	But it's much more difficult when you're not a monastic because you do then have to pay the bills and you know you do have to make a living and you do have to get a following and so there's always going to be a pressure sort of pushing you in that direction.
3099880	3108880	And you have to be very strong actually to sort of retain your real reason why like why you want to do it. What's the point of it all.
3108880	3123880	And so then for us as monastic as a monastic community now in a sort of more engaged sense what we want to do is to start offering retreats for artists to support them in making
3123880	3143880	the movement of all kinds for these for maybe this what I would call the deeper reason and which is probably more resonant with their original intention maybe even as a child that that wish to sing to to create to celebrate to paint to dance to write whatever
3143880	3148880	it's very very pure and I think it needs a lot of protection.
3148880	3152880	So and in a way with with the monastic life.
3152880	3155880	There are all these conditions.
3155880	3166880	You see the support the monastic being able to do creative work artistic work and perhaps as you say a deeper pure way.
3166880	3184880	And it sounds like what you're describing is is we need to find ways to create conditions for those who are not monastics but still have that same desire to be supported to to be kind of anchored to that deeper pure.
3184880	3202880	They kind of to use the you know the term that mindfulness sati means remembering to remember that their deeper aspiration rather than yeah it being caught by the again to use Buddhist caught by the marketplace.
3202880	3203880	Exactly.
3203880	3213880	And sometimes it's enough just to be reminded or just to be in a community of people who kind of agree that yeah, this is the more important thing.
3214880	3215880	Yeah.
3215880	3232880	And it's what I've seen in artists is that there's a kind of a release of a very deeply held tension when they feel safe to make art in that way again they're kind of like, it's a relief.
3232880	3235880	It's a profound relief to say, oh, wow.
3235880	3237880	Okay, I can do that.
3237880	3238880	I'm allowed to do that.
3238880	3240880	Yes, you are.
3241880	3244880	You know, it's like the joy of the amateur musician.
3244880	3251880	Amateur musicians have a huge advantage because they can do it amateur you for love, you know, the meaning of the word.
3251880	3253880	Yeah.
3253880	3255880	That's what all music should be.
3255880	3257880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3257880	3276880	So Fab that I wanted to I'm conscious of our time and I really wanted to explore a topic with you that we exchange and tweets about I think about a year ago actually looked up in advance of a conversation and it's to do with them.
3276880	3283880	I think we're in a time where many people care deeply about the world, you know.
3283880	3294880	And they have deep respect for the various wisdom traditions of the world, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam.
3294880	3312880	And but many people may struggle with the ontological claims, you know, but they still want to be in some way devoted.
3312880	3320880	And I want I use that that term quite precisely, you know, they saw I think people want to live with the life of devotion.
3320880	3323880	But it's maybe not not not in it.
3323880	3331880	It's a devotion to maybe life itself to what to what feels beautiful to what feels meaningful to them.
3331880	3337880	These are a lot of times these people are described as as spiritual but not religious.
3337880	3346880	And I'm I want to in one of these this tweet that caught my eye from you because you said something about what we need is this ontological openness.
3346880	3357880	And it strikes me that Zen is is I think all of the world's wisdom traditions have this kind of quality of them when you get into the mysticism.
3357880	3372880	Yeah, but Zen seems to be particularly well developed as a kind of almost explicitly being like, yeah, you know, we see when you think you've grasped the final truth.
3372880	3376880	You know, take that hand yourself a slap and go back and set again, you know.
3376880	3383880	And so I'm curious like what one if you could say a little bit about what you mean by ontological openness.
3383880	3403880	And then and if you can then after that maybe you could say a little bit about how you practice a kind of you devoted to a path of practice when there's a deep epistemic humility about what is the nature of life and the nature of existence and the nature of being.
3403880	3407880	And when you don't really know how do you continue to practice with devotion.
3407880	3410880	So that's a long question but I good one.
3410880	3412880	I like it.
3412880	3422880	It's one that's close to my heart and one that I've struggled with over the years because I went into the monastic life.
3422880	3429880	Really quite confused in a sense like I knew, like I said before I knew the kinds of things I didn't want.
3429880	3442880	And I knew that plum village was a place where maybe I wouldn't, you know, I would be free from those aspects of, you know, having to be competitive individualistic and so on.
3442880	3451880	And maybe I would even be trained to release those habits of company, you know, being competitive and individualistic in myself.
3451880	3455880	That's still work in progress.
3455880	3464880	At the same time, I was very confused about what about the role and the status of religion for me.
3464880	3471880	I was quite, I was and perhaps still am quite anti religious in quite important ways.
3471880	3480880	This is a bit odd to say as a monastic of 16 years.
3480880	3499880	But I think that's at the heart of your question. So it was quite, it was quite meaningful for me and also confusing when tie my teacher, you know, as part of becoming a monk in plum village you get a name and your teacher gives you a name, which is sort of the result of their insight into you and into your
3499880	3505880	being and, you know, you're the particularity of you.
3505880	3524880	And so I, in the, you know, at the end of the ceremony, I get this name and he says brother fat blend and I don't understand because he's in Vietnamese and then he translates it and he says an English true Dhammic spirituality so Dhamma is the path that's the way that's the teaching and we all it's
3524880	3536880	we all get all the monks get true Dhammic something or true something of the Dhammas who Dhamma something it's always true and Dhamma and then the last part is, you know, the specific.
3536880	3551880	So for me it's spirituality, which was a very interesting name to receive. And I received it almost physically I really felt it as as like a.
3551880	3571880	It was like a, it was like a structure like a three dimensional something like a wave form that just entered into my being and began to heal I could feel it knitting together this deep wound that I didn't even know I had until the moment it started to heal.
3571880	3589880	I didn't know that I had this gash in my being that I now see as being the corrosive action of scientific materialism basically of a kind of skeptical outlook.
3589880	3614880	And, and the use the overuse and the overreliance of rationality in a domain where it's not applicable, which is the realm of the mystery of the divine of spirituality so I was trying to assess spiritual truths with rational means, which are completely inappropriate to the task, but I
3614880	3635880	didn't know that. So I was doing my best to, you know, to skeptically and rationally decide, is there just matter, right, just bits of stuff, meaninglessly bouncing off each other and, you know, kind of like just some giant universal clockwork meaningless pointless soulless indifferent.
3636880	3650880	And we, and we would be part of that we would also be mechanisms within that view this is sort of, I mean, I'm sure this audience is very familiar with this from in McGillchrist's wonderful work but for me it was really the result of reading.
3650880	3663880	Richard Dawkins aged 14, kind of, and at the time not being able to argue against it so then taking it on because I just out of sort of an attempt at intellectual rigor and honesty I was like well, I can't.
3664880	3676880	I don't have the means to disprove it so I have to then apply it to myself and to my life, but that's a very, very painful thing to do age 14 I was telling myself.
3676880	3691880	I am just a biological machine. I am a mechanism whose sole purpose it doesn't it doesn't even have a purpose it just accidentally is structured in a way that seeks to maximize its chances of of reproduction.
3692880	3704880	And everything else is is actually just a sort of higher level abstraction of that fundamental thing so kindness altruism generosity love. None of those things are real. They're all fake.
3704880	3717880	They're fake in me. When I feel kind. I'm not being kind. I'm just trying to seek, you know, sexual status, basically, in some very distantly abstracted way.
3717880	3725880	That's what I told myself and it's so brutal. It's so painful as a way to live as a thing to believe to believe that that's what we are.
3725880	3730880	So there I am and I get this name and I suddenly realize like.
3730880	3742880	Okay, this person that I trust possibly more than myself type is saying a spirituality is something real.
3742880	3759880	Be you can somehow have something to do with it. You can live it be it manifest it become it maybe you have to learn and live into it but it's there as a potential in you.
3759880	3765880	And his trust in giving me that name started this deep process of healing for me.
3766880	3769880	Which is ongoing.
3769880	3776880	And so I'm trying to come back to your question, which was just help me.
3776880	3780880	It was to do with ontological openness.
3780880	3781880	Yes, yes.
3781880	3790880	Okay, that kind of epistemic humility and still being devoted to a spiritual path right without that kind of conviction or certainty about how things are.
3790880	3805880	Okay, so this is this is and was still but it was more difficult for me then, but I was sort of coming it's like, okay, I'm going to do this thing I'm going to become a monastic but I'm very very skeptical and kind of not sure about this whole business
3805880	3817880	whole religion thing and I'm going to become religious a religious person I'm going to am I now Buddhist what you know what does it mean I have to believe certain things and I really had big problems with this.
3817880	3823880	I had a teacher that I have to be a Buddhist to become a monk.
3823880	3828880	And in typical Thai style he just grinned.
3828880	3833880	So, okay, I'm good, I can do this.
3833880	3843880	And I felt like my trust started to condense around certain things.
3843880	3861880	Because of we have this this, you know, 14 bodies out for precepts the first of which is is this fundamental kind of what I would call it the lion's roar, which is this commitment to openness, and and a basically and a refusal of ideology or dogma in any form, even
3861880	3864880	Buddhist ones.
3864880	3885880	When I read that as like, wow, okay, there is a religion, there is a spiritual practice, which encodes at its heart and puts it in number one, you know, of its principles are refusal to be bound by or committed to any form of dogmatic belief or ideology.
3885880	3888880	I was like, that is cool.
3888880	3891880	That's the kind of ground that I can stand on.
3891880	3902880	Right, if that's the resting place they're kind of like, I refuse to be bound by any doctrine or ideology.
3902880	3912880	Then that's the kind of ground that I can stand on so it's basically like built in this profound anti dogmatic stance.
3912880	3923880	I mean, it's also an understanding of the limitations of language, because what it's saying is, we know that whatever we say, in some profound sense is wrong.
3923880	3935880	Because it's not because it's the map it's not the territory, right language is is a beautiful wonderful thing, but it's not reality it's not experience.
3935880	3949880	What we have to say about the nature of experience in language is by definition wrong. It's not, you know, it's like this, somebody said, all maps are all models are wrong, some are useful.
3949880	3960880	Right, so it doesn't mean that we can't use language but we have to be very, very, very careful about what credence we put in it how we handle it.
3960880	3971880	It's like a knife it can cut you. If you use it skillfully it's helpful. But if you, you know, you, you know, you don't know how to handle it, you're going to get in a big mess.
3971880	3989880	And that for me is, I don't want to make any two sweeping statement but I for me I think a lot of the harm that has been done by organized religion throughout our various variegated histories and very different cultures.
3989880	4002880	And around this, the thing that happens when language takes over and solidifies and and then we make demands on people you say no you now have to believe this, and you have to agree with this creed.
4002880	4015880	You have to, you know, you have to kind of certified like I believe in this. It's the thing that I had the energy to in school, you know, and they say I believe in that and you have to recite the creed and I'd be like, but I don't.
4015880	4019880	Why do I have to say it this is madness.
4019880	4031880	And it's, it's not faithful to the roots of Christianity even, you know, it's, it's, it's something's a later accretion, I would say, but maybe I'm not so qualified to talk about that.
4031880	4041880	But I think what I can have faith in is not a set of beliefs, but a set of practices.
4041880	4054880	Okay, because the practices are means that are offered to us to help us to disentangle ourselves from our hidden assumptions and views and beliefs.
4054880	4070880	So they're, they're basically heuristics, they're not treated as holy or absolute truths, right they're treated as temporary, changeable, upgradable work in progress it's like well we found that by paying attention to your breath.
4070880	4089880	And what happens, which is that you, you start to, you know, the mind can settle, we can move from the verbal sort of narrating experience into a more direct felt sense, you know, experience of life and then we can move into the direct felt sense of the
4089880	4108880	boiling world of emotions and then we can move into the direct perception of the, you know, at the speed of thought in the present moment without being swept up in those thoughts and then we can kind of observe the process and the arising of, of the subject
4108880	4113880	of consciousness coming together in every moment, we can observe that directly.
4113880	4117880	And that all starts by just like paying attention to your breath in your body.
4117880	4119880	This is a method, it's a praxis.
4119880	4121880	Right, it's not a, it's not a belief system.
4121880	4122880	You see what I mean.
4122880	4123880	Yeah.
4123880	4125880	But I can have faith in that.
4125880	4127880	Why, because I can verify it for myself.
4127880	4128880	Yeah.
4128880	4129880	I can do it.
4129880	4134880	And I've done it thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
4134880	4136880	And it continues to bear fruit.
4137880	4140880	So that is something I can absolutely have faith in.
4140880	4146880	And the experience is the verification, the direct knowing.
4146880	4147880	Only that.
4147880	4148880	Yep.
4148880	4149880	Yep.
4149880	4158880	And, and what I love is a practice and a community life, like you could call it like John Bovick, he calls it an ecology of practice.
4158880	4159880	I really like that phrase.
4159880	4160880	Yeah.
4161880	4181880	Where you can start to see that every aspect of that community life is articulated is, is, is sort of set up to facilitate that freedom from views, dogmas and beliefs, and that, and that constant reminder to come back and verify for yourself.
4181880	4186880	I mean, kind of what, you know, what I call the laboratory of your own present moment experience.
4186880	4191880	You can do lots of experiments and you can test and see, like, is this true?
4191880	4192880	Yeah.
4192880	4193880	Does this work?
4193880	4194880	Is it still true?
4194880	4195880	Do I need to change it?
4195880	4200880	Like, yeah, those experiments are very fun and you can get a lot.
4200880	4207880	And I'm conscious, I'm conscious of our time and I want to hand it over to the audience for questions.
4207880	4215880	But I just, just, maybe throw one last question at you, Fablin, just to, just to bring us to, to a close.
4215880	4225880	And also just to let people know why I've wandered into this area of, of, of metaphysics or ontology.
4225880	4230880	Because one of the things that I'm curious about is, is anti-ontology.
4230880	4231880	Anti-ontology.
4231880	4232880	Yeah.
4232880	4234880	There's this, the.
4234880	4236880	Unontology.
4236880	4237880	Yeah.
4237880	4238880	Unontology.
4238880	4239880	That's a mouthful.
4239880	4247880	There seems to be a kind of a need for cultural renewal, you know, and, and affording opportunities
4247880	4248880	for people to come together.
4248880	4254880	One of the things that Greg Thomas and I spoke about last time was the African-American musical
4254880	4261880	heritage and the, the social rituals and practices that the, that, that, that really were life
4261880	4264880	sustaining for that community for a century, you know.
4264880	4267880	And listening to the conversation, it was really beautiful.
4267880	4268880	Yeah.
4268880	4269880	Yeah.
4269880	4277880	And, and so, but we're in this time where, where, where we don't have a kind of ontological
4277880	4280880	consensus in our society, you know.
4280880	4287880	So, so the reason I'm curious is, is can we, can we create these forms of communitas and
4287880	4292880	maybe music is one of the most powerful vehicles to do that in a way that is ontologically
4292880	4293880	open.
4293880	4294880	In a nontological way.
4294880	4295880	Yeah.
4295880	4296880	I love that.
4296880	4297880	Nontology.
4297880	4301880	See, I just want to ask you that question.
4301880	4302880	I'll credit it.
4302880	4303880	It's a great one.
4303880	4305880	Do you think we, do you think we can do that?
4305880	4309880	And, and, and how do you think, how do you think we might be able to do that, you know,
4309880	4314880	as someone who, who is kind of, has so many experiences of communitas at Plum Village, could
4314880	4322880	you see that moving into society in a more, without being tethered to an ancient 2000
4322880	4326880	or 2000 and a half, two and a half thousand year old wisdom tradition?
4326880	4328880	Okay.
4328880	4334880	So yes, because we are, that is what we're doing right now in a sense.
4334880	4337880	I think we're engaged in that business.
4337880	4340880	And it's happening, I think in lots of ways.
4340880	4341880	Yes.
4341880	4347880	Also because I think there are ways to engage with these wisdom traditions that are, that
4347880	4351880	are safe in a sense from dogma, like I described.
4351880	4355880	But for me, I feel safe to engage, to be rooted in a tradition because I think tradition,
4355880	4358880	like we can't dismiss tradition, right?
4358880	4360880	We can't throw it out of the window.
4360880	4361880	100%.
4361880	4362880	100%.
4362880	4363880	Yeah.
4363880	4366880	We actually, I think right now part of the danger is kind of spiritual window shopping
4366880	4372880	or another manifestation of that is just the capitalist appropriation of even something
4372880	4379880	like mindfulness and some, you know, the sort of the most beautiful, sacred, you know,
4379880	4386880	products of human culture are now getting commodified, productified and sold back to
4386880	4391880	us in almost unrecognizable form where they are completely separated from the ethical
4391880	4394880	roots, completely separate.
4394880	4398880	And so we're in a very sticky situation.
4398880	4407880	So what I propose is this kind of this narrow path where we can, we can receive the insights
4407880	4422880	of tradition as, as praxis, not as dogma or, you know, kind of a belief system.
4422880	4431880	So what you have is a sort of like an unbelief system or a kind of like belief verification
4431880	4436880	system or like what I would say that my, I've been thinking about this a lot recently and
4436880	4441880	this is to do with the book that I'm working on, which is so it's a one possible framing
4441880	4446880	of Buddhism for me because people have said, oh, maybe Buddhism is like science or is, you
4446880	4454880	know, science, no, no, I think if anything, Buddhism is a set of skills or methods which
4454880	4459880	involve also training at a teacher-student relationship, right?
4459880	4463880	So it's not just you'd learn it in a book or from a YouTube video that there is something
4463880	4467880	mysterious that arises in community practice.
4467880	4472880	There is something mysterious and deep that is beyond words that is transmitted by a teacher
4472880	4474880	to their disciple, right?
4474880	4479880	And so this is also a little bit antithetical to our Western sensibilities of I'm just going
4479880	4484880	to do my own and don't tell me and, you know, I'm kind of like, we're a little bit skeptical
4484880	4490880	about teacher-student relationships because of the way that they've been abused and how,
4490880	4492880	you know, power dynamics have come into them.
4492880	4500880	So there's, you know, it's not easy to navigate, but I do think it's possible to receive these
4500880	4509880	traditions, to learn from them as a way to take off the glasses that we're wearing without
4509880	4514880	knowing which are our views, our world views, right?
4514880	4520880	It's like we are, we have a view on the nature of reality, on the nature of our self, on the
4520880	4523880	nature of human beings and what it all means.
4523880	4528880	And then we get to have a practice that goes, oh, look, look at that, that's interesting.
4528880	4530880	Here's a view.
4530880	4534880	And then you can either, you know, you can give them, you can clean the glasses, you can put the
4534880	4538880	back on, or you can put on a different pair of glasses, you can change them, you can wear
4538880	4541880	sunglasses, you know, it's like, or you can wear no glasses.
4541880	4543880	Very hard, but possible.
4543880	4546880	I have a point of disagreement within McGorchrist on this one.
4546880	4556880	So, yeah, I think in that sense it's possible to engage with tradition.
4557880	4564880	As to your question about whether it's possible to create spaces of, I don't know exactly how you
4564880	4566880	put it, but it's kind of like spaces of healing.
4566880	4568880	Munitas, I would say.
4568880	4576880	Yeah, and maybe music and celebration without feeling that you have to now become a member
4576880	4581880	of something or, you know, have a certain allegiance to any particular tradition.
4581880	4586880	I would say in Plum Village, the vast majority of people who come to our retreats don't
4586880	4588880	consider themselves Buddhist.
4588880	4590880	They're never asked to convert to anything.
4590880	4593880	They're never told that they have to now be Buddhist.
4593880	4598880	In fact, what we generally do is encourage people to go to strengthen their roots in whatever tradition
4598880	4605880	they come from, whether that's Christian, Muslim, Judaism, whatever it might be.
4605880	4612880	We're like, there's beauty and depth in your roots, and you also have to take care of them.
4612880	4619880	And if these practices can support you in that process, in freeing up and healing your own
4619880	4624880	relationship with your own tradition, then that's our greatest happiness.
4624880	4630880	So we're never, like, we're not interested in converting people.
4630880	4636880	And I think we can create these spaces where practices are offered, and they're offered freely.
4636880	4639880	Like, it's not kind of like, you now have to do this.
4639880	4645880	It's like, well, if you've chosen to come to Plum Village, then presumably there's an intention to experiment with this.
4645880	4648880	So there has to be a general willingness to have a go.
4648880	4653880	But it's not very forceful or authoritarian, as it were.
4653880	4654880	It's just like, try it.
4654880	4658880	If you like it, carry on and apply it.
4658880	4662880	Be inventive, be creative.
4662880	4664880	Wonderful.
4664880	4666880	Okay.
4666880	4671880	Well, I think this is a good time to open to some questions from everyone.
4671880	4679880	What I'm going to do is, but then I'm going to remove the spotlights that are on us.
4679880	4681880	And then hopefully we'll see everyone.
4681880	4682880	Yeah.
4682880	4691880	And then if you'd like to ask a question, if you could just raise your hand, if you can do that electronically, that would be, that would be best.
4691880	4695880	So you can go to the reaction function.
4695880	4701880	They're in the bottom of the toolbar and then click raise hand.
4701880	4708880	And then, yeah, you should be able to ask a question.
4708880	4717880	See, there's lots of wonderful comments here that haven't had a chance to read.
4717880	4720880	What was the point of disagreement within McGillchrist?
4720880	4722880	Well, it's not really a disagreement.
4722880	4729880	I think he, he said something slightly offhand about not believing that it's possible to have no view.
4729880	4741880	So what the highest view, what's considered right view in sort of traditional Buddhist thinking is sometimes referred to as the absence of views.
4741880	4749880	And I think he may have taken that a little bit, not in the sense that it's intended to say, well, it's not possible to not have a view.
4749880	4757880	You always have a view because you're embodied and, you know, so as a human being, yes, you are seeing from somewhere.
4757880	4774880	But what I think, as I understand it, it's, it's meant to mean the freedom from a set of metaphysical prejudices, basically, of any kind.
4774880	4779880	And that's at the conscious level, but also at a very deep unconscious level.
4779880	4798880	So it's basically also a freedom from language and a freedom of the kind of narration from the narration of experience through the means of language because language in itself encodes certain views about the nature of reality just because of the ways the structures of grammar,
4798880	4805880	for example, the word the verb to be implies that things either are or they are not.
4805880	4812880	Right, but that's, that's a view about the nature of reality, which from a Buddhist point of view is is very misleading.
4812880	4814880	And it's actually the root of a lot of suffering.
4814880	4818880	Like if we think that things exist, then we reify them, we solidify them.
4818880	4834880	So, so the freeing from views is this idea of like, if we could somehow get to the roots of how these ideas, how language has conditioned perception, we can, we can uproot that and get back to a kind of direct perception,
4834880	4838880	in which there is no reification, and we're free.
4838880	4851880	And that's what's considered the view of no views of no view but it doesn't mean that you don't you still see the mountain right you still see the river but you just don't reify it in the same way.
4851880	4858880	So I think if we had a chance to talk about it more I don't think we disagree at all.
4858880	4862880	There's enlightenment direct perception from the right hemisphere.
4862880	4865880	Maybe.
4865880	4867880	I don't know.
4867880	4873880	We don't talk about it much for obvious reasons.
4873880	4875880	Why don't we talk about it.
4875880	4879880	Because then we make mistakes.
4879880	4884880	Because language.
4884880	4893880	It's great to ask a question. We, and it's great to have questions coming in the chat but it's also really nice to get people's voices in the space.
4893880	4899880	So, Jonathan, I think Jonathan has a question.
4899880	4902880	It was a great question in the, in the.
4902880	4904880	Hi there, can you hear me okay.
4904880	4905880	Yes.
4905880	4906880	Thank you.
4906880	4925880	So thanks for the wonderful, really wonderful event and talk and thanks for joining us and being here today. I, I guess I wanted to just query you on the spirit, rather than the letter of what you said vis a vis the your own history and your own sense that you could
4925880	4929880	commit to something that was a kind of.
4929880	4932880	Nontology, as the term was coined.
4932880	4953880	And I guess I was just curious about how that works when one faces resistance, or one faces struggle because I think those who studied spiritual practice and alternative spiritualities outside of religious context, often find the problem arises when precisely when you reach
4953880	4956880	some kind of limit or obstacle.
4956880	4968880	And you find that you're obliged to actually, you know, seek out a teacher or seek out someone who's been there before. And that's precisely what you get within a tradition.
4968880	4972880	And the binding quality of that tradition is often something more.
4972880	4981880	If not doctrine then Dharma, you know, at least there's some kind of shared commitment to something that isn't just a practice.
4981880	4990880	And I wondered how you contend with the idea that, you know, try it, you might like it or try it might work.
4990880	5008880	How, how, how far that can take you and whether it risks collapsing into a and do what works for you and you only, and therefore ends up shoring up problems of narcissism and, and kind of spiritual materialism, rather than actually leading to something like transformation.
5008880	5012880	This is a great question and it's, thank you.
5012880	5031880	It's one that's also close to my heart, because now, you know, as a slightly more senior monastic, I'm involved in monastic training. So I have to, you know, we receive young men in their 20s, who have probably done quite a lot of spiritual window shopping, and who very much want to come and
5031880	5035880	sort of try it but without committing much to anything.
5035880	5052880	And it's a huge problem, because so the subtlety for me is this, that when I say, you know, for example, I received this, that there's a sutra called the Anapanasati Sutra, 16 exercises of the full awareness of breathing.
5052880	5061880	So there's this thing that the Buddha said, maybe the Buddha said, but anyways recorded as the Buddha said this, which involves 16 exercises.
5061880	5064880	They're very specific, they're very detailed.
5064880	5071880	And the invitation is to try it. Right. So obviously,
5071880	5079880	there's, then there's the question of the way, the how, which is a kind of hemisphere question as well, because I could try it in a kind of like a very uncommitted way.
5079880	5082880	I could try it in a way that has no love in it.
5082880	5089880	I could try it in a, in a sort of selfish, narcissistic way. It's not going to work.
5089880	5101880	Right. So the try I'm talking about involves a kind of surrender already. There has to be some stance of spirituality, which often depends on the relationship with the teacher.
5101880	5117880	So there has to be a relationship of trust. It can also be with a community where you see like, I accept that I don't know, and that I may not be the best judge, actually, of what is reliable and what is unreliable.
5117880	5130880	Even to some extent in my own experience, because I may be so caught up in narcissistic fallacies that I don't even know what's happening in myself.
5130880	5143880	So I need to trust that there are kind people around me who have enough insight and presence that they can kind of maybe at the beginning see into me a little more clearly than I can see into myself.
5143880	5147880	And they will help me and they will guide me.
5147880	5154880	And when they ask me to do something when they invite me to do something like say, bring my attention to my breath.
5154880	5164880	I have to be very, very attentive to the, not only the explicit instruction, but the implicit instruction, the way.
5164880	5173880	So when they say it, there's obviously the sort of syntactic content of what they're saying, but there's also the tone of speech.
5173880	5193880	There's the cadence of speech, there's their energy, whatever you want, you know, whatever that means, their being, their vibration, somehow they're also communicating to me a way of being with my breath, which can't be written down.
5193880	5214880	And I have to be, I have to surrender a lot of my hostility, you know, a lot of my reactivity, a lot of my arrogance, just to start to open up to the possibility of I really don't know and I'm ready to be taught.
5214880	5218880	That's the stance, it's like, I am trainable.
5218880	5231880	I'm sufficiently open that I know I've kind of developed a little bit of a version, you know, not a version, but it's kind of skepticism about the reliability of my own assessment of things.
5231880	5244880	So I then take refuge in a teacher or in a community who has more experience on the path and may then and that depth of experience transcends lifetimes because it's that teachers, teachers, teachers, teachers and they're going back.
5244880	5251880	So it's a very, very deep kind of experience that I'm talking about, which is then the sort of what is being transmitted.
5251880	5262880	And then when I sit down on my cushion and I try to follow my breath, I may conclude after one session, oh, well, this doesn't really work, or this is not applicable to me, or my personal trauma is different.
5262880	5264880	I need more of this, a little bit of that.
5264880	5273880	And this is, you know, we get this reaction and all the time you say, well, I know that's great, but you know, I need something more specific, you know, I want to do my own thing.
5273880	5275880	And we have to be quite firm.
5275880	5280880	And what we say is, okay, so you say you tried.
5280880	5283880	But I don't actually believe you.
5283880	5285880	You need to try again.
5285880	5290880	And, and again, and again, and there's the discipline element, you need to do it enough.
5290880	5309880	And you need to do it kind of like, honestly enough, and with with enough of the right attitude, the sort of spiritual surrender to say, Yeah, I have wholeheartedly engaged with this practice with a little bit of faith.
5309880	5325880	I have a little bit of faith thrown in, right, because for me to sit there on the cushion and say, Okay, so all I'm going to do is bring my attention to my in breath and to my out breath and every time my mind wanders, I'm going to bring my attention back.
5325880	5328880	And I, and it's supposed to do something.
5328880	5338880	But fundamentally, I don't know why I don't know how I don't know the mechanism I can't understand the mechanism of why that would do anything I can you know have some theories but they're basically useless.
5338880	5343880	And, and if it doesn't work.
5343880	5360880	It's probably because I didn't do it right. So it's kind of like my, I have to, you know, I have to suspend my disbelief in my own inability to do in my own ability to do it and more like, Well, if the Buddha said it works, and all of his disciples say it worked and my teachers as it works.
5360880	5364880	It probably does work.
5364880	5378880	And I kind of have to step into the void, I have to take a leap of faith at some level I have to actually, because it's part of the working of it, and it does work is when I believe that it's going to work.
5378880	5390880	And it's a bit weird, and it can sound a little bit, you know, and then you're, you know, getting into some sticky territory for us, very rational Westerners who have grown up on skepticism.
5390880	5407880	So it is hard, you know, but then faith is a necessary component and discipline and rigor, and can it sort of community checks and balances and spiritual narcissism is an absolute reality that we constantly have to be alert to.
5407880	5412880	Thank you.
5412880	5416880	I realized I muted there. Thanks for the question, Jonathan. Thanks for your response.
5416880	5425880	I think we're just coming to a time but I see that Kelly's raised her hand so if we can keep it short Kelly I think it'd be great if we could just get one more.
5425880	5427880	Go for it.
5427880	5431880	Thanks so much for this inspiring conversation today.
5431880	5441880	I'm a professional musician and I am in the on the threshold of a transition where I'm feeling called to do music as an active service.
5441880	5461880	And I'm wondering if you have like an idea or something to be taken into consideration, as I'm working with and collaborating with other artists to define what that can look like like in the pedestrian sense like how do you know how do we set up the setting to create the conditions for the
5461880	5465880	mindset to have this transcendent communal.
5465880	5469880	Excellent.
5469880	5473880	Excellent question. Thank you. A very practical one too.
5473880	5480880	I have some I would say some direct experience of this in a couple of different settings so I try to be brief.
5480880	5490880	So, as part of my monastic life in very early on, because I was a musician everybody assumed that I could sing. This was not the case.
5490880	5501880	If you know anything about classical the world of classical music if you're if you're instrumentalists like singers are kind of, I don't know, there's somewhere over there but you don't mainly don't talk to them, and they don't talk to you.
5501880	5509880	And you certainly don't sing, which is a stupid and awful thing because it's like, as a musician.
5509880	5514880	I don't know, I think we should all be encouraged to sing. Anyway, that's another point.
5514880	5529880	Everybody assumed that I could sing so they would, you know, at the beginning of the sitting meditation and be like, oh, if I play and go and chant and do you know do the we have a morning chant before the sitting meditation in the morning and the evening.
5529880	5542880	And of course, I can hit the right notes I can read the music you know I can do that but I never I don't feel comfortable singing. And in fact I feel a lot of shame and confusion.
5542880	5546880	Are we connected. Yeah, I think we're back. I think we're back.
5546880	5551880	We lost you just when you were talking about feeling shame. Yeah, in the morning.
5551880	5560880	Right, so I would then I started noticing because then okay so apply mindfulness notice what's happening. Okay, I am treating this as a performance.
5560880	5569880	I'm treating this as basically me being the best. I have to chant it better than anybody else have to do it really well.
5569880	5577880	And, and I'm sort of expecting some praise afterwards I'm kind of like or at least I'm, you know, I'm kind of waiting for it like somebody's oh that was that was a really good morning chant.
5577880	5585880	Okay, I want to know how that's that's just unconsciously how I'm treating it also I've now noticed that well.
5585880	5592880	Okay, so this whole thing is making me quite tense and it's the whole thing is quite unpleasant so let me just reframe this whole experience.
5592880	5596880	What's happening here is I have a room of 150 people.
5596880	5604880	They could not care less about me right now and my child.
5604880	5608880	They're just waking up it's like 630 and six in the morning.
5608880	5611880	They're just trying to have a nice sitting meditation.
5611880	5613880	They're just hoping not to fall asleep.
5613880	5619880	You know, maybe hoping to have a little insight or to feel comfortable or to feel well.
5619880	5624880	So I am in service to that or I could be.
5624880	5629880	Let me put myself I, I'm not important.
5629880	5633880	What's important here is all of these people.
5633880	5643880	What do they want. What do they need. How can I support them I am here as their servant really like to just.
5643880	5646880	So then my love comes up.
5646880	5649880	You see, then I'm like, it's like my mother seed.
5649880	5651880	I just like, I just want to love them.
5651880	5654880	I'm like, oh, wow, yeah, it's tough.
5654880	5657880	You know, maybe you're not used to sitting meditation.
5657880	5659880	Maybe you get distracted.
5659880	5669880	Maybe you fall asleep like my wish for you is to have the most wonderful, peaceful, insightful sitting meditation you've ever had in your life.
5669880	5673880	That's now all I'm thinking about for these 150 people.
5673880	5676880	I'm just, it's like a prayer.
5676880	5686880	So it's really like, talk about setting an intention, but it's literally like I would join my palms and be sitting there in the dark at the sitting at the bell.
5686880	5688880	It's not a performance. Nobody can see me.
5688880	5691880	I'm just like creating this intention.
5691880	5699880	What I wish is for you, all of you to have a wonderful, peaceful sitting meditation.
5699880	5701880	And I only think about that.
5701880	5706880	And then I start inviting the bell and I start chanting and it all comes naturally and it's all very fluid.
5706880	5715880	I'm not worried about it because I maintain my concentration throughout the whole chart on these people's experience, not mine.
5715880	5725880	And I found every single time I managed to remember that to reframe what's even happening, who it's about, what it's for.
5725880	5727880	Everything works better.
5727880	5736880	And recently we had a chance to work with a wonderful producer in Plum Village and we didn't really know what was going to happen.
5736880	5740880	But part of the idea was that maybe we're going to record an album.
5740880	5748880	But right at the beginning, some of us got together and because I had this experience, I was really keen and it turned out everybody was.
5748880	5751880	Everybody was quite aligned on this to set an intention.
5751880	5755880	So we kind of invented a little ceremony.
5755880	5764880	And, you know, we have some ceremonies in Plum Village and I kind of looked at one in the chanting book and there was one about like blessing a space.
5764880	5774880	Where there's a purification of the water ceremony and then you sort of spread water around the room and you and you call on the support of the ancestors and there's a whole thing there's a chance and it's.
5774880	5780880	So I just thought, well, we are blessing a space we're blessing this recording studio.
5780880	5796880	And we're blessing each other and we're we're all going to and I created within the context of that little ceremony opportunity for everybody to share their intention, like what was important for them in this project.
5796880	5809880	And we, and it was very beautiful what everybody said, like, you know, I think some of the things I've said today are a little bit related it's more like for me it was the importance of being able to record and make and create right and sing
5809880	5824880	and perform music for love and to to to kind of touch an experience of love and maybe even healing in others and just to feel like okay we're sending it out into the world only for that.
5824880	5829880	And then the others shared different things but all quite, you know, very aligned actually.
5829880	5846880	And I must say that for the next three weeks of this project, I felt we were protected by this vow by this intention it's it's really it's a ceremony, which is again doesn't come easily for me.
5846880	5860880	It was very, very profound it really really and I felt like about halfway through some of us noticed he was starting to lose it and there was a little bit of tension coming into the group a little bit of disgruntlement and competition and weird energies.
5860880	5872880	So we're like, Oh, okay, we need to, you know, bring every because we brought now we started before and now there was like 12 people so it was like, Oh, they didn't all do the ceremony we should do another ceremony.
5872880	5881880	So we just did another ceremony and everyone was like, Oh, yeah, that's what this is about. That's what we're doing. And it provides this kind of protection.
5881880	5891880	Just knowing that we are actually aligned at this very, very deep level. We know what we care about we know what's important to us.
5891880	5896880	Yeah, so that's, I mean,
5896880	5904880	I think that's real. I think that's a very, very real thing and it maybe it's just like a stick of incense and then everybody shares an intention.
5904880	5920880	Maybe there's the song that you can sing together, maybe you can have a bell, you know, it's like you have to kind of just conjure it up, but there's probably bits and pieces of things, you know, other traditions and things that you can pull from to make it work.
5920880	5925880	So if you want, you know, there's a privilege.
5925880	5932880	We have a chanting book is called chanting from the heart, and there's a ceremony in there it's like dedication of the
5932880	5943880	of a new house or something. So that's the that's the structure we followed but I would recommend that you do something that's meaningful and sort of rooted for for you.
5943880	5946880	If that then thank you for the question Kelly.
