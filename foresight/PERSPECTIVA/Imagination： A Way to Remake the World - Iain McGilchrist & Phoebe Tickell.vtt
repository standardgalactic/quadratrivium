00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Thank you so much, Lee. I hope you can all hear me okay. You might be wondering why it

00:09.360 --> 00:16.480
looks like a horror movie here. I'm currently in Kerala, India, with my family, and there's

00:16.480 --> 00:23.320
been a power cut just a few minutes before coming online, which means weirdly the system

00:23.320 --> 00:28.320
preserves certain things like Wi-Fi but allows other things to die like lights. So I currently

00:28.400 --> 00:32.880
have my phone light beaming in on me, which is why you have this effect. So don't be scared.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.040
Do imagine the best and not the worst for me in this context. We are speaking about imagination

00:39.040 --> 00:45.360
today after all. And it's a great pleasure to invite, well, to welcome you all here first of all,

00:46.640 --> 00:51.920
and this is now the fourth in our series of talks with Ian about the

00:52.640 --> 00:59.920
the matter with things. I get confused with that because I wrote a book once

00:59.920 --> 01:05.040
myself called The Moves that Matter, and every so often the two books kind of flip in my head.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.640
This is about the matter with things, and it's the fourth in our series. And we are particularly

01:10.640 --> 01:16.480
interested tonight to speak about imagination. Our prior event was more about sanity, prior to that

01:16.480 --> 01:23.680
about value, and prior to that matters of Ian's work more generally. Tonight we've arranged the

01:23.680 --> 01:30.400
conversation with Phoebe Tekel, whom I'm very pleased to introduce to you all. Many of you will

01:30.400 --> 01:36.000
know her already. Phoebe is, I'll give the formal definition before the informal one, a biologist,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.840
systems thinker, and founder of moral imaginations. It's an organization driving a movement of

01:41.840 --> 01:48.000
imagination-powered activism, placing life back at the center of the economy, politics, and systems

01:48.000 --> 01:53.360
of governance. Phoebe works across multiple societal contexts, and has advised government,

01:53.360 --> 01:58.480
the education sector, and the food and farming sector. More recently she has worked with Camden

01:58.480 --> 02:03.920
Council to train council officers in the skills of collective imagination and horizontal leadership.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.120
Phoebe will speak a bit more about what all of that means, but I can say that I know her

02:09.120 --> 02:15.120
personally. I was also part of a sort of imagination practice that she did with a large

02:15.120 --> 02:20.560
group of people in Berlin a few years ago. So I have firsthand experience of how she evokes and

02:20.560 --> 02:26.800
elicits sort of imagination in large groups of people for the greater good, and it's a practice

02:26.800 --> 02:32.400
that's continuing to develop and be refined as we go. Phoebe is a scientist by background,

02:32.400 --> 02:39.600
like Ian, they have in common this kind of deep spirit of scientific inquiry leading you

02:39.600 --> 02:44.160
beyond science, which I think all the best scientists somehow on the one hand remain loyal

02:44.160 --> 02:49.520
to science and yet somehow move themselves beyond it as well, and I think they share that at the

02:49.520 --> 02:56.640
very least. I think the way I've seen this conversation in outline is that this is a chance for

02:57.200 --> 03:02.320
Ian who's fascinated by imagination and makes it one of his main pathways to truth

03:02.880 --> 03:09.680
in the matter of things, to speak with someone who's working very seriously and in a very dedicated

03:09.680 --> 03:15.600
way to bring imagination, to walk the talk of imagination in practice in civil society context,

03:16.160 --> 03:20.480
where we say we need greater imagination but don't always know how to go about doing it.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.680
Phoebe's actually taking it very seriously and trying to do that, and for Phoebe it's a chance

03:25.680 --> 03:32.560
to get a richer, more full theoretical take on what exactly imagination is and why,

03:32.560 --> 03:36.000
and I believe they're going to explore many things including moral imagination.

03:37.920 --> 03:43.200
So it's a great pleasure to let them speak to each other, and I can release you from the

03:43.200 --> 03:49.440
terror of this image of me with the light and the darkness. I hope to be back for the Q&A

03:49.440 --> 03:55.520
looking slightly more respectable, but until then I welcome the chance to introduce you to

03:55.520 --> 03:59.920
Phoebe Tekel and Ian McGilchrist, and I hope they'll have a great 50 or so minutes talking

03:59.920 --> 04:04.960
between them, and then we'll speak about how to do the Q&A once it starts then.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.160
Thank you all very much, and I'll see you a bit later. Bye.

04:11.920 --> 04:16.960
Ian, is it just me who thinks Jonathan should probably stick to that kind of

04:16.960 --> 04:23.520
intro in the dark with the light? I think it's a marvellous improvement.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.600
So often a negation proves to be extremely positive.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.280
I agree. What better introduction to a session on imagination?

04:36.160 --> 04:43.280
Indeed, indeed. So yeah, you carry on. No, no, I'd like you to fire away.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.240
Okay, so I mean, I wanted to just start by saying that it's not an exaggeration to say that it's a

04:50.240 --> 04:56.480
huge honour to have this conversation, and just to say a big thank you for your work

04:57.840 --> 05:04.640
on reading the master and his emissary, and also the two huge tones which I've got here on my desk,

05:04.640 --> 05:09.920
the two latest books. Massive. I've been using it as a laptop stand, but also really amazing,

05:10.800 --> 05:17.840
really incredible, but really grateful because as I have been reading your work,

05:17.840 --> 05:24.160
what I have been finding is that there is a resonance to the work that goes beyond just the

05:24.160 --> 05:30.560
content. There's a sort of grammar of meaning, and it kind of reminded me of the conversation

05:30.560 --> 05:35.760
you and Zach were having about how meaning and value are so inherent in the universe,

05:35.760 --> 05:43.040
and I really had this sense as I read your book that there is something resonating in your work

05:43.040 --> 05:50.000
that is much deeper than the left hemispheric kind of, oh, that's an interesting fact, and

05:50.000 --> 05:55.120
oh, that's a great quote, and that's a fantastic bit of research. There is something going on

05:56.240 --> 06:03.200
at a deeper level, which perhaps also has something to do with identity,

06:03.760 --> 06:08.640
because actually as a scientist, as somebody who started life in the sciences and felt

06:09.280 --> 06:18.880
profoundly dissatisfied by the scientific route to truth, and really felt that the

06:18.880 --> 06:25.680
sciences as a whole were just quite impoverished as a way to understand reality. As I'm reading

06:25.760 --> 06:34.000
your books, I'm feeling like you've done me and probably many others a huge favour to give us

06:34.000 --> 06:44.160
a stack of research and backing for what that feeling is, the feeling of this can't be all

06:44.160 --> 06:51.360
there is, there must be more, and I found my way from science, how long ago was it, about

06:51.920 --> 06:56.080
seven years ago I left the lab at Imperial College London, finally said, okay,

06:56.880 --> 07:01.600
I love science, but there's something more, and actually if we want to try and address what's

07:01.600 --> 07:06.560
wrong with the world, clearly science and technology don't have the answers, because we've been trying

07:06.560 --> 07:13.840
that route for the last 200 plus years, so there's something else, and I found my way to

07:13.840 --> 07:18.480
imagination, which is obviously the topic of what we're going to focus on today, and I found it

07:18.560 --> 07:26.080
profoundly encouraging that the final chapter of the first volume of the matter of things is

07:26.080 --> 07:33.120
imagination, it feels like you went on a similar path from questioning science as the only

07:33.120 --> 07:39.440
route, science and reason as the only route to truth, to questioning how are we unmaking the

07:39.440 --> 07:46.320
world through perception, through some kind of divorce from reality, because clearly there's

07:46.320 --> 07:51.520
something going on if we're so out of touch with reality, that we're creating the kind of

07:51.520 --> 07:57.600
destruction that we see today, and I'll stop in a second, but one of the other things I found

07:57.600 --> 08:03.920
profoundly satisfying was that you also came to the same conclusion, that imagination is not

08:04.560 --> 08:10.320
a faculty and a capacity that takes us away from the world, it's actually one that brings us

08:10.320 --> 08:15.200
closer to reality, and I feel like this is what I've been trying to say for the last kind of four

08:15.280 --> 08:20.720
or five years when I started the work with moral imagination, I was saying I think imagination

08:20.720 --> 08:27.600
can get us closer to what really matters and what is real, but I felt like I was sounding like a

08:27.600 --> 08:35.680
crazy person, so that's where I want to start, it's just a big thank you really, and I'm curious

08:35.680 --> 08:42.560
to hear any thoughts you've got in response to that. Oh that's a very kind introduction,

08:42.640 --> 08:47.600
and there were so many things in what you said that I would love to pick up on,

08:49.200 --> 08:56.080
I mean one that just comes to mind is the difficulty of articulating the really important

08:56.080 --> 09:03.760
things, and these are the things that don't therefore get adequate treatment into science

09:03.760 --> 09:11.840
and in the discourse of reason, both of which I honor hugely, as I believe you do too, but I don't

09:11.840 --> 09:18.160
accept that they are the only ways of reaching reality or even necessarily the most profound ones,

09:19.120 --> 09:24.080
but they make a very very valuable contribution, and I worry about the way in which sometimes

09:24.080 --> 09:32.800
nowadays people are too ready to disparage either science or reason, so yes, but essentially

09:33.440 --> 09:40.640
it's going to defeat language, because what we're talking about when we're thinking about

09:40.720 --> 09:52.000
imagination is a resonance between ourselves and another, and that other isn't necessarily

09:52.000 --> 10:01.120
well specified, but it's absolutely real, it may be the existence of a phenomenological world

10:01.120 --> 10:08.080
around us, it may be a realm in which the better ways to talk about ourselves are as

10:08.080 --> 10:17.360
embodied souls, but there is here something that language will always bring to the ground

10:17.360 --> 10:25.280
with a great flood, which is in no way does justice to what it is that we're talking about,

10:25.280 --> 10:30.720
so I do think that imagination is central, and that's why in a way I did work towards that at the

10:30.720 --> 10:37.440
end of part one and that section on epistemology, and you'll notice at the end of part two which is

10:37.520 --> 10:42.640
the metaphysics, I have a chapter on the sense of the sacred, which is also another thing you

10:43.840 --> 10:48.560
know from the very word go, it's going to defeat language, but we mustn't be put off by that,

10:48.560 --> 10:53.440
we must stick to our perceptions, and you can have perceptions and you can have insights

10:54.240 --> 10:58.800
without them necessarily having to be explicit in language, in fact all the best ones are not,

10:58.800 --> 11:06.400
which is why we have poetry, why we have music, why we have ritual, why we have narrative myths,

11:06.400 --> 11:13.280
all these things are able to put us in touch with things that importantly need to remain

11:13.280 --> 11:20.480
implicit unless they're going to be degraded by this the common coin of everyday language,

11:20.480 --> 11:25.680
which makes everything similar to something else that we already know, so what are we going to

11:25.680 --> 11:29.520
do about the realm where we're going to find things that we don't already know, because language

11:29.520 --> 11:34.320
only deals with the stuff that we do, unless it works against itself, and you may know that my

11:34.320 --> 11:44.000
first book was called Against Criticism, I wrote it in my 20s, and well anyway yes, I think it was,

11:44.720 --> 11:51.120
it sold about 400 copies and after that was unceremoniously remained, and Faber made a big

11:51.120 --> 12:02.480
loss on it, but the idea there was to argue there was something wrong with the way in which we

12:02.480 --> 12:09.760
conceived academic criticism, which was to take an entity that was living entirely imaginative,

12:10.720 --> 12:17.520
implicit, embodied, and utterly unique, and turn it into something every day that was

12:17.520 --> 12:23.440
general in nature, decontextualized, disembodied, and from which the the magic of imagination

12:23.440 --> 12:29.520
had disappeared, but there was another meaning to the title, which was that criticism could work

12:29.520 --> 12:35.920
if it worked against criticism, in other words, there is a kind of discourse which is aware of

12:35.920 --> 12:41.440
its own limitations and can incorporate them, there is a kind of science that can be aware

12:41.440 --> 12:47.760
of the limitations and therefore not become hubristic about what it can definitely state,

12:47.760 --> 12:53.440
and it's getting into that area where you've neither rubbish something nor said this is our

12:53.440 --> 12:58.160
saviour, this will give us all the story, there will never be the whole story, because I believe

12:58.160 --> 13:03.040
that whatever it is we're trying to contact is essentially infinite, and also of infinite

13:03.040 --> 13:08.880
importance, which gives us a bit of a thing to think about during our lifetime, because we

13:08.880 --> 13:16.640
have a short period in which to make use of this amazing gift, so that's what I'd say in the outset

13:16.640 --> 13:21.760
anyway, how would you, what would you think about that?

13:21.840 --> 13:30.880
Not there, so a metaphor, a couple of things, so the metaphor that I can't remember where it

13:30.880 --> 13:36.480
is in the book, but where you talk about the flat, maybe it's in a quote, the flashlight

13:36.480 --> 13:42.080
and the the fertile dark, biochemist who is talking about how, you know,

13:42.080 --> 13:48.320
Irwin Charakoff, yes, yes, and I loved that, so he was saying, you know, I think people think

13:48.320 --> 13:55.040
that science is about illuminating the darkness, but actually science needs this fertile darkness,

13:55.040 --> 14:00.560
and if you think that you're illuminating it, it's the kind of flashlight in the void, you know,

14:00.560 --> 14:08.800
in the dark, starry skies and, you know, kind of incredible, mystical, ineffable universe,

14:08.800 --> 14:12.880
and you've got this flashlight and you're saying, well, we found it, it's this room here that we

14:12.880 --> 14:19.360
can see, and I thought that was such a good, such a great metaphor for what we, you know,

14:19.360 --> 14:24.640
what the situation we're in, and then it also made me think about, obviously as an imagination,

14:25.520 --> 14:34.320
activist, you know, person, you know, obsessive, I've read quite a lot of Blake, William Blake.

14:34.400 --> 14:43.120
Ah, wonderful, yes. You know, his work is huge, hugely, not just inspirational, but like your

14:43.120 --> 14:49.360
work, the kind of work where I read his work and I think, ah, like, yes, this is, this is resonating

14:49.360 --> 14:54.000
with what I'm finding in my practice and, you know, in the kind of lab of imagination where

14:54.000 --> 14:58.800
we're trying out practices and working with people and actually seeing some of, you know,

14:58.800 --> 15:06.560
what he's talking about in kind of 1700s, feeling like, yes. And he, I think there's a work of his

15:06.560 --> 15:12.960
art where he paints Newton, and, you know, he's painted Isaac Newton with this, and he's like

15:12.960 --> 15:18.160
staring at this, at this piece of paper, which has got like a beautiful graph on it, and then

15:18.160 --> 15:23.600
there's like the big chaotic, mystical universe around him, but he's just, you know, he's focusing

15:23.680 --> 15:29.840
on this kind of perfect, you know, perfect equations or, you know, some sort of representation of the

15:29.840 --> 15:36.160
world. And so that, that's what comes up for me is that, you know, science is beautiful and elegant,

15:36.160 --> 15:41.200
and that the reason why I chose to study science and I loved it, like I'm sure you did as well.

15:42.640 --> 15:48.960
But we think that we are discovering everything, you know, it's quite often that I hear people

15:49.040 --> 15:52.400
say like, oh, what if we run out of things to discover of the unit, you know,

15:53.440 --> 16:02.000
covered so much. And actually, what if we run out? Wow, what an impoverished reality.

16:02.880 --> 16:08.480
You need imagination to see how little you know. If you don't have any, you think we know it all.

16:08.480 --> 16:16.640
But yes, I'm so glad you brought up Blake, who by the way, you know, we both know that Blake was

16:17.360 --> 16:23.760
a wonderful man, also quite frustrating in some ways. And he did tend to, for his own purposes,

16:23.760 --> 16:32.640
demonize Newton, who, you know, interestingly, was was more fascinated by spiritual inklings

16:32.640 --> 16:38.000
of his than he was in his physics. But it just goes to show that a great mind can,

16:38.720 --> 16:44.640
I believe, encompass both. And many of the great physicists of the last 100 years show that exactly

16:44.720 --> 16:52.000
that they are able to see into the heart of things matter and see in there something

16:52.640 --> 16:58.720
beyond and more profound. And that that brings me back to Blake. And I hope this is a fruitful

16:58.720 --> 17:07.360
connection. I think the quote is, to the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.920
I think I use that at the beginning of the chapter. And what's really interesting about

17:13.920 --> 17:20.000
that, you can puzzle over it. What does he mean, the man of imagination, nature is imagination

17:20.000 --> 17:27.360
itself. But just before it, I quote, Richard Feynman, who says that nature has a far, far

17:27.360 --> 17:33.200
greater imagination than a human being, which is really a way of saying, our puny imagination can

17:33.200 --> 17:39.040
only get so far in investigating what there is. But I think that Blake is making a more profound

17:39.120 --> 17:44.320
point. I mean, it's a very good point, which I entirely agree. But I think what Blake is saying

17:44.960 --> 17:53.120
is that the imagination, you are not inspecting or something over there. But in imagination,

17:53.120 --> 17:59.040
you are already in whatever it is. So that the subject object divide is actually transcended.

17:59.680 --> 18:06.640
So that if you really look into nature, you are already in nature. And this is what

18:06.640 --> 18:14.960
imagination is about. It's about healing the divide, not in some terribly weird and new edgy way,

18:14.960 --> 18:20.880
which means we can stop thinking. But there is something desperately profound in this idea

18:21.680 --> 18:29.280
that in the realm of imagination, we are actually contacting not a representation,

18:29.280 --> 18:37.120
which is what the left hemisphere offers us, not a drawing, a picture, a graph, a theory,

18:37.120 --> 18:44.800
but the actual experience of what it is in which we finally see sort of through it, but not in the

18:44.800 --> 18:50.080
sense of seeing through it to something that's separate from it beyond, but seeing through

18:50.080 --> 18:58.160
the veil of familiarity to its real core. So I think that that's one thing I'd like to say

18:58.160 --> 19:04.160
about imagination is that it brings us to this place. We're not sort of just making stuff up or

19:04.800 --> 19:08.560
we're definitely not making stuff up. In fact, that's the exact opposite of what we're doing.

19:08.560 --> 19:17.120
We're respectfully, honorably, humbly, with awe, approaching whatever it is, and thereby

19:17.120 --> 19:21.360
allowing ourselves for once to get close to it and into it.

19:22.160 --> 19:32.720
I'm so glad you said that. During the work of finding the thread of imagination and kind of

19:32.720 --> 19:39.680
pulling on it and starting to unravel a huge amount, what I've been uncovering in my research

19:39.680 --> 19:45.760
and thinking and writing and practice is that imagination, I think, is one of the most deeply

19:46.000 --> 19:51.680
misunderstood things, not non-things, actually, because I think one of the reasons it's been

19:52.960 --> 19:57.920
is because it's been so thingified. It's been so, you know, it's like, oh, the imagination,

19:57.920 --> 20:03.920
the thing that is over there that we do sometimes on the weekend and we have it when we are

20:03.920 --> 20:08.720
children, but we don't have it when we're out, you know, and it's this ridiculous kind of,

20:08.720 --> 20:14.720
even the language we use around imagination is completely, it's not just inaccurate, but it

20:14.720 --> 20:21.440
leads us into completely confused realms and creates quite an odd relationship between

20:22.480 --> 20:26.800
ourselves and imagination. And this has been a lot of the work of the last few years is like,

20:26.800 --> 20:32.080
actually, before I even get to do the work of actually, you know, testing and experimenting

20:32.080 --> 20:37.600
with how can we increase, you know, increase imagination capacity, which is also a bit of a

20:38.480 --> 20:43.840
an odd term. Because actually, what I've been finding is that there's no need to,

20:43.840 --> 20:49.120
there's nothing to increase, because it's not a volume or a thing, there is just unblocking

20:49.120 --> 20:54.320
to be done from the relationship to it. Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.

20:55.440 --> 20:55.920
We'll do.

20:58.240 --> 21:05.200
I mean, I wish this was like a four hour conversation, because it's so good to unpack some of this.

21:06.000 --> 21:12.960
What I just wanted to comment about it there, since we've had a little hiatus is the idea that

21:14.080 --> 21:26.000
imagination is not something that has somehow to be drummed up. It's something that is there

21:26.000 --> 21:33.600
all the time, if a certain way of thinking doesn't get between us and it. So we use and have to use

21:33.600 --> 21:38.640
the left hemisphere as mode of apprehension in order to be able to function properly. But as I'm

21:38.640 --> 21:42.560
always saying, there's nothing wrong with that. There's something good about that. As long as we

21:42.560 --> 21:49.600
can then remember to go beyond it, to have finished that process of unpacking explicitly,

21:49.600 --> 21:55.280
and then say, right, it's none of that, although that has actually helped us on the way. So it's

21:55.280 --> 22:06.160
as people say in so many religious traditions, that the seeking of God is not that God is hiding

22:06.160 --> 22:15.280
somewhere, but God is there if only you don't stop yourself from seeing. And that could be said,

22:15.280 --> 22:21.760
I think, about the imagination that it is there. And it's by not doing things and by not

22:22.400 --> 22:28.080
espousing certain views and not acting and so on, but allowing, permitting something that it will

22:28.080 --> 22:34.800
come into being for us. Exactly. And one of the things that the participants of, you know, the

22:34.800 --> 22:39.280
programs that we're running with moral imagination say is that one of the most valuable things that

22:39.280 --> 22:46.560
we're doing when we go into local councils is giving them planned unplanned time. And to start

22:46.560 --> 22:55.280
with, the kind of managers were like, what do you need unplanned time? But that's actually what

22:55.280 --> 23:04.480
it takes is to just, you know, how can we expect exercise imagination when there's no space or

23:04.480 --> 23:10.560
time and we're completely flooded by the need to deliver, to produce, to perform

23:11.440 --> 23:18.560
worst conditions for imagination. Modern day. And those are all expressions of the left

23:18.560 --> 23:24.720
hemispheric mentality that we must have something we can measure. There must always be a utility,

23:24.720 --> 23:29.840
there must be a product to this. Otherwise, this has been completely wasted, even if the time that

23:29.840 --> 23:34.400
you spent was profoundly useful, but didn't actually turn up anything measurable at the time.

23:35.120 --> 23:44.720
So it's all this administration managerial thinking that, in my view, is mushrooming in the

23:44.720 --> 23:51.280
world. I mean, so fast that I think there's a very palpable difference between now and five years

23:51.280 --> 23:56.320
ago. I mean, it was bad all the time I was growing up. I complained about it in the 70s and the 80s,

23:56.320 --> 24:03.280
but I hadn't seen anything till you get to 2023. And I think this is partly to do with machines,

24:03.280 --> 24:09.520
which of course, have no imagination, have no understanding of context, individuality,

24:09.520 --> 24:15.440
embodiedness, feeling, the spiritual, anything. But our following simple left hemisphere rules say

24:15.440 --> 24:20.880
it's much worse. It's much worse than talking to an administrator is having to deal with a machine.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.800
And now most of the time when you want to do anything, you have to interface with the machine.

24:24.800 --> 24:30.160
So that is the death of imagination. And I'm sure you know, Paul Kingsmorth uses the term

24:30.160 --> 24:35.360
the machine as I think it's a perfectly good way of talking about what I mean by the left

24:35.360 --> 24:42.000
hemisphere. All I'd say is that it's bigger than the machine in the machine is an expression of

24:42.000 --> 24:48.400
this left hemisphere mentality. But the left hemisphere mentality is behind the machine and

24:48.400 --> 24:55.120
behind many other things. So for example, we we look at various predicaments, the obviously the

24:55.120 --> 25:02.560
destruction of the planet, the the catastrophic changes in climate, all of these things. And we

25:02.560 --> 25:09.760
see them as something either bad luck or bad planning or something we did wrong. And we look

25:09.760 --> 25:16.560
at other things like the growing disparity, not the diminishing disparity between the

25:17.440 --> 25:22.880
unimaginably rich and the poor. And we think we must have got a problem here. And what did we do?

25:22.880 --> 25:26.240
And there's all these different problems. What was the solution? And the answer is,

25:26.240 --> 25:32.080
they're not problems, but in dual hinds terms, their predicaments that we have brought about

25:32.080 --> 25:38.560
by a certain way of thinking, which leads inexorably to each of these, and to a de spiritualized,

25:38.560 --> 25:42.240
desacralized sense of the world in which we live.

25:45.360 --> 25:50.400
Yes. So, so I'm just holding in mind, you know, there's a couple of things I'd

25:50.480 --> 25:54.720
like to cover in this conversation. So I'm just following the thread of where it's going. But

25:54.720 --> 26:00.880
I will pull us into a couple of things. I'd really like to say, I'd love to spend some time on the

26:00.880 --> 26:04.880
brain and imagination neuroscience, because that's something that, you know, I've done a lot of

26:04.880 --> 26:08.720
thinking and research around. And and would love to talk to you about, you know, linking it with

26:08.720 --> 26:14.320
the right, right and left hemisphere, and also talking about moral imagination, which was my

26:14.320 --> 26:20.080
way into imagination. We must talk about both of those. Yes. Yes. I didn't just want to have,

26:20.160 --> 26:24.800
you know, hat tip to chat GPT, because you mentioned, you know, machines don't have imagination,

26:24.800 --> 26:30.560
and I'm sure that it's on everybody's mind is, you know, right now, there is a lot of talk about

26:30.560 --> 26:36.720
how chat GPT seems to have imagination, you know, it's, it's kind of churning out poems and

26:37.600 --> 26:44.640
rap battles and, you know, it seems to be creative, even though it's, you know, through a mimicry of

26:44.640 --> 26:48.720
all the information, you know, kind of emergent property of all the information it's gathering

26:48.720 --> 26:55.200
and kind of faring off. But, you know, do you want to say anything about? Oh, gosh, I do. Yes.

26:55.200 --> 27:02.560
Because, I mean, I want to say that I can't intellectually completely rule out that at some

27:02.560 --> 27:11.600
point, some creation of ours might might achieve a kind of consciousness. I just can't rule that

27:11.760 --> 27:19.360
out, partly because I believe the consciousness is the original primary stuff of the cosmos,

27:19.360 --> 27:25.680
in any case. But what you mean there, and what I mean by imagination is not what this is doing,

27:25.680 --> 27:30.960
what it is doing is exactly what an imaginary person doesn't do, which is do a very quick,

27:30.960 --> 27:34.560
which of course the human being couldn't do in this speed, what machines do is just do things

27:34.560 --> 27:42.720
very fast, is to sort of do a trolley dash around Wikipedia and come up with an answer.

27:42.720 --> 27:48.000
And it will even make stuff up and be quite sure that it's right because it sees a pattern and jumps

27:48.000 --> 27:54.080
to conclusions, which is what the left hemisphere does. And really, this is no different from

27:54.080 --> 28:01.040
something that existed decades ago. I can't remember the name of the man, but basically what he did was

28:01.120 --> 28:07.440
he fed all of Bach's works into a computer, and then set some sort of, you know, let the

28:07.440 --> 28:13.760
computer look at these things and then imitate a work of Bach. But none of these works has anything

28:13.760 --> 28:20.160
like the power of Bach, and Bach's very first composition when he was 19 years old is already

28:20.160 --> 28:24.960
one of the most staggering pieces of musical writing in history, and it wasn't derived from

28:24.960 --> 28:31.600
anywhere. So we're looking at things that we must be careful, you know, because a machine

28:31.600 --> 28:37.040
can be made by human ingenuity to simulate almost anything. I mean, there's no limit to how far you

28:37.040 --> 28:42.880
can help it simulate. The question is, is it simulating something, or is it actually achieving

28:42.880 --> 28:50.880
it? And so far, there's no evidence that it's achieving it. Is there also something about,

28:51.840 --> 28:59.600
you know, it's almost like a left hemisphere response to art or to the sacred. It's like,

28:59.600 --> 29:04.160
oh, but, you know, we could just churn out, you know, does the sacredness of art

29:05.200 --> 29:12.400
become affected if it's something that's being churned out through random, you know, re-organization

29:12.400 --> 29:18.720
of, you know, fact and existing art? I mean, that, I think we could talk for the whole hour

29:18.720 --> 29:25.040
just about this, but I did just, you know, to touch on it. It's relevant. Well, really, it's

29:25.040 --> 29:34.080
really the logical conclusion of the Industrial Revolution, which was to take things that took

29:34.080 --> 29:38.960
a lot of craftsmanship and were, you know, occurred in nature, and try and imitate them,

29:38.960 --> 29:44.640
and then produce thousands of them very, very fast. It's exactly what was going on already in the

29:44.640 --> 29:51.680
early part of the 19th century. It's just been heightened to another level of technological

29:51.680 --> 30:01.360
sophistication. But it's not going to produce, it's never going to produce works that have profound

30:01.360 --> 30:09.440
human meaning, because you have to have a body, emotions, the sense of relationship, the knowledge

30:09.520 --> 30:16.640
that you're going to die, to have suffered, and to be aware of the limitations to what it is that

30:16.640 --> 30:23.520
you can experience. And I just think this is, this can be fed by a clever IT expert into a

30:23.520 --> 30:27.440
computer. It seems to say those things, but it can't actually do them.

30:27.840 --> 30:41.280
So back to, imagine it, the organic. I said at the beginning that I felt it was one of the most

30:41.280 --> 30:47.760
deeply misunderstood, and we, without the signifying of imagination, you know, I also,

30:47.760 --> 30:54.800
in your chapter 19 of your book, you talk about how, I guess the parallel is that

30:55.520 --> 31:01.440
many people, when they think of imagination, think of fantasy, think of daydreaming. And this

31:01.440 --> 31:06.800
is often what I get when I talk to people about what I do. It's like, oh yeah, you know, we need

31:06.800 --> 31:13.040
more imagination, we need more fiction, you know, we need more creativity. Another big misconception

31:13.040 --> 31:18.560
I've been fighting is that people think that my work is all about the future. It's not about

31:19.280 --> 31:25.600
the future. It's about, it's not about time. In fact, I actually think in the imaginative,

31:25.600 --> 31:33.600
imaginal realm, there is no time. It's not a time bound place. And so that's been quite an

31:33.600 --> 31:38.320
interesting thing to unpack is that people immediately think that what I'm doing is helping

31:38.320 --> 31:45.360
people imagine the future. When actually, the work of moral imaginations is really about shifting

31:45.360 --> 31:52.880
perspective and unblocking and seeing what is there. So it's not, we're not trying to get people

31:52.880 --> 31:57.920
to think about the future. You're about, were you about to come in there? It's very interesting,

31:57.920 --> 32:03.440
because I mean, you know that you sent me some things to look at about an hour before this,

32:03.440 --> 32:08.800
and I therefore didn't have time to look at them in any depth. But I was interested by your three

32:08.800 --> 32:13.360
pillars, which would seem on the face of it, to suggest that you are interested in the past

32:13.360 --> 32:18.720
and the future, as well as our relationships with the natural world. I like that actually,

32:18.720 --> 32:24.960
because I think that one thing we've lost is the sense that we are, it's part of our atomistic way

32:24.960 --> 32:33.360
of thinking. We are part of a flow which includes the past and includes the future. And our ancestors

32:33.360 --> 32:40.240
and any of our offspring are already present in our lives in some way. And we owe them each

32:40.240 --> 32:47.920
a moral obligation. We have a moral obligation to those who worked hard, sacrificed, died to

32:47.920 --> 32:53.440
produce the things that we take for granted, and all the wisdom that they stored up, which is now

32:53.440 --> 33:00.960
just being trashed and thrown out of the window. And we have a moral obligation, a very big one,

33:00.960 --> 33:09.600
to those that come after us, not to carry on defiling and destroying what is their birthright.

33:09.680 --> 33:15.360
So I like that. But maybe what you're saying is that in the realm of imagination,

33:17.200 --> 33:21.280
there is no time. I wouldn't know really whether that was or not. But I think that

33:22.080 --> 33:26.320
when you're really in the realm of imagination, you're not aware of time. You're not aware of

33:26.320 --> 33:31.040
time passing. So that when you make contact after all, imagination is not only not a thing.

33:32.240 --> 33:38.720
It's a relationship. And that relationship is reverberative. So something is going on that

33:38.720 --> 33:45.200
is bringing something into being. And this is why you have to do the kind of one foot in

33:45.200 --> 33:50.640
either camp of saying, it's not just something I make up, but it's not something just out there

33:50.640 --> 33:56.560
given. It's something that comes into being that is utterly real. An aspect of what it is is revealed

33:56.560 --> 34:04.080
in the relationship with my imagination. And so we're dealing there with something that it is

34:04.080 --> 34:09.440
the only hope we have of getting into reality. Because if you just look at Wordsworth and

34:09.440 --> 34:15.360
Coleridge, I have the greatest philosophical writers on imagination in any language, I believe.

34:16.240 --> 34:21.680
But I mean, what they were saying is that when we think we see something, we look at the mountain

34:21.680 --> 34:26.640
and we just see a lump of rock and so on. But it's only when we use our imagination that we

34:26.640 --> 34:30.960
see into it. And in doing so, we don't see something that's other than a lump of rock.

34:30.960 --> 34:36.080
We see what a lump of rock is that lump of rock is by the way, not any that lump of rock is for

34:36.080 --> 34:43.680
the first time. And this reminds me of the Zen master Dogen in the 12th century, who said,

34:44.320 --> 34:51.360
when I sought enlightenment, the mountains were just mountains and the rivers were just rivers.

34:51.360 --> 34:56.080
When I was in the process of seeking enlightenment, the mountains were no longer mountains, the rivers

34:56.080 --> 35:02.080
were no longer rivers. When I achieved enlightenment, the mountains were mountains and the rivers were

35:02.080 --> 35:07.520
rivers. And I think that's the point is we're not putting something in place of something.

35:07.520 --> 35:14.240
We're allowing the real entity for the first time to become real in this world. And we each

35:14.240 --> 35:21.680
to blink to moral imagination. The reason I believe that attention is moral is because the way we

35:21.680 --> 35:27.760
attend changes of what it is we find. And what we find is part of the imaginative world that is the

35:27.760 --> 35:32.960
only thing that is real. And so we are actually creating something, either something terrible

35:32.960 --> 35:40.240
or something good by what we do. And that means that we each bear the burden of a certain kind of

35:40.240 --> 35:49.280
responsibility for what we do. Lake talks about twofold vision, which I think is very relevant

35:49.280 --> 35:57.280
here. And I love the, you know, his couplets of, Oh, God, may, may us keep from single vision,

35:57.280 --> 36:04.880
Newton's sleep. And, you know, I love what he talked about was actually the view of the world

36:04.880 --> 36:11.680
is just material. That's Newton's sleep, you know, falling you into a sleep away from reality,

36:11.680 --> 36:17.440
which you actually feel through twofold vision, meaning one eye and, you know,

36:17.520 --> 36:22.960
looking and seeing what is, but the other eye, having this internal mind's eye of

36:22.960 --> 36:29.520
imagination, and that is the twofold vision of what is real. And we've been lulled into a sleep,

36:29.520 --> 36:34.320
you know, by, I, he clearly has an issue in Newton, but he also depicts Newton as like a

36:34.320 --> 36:40.160
beautiful, healthy guy. So I don't think it was only that, but for Newton, it's not only him.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.680
And as you say, he also had a great interest in the mystical and the mysterious.

36:44.560 --> 36:51.040
Yes. I loved that, that kind of, you know, this is lulling us into a dangerous sleep,

36:51.040 --> 36:57.920
which we might not wake up from before it's too late. And that's why this work is so urgent and so

36:58.560 --> 37:04.160
existential, actually, because actually we're asleep at the wheel, and we're heading towards a

37:04.160 --> 37:11.280
cliff. And I completely agree. Yeah. And I did, but imagination can, can wake us up.

37:11.360 --> 37:19.920
It needs to, because as I, as I say in one of the books, I don't know, that we're like

37:19.920 --> 37:24.480
some nambulist wandering towards the abyss, humming a happy tune as we go. And that's the

37:24.480 --> 37:29.920
left hemisphere. It doesn't see what's happening. And yet it thinks all is fine, because I know,

37:29.920 --> 37:36.320
and I'm in control. So we need to see, I think Blake also said that, you know,

37:37.280 --> 37:42.960
that the man of imagination sees not with the eye, but through the eye. And again,

37:42.960 --> 37:48.560
it gives this idea of a depth to what one's seeing. But that what one shouldn't think is that what

37:48.560 --> 37:56.240
one sees through the eye is some hidden reality behind what it is. One sees into the depths of

37:56.240 --> 38:02.960
things, as Wordsworth said. This is a very, very important idea that he, in fact, he talks about

38:03.040 --> 38:06.800
lulling our intellectual, Wordsworth talks about in the Tentanabula, about

38:06.800 --> 38:14.480
lulling our intellectual faculties asleep, so that the, that we can see into the depths of things.

38:15.200 --> 38:23.600
So there's a kind of sleep of reason, which is either what Goya thought was terrible,

38:23.600 --> 38:27.680
and I know what he was talking about, because it's happening in our own time, when people

38:28.320 --> 38:32.000
just decide that they're going to dispense with reason, because it doesn't accord with what they

38:32.000 --> 38:36.400
want to believe. So they'll just believe it anyway. And so there is a sleep of reason,

38:36.400 --> 38:43.680
but there's sometimes a need to silence the hemisphere that does all the processing of

38:43.680 --> 38:48.800
language, so that the other hemisphere, the right hemisphere, can for once see the whole.

38:50.240 --> 38:55.760
Which is actually what happens during sleep, you know, and which gives rise to dreams,

38:55.760 --> 39:00.720
isn't it, that the kind of dominant, I've been, you know, my research has led me to the default

39:00.800 --> 39:06.240
mode network, which I don't know if that is left hemispheric, you know, dominant network,

39:06.240 --> 39:11.840
because it's, it seems to be the seat of rationality, reason, also the sense of self,

39:11.840 --> 39:16.000
we don't, you know, when we're born, we don't have a default mode network. So as babies,

39:16.000 --> 39:21.040
we don't have memories, because the default mode network is what gives us that autobiographical

39:21.040 --> 39:27.040
sense of self. But it's also, it's also what constrains the imagination. So as children,

39:27.040 --> 39:32.960
we have imaginary friends, and those imaginary friends are not close our eyes and somewhere

39:32.960 --> 39:38.160
over there, they're here with us, that, you know, people see children talking to their imaginary

39:38.160 --> 39:45.360
friend, because it's there. And so, you know, interesting that the default mode network becomes

39:45.360 --> 39:51.360
stronger and stronger, you know, into adulthood. And I think it was either Blake or somebody writing

39:51.360 --> 39:56.960
about Blake talked about how compared adulthood to the falling out of Eden, you know, the kind

39:56.960 --> 40:04.320
of innocent childlike wonder and awe and imagination that we have. And then as we're older, there's a

40:04.320 --> 40:11.120
kind of divorce from that and the strengthening of these networks and also our culture and society

40:11.120 --> 40:16.960
that is constantly strengthening the neural pathways, you know, of reason of rationality,

40:16.960 --> 40:22.720
of modeling, predicting, controlling. And it's interesting that often when people go through

40:22.720 --> 40:29.680
our workshops, they talk about rekindling or reconnecting with a kind of inner sense of childlike

40:29.680 --> 40:34.160
wonder, or you know, someone's even said like, I feel like I've discovered the five year old,

40:34.160 --> 40:40.640
you know, that was kind of inside me, which sounds a bit contrived or, you know, a bit silly, but

40:40.640 --> 40:47.120
there's something interesting going on, that people are finding a reconnection to a childlike

40:47.120 --> 40:53.360
that which which has a huge pain, you know, that they feel a great sense of grief that that's been

40:53.360 --> 41:00.560
lost. And this is all connected, you know, that your work of the kind of dominant rationality

41:00.560 --> 41:09.760
reason. Anyway, that's a jumble of thoughts. No, no. Yes. As that. Well, no. Of course, there are

41:09.760 --> 41:17.760
different kinds of imagination. There's the imagination of a Michelangelo or Bach, and there's

41:17.760 --> 41:26.800
the imagination of a thoughtful, lively five year old. And there's a, in a way, there's a sort of

41:27.360 --> 41:37.280
parallel to the way in which there is a kind of knowing, which gets in the way of unknowing.

41:37.520 --> 41:41.440
It's not the same as the unknowing you have when you're ignorant and still have to learn.

41:41.440 --> 41:46.320
It's the unknowing that, in fact, goes beyond knowing when you know enough to know that you have

41:46.320 --> 41:53.120
to practice unknowing. Similarly, there's a kind of innocence a child has, which is, as it were,

41:53.120 --> 41:58.240
a gift that they have. But there is a kind of innocence that a saint has that comes the other

41:58.240 --> 42:03.600
side of experience and is greater than either the innocence or experience. And so I would say that

42:03.600 --> 42:10.160
there is a kind of sense of imagination. The imagination can grow. It doesn't have to be

42:10.160 --> 42:16.960
stunted by life. But the processes whereby we educate people can certainly contribute to a

42:16.960 --> 42:23.760
process of, you know, making them feel small and making them feel silly if they confess to

42:24.480 --> 42:28.640
imaginative ideas, such as, you know, an imaginative friend and then somebody says,

42:28.640 --> 42:34.080
now, don't be so silly. There isn't really anyone there. And of course, this links to bigger

42:34.080 --> 42:41.600
topics like amongst other people, poor old Dawkins, he's become like Newton for Blake,

42:41.600 --> 42:46.080
but he just keeps on saying these things. He sort of believes it's terrible.

42:47.840 --> 42:54.560
He's his own worst foe. How dare people indoctrinate children into these ideas of a spiritual realm

42:54.640 --> 42:59.680
with a divine realm as well. They never think of this if they weren't indoctrinated into it.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.360
But actually, there's a lot of research, some of which I quote in that book,

43:03.360 --> 43:08.880
which shows that children naturally are aware of things beyond what we call the realm of the

43:08.880 --> 43:16.080
five senses. But this is kind of drummed out of them by being told it's wrong and humiliating them.

43:16.080 --> 43:22.880
And then they go, oh, well, and they're lucky if they can then reconnect with it. And of course,

43:23.440 --> 43:30.080
in my experience, certainly helps to reconnect one with that is the greatness of art in all its

43:30.080 --> 43:36.240
various forms and the experience of what everyone likes to call it religious or spiritual life.

43:37.200 --> 43:43.360
And nature. And nature is core to all of this. Yes, absolutely. Yes.

43:44.080 --> 43:48.880
So into moral imagination, because I did this is really,

43:50.160 --> 43:56.400
you know, I find imagination is absolutely fascinating. And it's, to me, it's, you know,

43:56.400 --> 44:01.920
the most convincing route towards getting us out of this mess, you know,

44:03.760 --> 44:08.560
existential crisis as many people do in their 20s and really felt like, you know,

44:08.560 --> 44:13.520
what are we doing to the world? And that crisis has essentially led me to imagination. But

44:14.080 --> 44:18.560
through that crisis, you know, the question I was really asking was like,

44:19.440 --> 44:25.680
how is it that we're making such immoral decisions? How is it that we are making decisions that

44:26.240 --> 44:33.440
are so self-serving, so greedy? You know, what is that about? How does that come about? So I became

44:33.520 --> 44:40.160
really fascinated by morality and ethics, you know, and thinking probably with a hangover of my

44:40.160 --> 44:46.080
scientific, you know, brain thinking like, okay, so the problem is a lack of morality or, you know,

44:46.080 --> 44:52.160
a lack of the sacred or some sort of death of what is good, beautiful and true. So how,

44:52.160 --> 44:59.920
what can we do about that? Started reading about morality and didn't find a lot of it very interesting.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.600
And then came across, you know, came across, you know, the thing I was thinking about was that

45:05.600 --> 45:12.880
actually, the way that we've approached morality in the West has a lot of parallels to the way

45:12.880 --> 45:19.360
that we approached, you know, science, that it's very much tangled up in reason, in rationality and,

45:19.360 --> 45:25.040
you know, the kind of enlightenment breeds of morality like utilitarianism or Kantianism

45:25.680 --> 45:32.640
feel like they're very much left brain schools of morality and thought and, you know, Kantianism

45:32.640 --> 45:39.040
suffers from extreme abstract, you know, abstraction, utilitarianism suffers from extreme reductionism.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.720
And so I started wondering what would morality with a kind of upswell of imagination, like,

45:47.520 --> 45:54.080
where could those two things come together? And I think it's interesting that a lot of Western

45:55.040 --> 46:01.440
morality is based on, you know, this is a very simple model that Mark Johnson talks about,

46:01.440 --> 46:10.720
the kind of moral, moral folklore. So a very basic model of the mind having, you know, four

46:12.080 --> 46:18.080
components, you could think of it as perception, will, you know, the mental realm, it's got,

46:18.080 --> 46:23.280
let's say it's got for these four members, perception, reason, passion and will. And the way

46:23.280 --> 46:29.280
this works is, you know, perception receives sense impressions from the body, passes them to reason

46:29.280 --> 46:36.000
or passion. And these two things affect our will. And passions become active through bodily experience,

46:36.960 --> 46:42.160
you know, either directly through perception or through memory. Reason receives this information

46:42.160 --> 46:48.720
and calculates and analyzes sense data and passes it to the will. And, you know, basically it's up

46:48.720 --> 46:55.760
to the will to decide how to act based on these two influences. And so, you know, as I said,

46:55.760 --> 47:02.160
reason calculates, passion exerts force on the will. And we think of passion as kind of unpredictable,

47:02.160 --> 47:08.880
difficult to control. Reason, you know, exerts force on the will, but the will can sometimes

47:08.880 --> 47:15.120
resist reason. It can't resist, you know, it can sometimes resist the force of passion. So

47:15.120 --> 47:21.600
there's something here about, you know, that the model of morality being the ability to use reason

47:22.160 --> 47:28.880
to make the right decision and to resist the force of passion. And we also think of animals as

47:28.880 --> 47:36.720
lacking reason. And so humans being these, you know, like a reason, a rational animal or a reasonable

47:36.720 --> 47:45.040
animal. But the role of imagination doesn't play any role here at all. And to be a moral

47:46.000 --> 47:56.480
to be moral in this folk model of morality is to exert reason and is to resist the force of

47:56.480 --> 48:01.200
passion. Are you, are you with me on this? Or, you know, is there anything to

48:02.480 --> 48:10.720
No, I am. I am broadly with you. What I'm thinking, though, here is that, as you're well aware,

48:11.280 --> 48:18.720
there are different schools of thought about morality and very different approaches to religion

48:18.720 --> 48:25.120
and the religious life. And like everything else, the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere have

48:25.120 --> 48:31.360
different takes on them. And what you're pointing to is what joins together all these various things,

48:31.360 --> 48:36.240
the excesses of capitalism, of rationalism, of mechanism and so on, is that these are

48:36.240 --> 48:43.120
expressions of the will for power, which is essentially the only value, as I've said before

48:43.120 --> 48:50.400
on previous occasions, the only value that really drives the left hemisphere, it's evolved to be

48:50.400 --> 48:57.200
the one that manipulates. And that leaves all the other values that are to you and me and I think

48:57.200 --> 49:04.400
to all human beings, so important and so neglected, it leaves them out of the picture and out of the

49:04.400 --> 49:14.240
calculation. And I would say that, you know, for all that was a bit autistic and hyper-rationalistic

49:14.240 --> 49:20.560
in some ways, and he did say, you know, the two things that film you with awe, the starry vault

49:20.560 --> 49:26.640
above me and the moral law within me. So, I mean, he was in awe of the fact that there was a morality

49:26.640 --> 49:31.200
at all. And indeed, he thought that there must be a God because there was morality. He didn't

49:31.200 --> 49:35.920
think there must be morality because there was a God. So, he thought that this moral thing was

49:35.920 --> 49:40.880
actually very important and intuitive, although his particular approach to it I slightly differ

49:40.880 --> 49:46.960
from. But one of the things that one now sees in the way we talk about morality is exactly what

49:46.960 --> 49:54.560
you were getting at, that it seems to be about a logical process that will result in the utility

49:54.560 --> 49:59.440
and maximise utility. And I don't want to recap on this because I think I talked about it probably

49:59.520 --> 50:02.160
did. Yeah, I think you covered it with that conversation.

50:02.720 --> 50:09.120
Exactly. But there is a huge problem with this approach and that what it rules out as you also

50:09.120 --> 50:17.680
were hinting is the depth and importance of our intuitive imagination, which helps us to be human.

50:17.680 --> 50:22.960
And I think we're just becoming less than human because of the assault on all sides,

50:22.960 --> 50:29.440
on intuition and imagination and the substitution of an incredibly mediocre thing,

50:29.440 --> 50:35.200
which is a rationalising system. And I'm not saying that there is no virtue in having such a

50:35.200 --> 50:41.680
way of thinking at certain stages in any kind of process. You need it. I keep reiterating that

50:41.680 --> 50:45.840
because I don't want to fall into this thing. People think, oh yeah, the right hemisphere is

50:45.840 --> 50:50.480
all creative and wonderful and the left hemisphere is this bogeyman. The left hemisphere is very,

50:50.560 --> 50:56.160
very useful, but it doesn't know its own limitations. And that is the problem we now find ourselves in.

50:56.160 --> 51:00.800
So in a way, I feel rather like I've just read actually in very much admire

51:02.400 --> 51:07.200
Dougalde Hein's latest book. He just came and visited on the day that it came out a week or two ago.

51:07.200 --> 51:16.560
And we were in conversation the week after, Dougalde and I. Wonderful. And I don't have much time

51:16.560 --> 51:20.240
these days for reading, but I started reading and thought I think I'm going to have to finish

51:20.960 --> 51:27.840
and I thought it was brilliant. But really what he's saying is very much this thing that it's just

51:27.840 --> 51:34.480
aren't a wicked network of this problem and that problem and the other problem,

51:34.480 --> 51:39.360
but there is a whole way of thinking that underlies very clearly the whole package.

51:39.360 --> 51:44.720
And it's no good just addressing it at the top level. That would be like putting a sticking

51:44.720 --> 51:50.160
plaster on a cancer. You've covered it, but it's going to keep growing. What we have to do

51:50.800 --> 51:57.760
is to emphasize that the only way out of this is to rethink our moral stance. And what I mean by

51:57.760 --> 52:07.920
that is to embrace above all a degree of humility about what it is that we as humans can do to

52:07.920 --> 52:16.080
therefore listen to the wisdom that comes through silence and through traditions and through art

52:16.080 --> 52:23.280
and through nature, if you attend to it, and to express compassion and moderation in the way in

52:23.280 --> 52:29.920
which we try to deal with these. I don't mean moderation in the sense of averaging everything

52:29.920 --> 52:35.040
out, but I mean not supposing that this one thing, if we just do this, we'll answer everything and

52:35.040 --> 52:41.120
being extreme about it. We have to know that there are people who have differing angles on this and

52:41.120 --> 52:46.240
they can contribute something. And so what the work you're doing, which is to liberate people's

52:46.240 --> 52:50.880
imaginations from whatever it is that they're constantly being told they have to believe,

52:50.880 --> 52:54.400
is wonderful because it will bring different facets of truth to life.

52:55.440 --> 53:03.200
Thank you. I mean a really important part of the work is also the connection to what matters,

53:03.440 --> 53:10.080
this moral imagination. The way I see that is that rather than following moral laws and rules that

53:10.080 --> 53:18.320
can actually be massively manipulated, religion can be wonderful. It can also be very harmful.

53:18.320 --> 53:23.840
Absolutely. Looking to kind of top down morality and morality has become a really dirty word,

53:23.840 --> 53:30.320
but a lot of people have raised their eyebrows at the name of moral imaginations and what we're

53:30.320 --> 53:35.520
doing. And yet we're trying to reclaim that and say actually what we need, what everybody needs is

53:36.080 --> 53:42.480
to kind of build a muscle of moral imagination and metaphor and the ability to really connect with

53:42.480 --> 53:50.560
what you know matters and is beautiful and good and true and not wait to be told that or to follow

53:50.560 --> 53:56.160
rules or to try and work out what the right law or rule or principle is, but to get this kind of

53:56.160 --> 54:04.160
coming alive through the imagination, through the kind of faculties that we're talking about,

54:04.160 --> 54:13.600
the kind of right hemispheric, intuitive, imaginative capacities to develop that compass

54:13.600 --> 54:18.240
of what is right and wrong and what are we not going to let happen. Does that make sense?

54:18.240 --> 54:23.360
There's a kind of what I'm trying to do is knit them together. I love that. I love that. And I

54:23.360 --> 54:30.080
think you ought to wear the superciliousness of these people who raise an eyebrow and you

54:30.080 --> 54:35.440
talk about morality as a badge of pride. It shows that you're really onto something important

54:35.440 --> 54:41.280
because nowadays everything that's really important is being attacked and destroyed because it

54:41.280 --> 54:47.040
demands of some degree of self-restraint. It demands that we are aware of the limitations

54:47.120 --> 54:54.400
and boundaries in things. We can't just have everything we want and have it now. We need,

54:54.400 --> 55:05.120
actually, to exercise some virtuous restraint on how we behave and how we think. And without it,

55:05.120 --> 55:11.520
we're utterly lost. And it comes from an intuitive level. What really interests me is that there's

55:11.600 --> 55:18.320
a couple of cases I refer to in the book in which scientists who are completely convinced, of course,

55:18.320 --> 55:26.320
that human beings are naturally... Competitive, self-interested... Competitive and self-interested,

55:26.320 --> 55:32.160
egotistical and so on. It's set up experiments to show this and, we're honest enough, report

55:32.160 --> 55:37.760
that the answer showed the exact opposite. That people aren't normally naturally... And you see

55:37.840 --> 55:42.720
this in children. We didn't have to be tortured unless there's something very wrong with them,

55:42.720 --> 55:49.520
I know. But generally speaking, you see this, that they love to help one another. They love to be

55:49.520 --> 55:56.720
cooperative. We are naturally generous and it's further thinking and ratiosination that leads us

55:56.720 --> 56:02.080
to be greedy and self-seeking and speak for our own interests rather than others. So,

56:02.400 --> 56:07.840
you know, once again, it's a case of there not being a predicament. How on earth do we reverse

56:07.840 --> 56:13.120
the way we are? However, do we... It's actually there. It's all there ready. If you can just tear

56:13.120 --> 56:16.560
down the edifice that's been built in front of it, if you see what I mean.

56:17.120 --> 56:22.240
Completely. And the systemic, you know, we haven't really talked much about, you know, the systemic

56:23.600 --> 56:28.320
forces that keep us and, you know, that really encouraged the kind of qualities you're talking

56:28.480 --> 56:37.280
about. Let's do so. Capitalism. Capitalism. You know, what do you... I didn't see capitalism

56:38.080 --> 56:43.920
mentioned so much explicitly in your book, but I'd be really curious to hear, you know, where

56:44.720 --> 56:49.520
the place for the kind of systemic critique of where we find ourselves is.

56:50.000 --> 56:58.480
Well, I suppose the thing about capitalism is that, in a word, it's a product of the left

56:58.480 --> 57:05.520
hemisphere. It's... However, people will say, well, what would you like to put in its place?

57:05.520 --> 57:11.360
And I certainly wouldn't want to put communism in its place. But there are other alternatives

57:11.600 --> 57:19.280
we could talk about based on... It would take that to reach a kind of more

57:19.280 --> 57:28.240
communitarian way of living would require probably some disaster, I hope doesn't occur,

57:28.240 --> 57:34.160
but which would sufficiently disrupt the structures we have now and people would be

57:34.160 --> 57:39.040
thrown back on having to help one another, trust one another, work together and so on.

57:39.120 --> 57:46.480
Because at the moment, we've become lazy. So go back to capitalism. I think that

57:46.480 --> 57:51.760
there are ways of thinking of capitalism in which it's tempered by other things. And so

57:52.480 --> 58:00.480
anything that is dogmatic is going to be inhuman and damaging. And so whatever system you come

58:00.480 --> 58:04.560
up with, it needs to be tempered. It needs to be qualified. Whatever it is, it's going to have to

58:04.560 --> 58:08.560
have those... That's not wrong. That's just showing that you're taking into account

58:08.560 --> 58:13.280
various different things. I don't talk about it largely because I'm not myself, particularly

58:14.960 --> 58:23.120
involved in political thinking. And I don't want to... I'm more interested in the things

58:23.120 --> 58:27.760
behind politics than in the politics themselves. So I didn't want to start a big conversation

58:27.760 --> 58:31.920
about that, which would have been a whole other book, one which I'm absolutely not equipped to

58:31.920 --> 58:42.720
write. So yeah. It is an interesting question. What could imagining to imagine what is a right

58:42.720 --> 58:50.160
hemispheric system? If capitalism is created by the left hemisphere, what... And I thought

58:50.160 --> 58:56.720
this quite often as I've read your work is we live in a society dominated by the left hemisphere

58:56.720 --> 59:03.360
in doctrine. And it's too far and it needs to swing back. But what would a society look like

59:03.360 --> 59:09.200
if it had... If it was kind of swung too far the other way, just to...

59:10.560 --> 59:14.800
Yes. I mean, if it swung too far the other way, I'm often asked, so what would a right

59:14.800 --> 59:20.480
hemisphere society look like? And I say, well, very moderate, because the thing about the right

59:20.480 --> 59:25.840
hemisphere is that it understands the need for the left hemisphere's contribution. And in the

59:25.840 --> 59:29.840
story of the master and the emissary, the master pointed the emissary. It's just the emissary now

59:29.840 --> 59:37.680
thinks it's the master. That's the problem. So there isn't really... Sorry, what are we talking

59:37.680 --> 59:43.680
about there? The right hemispheric system. What would that look like? Oh, yes, what would it look

59:43.680 --> 59:50.960
like? Yes, yes. And we have had periods in history, I think, where they're not what we would probably

59:51.920 --> 59:59.760
suggest to ourselves now, but we're obviously massively creative periods in which society flourished

59:59.760 --> 01:00:05.760
in the West. But they were fairly short lived. And the thing is that every civilization is fairly

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:17.520
short lived. And I can't remember the name of the guy now, but early 20th century writer who looked

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.640
30 past civilizations and reckoned that, I mean, of course, it's not scientific to say when does

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:29.840
it begin and when does it end. But a reasonable gestalt was that they tended to come up and then

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.880
fade over about three to 400 years, that seems to be the normal pattern. And one way of thinking

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:46.320
about that is in the terms of William Orffles. I can never remember whether he's William or Patrick.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:53.440
One, this is real name, the other is pseudonym. Not a good pseudonym. Orffles, O-P-H-U-L-S, who wrote

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:59.440
Immodern Greatness, which is a quote from Gibbon. But effectively, it's a very short book, only 80

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:07.040
pages long. All of you go out and buy it after this, it doesn't cost anything, or much. And he gives

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:14.160
the six reasons why civilizations always undermine themselves by overreaching themselves in various

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.160
ways. And one way of thinking of that is that this self-satisfying thing of the left hemisphere

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:28.480
takes over. But one fairly, I think we would all resonate with this, one image he has, is that

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:35.440
civilizations tend to go through phases. In the first phase, they require enormous levels of

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:43.920
mutual trust, valor, self-sacrifice, courage, hard work, you know, honor, then building something

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.680
valuable. And then when that's been built, I think where the next wave comes along, and they can build

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.080
on top of that, and they produce works of science, they produce great works of art, they elaborate

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:02.880
on top of this. And then the next wave, which is the final wave comes along, where they are basically

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:10.240
now soft, weak, selfish, lack self-discipline, think that they're entitled to everything

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:16.880
on a plate because they're born. And I believe this is the one we're ridden now. We believe that

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.160
somehow it's our right to carry on living in a totally absurd way, which is destroying

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.600
everything we value. Thank you for answering that. And I know it seems as if we diverged

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:33.040
from imagination, but I think a lot of what really brings people's imaginations alive at the

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:41.200
moment is the question of what could an alternative look like, and also the unimaginable. That brings

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:50.880
me a lot of hope, actually. The idea that all big social change, all societal change was always

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.720
unimaginable before it happened, and the 50 years of the world we're living in now was completely

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.960
unimaginable. And so when people say there is an air of hopelessness and despair and

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.960
a darkness around what's coming next, there is a cliff edge. There is, there is. I find it very

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:21.520
encouraging to hear you gesture at the unimaginable alternative. One of the points that maybe we need

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:29.520
to start winding up our bit and hand over, but one of the things in in Dougal's book

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:41.920
is this idea that the reason we're so despairing about what's coming is that we think too narrowly

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:50.320
about ourselves. And we and the life that we are living now probably won't exist in the future.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:58.000
And it didn't exist in the past either. But some creatures will live with any luck. I imagine

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:06.160
substantial numbers of human beings will live and the world will begin to heal and regenerate.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:14.240
And what I hope is that those human beings will be, will have their eyes opened to things that

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:20.160
we're now blinded to by being too comfortable and too convinced that we know it all. And that

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:33.600
that will lead them to a kind, humane, courageous working together in which people are bound together

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.080
by the ties that really make life worth living. And it will be in smaller communities than the

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.240
ones we have now. And it's not a human faculty to be able to understand very large numbers,

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.480
and especially not very large numbers of people. Is it three million or is it three billion or

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.840
three trillion? We just don't know. But you know, we're, we're, we're famously fitted to

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.680
knowing about 150 people. That makes sense. And so I think one of the problems is we've simply

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:07.520
agglomerated everything. And that's been partly due to technology and partly due to capitalism.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.520
Anyway, maybe that's where we, is that where we begin to, we'd like to have another one of these.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.120
Great. I hope it's just the first. Thank you.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.680
So thank you very much Phoebe.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:29.200
Thank you. Thank you both Phoebe and Ian. That was really, really interesting. And I thoroughly

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:34.880
enjoyed the whole arc of the conversation. So I'm looking forward to hearing the various

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.880
questions that will be coming through shortly. And I should say that Jonathan has encountered

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.600
further difficulties with the power where he is. So I'll be conveying the questions and,

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.760
and moderating this next part. So I'm actually going to start by asking the question that

01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:00.240
Jonathan had hoped to ask if he were able to do it out loud. So I'm just going to read that out

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.760
for you. And you have to imagine Jonathan's Scottish accent, which I unfortunately am not

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:12.080
capable of reproducing. And nor would you want me to. So Jonathan wrote, and he put this in the

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.840
chat as well. You'll have to scroll up a bit to see it. Ian often suggests that the left

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.280
atmosphere is power seeking in some sense. And both Phoebe and Ian suggest imagination may be

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.760
critical to wake ourselves up to our predicament and be some part of the solution. And yet power,

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.720
in some shape or form, will always be part of reality. So what then can we say about the

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.240
relationship between imagination and power? And in particular, what might it mean to imagine

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:47.200
power as something wisely wielded in a way that does not sound naive or wishful thinking? So I

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.560
think it's actually quite good as a follow up to the kind of systemic discussion that you were just

01:06:52.560 --> 01:07:01.200
having at the end. Yes. So either of you would like to. Do you want to go first, Ian?

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.400
Okay. Before saying anything, I see a number of people want to know about Duke Gould Hein's book.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.880
It's called At Work in the Ruins. And it has a very long subtitle, which is so long, it's almost

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:24.960
comical, and I can't remember it. Power. You see, there's a paradox that the more we seek power,

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:32.480
the less we really have any control or influence over what happens. Things control us.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:42.640
The power-seeking mentality is always frustrated, always unhappy, always unfulfilled. And one sees

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.720
this, I have seen it as a psychiatrist very often, but one sees it if one looks around. There is,

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:56.080
and this is often said by people in particularly Eastern traditions, that what we're talking about

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:05.600
is not a kind of helplessness, but a kind of affirming acknowledgement of one's vulnerability,

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:13.600
of the fact that there are limitations, and that in all humility, and honesty, and with

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:20.320
awe, one puts oneself open to something bigger than oneself. And that in doing that,

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:27.680
one finds a new direction, one finds that one is no longer frustrating oneself,

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:33.520
one finds a freedom and autonomy, that by seeking freedom and autonomy in that aggressive left

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:42.480
hemisphere way, we just destroy it. I mean, there never has been a period in the West when freedom

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.880
has been more in jeopardy than it is now. And this one says, well, what about the Soviet era

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.400
and the Nazi era? But we're going back into one of these areas right now because of a strident,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:05.600
un-nuanced, naive view about freedom and those sort of things. So that's what I'd say is that I

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.840
don't think power is this simple thing about controlling others. It's about letting go of

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.520
control in order to be filled with a spiritual sense of things, to be one with the world, and

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:24.800
therefore to be empowered by it. I mean, it is an empowering experience, I can say from my own

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:33.280
poor experience that I find it such. Yeah, thank you for that, Ian. I think what I was struck by

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:42.560
is that I worry that we thingify power, like we thingify imagination. And power is not a thing

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:50.880
that we're trying to get and grab and achieve. There's no end to it. As you say, Ian, it's a

01:09:50.880 --> 01:10:00.000
kind of bottomless pit that you can never really reach the end of it. I also, another thing that

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:06.560
comes to mind is that I think the systems thinking, which I think is very right hemisphere,

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:14.720
the kind of systems thinking view on power is not like the physics kind of cause and effect,

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:21.840
like I push the world, I push someone and they fall, that kind of mechanistic view on the world

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:29.200
of power. So that kind of model would mean if the way power is exerted is through kind of pushing

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.320
on the world and things happening, then the way to kind of get power is to barricade yourself from

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:40.320
being pushed and to kind of get more and more powerful. But actually, we know through systems

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.920
thinking through looking at how nature works, that it doesn't work like that. It's not the

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:52.400
only way it works. Power can also be not zero sum, there can be win-win, there can be different

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:58.960
kinds of power where you win and I win. And everything there's a kind of mutual flourishing

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.960
or a different kind of power that doesn't need to mean that other people get pushed down. We could

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:14.800
all be powerful. So I wonder if that's a different kind of power. I love that and I can't resist coming

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:23.680
back to it. Thank you very much because the thing about a complex system and all living things

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:31.200
and all living communities and environments are complex is that they don't have this

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.200
efficient causation at the back of them that pushes things forward. Instead, there is

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.880
as much bottom down as top up causation, if you'd like to think of it in those ways,

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.800
but there are also different kinds of causes. We've selected one of Aristotle's four causes,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.640
the efficient cause, and think that is what causation is. But in fact, people's behavior

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.680
is caused also by aspirations towards certain things, by being drawn effortlessly towards

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:07.680
something that is good, beautiful and true, what he called a final cause. And there are also formal

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.520
causes which are becoming important in both biology and physics. Where is the information about form

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.360
in that DNA code? Actually, there must be form fields, as physics suggests,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.120
so in biology. And this is now entering into the mainstream. It was a bit fringe, but it's now

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.080
entering into the mainstream. So there are other ways of thinking about how things are caused,

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.400
which are in the round and are beautiful and attractive, not being pushed from behind.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, beautiful. Botanical power. Botanical power, I like it.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:52.640
All right, well, let's ask Stuart Campbell to ask the next question. So Stuart, if you can,

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:58.800
I will ask you, unmute you here, and if you can ask your question out loud, please.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:07.200
Yeah, thanks, Lee. So I have a bit of a concern with the term imagination or idea of imagination,

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:15.440
as it's kind of commonly conceived, and that is that human beings can imagine quite wildly and

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.200
quite disconnectedly from reality. So my interest is in getting a clear sense of how you discern

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:33.920
imagination and maybe as differentiated from what. In other words, how do we temper imagination or

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.720
have imagination relate fittingly to reality? I mean, we could say that the left hemisphere

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.880
imagines itself the master. So if you get the tension that I'm trying to speak to here,

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.320
I'd love to hear what you have to say. I certainly do see what Stuart's talking about.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:14:02.480
And of course, imagination is not just some kind of faulty thinking. And I'm tempted to refer to

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:11.120
the saying by their fruits, you shall know them, that in a way, you know imagination when you

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.360
experience it, and you know when you find it in others, that it is not a fantasy of theirs.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:29.280
Imagination can include dark things, but its general trend is towards life and vivification,

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:36.960
whereas the appropriation of masterhood by the left hemisphere is a kind of blow for death,

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.840
if you like, for mechanism. So there isn't, of course, unfortunately, a way we can

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.360
measure in any sense imagination. And of course, we can't image it on a on a on a

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.080
wretched PET scan or anything like that. We're talking about something which is profoundly

01:14:52.080 --> 01:15:01.840
and only experiential. And so imagination can lead people astray. This is right. But I think

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.360
it's rather like being in the groove that you know when your imagination is taking you somewhere

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.120
good. If you have ever had, which I only very occasionally have had the experience of really

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.600
writing a poem rather than just versifying, you kind of know when something is happening through

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.400
you. And I think that imagination is like that. It's rather like playing music while singing,

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.720
while dancing. Well, that's the best I can say it's completely won't stand up in a court of law,

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:32.000
but it's the best I can do. Help me out, Phoebe. I'm sure you've got something better to say.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.760
Well, I've got an easy out, which is moral imagination, obviously, because it, you know,

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.520
what I like to say is that, you know, imagination gave rise to nuclear weapons, you know,

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.440
imagination is not, it's not, but it's not necessarily positive. But I resonate with what

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.160
you're saying, Ian, which is that there is, you know, we're talking about a kind of

01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.960
opening the doors of perception and allowing the sacred to flow through.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.560
Exactly. Imagination being the kind of seeing through and allowing, you know,

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:13.280
that real sense of connection to the world or experience of reality. Whereas what I think,

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.640
Stuart, you were talking about is more kind of almost like active imagination, actively imagining

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.960
things and can obviously lead to bad things and good things and a kind of directed

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.720
imagination. I don't think that stands up in a court of law either. But I think it's a good

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:39.440
question. I think there's also something about not being just a head, you know, head based thing.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.280
It's also heart. It's also embodied and it's throughout. And how do we bring alive that

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.200
imagination that, you know, that is not just using the neurons of the head, but the neurons of the

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:58.400
gut and the heart and there's so much more there. I hope that. Yeah, I love that. Yeah.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.160
And I think also, well, maybe we've had enough on this question, but, you know,

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.280
when people want to be imaginative, and I'm sure this is nothing to do with anything you do,

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.240
but, you know, they say, come on, let's have a brainstorming session, you know, and my

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.800
bet noir is the brainstorming session. Doesn't matter how crazy it is, we put it on the board and

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.960
so on and let it all hang out. This is not actually how creativity works. And I make a big

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.160
distinction. I have a whole chapter separate to the imagination of creativity, because I'm talking

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.280
really about how the brain can be helped in this. And it is nothing to do with this

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:44.560
and simply letting it all hang out. That is not likely to end up with anything very useful.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.480
And when you look at people who are truly creative, they operate in a completely different way from

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.280
the person who is trying to be creative. If you're not creative, then don't worry,

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.760
you're not a creative person for now. Maybe later, you will be. But right now, you're not a creative

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:06.080
person, but don't try to be creative because it's counterproductive. Do not try. I feel like that's

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.000
a kind of yoda. There's a yoda quote there. Don't try, just do.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:17.520
Oh right, okay. My life has been yoda poor, I'm afraid, but there we are.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.280
Sorry for the introduction there. I was just going to say it actually is quite a good

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.360
segue into the next question, which is from Rosalind Murray. So I've just

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.160
unmuted you, Rosalind, if you'd like to ask your question live, please go ahead.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.160
Thank you. Yeah, I was just interested in, well, William Blake is great,

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:51.520
but he passed away in 1827. So I'm just kind of wondering if you can speak to

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.760
contemporary art ideas and imagination. I mean, there's a whole world in contemporary art

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:05.200
that touches on all the things you're speaking about. It's a huge area at a lot of talks

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:11.920
like this. And many others maybe that come from a literature side, often you're getting conversation

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.200
that relates to artists that are very long ago and not about what's going on now. And this is a

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.960
huge area which already is exploring what you're talking about. So I'm just all of the things

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.440
you're talking about, but kind of gets left out of the conversation. So I'm just wondering,

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:35.200
is there any space within that that influences your work, but from a much more contemporary

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:44.400
perspective? Who is that aimed at both of us? Yeah, that would be great.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.400
You're still there. I would also love to hear the artists. I feel like there are some artists

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:58.640
that perhaps you're holding dear to imagination, if there's any that you'd like to name before we

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:07.440
speak about our own. I wouldn't because there's so many artists from so many cultures that if I

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:15.520
started to even dig into specific artists, specific approaches, and even that brings me back to this

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.800
question, another aspect of the question, which tonight and often this idea of we, like there is

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:30.400
no one single we, we is a conglomerate. So I'm kind of interested in the positioning of us,

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.880
we, because we are not. And so even when we say we as a group of people

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.280
act in this way with imagination, that's not true, because there's a whole group of people

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.880
who are maybe artists or naturally creative or have invested a huge amount of time

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:55.200
in a particular practice of art and art understanding and learning creativity and imagination,

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.200
you know, developing that, that are not operating in that way. And then there are people in other

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:07.360
cultures that don't operate in that way. So I think I wouldn't like to pick specific people

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.440
because there's so much rising and so many people. I'd just be interested in if you had anything from

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:19.280
a more contemporary place that you were coming with yourselves. So however, you don't want to

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.520
answer the question, but you're asking us to answer it. That's absolutely fine. And the reason

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:30.640
that Blake came up, I think it's fair. I don't think that's fair. No, no, I'm not. That's not a

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:40.080
fair response. Okay, because well, it sounds like I'm just asking those contemporary art influence

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.240
your thought and practice in this area. Maybe there. That's a better way. The reason the reason that

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:53.680
Blake came up, I think was twofold. One is that he's a he's very unusual in that he writes about

01:21:53.680 --> 01:22:00.240
imagination all the time. He not only uses imagination, but he rather unusually writes about

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.360
it. Most great poets don't. Wordsworth perhaps was another.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.840
And possibly Coleridge, but it's not very common. I mean, the other is that he is a towering genius.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:19.760
I mean, he doesn't nobody like him in the history of literature. He's utterly unique and incredibly

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:26.560
important. And the fact that he died in 1827 has no nothing whatever to do with it. If he died in

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:34.000
1827 BC, he would be worth exactly as much as if you were alive now, because as Phoebe says,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.440
there is no time in the realm of true imagination. These are timeless words, timeless truth. But if

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:48.560
you ask me to say, what poets do I like? What painters do I like? And so on. I can say that.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.680
I mean, one of the things that often happens when I'm giving a talk is that I have a painting behind

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.440
me by Ross Love Day, which I think is a perfect expression of the modern imagination and that

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:06.640
it is a kind of absolutely non-pindownable landscape. And it's also a fantastic abstract

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.440
that seems to mean something beyond whatever landscape is being hinted at. So that would be

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:18.800
an example of modern work, which is deeply imaginative. And it's not trying to give me a message.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.880
I mean, it's death to a work of art when it's got a message. And there's a little plot beside

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.560
what the artist was trying to do with, you know, or what the composer really meant.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:32.160
Well, no, great art speaks to itself and is not trying to persuade you of anything. That's what

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:39.440
I'd say. But apologies if I offended the question. I was being a bit frivolous. I mean, you have to

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:50.240
take that as part of the game. Anyway, over to you, Phoebe. So rather than naming specific artists

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:57.440
or musicians, but I might end up doing that. But I think what the question, what it brought up for

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:03.440
me, which I think is a very relevant and interesting one, is the kind of movement ecology around

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:10.240
imagination. You know, who's there? And I speak about something called imagination justice,

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.280
which is actually who gets to imagine, you know, where is the imagination capital in the world?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.920
Like, at the moment, it's being hoarded by usually kind of tech CEOs in Silicon Valley who

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.840
will look and sound a certain way and also have a lot of money. You know, and there's a thing around

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:34.800
who gets to imagine, which is also not just who gets to imagine, but who's imaginations get to

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:41.280
then translate into, you know, affecting and creating and worlding, you know, this concept of

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:48.480
worlding from, I think, from feminist critical theory is about how some people get, you know,

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.200
get to create the world. You know, and as I'm thinking, I'm going to forget who said this,

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:03.200
but it matters who, world's worlds. It's a very famous quote by a writer who does influence me

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.640
a lot in imagination. I'm having a blank now. You know, it matters what words, words and world's

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.000
worlds. It's not just me. It's staying with the trouble is her book.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.960
Anyway, but something we didn't, sorry, Ian, just to add, something we didn't

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.640
go far away. Thank you so much, Madalina. Something we didn't come onto, which I think is really

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:37.520
relevant, is that there is a living, you know, living group of people who, Indigenous people,

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.840
whose whole culture, you know, who have been keeping alive a culture of imagination and, you

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.840
know, resisting, not all, again, it's very easy to generalizations and labels like not all Indigenous

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.640
people, but Indigenous cultures, I think, really deserve a mention here because there is a living

01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:01.280
breathing continuum of a way of being in the world and principles, you know, principles, ways of

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.120
living relationship to the natural world. So there is a stewarded culture that is keeping

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.080
imagination alive in the ways that we've just been talking about, Ian. I'd love to hear, you

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.400
know, if you have anything to say about that, because I think it's very relevant to the question.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.040
I'd just say a hundred percent agree. I mean, I resonated with everything you said,

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:28.800
and we're interestingly driving to extinction the little pockets of wisdom that we could be

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:36.160
learning from. And unfortunately, one very great pocket, namely China, has chosen, instead of

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:44.640
offering wisdom that it once had, has chosen to become a delinquent Western state. But I love

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.800
what you say about the Indigenous people and the wisdom that is there, and it's very, very important.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:27:00.160
Thank you. I'd like to invite Mark, Reid, to ask your question, please. And this might be the last

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:06.720
one, depending on the response time, just because we'd like to end it 40 minutes after, as we've

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.800
promised, the 100 minute event. But let's see. Thanks. Thanks very much. Thanks, Phoebe and

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:18.800
Ian McGillicrice. Ian, I love your books. You're an incredible writer. And Phoebe, this is great to

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.720
hear about you and the moral imagination. My question is about the moral imagination.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.560
First of all, the first time I heard about moral imagination was in a book by Rudolf Steiner,

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.800
who I've talked to Ian about before. It's the philosophy of freedom. And there's

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.640
more than imagination, you can see. But anyway, my question is, and we talked about, like you

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:44.480
talked about developing the imagination, you know, do you either of you advocate any spiritual

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.880
practices, or do you do any spiritual practice yourself to develop the imagination? And

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.320
while I ask that question, because you talk about moral development, Steiner talks about

01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:02.640
developing imagination, inspiration and intuition. But he said, in every step in

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.160
spiritual development should be three steps in moral development. That's really important.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.000
And I think that's often what happens, that people do develop these, and actually, you know,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.800
this might sound crazy, but something like Trump, who is a big fan of Norman Vincent Peel and the

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.320
power of positive thinking, I think has developed a great powers of imagination, believe it or not.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.840
And that is really to power. I like with that, but no moral development whatsoever.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.120
So I'm just curious about yourselves. Do you have spiritual practices to develop imagination?

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.440
If it's you Phoebe, go ahead. You're the moral imagination person here.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:53.840
Yeah. It's interesting. I avoid the word spiritual, usually. I think there's a lot of

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.920
baggage. And I also think there's a huge amount of spiritual bypassing that goes on, you know,

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.040
the things that use the word spiritual and are incredibly harmful and incredibly

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:09.680
lacking in any kind of sense of the sacred or morality. So I stay away from that word.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.920
I think the work that we're doing in moral imaginations, the work that Ian talked about,

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.840
the three pillars of future generations, ancestors, and the more than human world is

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:30.160
profoundly spiritual. Like I think part of why, I mean, I feel incredibly grateful and kind of

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:35.120
honored to do this work every day is because it, I wouldn't call it that, you know, we're going

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.600
into local councils, we're working with, you know, large institutions. But what we are trying to do

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:48.800
is create a space and practice that is profoundly connecting to the sacred. When you imagine having

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:54.720
a conversation with a person, seven generations in the future, you know, to touch on Iroquois

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.680
indigenous thinking, that is profoundly spiritual and sacred. So to me, this imagination work that

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.640
I'm doing, it's not frivolous. It's not about the future. It's not about innovation and technology.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:13.520
It is deeply sacred and spiritual. And, you know, personally, you know, I meditate, I try and spend

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:19.040
a lot of time in nature. I think meditation, you know, that Rob Bebea is a really interesting

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.400
Buddhist teacher who actually works a lot with imagination within the kind of Buddhist practice.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:29.280
So if anybody is interested, I'd recommend looking at his work. But I think right now,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:36.000
that I guess I only have so much capacity for spiritual work. And basically, my job is

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.160
doing that kind of spiritual work and bringing people together and creating spaces where people

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.600
can connect with the, with the imaginal with their sense of what's important, what matters.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.320
And so that's my, that's my answer.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.960
And Ian, do you meditate? I'm just curious.

01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:01.280
Yes, I do. At least it's what I call meditation, which is my understanding of mindfulness.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.440
Which I think is an important practice that should be taught in schools,

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.960
so that everyone knows how to do this. It's not, it's not like there's some complicated

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.920
technique. It's just remembering to stop certain things happening. And as I keep saying,

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.240
the first step in creativity sounds negative to the Western mind, because we think in these

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:29.600
polar ways that you must be push, push, push. But sometimes actually you get, if you're pushing

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:36.000
at a dormant pull, then you're doing the wrong thing. And a lot of the time it's about stopping,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.960
stopping doing the things that are going on in my head. And remembering with gratitude the things

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:54.560
that I do love and learn from and feel connected to in my day, in my days. I'm lucky that I live,

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.920
well, by choice in a rather remote place where I'm surrounded by nature, which is a constant

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:08.640
companion and reminder. Like Phoebe, I dislike the word spiritual, which can be anything from

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:15.840
having a scented bath with candles to, you know, I just don't, I think the term is terribly

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.800
reduced. But on the other hand, people react very badly if you talk about religion for reasons I

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.720
completely understand, although in the end I would, I would caution people not to dismiss by any means,

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:33.920
cry, the incredible traditions of the great religions of the world, including Buddhism,

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.480
if you call it a religion, which I think a lot of Buddhists do, and quite rightly, because it's

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:45.680
in touch with the divine. So I, what am I saying? I'm saying I don't, I don't, I don't actually

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:52.080
sign up for anything. This is bad, I believe, I don't go to a church, partly because any of the

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.000
churches that are within striking distance for me would not be of the kind that I particularly

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.880
want to go to. And I would find it very difficult, I think, but I don't approve of that point of

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:11.600
view. I approve of the point of view where you go and you, you form part of a community. So I'm

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:18.240
putting my hands up here as, you know, I'm not, not, not any expert on any of this. I'm just

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:25.360
like, I guess a lot of people listening to this muddling my way through life as best I can,

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.720
you know. And when I last checked, I was still alive and that's good.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:36.400
Thanks. The word spiritual, it's funny, I think I'm trying to reclaim that word because I know

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:43.280
it has a dirty, you know, association, like the religion. And very much I was brought up, you know,

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:51.120
hating religion as a Catholic, because it was very moralistic, in a bad way, in an exterior way,

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.480
but yeah, meditation, mindfulness. And that's what I meant, really, you know, I

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:03.120
spoke, yeah. Look, thank you very much for your... Can I loop back around? Just to say that I think

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:09.040
there, you know, I said, I do meditate, but I think just really in parallel to the conversation we

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.600
just had about imagination, I think there's something about bringing, you know, to me being alive in

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.680
the, you know, the Anthropocene, whether we use that word or not, but being alive in this time and

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:25.680
being really awake and sensitive to what is going on is a spiritual, you know, it is spiritual.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.280
Like, I think that's kind of what you ended on, Ian, is like, I'm alive. I'm, you know,

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.040
that is a spiritual experience. And going and sitting and closing my eyes and meditating,

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:39.600
I don't actually think of as more spiritual than the kind of constantly waking up, being like,

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.920
this is what's happening, who am I? What am I choosing to do? How do I see it as sensitive

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.720
to the pain of the world, to what is happening? I'm just saying that we are reaching to 100

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:56.480
minutes. I don't want to upset Jonathan, even though he's not here, by taking us over. But

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.760
it's a really good question. It really got me thinking that there's, you know, the answer I gave

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:06.880
first, and then there was a sort of emergency. Yes. And what the hell about the timing? Sorry,

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:14.080
I'm just going to say something. The, you know, the idea that one should push towards a spiritual

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:22.880
goal is also something that requires awareness of its negative side. So, you know, to be extremely

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.960
zen, you know, the answer to being spiritual is to not try and be spiritual at all. You know,

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:37.520
however, it's very good putting on my western hat to have a routine of sitting down and perhaps

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.680
reading a certain text or being quiet and meditative. There we are.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.800
And somebody put a paradox mindset, but we haven't got time to talk about that, I suppose.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:56.240
I saw that. I saw many good questions. Ian and Phoebe will send you the questions

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:04.320
so that you have a chance to look at them. And for everyone, thank you so much for being here

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:08.080
and for those of you that were asking questions and who wanted to ask that didn't have the time,

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:14.880
please bring them to the Connection Session next Tuesday. And I also wanted to mention

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.720
that in two weeks' time, there's Isabella Granich, who's going to be in conversation with Ian.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:28.080
She is a researcher and facilitator. She works in, kind of, from a developmental science

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:33.920
background, works with adolescents. We'll have more information about who she is and the

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:39.760
topic of the conversation very shortly. Michael has put it in the chat, so if you want to

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.320
register already for that next session. And this will also go in a sort of modified form

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.320
on YouTube once we make the edits. So if you want to replay this, you'll be able to do that.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.160
And you'll see that link come out in a few days. But I think just for now, I wanted to really thank

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.200
Phoebe and Ian for taking the time to speak together. I personally found it incredibly

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.200
interesting to listen to the two of you in conversation. So thank you very much and good

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:19.200
evening and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
