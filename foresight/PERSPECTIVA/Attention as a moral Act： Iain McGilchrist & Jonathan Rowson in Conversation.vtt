WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
Welcome. Good to be here. Thank you for coming. My name is Jonathan Rousson. I am Director

00:11.360 --> 00:19.040
of Perspectiva and I have known Ian for 12 years, I realized today, and in that time

00:19.040 --> 00:25.840
come to understand his work, I hope, and certainly enjoyed his work and found a great

00:25.840 --> 00:29.920
deal of importance in it, and we're the very proud publishers of The Matter with Things,

00:30.960 --> 00:38.560
which is an extraordinary book over two volumes, and the paperback has just come out officially

00:38.560 --> 00:44.320
today. So tonight's event is partly a way of marking the, I don't know if it's still a launch

00:44.320 --> 00:48.960
when it happens the second time, but the kind of re-enchantment of the book through the act,

00:48.960 --> 00:56.000
let's say, and Perspectiva, for those who don't know, we think that based on the

00:56.720 --> 01:00.800
data we could receive from who's joining tonight, roughly a third of you are familiar with

01:00.800 --> 01:07.120
Perspectiva, and maybe roughly two-thirds not so much. We are a charity based in London,

01:07.120 --> 01:13.360
although our reach is quite global because of the digital world, and we have staff that are

01:13.360 --> 01:19.840
outside of London as well, and we are funded primarily by the Fetzer Institute in the USA,

01:20.640 --> 01:24.640
and I say that now because that's what makes tonight's event being free possible,

01:25.440 --> 01:31.120
that and an additional funding that we've received, particularly for this event, and

01:34.240 --> 01:38.160
Perspectiva, it's worth just saying a few things about it to contextualize why we're

01:38.160 --> 01:45.200
interested in Ian's book and what the series is about. So we sometimes call ourselves an urgent

01:45.200 --> 01:51.360
100-year project, and it's interesting when you say that. Some people hear the 100 years and think

01:51.360 --> 01:57.440
that's far too long, and the point of saying urgent 100-year project is deliberately to get that

01:57.440 --> 02:03.600
problem of sort of playful paradox being somehow the reality of things, that we think that we do

02:03.600 --> 02:07.920
urgently need to rethink the world, reimagine the world, we conceive the world, but at the same

02:08.000 --> 02:14.640
time, it's not something that is in kind of action panic mode, we're not in the business of

02:15.600 --> 02:20.560
trying to put fires out as such, we're trying to reconceive the world from first principles and

02:20.560 --> 02:26.160
give intellectual permission and social permission to people who want to try to reimagine how the

02:26.160 --> 02:32.560
world might be, not just next year, but in 10 years or in 100 years, and that kind of work often

02:32.640 --> 02:39.280
takes quite a philosophical dimension, but a lot of our work is also applied, we do a lot of

02:39.280 --> 02:45.840
sort of social innovation of various kinds, and of course a publisher, so there's more to say,

02:45.840 --> 02:50.400
but if you'd like to understand perspective a better, someone can put in the chat our website

02:51.760 --> 02:57.200
and do have a look around. Although tonight's event is free, you are very welcome to make a

02:57.200 --> 03:02.000
donation, if you're interested in the work we do already, or if you're becoming interested,

03:03.040 --> 03:06.000
and later after this event, we'll be asking if you want to sign up to our

03:06.640 --> 03:12.080
work and get to know us better, so first of all welcome, and I'm very grateful to Ian for making

03:12.080 --> 03:22.880
it possible to have so many of you here. So this series is called Attention as a Moral Act,

03:23.920 --> 03:29.680
and I want to just draw your attention to a line in the first book here, The Big Tomes,

03:29.680 --> 03:37.200
so it just takes a second to come to it, but Ian, for those of you who don't know Ian's work,

03:37.200 --> 03:46.240
and I'm assuming we're working on the assumption that you mostly do, and he says here, we'll just

03:46.240 --> 03:53.360
find it, yeah, it's not a small claim, Ian says this right at the beginning of the introduction,

03:54.000 --> 04:01.360
I believe we have systematically misunderstood the nature of reality, I believe we have systematically

04:01.360 --> 04:07.760
misunderstood the nature of reality and chosen to ignore or silence the minority of voices

04:08.640 --> 04:12.880
that have ensured it as much and consistently maintained that this is the case.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.600
Now we have reached the point where there is an urgent need to transform

04:18.400 --> 04:24.240
both how we think of the world and what we make of ourselves, attempting to convey such a richer

04:24.240 --> 04:30.160
insight is the ambition of this book, so he sets himself a very high bar that we're systematically

04:30.800 --> 04:37.280
misunderstood, misrepresented reality, and what's interesting for me as a civil society,

04:37.280 --> 04:42.800
leader of a civil society organization is, many people ask how to make Ian's work relevant,

04:42.800 --> 04:47.920
and this is a non-trivial task, as someone who's been alongside it in some way for 12 years,

04:48.720 --> 04:53.520
it's not as simple as because Ian says X, the policy should be Y, it's never that simple,

04:54.720 --> 05:01.360
but Ian's comment there does point to this quality of kind of the need to reconceive

05:01.360 --> 05:06.800
who we are and what we're living for at a very fundamental level, to have a chance of surviving

05:06.800 --> 05:13.600
and thriving in the 21st century and beyond, so the stakes are kind of high, so the combination

05:13.600 --> 05:19.120
of the really high stakes, but often the quite deeply philosophical content makes it a particular

05:19.120 --> 05:26.000
kind of discussion, it's important for me, our job here in this series, is to try to move the

05:26.000 --> 05:32.240
conversation towards people beginning to perceive it and experience it and understand

05:33.040 --> 05:37.840
the view of the world presented in these books in a way that allows them to act differently,

05:38.400 --> 05:43.200
not as kind of premise to conclusion, but as a shift to perception, a kind of metanoia,

05:43.200 --> 05:48.320
sort of completely new frame of mind that allows them to live differently, to prioritize

05:48.320 --> 05:52.720
differently, and so on, so that's what this series is about, and we call it attention as a moral act

05:53.280 --> 05:58.800
to get to that feeling of it matters how you attend to the world, and these books help to explain

05:59.360 --> 06:05.360
both what that means and why, and we're going to have, we already have scheduled for two weeks

06:05.360 --> 06:10.960
time Zach Stein, and then laterally, soon after that, we have Phoebe, Zach Stein will be speaking

06:10.960 --> 06:16.080
about value, value-ception, the notion of value as being something that you can actually perceive,

06:16.080 --> 06:21.600
a very profound notion in Ian's work, Phoebe Tekel will be grappling with imagination,

06:21.600 --> 06:25.440
she's an imagination activist she calls herself, so she'll be interested in the kind of theoretical

06:25.440 --> 06:32.240
basis of her work, Bonito Roy will be speaking about the notion of what it means for a society to be

06:32.240 --> 06:37.200
insane, whether we are in some meaningful sense insane, the book's subtitle, as you may know,

06:37.200 --> 06:42.800
is our brains, our delusions, delusions, sorry, delusions, and the unmaking of the world, so

06:42.800 --> 06:47.840
this notion of what it means to be deluded at scale will be that focus, and then we also have a

06:47.840 --> 06:53.680
discussion on the physics in Ian's book with a physicist, Philip, can you remind me of his second

06:53.680 --> 06:59.600
name? Philip Goyle. Philip Goyle, sorry, Philip Goyle, who will get into the sort of the depth

06:59.600 --> 07:04.720
of the physics that underlies some of Ian's theorizing, so that's ahead, and then we have

07:04.720 --> 07:11.520
another six or so after that, and we want this conversation to go on to try and really tease

07:11.520 --> 07:18.160
out from unusual places what to make of Ian's work, like how does it help us reorient to the

07:18.240 --> 07:25.920
situation of the world at the moment, so that's all going on, and I think I've mentioned everything

07:25.920 --> 07:32.080
essential, so the first question really, I want to speak to Ian tonight about something I call

07:32.080 --> 07:36.800
the McGillchrist manoeuvre, half and jet, totally an earnest, but we're going to come to that a

07:36.800 --> 07:42.560
little bit later, the first thing I want to do really is most people here know Ian as a talking

07:42.560 --> 07:48.160
head, perhaps from Channel McGillchrist, perhaps from a lecture, and they'll know his writings

07:48.160 --> 07:54.560
from his books, but there is an intellectual formation story, you know, Ian sometimes gives

07:54.560 --> 07:59.920
the impression of being a polymath, but it wasn't always thus, and so I'm interested in if you could

07:59.920 --> 08:08.400
please, slowly but surely, yet somewhat quickly, talk us through the key turns of your intellectual

08:08.400 --> 08:13.600
formation, because you appear to have this sort of polymathic erudition, and I suppose I mentioned

08:13.600 --> 08:24.240
doesn't know where it came from. Well, as with all polymathic erudition, it's probably not as

08:24.240 --> 08:32.720
exciting as it looks, but it started in childhood, I was a very, I was kind of a curious child,

08:32.720 --> 08:38.080
and that's probably true as well, and I was interested in many things, my father was a doctor,

08:38.160 --> 08:44.560
but it was mainly my mother's father, my grandfather's interest in science that fired my

08:44.560 --> 08:50.560
imagination as a child, he used to love going to stay with him and being, he showed me many

08:50.560 --> 08:57.920
fascinating things in science, in the workshop, in the garden, and so on, and that made me think,

08:58.720 --> 09:03.440
wow, this is something I really need to know more about, and I suppose that was the general drift

09:03.440 --> 09:12.800
of my intellectual life, until I, at the age of 12, which is of course a very important turning

09:12.800 --> 09:23.760
point for everybody, I got to be at a school where I could explore many things, and I've really

09:23.760 --> 09:29.760
always been philosophically minded, there were a number of things that occurred to me and seemed

09:29.760 --> 09:37.680
terribly important that were different from what everyone taught me, or what everyone seemed to imply

09:37.680 --> 09:44.080
at any rate, and these were things like, that the whole is never the same as the sum of the part,

09:44.080 --> 09:50.240
you know, when I used to say this to people, they'd say, well what is this magical something extra

09:50.240 --> 09:56.080
that goes in there, and at the time I felt, you know, well, that's all very well, but it's not

09:56.080 --> 10:02.720
quite right, but I couldn't articulate it at the time, I can't now I think, and I thought that the

10:02.720 --> 10:16.160
world was not a sort of unresponsive lump of matter, it was a deeply responsive, vibrant,

10:16.160 --> 10:25.600
living, reverberative experience in that whatever it was was a two-way process between

10:25.600 --> 10:32.160
the world around me, particularly the natural world and me, I thought that opposites were not

10:32.160 --> 10:38.400
necessarily as far apart as people seem to think, in fact I started to think that opposites often

10:39.040 --> 10:43.920
seem to coincide and that the further you push something, the more you approach the very thing

10:43.920 --> 10:50.320
you're fleeing from, I thought that history generally seemed to move in spirals, not in a

10:50.320 --> 10:56.960
sort of linear trajectory, and I thought that the general tendency of the analytic mind that

10:58.000 --> 11:04.480
was very much prized in my education, was to take things, abstract them,

11:06.080 --> 11:13.120
decontextualize them, and render them no longer unique and alive, and this was an odd thing,

11:13.120 --> 11:19.280
because doing this was important, it was definitely what we did, and I seem to be good at it,

11:19.280 --> 11:25.680
but I also thought this is not enough, and then, I ultimately-

11:25.680 --> 11:31.440
Your thoughts are arising when you're 12, or is that rather when they began to?

11:31.440 --> 11:37.920
No, I would say probably about 13 or 14, and what happened at the school I was at,

11:37.920 --> 11:45.280
Winchester College, was that you did your own levels in the first term, or at least by the end

11:45.280 --> 11:50.000
of the third term, the end of the first year, so at age 12, when I got one's own levels out of the

11:50.000 --> 11:57.440
way, and the rest of the time was free to really explore many things, and there were three strands

11:57.440 --> 12:04.640
to it, one was a science ladder, one was a humanities, i.e. the history and languages,

12:04.640 --> 12:09.440
and the other was the classics, and everybody had to, whatever they chose as their special area,

12:09.440 --> 12:14.560
they all had to do a hard core that never drops things like mathematics, history,

12:15.600 --> 12:22.320
English, and so forth, and I started off, in short, by jumping onto the science ladder,

12:22.320 --> 12:26.960
because that seemed to me the thing that was most interesting, and I very quickly found as my

12:28.000 --> 12:35.440
mind unfolded in this, and as I became slightly more of a mature person than I was at 12,

12:35.440 --> 12:42.800
that things like history and literature were vastly important, so I hopped at that one,

12:42.800 --> 12:50.800
and then finally I hopped to the classics, so that rather unusually, I managed to straddle

12:50.800 --> 12:55.200
all three of these things, I've never been able to seem to make up my mind about what it is I

12:55.200 --> 13:01.920
particularly want to specialize in, and then I wanted to go to Oxford to study philosophy,

13:02.000 --> 13:10.880
and particularly the kind of philosophy that was not the terrifically dry splitting of hairs,

13:10.880 --> 13:15.840
but the kind of philosophy that saw into the depths of things and had a place in it for the

13:15.840 --> 13:21.440
idea of a god, because I came from a god, I can put it this way, from a godless household,

13:21.440 --> 13:26.880
I mean one in which we never went to church, my parents didn't talk about that kind of thing,

13:27.600 --> 13:36.560
to being in my teens struck by the force of what one can only call the sacred in nature,

13:36.560 --> 13:45.040
in music, in art, and in the fellowship and community in which I lived, so I was changing

13:45.040 --> 13:50.960
at that point, but I'd always wanted to do philosophy, and as I say I was excited because

13:50.960 --> 13:55.520
in Oxford there was a course called philosophy and theology, which was just what I wanted to do,

13:55.520 --> 14:01.280
so I did the exam and I went up for interviews, and I had to do the exam in some school subject

14:01.280 --> 14:06.080
which just happened to be English literature, and the people who interviewed me said, oh you can't

14:06.080 --> 14:12.400
do philosophy and theology, it's not an honours degree, so in 1971 philosophy and theology was

14:12.400 --> 14:17.760
not even an honours degree at Oxford, there's a simple reason it had only just been founded,

14:17.760 --> 14:24.160
and I don't think it had had time to acquire that status, but they said instead you must do PPE,

14:24.240 --> 14:29.120
philosophy, politics, and economics, and I'm sorry to say this to somebody like Hugh Jonathan

14:29.120 --> 14:35.280
who's learned and excited by both philosophy and by both politics and economics, I'm not

14:35.280 --> 14:40.880
particularly, and I wanted the other thing, and they said well look, I don't want to do that,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.640
so they said well come and do literature because it's quite philosophical if you want it to be,

14:45.200 --> 14:52.080
and so I did, I read English literature, after I got my degree I was then

14:52.400 --> 14:59.440
encouraged to sit the exam for Old Souls College which is an odd college, it doesn't have any

14:59.440 --> 15:06.160
students, not graduates, not any kind of students, it's really just a kind of an intellectual

15:06.160 --> 15:11.440
hot house for people who can be assumed to be somewhere near the head of their game,

15:11.440 --> 15:16.000
and it was a very exciting seven years I had there, when I arrived there.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.760
I was thinking before the seven, before you got admission, I want to pause there because I happen

15:19.760 --> 15:25.040
to know something that's of interest to the audience maybe, I took the exam myself I believe

15:25.040 --> 15:34.240
in 2001 and did not pass, but I do remember the, at that time had one of the five papers being a

15:34.240 --> 15:39.760
single word essay question, and the one was diversity which is quite curious given the

15:39.760 --> 15:47.440
current world, but what's also curious is I believe yours was on evil, and do you remember

15:47.440 --> 15:49.760
what you said about evil that got you admission to Old Souls?

15:51.520 --> 15:57.600
Well I wouldn't have remembered, but a philosopher Derek Parfit was a colleague who was so

15:58.720 --> 16:04.320
taken with that essay that I wrote that he photocopied it, and when I became a fellow he gave

16:04.320 --> 16:09.840
it to me, so somewhere in a box in the attic if I could ever find it, there is that essay.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.240
I was alarmed because I sat in this room with I suppose 20 people,

16:16.240 --> 16:21.840
we were competing for at maximum two fellowships, and very often one or none were appointed,

16:22.880 --> 16:29.200
and in the room people started to write after five or ten minutes, and I sat there and I was sort of

16:29.200 --> 16:33.600
thinking half an hour went by, I could see everyone scribbling, I still wasn't writing,

16:33.600 --> 16:40.720
three quarters of an hour went by, and finally at two hours I was just so, if you like wired,

16:40.720 --> 16:51.040
I just thought I've got to write, and I just did in that hot fire of the pressure of time.

16:51.600 --> 16:58.640
Anyway that was that, it's an extraordinary exam, I hope it's not too different these days,

16:58.640 --> 17:02.800
it seems to me to be able to try and take in people who are not just very good at their

17:02.800 --> 17:08.400
special thing, but actually can think broadly about many topics, say there were general papers.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.640
It was you who told me and that they did away with the one word question in the exam.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.480
I think they have done, I think they have.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.960
The quality had decreased so much that they weren't sure it was worthwhile.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.760
I don't know if that's the case, I think that was the case with the language, there was a language

17:24.640 --> 17:30.320
where you just had to translate as many pieces as you could in three hours from Greek, Latin,

17:30.320 --> 17:37.440
German, Spanish, French, Russian, and Italian, I think it was. Anyway, I think they stopped doing

17:37.440 --> 17:41.680
that, I'm sorry about the essay because I think it was a real test of something,

17:43.280 --> 17:50.880
a kind of ability to think broadly and differently. But they do still have, I think,

17:50.880 --> 17:56.720
the special subject papers alongside general papers, so you could, it doesn't matter what

17:56.720 --> 18:01.520
subjects you're taking the exam in, you have to answer some general questions. Anyway,

18:01.600 --> 18:08.880
there it was. And when I got to all servers, I had planned to do a thesis on 18th century

18:10.560 --> 18:16.480
literature and ideas, the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism.

18:17.040 --> 18:24.800
But a number of people, but most vocally, again, Derek Parfit, a very, very considerable

18:24.800 --> 18:29.120
philosopher, I think by most people considered the greatest philosopher of his generation,

18:29.120 --> 18:33.440
had started as a historian. And he said to me, you don't know where you may want to go,

18:34.480 --> 18:39.120
don't do that, you've been given something very special, you can do a doctorate at any college,

18:39.120 --> 18:44.080
but you've been given seven years in which you can do anything and there'll be no questions asked,

18:44.080 --> 18:51.920
you can read what you like. So I did, I spent that time doing a lot of things, I read a lot of

18:51.920 --> 18:57.840
science, of course, but I also read philosophy, went to philosophy seminars and other things,

18:58.320 --> 19:05.040
I found myself a Russian teacher and so on. So that just generally broadened my horizons.

19:05.040 --> 19:09.680
But I began to think at the end of this, what am I going to do next? I don't want to just

19:09.680 --> 19:14.960
to go into some sort of normal academic rut. There's something wrong with the way we studied

19:14.960 --> 19:21.120
literature. And I wrote a book called Against Criticism, published by Faber in 1982, in which

19:21.120 --> 19:27.840
I laid out the philosophical basis for why the academic study of literature is somehow

19:27.840 --> 19:33.200
vitiated, it destroys the very thing it's trying to get hold of. Anyway, I won't go into that,

19:33.200 --> 19:40.480
except to say that in brief, I thought there were three important things about, say, a poem,

19:40.480 --> 19:44.640
was that somebody in the past wrote something that they thought was very meaningful and

19:44.640 --> 19:49.840
important, so important that they poured some very, you know, they suffered in order to produce

19:49.920 --> 19:57.040
this thing. And along we came with our clever, sneering attitudes from the 20th century and sort

19:57.040 --> 20:04.560
of encouraged to deconstruct it in a certain way. But more importantly, what happened was that we

20:04.560 --> 20:11.200
abstracted something that was deeply contextual and embodied. We generalized something that was

20:11.200 --> 20:21.200
unique. And we lost the sense of the living thing that we were looking at that is unique,

20:22.000 --> 20:29.440
embodied, and implicit. And in the process of analyzing it, we'd taken this importantly implicit

20:29.440 --> 20:37.440
material out and made it explicit. And that's as deadly as explaining a joke, explaining a poem

20:37.440 --> 20:44.480
is, you know, death to the poem. So I wanted to move on and I got very interested in this

20:44.480 --> 20:49.600
issue, what was wrong, and it struck me that it was to do with the mind body problem that we

20:49.600 --> 20:55.840
neglected the body. And I was familiar with the philosophers, I went to their seminars and

20:55.840 --> 20:59.840
heard what they had to say about the mind body problem. But it seemed to me they were just too

20:59.840 --> 21:06.560
disembodied in their approach. And so I thought I not to do something more embodied about this.

21:06.560 --> 21:12.560
And at that time, Oliver Sacks had just published Awakenings, which was one of the many sort of

21:12.560 --> 21:20.880
real milestones in my intellectual development. Because here was somebody who related illness to

21:20.880 --> 21:27.600
an analysis of what we are when we are well and healthy, who related what was going on for an

21:27.600 --> 21:33.920
individual person, beautifully realized in his text. And he was able to see in it,

21:33.920 --> 21:40.640
general truth, general philosophical truths through that highly individual vignette.

21:41.280 --> 21:47.680
And that most of what he was saying was actually in the footnotes, it was as implicit as it could

21:47.680 --> 21:52.880
be. So anyway, I thought, well, I want to be somebody like Oliver Sacks. And that meant going

21:52.880 --> 21:59.200
to medical school and learning neurology and going into psychology in the overlap area between

21:59.200 --> 22:03.520
neurology and psychology. So I did that. I became a doctor.

22:03.520 --> 22:07.120
So still down to some words for a second, just because you seem to be saying two things there.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.840
One is, in a very real sense, your first book on literary criticism prefigured the master

22:11.840 --> 22:16.320
in his emissary that came much later. There was a sort of very clear overlap and the kind of

22:16.320 --> 22:22.400
concerns you had. Yes. Which even went back to my my adolescence at school. Yes.

22:22.400 --> 22:27.920
Right. And the second thing is that there's a very clear figure of admiration that sort of

22:27.920 --> 22:33.040
propelled you forward into a way of looking at the person scientifically and philosophically.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.480
I want to make sure we've been a number of days. Yes. Now, I'm worried about just taking up too

22:40.480 --> 22:45.920
much time. It's worthwhile because people don't know these my senses. They don't know these things.

22:45.920 --> 22:53.040
And it's good to work in the land. So then you go to medical school and later become a psychiatrist

22:53.040 --> 22:58.160
and particularly Baltimore, right? And their brain scan things happen.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.840
That's right. But perhaps just before that, I should say that I was at the Maudsley Hospital

23:03.840 --> 23:10.480
in London, the Bethelman Maudsley Hospital, which is a great British teaching hospital.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.480
They would like to think the greatest British teaching hospital in that area.

23:15.760 --> 23:21.040
And I heard a lecture there one day by a man called John Cutting, who became another

23:21.120 --> 23:25.760
influential figure for me. He'd just published a book called The Right Hemisphere and Psychiatric

23:25.760 --> 23:34.160
Disorders with O.P. Oxford. And anyway, I almost didn't go to this lecture, but thank God I did.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.160
Because in it, he talked about the differences between the hemispheres, which are nothing like

23:38.160 --> 23:45.040
what I'd heard in the pop psychology stuff that is all too widely or used to be all too widely

23:45.040 --> 23:52.160
believed. I think I've done something to erode that now. But what he was saying was that the

23:52.160 --> 23:58.320
left hemisphere doesn't seem to be able to understand what is implicit. It understands what is explicit.

23:58.320 --> 24:07.600
So it doesn't get tone of voice, humor, metaphor, irony, sarcasm, facial expression, bodily posture,

24:07.600 --> 24:12.240
all the ways in which we communicate meaning. Secondly, it tends to categorize. So it takes

24:12.240 --> 24:17.840
the unique thing and it categorizes it so that the uniqueness is lost. It becomes a representative

24:17.840 --> 24:23.200
of a type. And the third thing that I remember, but so relevant, was of saying the right hemisphere

24:23.200 --> 24:28.640
is literally more in touch with our embodied being for a number of reasons. I don't need to

24:28.640 --> 24:35.280
mention, but to do with its more rich connections to the limbic system and its relationships to the

24:35.280 --> 24:43.200
hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. Anyway, that fascinated me. I went to talk to John afterwards,

24:43.200 --> 24:49.600
and I then began some research on hemisphere differences. And then I went to Baltimore,

24:49.600 --> 24:56.720
and I was able to join a research group in which people were looking at hemisphere differences.

24:56.720 --> 25:06.320
This was very exciting for me. And I became involved in researching into the abnormal

25:07.520 --> 25:13.200
symmetry or asymmetry in the brains of people with schizophrenia. So in the normal brain,

25:13.200 --> 25:18.480
there is a reliable finding that the left hemisphere is broader and bigger towards

25:18.480 --> 25:24.000
the back and the right hemisphere broader and bigger towards the front. But in schizophrenia,

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
this is often either absent or actually reversed. And interestingly, the very parts that get

25:30.720 --> 25:40.000
affected by this are the parts that underwrite some of our most important capacities for making

25:40.000 --> 25:45.120
sense of the world. They're what's called hetermodal association cortex, particularly the

25:45.120 --> 25:51.920
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and parts of the cingulate.

25:51.920 --> 25:58.880
So these things are very important, and they are abnormal in this condition. And that was

25:58.880 --> 26:03.120
terribly exciting. I was able to map these things and take part in research into it.

26:03.680 --> 26:09.360
But I also, at the same time, received an excited message from John Cutting saying,

26:10.080 --> 26:17.760
you must read a certain book. It's absolutely essential to everything you and I are concerned

26:17.760 --> 26:25.680
about. And it was Louis Sass's book Madness and Modernism. And its subtitle is Insanity in the

26:25.680 --> 26:31.920
Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought. And this extraordinary book, extraordinarily clearly

26:31.920 --> 26:38.080
and beautifully written, is the product of a mind that was able to range over many things,

26:38.080 --> 26:45.440
over literature, over philosophy, obviously, over psychology, and over the visual arts.

26:45.440 --> 26:51.040
And what he seemed to show was about 20 to 25 aspects of modernism, if you like, the culture

26:51.040 --> 26:58.800
of the 20th century, mainly, and postmodernism that overlapped with elements in the experience

26:58.800 --> 27:05.600
of subjects with schizophrenia. And I kind of knew this, as soon as I read, of course, of course,

27:05.600 --> 27:10.960
it was really the most beautiful moment at which something happened to me that people say happens

27:10.960 --> 27:16.480
when they tell me now, when they read my work, which is kind of, of course, I've sort of realized

27:16.480 --> 27:21.840
this, but had no way of articulating it. Anyway, I mean, obviously, it couldn't be that we'd all

27:21.840 --> 27:28.400
suddenly got schizophrenia, we haven't. But what seems to have happened is that we have ignored

27:28.960 --> 27:34.960
the input of the left hemisphere, people with left hemisphere overdrive or right hemisphere

27:34.960 --> 27:40.800
deficits, look at the world very much in the way that people with schizophrenia do, they become

27:40.880 --> 27:46.240
frankly deluded. And that's why the word delusions is important in the subtitle of the book, The

27:46.240 --> 27:53.520
Matterway Things, because I really believe that we are now in a world in which we have lost touch

27:53.520 --> 27:59.360
with what the right hemisphere could have told us, and we are becoming deluded about what we are,

27:59.360 --> 28:07.200
what the world is like, and so on. So that is some of my intellectual evolution. All these

28:07.280 --> 28:14.080
influences were very important. And I spent the next, I suppose, 20 years writing The Master and

28:14.080 --> 28:20.320
His Emistry. So that really takes you up to the beginning of that one.

28:20.320 --> 28:24.160
So okay, great. Thank you. Well, I hope that was useful for people. It certainly is for me.

28:25.600 --> 28:30.080
And like you said, that takes you up to the publication of The Master and His Emistry,

28:30.080 --> 28:33.200
which I believe it took about 20 years to write, although you were working at the same time, I

28:33.200 --> 28:41.120
suppose. I was working about 55, 60 hours a week at the time. And it only took me 10 years

28:41.120 --> 28:46.080
to write the longer book The Matterway Things, but I was writing full time.

28:47.120 --> 28:52.640
You also, yeah, okay. And so then The Master and His Emistry came out to mostly

28:53.360 --> 28:59.040
critical acclaim, although some critical, some critical aspects of that too, but mostly acclaim.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.360
And then a documentary was made about your work by Vanessa Dillon. And you've been on shows with,

29:07.360 --> 29:14.720
I don't know, John Cleese and, you know, various other people that are very well known household

29:14.720 --> 29:22.160
names. How do you, you feel fulfilled in? Do you feel like you're like at a personal level,

29:22.160 --> 29:23.600
you've done your work in this world?

29:24.560 --> 29:32.560
That's an interesting thing. I think the answer is I can't help being

29:34.000 --> 29:43.120
delighted, touched, and filled with a sense of, yes, of something having gone right. When people

29:43.760 --> 29:47.840
tell me what my work means to them, that is the important thing. And it's not,

29:47.840 --> 29:52.640
yes, I've been on all the chat shows and I've met the various people, but it's,

29:52.720 --> 29:56.800
it's actually when people, individual people that I didn't know, write to me

29:57.840 --> 30:03.280
in the loveliest terms, saying what a difference it has made to their life, not just to their

30:03.280 --> 30:09.200
intellectual life, their thinking, but also to their, to their relationships, to their work,

30:09.200 --> 30:13.360
to everything. And that is, I think is the thing that fulfills me. That is the moment,

30:13.360 --> 30:17.200
that is when I say, okay, it's, it's all worthwhile.

30:17.520 --> 30:24.640
Okay. So I can tell you why, what it means to me. Now, it's a good segue to get to what I felt

30:24.640 --> 30:30.080
recently. So as you know, Ian, I read the entire manuscript of the matter with things,

30:30.800 --> 30:37.040
including all of the appendices and notes, which all inclusive, I believe, comes to,

30:37.040 --> 30:41.360
quite close to a million words, if not actually there, when you factor in absolutely everything.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.720
And I read quite a lot of it on train journeys. I think I said in the launch party of the event that

30:47.520 --> 30:53.200
it was a time when I knew I had to interview you about the book. And I was struggling to read with

30:53.200 --> 30:58.800
my job and family, just finding the time to, to read it. So I actually created excuses to go up

30:58.800 --> 31:03.200
and down to Scotland a few times to meet extended family and made it sound like it was all about

31:03.200 --> 31:07.600
them. And it was, I was also getting myself chunks of five hours each way to read the book.

31:08.400 --> 31:14.720
Anyway, while, while reading it, I noticed something that kept recurring. And it was as if

31:15.440 --> 31:23.440
it was a musical note that you hear come into a song every so often. And at the time, I couldn't

31:23.440 --> 31:29.360
quite place it, but we spoke a bit about it when I was on Sky. And it had a certain kind of pattern

31:29.360 --> 31:34.720
to it that I've laterally called the McGillchrist maneuver. And since then, I've been reading the

31:34.720 --> 31:39.520
book more closely. And I think the heart of the McGillchrist maneuver in so far as it means something

31:40.480 --> 31:47.840
is, is the primary hypothesis of the, what you call the hemispheric hypothesis,

31:48.400 --> 31:56.080
which is broadly the, the brain functioning well, presencing, allowing the world to presence

31:56.080 --> 32:04.880
itself to our own kind of appraisal and perception, then a kind of imperceptible shift towards left

32:04.880 --> 32:12.000
to sort of make sense, categorize, and understand, then I sort of shift back to the right, no longer

32:12.000 --> 32:17.520
quite the same for having received the input of the left. So the first McGillchrist maneuver is a

32:17.520 --> 32:24.160
kind of right, left, right of that form. But then there's a more subtle one, which is a little bit

32:24.160 --> 32:31.440
more analytical sounding, but it's very useful for public conversations, because you hear a lot of

32:31.440 --> 32:36.560
people saying, you know, you're thinking in a two binary manner, it's not either or it's both and,

32:36.560 --> 32:42.800
right? There's a very common refrain, you hear it a lot in sort of popular culture even. And,

32:43.440 --> 32:47.680
what your argument suggests, and you're not probably the first to say this, but you say it

32:47.680 --> 32:53.360
particularly well, and it falls out of the hypothesis as well, is that it's not so much that it's

32:53.360 --> 33:00.640
either or or both and it's in some meaningful sense, either or and both and, but not to the same

33:00.640 --> 33:06.640
extent, right? And that's the kind of like it's many layers of subtlety on that. But you begin to

33:06.640 --> 33:13.120
see this in several different parts of the book. And where the heartland of that maneuver lies,

33:13.120 --> 33:20.080
the kind of source code of it is in chapter 20. Chapter 20 of the book, I can say to people

33:20.080 --> 33:26.080
watching this is the business. If you want to read one chapter of your fundamental work,

33:26.080 --> 33:30.480
honestly, and you think if you've got a glimpse of the argument in general terms already is most

33:30.480 --> 33:35.440
of you have, either from the prior book or just watching a video or whatever, I think you can

33:35.440 --> 33:40.320
understand chapter 20 by itself without much other information. You need to know something

33:40.320 --> 33:47.280
about the hypothesis, but not that much. Chapter 20 for me is like the hinges on the door between

33:47.280 --> 33:51.920
the sort of scientific and philosophical appraisal and the sort of cultural implications.

33:51.920 --> 33:58.160
And for those who don't know, chapter 20 is rendered into simple English as the coincidence

33:58.160 --> 34:04.960
of opposites. But the word coincidence, as Ian points out in the book, has somewhat been tainted.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.280
But nonetheless, so you use the Latin, I guess, coincidence. How do you say it? Coincidence

34:13.280 --> 34:21.760
here? That's the one, right? Thank you. And this is really a beautiful, beautiful chapter.

34:22.400 --> 34:27.920
Because I think that if people who are on a slightly more applied side of things, working in

34:27.920 --> 34:32.320
stable society organizations concerned about climate change, interested in how the arts can

34:32.320 --> 34:38.400
influence culture and thereby influence behavior or whatever. In chapter 20, I think we see

34:39.440 --> 34:46.560
a shift in perception that is really generative of a different way of viewing the world and acting

34:46.560 --> 34:54.640
in it. And I say this, knowing that earlier in the book, in the first volume, you begin the

34:54.640 --> 35:00.320
book by targeting reductionism. Reductionism is kind of the public enemy number one in the first

35:00.320 --> 35:06.880
part of the book. And I think more precisely, reductive materialism. And you make a very strong

35:06.880 --> 35:11.680
case on that, and that stands on its own terms, and it has its own validity and so on. But I think

35:11.680 --> 35:17.200
actually for people in the public realm, trying to fight against reductionism with something more

35:17.200 --> 35:21.920
holistic of the kind you offer, is not necessarily as powerful as

35:22.160 --> 35:26.960
recognising this McGilchrist maneuver in chapter 20. Because what happens there is, the enemy there is

35:26.960 --> 35:33.680
not so much reductionism. It's actually the law of non-contradiction. And the law of non-contradiction

35:33.680 --> 35:39.920
basically says, you know, it can't be night and day, that you can't be right and wrong, it can't

35:39.920 --> 35:47.440
be black and white. And this chapter basically says, actually it can. And in many, many meaningful

35:48.400 --> 35:54.160
senses, not only can it be this, but this is the beating heart of reality. These opposites that

35:54.160 --> 36:00.000
are in some kind of meaningful relationship with each other actually are closer to the heart of

36:00.000 --> 36:05.600
things than the law of non-contradiction would ever be. And if I could just read a few of the

36:07.760 --> 36:14.880
statements you make, for example, you speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality.

36:14.880 --> 36:20.960
I'll just get my notebook which fell under the table, one second. You speak about, yeah, you

36:20.960 --> 36:26.960
speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality. You speak about the

36:29.520 --> 36:35.120
unity of unity and multiplicity. And you also speak somewhere very profoundly, this is the

36:35.120 --> 36:39.840
thing I want to ask you about now, because it relates back to your also's essay on evil indirectly,

36:40.800 --> 36:48.800
is you speak about the equal necessity but unequal status of spiritual opposites.

36:50.960 --> 36:55.760
And this is where you're getting at, it comes from the myth that you begin the second volume with,

36:56.400 --> 37:01.680
but it also speaks to the perennial battle between good and evil. And again, the McGillchrist maneuver

37:01.680 --> 37:07.040
here is very valuable, because what you seem to be saying is it's not that it's the world's either

37:07.040 --> 37:13.280
good or bad, it's not either or, it's not that it's simply that it's good and bad, that's not

37:13.280 --> 37:20.320
quite right either, it's that it's good and bad and it's somewhat more good than bad for particular

37:20.320 --> 37:25.040
reasons. That's how I, at least that's how I read it, so please stop. How do you see it?

37:27.360 --> 37:33.040
Well, I suppose the first thing to say is to anybody who hasn't read the book, I'm not sure,

37:33.040 --> 37:37.760
apart from really in that opening myth, which is just absolutely staggering, which is

37:37.760 --> 37:43.840
something I learned about, comes from an Iroquois people called the Onondaga.

37:45.600 --> 37:52.800
And it's unfortunately too long to go into now, but it is the most stunning introspective

37:52.800 --> 37:57.120
understanding of how the right and left hemispheres work together, that's the way I would look at it.

37:57.680 --> 38:03.120
I don't really talk about the spiritual much. I address that in the last chapter,

38:03.120 --> 38:10.240
28, because I don't want to lose my audience along the way, and I know how all the misconceptions

38:10.240 --> 38:16.720
that surround the idea of the spiritual, the divine and the sacred will lose people,

38:16.720 --> 38:21.600
but I want very strongly to show them that if they follow where I've been and you see the world in

38:21.600 --> 38:26.640
a different way, there's nothing that's irrational or unintelligent about embracing

38:27.120 --> 38:32.800
this idea. There's something very important about it. And I do, yes, I do in that chapter,

38:32.800 --> 38:39.360
chapter 28, at the end of the book, I do briefly talk about the nature of evil, but it's just a

38:39.360 --> 38:46.000
very personal thing. I can't believe the idea that evil is simply a kind of

38:47.920 --> 38:53.440
lessening or falling away of good. I think it has its own dynamism. I think it's real and to be

38:53.440 --> 38:58.880
reckoned with. And I think that this is part of the whole picture of the cosmos, which is that

38:58.880 --> 39:07.760
there are different drives, if you like, that are both needed. And the intellect may try and get rid

39:07.760 --> 39:15.040
of one or diminish one, but actually, that's just cheating. And so when I talk about the

39:15.040 --> 39:21.840
coincidence of opposites, and I use the Latin term coincidentiopositorum simply because it was

39:21.840 --> 39:27.680
the way in which it was first talked about by Nicholas of Cusa, a very interesting philosophical,

39:27.680 --> 39:35.280
scientific-minded cardinal in the 15th century, and by Jung, who I think is enormously important here.

39:37.040 --> 39:42.400
And as a psychiatrist, I can vouch that, you know, however good you think you are,

39:42.400 --> 39:47.440
there is a dark side. And that dark side is very important and recognizing it is enormously

39:47.520 --> 39:53.600
important. The failure to recognize it and understand it leads to damage, destruction,

39:55.280 --> 40:02.400
and disease. And so it's a hugely important thing for each of us individually, but also

40:02.400 --> 40:08.720
for a society as a whole, to realize that in pursuing headlongs, a very simple goal that

40:08.720 --> 40:14.000
looks you perfectly good, you're destroying all kinds of other things that may be very important.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.560
And if you push it too far, you may actually achieve the very opposite of what you intend.

40:18.560 --> 40:27.040
I mean, a very obvious case of this is that anarchy leads to tyranny. So we need, what I'm

40:27.040 --> 40:31.760
definitely not saying is, and people might say, oh, well, if he's saying something about the

40:31.760 --> 40:35.520
coincidence of opposites, doesn't that leave us unable to say anything about anything? Because

40:35.520 --> 40:40.160
really, anything and its opposites are true. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that context

40:40.240 --> 40:46.720
greatly matters. And that these things share in some important way, their qualities.

40:47.680 --> 40:55.760
So we need not, in fact, to reach, we must essentially never reach the position where we've

40:56.480 --> 41:04.000
abolished both of these and just substituted some warm mediocre soup somewhere in the middle.

41:04.000 --> 41:10.800
My point is, we need to hold both of these realities maximally, and yet hold them together.

41:11.520 --> 41:17.120
And this is beautifully imaged in a whole range of ways in the philosophy of Heraclitus,

41:17.120 --> 41:21.280
pre-Socratic philosopher, for me, most important philosopher in the West anyway,

41:21.280 --> 41:27.120
that ever lived. And he has this image of a loop string or a lyre string,

41:28.160 --> 41:33.600
and also the string of a bow that shoots an arrow. And his point is that it needs to be

41:33.600 --> 41:39.200
pulled in opposite directions. And it's very nature, it's very power to do anything at all,

41:39.200 --> 41:45.920
to give a note, to let the arrow fly comes from that tension being held. Now, that is what we,

41:45.920 --> 41:54.000
that is one of the many things we don't perceive. We also don't perceive that reality has this

41:54.000 --> 41:58.560
circular spiral like me, I prefer spiral light, because in fact, it doesn't circle back to where

41:58.560 --> 42:03.520
it was. It circles back to somewhere that seems rather like it, but is now higher up the spiral

42:03.760 --> 42:10.000
because things have happened, time has moved on. But that is an ancient image too, you know,

42:10.000 --> 42:15.280
empedically, it's thought that love and strife are the two elements that cause the world.

42:15.840 --> 42:22.160
And it's there in many philosophies around the world. We can't do away with one and just have

42:22.160 --> 42:27.120
the other as Alan Watts said, we can't just have the peaks and not have the valleys.

42:27.440 --> 42:34.400
Right. So we don't get that right. We don't understand that progress is never linear,

42:34.400 --> 42:38.800
that you're curving back towards the very thing that you fear. And unless you watch out for it,

42:38.800 --> 42:44.000
you will go to the place you really don't want to go to, that everything needs to be seen in

42:44.000 --> 42:49.520
context. And the way in which we talk now is to take things out of context. So all that could in

42:49.520 --> 42:55.760
a way, if you like, be implicit in that chapter on the current sense of opposites and you found it.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.760
Yeah, but also the other thing that I was struck by when I read this by you earlier,

43:01.360 --> 43:08.560
you say very amusingly, but very perturently here, that in your many talks, and you've got

43:08.560 --> 43:14.160
lots of audience feedback and lots of questions, and you say there is a way you put it to me was

43:14.160 --> 43:18.800
there are two things people want, and they can't have either of them. And as I understand it,

43:18.880 --> 43:26.400
you can correct me on this. But the first is that they want one thing to be better than the other,

43:26.400 --> 43:30.240
first of all, so they want the left hemisphere to be bad and the right hemisphere to be good.

43:30.240 --> 43:34.000
And that's not right. We really want the goodie and the baddie. They want the kind of manikin,

43:35.040 --> 43:38.240
right hemisphere, let's all create a right hemisphere world and forget about the left

43:38.240 --> 43:44.560
hemisphere. I'm kind of bitch. It's not that at all. But they also struggle with the idea that

43:44.560 --> 43:47.920
if there's two things that matter, that they necessarily matter equally.

43:50.080 --> 43:55.120
Right. And these things like these two points, I know that for you, they're self evident now.

43:55.680 --> 43:59.440
But I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I read this thinking, how can how can this book

43:59.440 --> 44:05.600
be translated into some form of praxis in the community that I feel as though this kind of

44:06.240 --> 44:12.000
this kind of capacity to see that you can have two things that are both really important.

44:12.720 --> 44:16.160
But one is more important than the other. And yet the other, they need each other.

44:16.960 --> 44:22.240
It's actually counter cultural. It's not actually there as one of our sort of memes of operation.

44:23.200 --> 44:27.200
All the things I'm saying are counter cultural because I believe our culture is founded on

44:27.200 --> 44:34.080
simplistic falsehoods. We've mistaken the nature of reality. That's what I'm saying. And in the

44:34.080 --> 44:39.440
first seven pages or so of the matter of things, I lay out all kinds of things that must strike

44:39.440 --> 44:44.640
people as very improbable. That for example, relations are prior to the things that are related.

44:45.440 --> 44:52.560
Get that. But I stand by that throughout the book. So and just for one, but it's in the

44:52.560 --> 44:57.200
master, it's in the image of the master and his emissary. The master needs the emissary and

44:57.200 --> 45:01.840
knows it. The emissary needs the master but doesn't know it. There's an imbalance in this

45:01.840 --> 45:06.880
relationship. And the emissary is good as long as it remains the emissary. The master is good

45:06.880 --> 45:11.280
as long as the master remains the master. But when the emissary tries to be the master,

45:11.280 --> 45:18.480
it falls apart. Now that image, I didn't know that. I only found out about it afterwards and in the

45:18.480 --> 45:25.520
writing of the matter with things is central to many cultures. There are examples in Chinese

45:25.520 --> 45:30.880
mythology, in Indian mythology, in North American native people's mythologies and so on.

45:31.120 --> 45:37.280
Of this usurping force. And it's actually the subject of what is arguably

45:38.400 --> 45:45.440
the greatest epic poem in the English language, Paradise Lost. It's precisely the story. So

45:45.440 --> 45:50.240
this is a very important one. There's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere as long as it

45:50.240 --> 45:54.480
knows its limitations. But unfortunately, one of the features of being limited is that you are

45:54.480 --> 45:59.840
limited in your knowledge of your limitations. I mean, it's not just that it's limited and

45:59.840 --> 46:05.520
it has to find its proper place in relationship. It's wonderful. It's glorious. It's an extraordinary

46:05.520 --> 46:12.400
capacity, right? And with all due respect, I mean, people have said of your two volumes and

46:12.400 --> 46:18.160
almost million words, it looks like the left hemisphere has won. But I think you would counter,

46:18.160 --> 46:23.200
I think, that this is in the service of the right, which is also quite a valid contention.

46:24.080 --> 46:28.960
Absolutely. I've spent my life struggling to bring the left hemisphere into service to what

46:28.960 --> 46:36.400
the right hemisphere knows. So it is quite true. The book is absolutely stuffed with real science,

46:36.400 --> 46:42.640
with hard science. So 5,600 references in the new book, it goes much further than the master in

46:42.640 --> 46:47.040
his hemisphere and exploring this difference between the hemispheres and nobody can say I

46:47.040 --> 46:51.760
haven't researched this properly. I don't think there are very few people alive in the world who

46:51.760 --> 46:58.480
would be in a position to have read more about it than I have. So there it is. And I use reason.

46:58.480 --> 47:03.520
Reason is my friend, not an enemy. It's just that not everything can be encompassed by reason.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.000
Reason can't explain why a wonderful piece of music is as wonderful as it is.

47:09.040 --> 47:14.160
There are, intuition and reason are both important. And again, when I chose the master

47:14.160 --> 47:19.920
in his hemisphere as the metaphor, I didn't know that quote that is attributed to Einstein, that,

47:19.920 --> 47:24.960
you know, the rational mind is a faithful servant, and the intuitive mind is a precious gift.

47:25.920 --> 47:32.000
We live in a world which honors the servant but has forgotten the gift. Well, in the second part,

47:32.000 --> 47:36.800
the middle part, as you know, of the matter of things, I look at reason, science, intuition,

47:36.800 --> 47:41.280
and imagination and basically suggest that all of these are very important in their different

47:41.280 --> 47:48.640
ways and we need to be able to make use of them appropriately. Okay, all well taken. And as always

47:48.640 --> 47:54.320
with your book, there's a kind of hermeneutic kind of process going on in which you have to go over

47:54.320 --> 47:58.240
many different aspects of your argument again and again until the full picture becomes clearer.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.480
And one of the things I was struck by, again, just focusing on chapter 20 for a second,

48:03.760 --> 48:09.360
it is the case, and sorry, not if, it clearly is the case. You argue it well, it's very compelling,

48:09.360 --> 48:15.360
I believe it, that we live in a world of the coincidence of opposites, a world in which resistance

48:15.360 --> 48:21.920
is a critical feature of life, opposition is necessary, movement or primary and all of the

48:21.920 --> 48:26.640
things that you argue in the second volume. If that's the case, it's natural that we'll

48:26.640 --> 48:31.040
struggle to perceive that without the language forms to perceive it. So on the one hand, what

48:31.040 --> 48:37.040
you're getting is a lot of people broadly of the right hemisphere perspective, insuiting that you're

48:37.040 --> 48:40.640
right. Of course Ian's right, this is why your book's so successful. Have you read Ian's book?

48:40.640 --> 48:46.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And yet when it comes to trying to put it to work, without the language forms to

48:46.480 --> 48:51.840
actually render this back to the right hemisphere in a way that gives a fuller picture of context,

48:52.400 --> 48:56.160
we'll struggle. In that respect, I was very struck that there are at least three words

48:56.720 --> 49:04.000
in chapter 20, big words, and there's no lack of them in the books, that I feel people don't

49:04.000 --> 49:09.120
really know, I know they do not know them, but the fact that they don't know them means they

49:09.120 --> 49:14.960
can't really perceive what they're pointing towards as well. So the first is hormesis,

49:15.920 --> 49:21.840
the second is syllapsis, tell me about the finesse there, and the other, and I always struggle to

49:21.840 --> 49:29.280
say this, but the enantiodromia is another. Can you talk us through what these three words mean

49:29.280 --> 49:33.680
and why they matter? Because I think we sort of need to know to get a sense of what we're talking about.

49:35.200 --> 49:44.560
Hormesis is a term from physical chemistry, originally, and it refers to the fact that

49:44.560 --> 49:51.360
something that is toxic in substantial doses may actually be helpful and health-promoting

49:51.440 --> 49:59.040
in small doses. There are certain very obvious examples of this, one is digitalist derived

49:59.040 --> 50:04.960
from the Fox Club, which is extraordinarily poisonous, but has been used since the 18th century and is

50:04.960 --> 50:13.200
still the basis of the most effective treatments for heart failure. Arsenic, which has also been

50:13.200 --> 50:19.200
used for 2,000 years, in very small doses can be extremely helpful, they're obviously large doses

50:19.920 --> 50:27.040
and atropine, which is derived from deadly nightshade, can restore function to people with

50:27.040 --> 50:36.400
certain neurological diseases. But it really was first described and probably is still most used

50:36.400 --> 50:42.160
in describing the effects of radiation, where large doses of radiation can obviously be damaging

50:42.160 --> 50:48.800
and cause cancers, but small doses of radiation can in fact be health-promoting and can in fact

50:48.800 --> 50:54.000
prevent the development of cancers in laboratory animals. It's all to do with the scale. Now that

50:54.000 --> 51:00.000
is so important, because what was I saying earlier, if you push and push something, you lose it.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.880
And actually it says this in the book of changes, in the Yi Qing, he who doesn't know when he has

51:06.880 --> 51:12.640
achieved enough, but pushes further, loses it. So that is very important. And there's an interesting

51:12.640 --> 51:18.240
observation that makes it vivid here. When people were looking at the biosphere 2, which is an

51:18.240 --> 51:27.360
enormous protected environment, which was erected to see how plants and even animals would respond

51:27.360 --> 51:32.320
to being in this protected environment, they were puzzled by the fact that healthy trees

51:32.320 --> 51:38.240
tended to fall over before reaching maturity. And what they discovered in brief was for a tree

51:38.240 --> 51:44.320
to grow, it needs wind, it needs the stress of the wind to develop what is in fact called stress

51:44.320 --> 51:49.600
wood, which is the core strength of that tree. And this is something that, funnily enough, although

51:49.600 --> 51:55.280
not presumably known in that form to Nietzsche, Nietzsche actually says this in 1870, something

51:55.280 --> 52:01.520
that in relation to human beings, that we need adversity. In a very simple way, we need adversity

52:01.520 --> 52:06.800
because, as you know, I think that everything is in motion. And contrary to the Newtonian image

52:06.800 --> 52:13.600
that rest is the normal state and that motion is an aberration, motion is the normal state and

52:13.600 --> 52:18.000
rest would be an aberration if it could ever be achieved. But to achieve that, we need friction.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.480
Friction is the thing that stops motion, that's how you would describe it. But it is also the thing

52:22.480 --> 52:28.880
that enables something to get started in moving. So that is Hormesis. One more thought on Hormesis

52:28.880 --> 52:34.800
here before you get to syllapses. For those of you who remember, there's a film called Dances

52:34.800 --> 52:39.520
with Rules with Kevin Costner, just to bring it to popular culture for a second. And the premise

52:39.520 --> 52:45.520
of this movie is basically a sort of white frontier pioneer person getting lost within a sort

52:45.520 --> 52:50.400
of Native American tribe and at some point he's captured and there's a kind of meeting around

52:50.400 --> 52:55.920
the fire to discuss what to do with him, what to kill him, what to send him back and so on.

52:55.920 --> 53:00.880
And I'll never forget watching this because one of the Native Americans is particularly aggressive

53:01.520 --> 53:06.960
and being for blood. He says, we must kill him, we must kill him. And I remember thinking all

53:06.960 --> 53:12.720
the others are like passing the peace pipes and kind of, you know, looking very quintessentially

53:12.720 --> 53:18.960
wise indigenous knowledge kind of picture. And yet this one guy is like a warrior saying we need

53:18.960 --> 53:23.520
to take him out now. And I remember feeling at the time, it's really important that he's there.

53:23.520 --> 53:29.280
It's not that he's right, but there was something about that energy being in the room as a kind of

53:29.280 --> 53:34.480
counterweight to the, it's not exactly Hormesis, don't get me wrong, but it's a similar spirit

53:34.480 --> 53:38.800
of this thing that's in a small dose valuable. If they were all like that, you'd have a different

53:38.800 --> 53:45.600
problem. And similarly, Ian, just to nail this point, you said that you prefer your dark chocolate

53:45.600 --> 53:52.560
at 70%, is that right? Yes, correct. Yes, I do. Can you please tell me why is it because

53:53.840 --> 54:03.440
because as you increase the percentage to 85 or 90, it becomes less pleasing. It's simply,

54:03.440 --> 54:10.560
this is why all the really best dark chocolate is 70% or 70 something percent.

54:11.600 --> 54:16.080
The others are used for cooking because they're a pure chocolate essence, if you like.

54:17.120 --> 54:21.360
There are many things that are like this. For example, in Scotland,

54:22.880 --> 54:31.520
you know, putting a lot of water in whiskey is considered a sacrilege. But a very tiny bit of

54:31.520 --> 54:38.640
water in the whiskey is necessary to enable it actually to unfurl, unfold. It's in a richness.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.720
And there's a joke I like, perhaps I may be indulged in it, in Scotland. In Scotland,

54:47.520 --> 54:52.160
if you ask somebody, will you have water in the whiskey? The reply is, will there be room?

54:53.280 --> 54:59.200
Anyway, perhaps I could talk about. In credulity, there will be space for the water.

54:59.920 --> 55:03.200
For the water. So let's move on to

55:04.560 --> 55:13.360
salapsis. Salapsis is, in fact, the Ionian or Ionic form of the word salipsis in Attic Greek,

55:13.360 --> 55:19.760
which is the one that's best known to philosophers. But it's the one that Heraclitus used. And he has

55:20.720 --> 55:26.800
a fragment, which is extraordinarily dense in my view. And it goes like this.

55:26.800 --> 55:36.800
Salapsis, and the word is grasping in English, grasping, holds and not holds convergent,

55:36.800 --> 55:44.080
divergent, consonant, dissonant from all things one and from one thing all. And I think that is

55:44.080 --> 55:50.880
just extraordinarily rich. I mean, first of all, this idea of the word salapsis or salipsis is

55:50.880 --> 55:57.520
something to do with a sudden comprehension, grasping in that sense, it brings things together,

55:57.520 --> 56:04.400
the other idea of, you know, coincidence. And it also signifies fertility, which comes about

56:04.400 --> 56:12.800
through the coming together of the gametes of the two sexes. So it says many things at once about

56:12.800 --> 56:19.360
this deep nature of reality, that it comes in glimpses or grasping moments of insight,

56:19.360 --> 56:25.280
and that in that insight, it's neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply hold

56:25.280 --> 56:31.360
or simply not hold, neither simply like nor simply unlike. Each thing, as I say, working with and

56:31.360 --> 56:38.560
by the same token working against the others, the one and the many may bring things into reality,

56:38.560 --> 56:44.080
they bring one another forth into being generating a reality that has this structure of its core.

56:44.720 --> 56:49.680
And that despite or in the light of all this, perhaps because of the nature of this multiplicity,

56:49.680 --> 56:56.000
all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here that's not paired with an antithesis.

56:56.000 --> 57:07.200
So I think that that idea is very rich. And I know what you're saying is so how do we get that into

57:08.080 --> 57:13.840
into dialogues in places where people are making decisions? I think the first thing

57:13.840 --> 57:20.640
is that we need to, we need to emphasize that while we are busily pursuing a single goal,

57:20.640 --> 57:25.680
we're neglecting all kinds of other things that are disappearing as fast as we're achieving that

57:25.680 --> 57:32.960
goal, that we need therefore to be very measured and see how far we should go and not go further

57:33.440 --> 57:39.920
unless we destroy that we need to respect the fact that when we bring things together,

57:39.920 --> 57:47.040
they remain unique and individual. This is not an abolition so that when a society is cohesive,

57:47.040 --> 57:53.200
it doesn't somehow destroy the individual, but actually enhances the individual. The individual

57:53.200 --> 57:59.840
can only be fully an individual with the background of an integrated society. That for example,

57:59.840 --> 58:04.160
when we move towards the future, we need to remember where we've come from in the past.

58:04.160 --> 58:09.600
We need not to jettison the knowledge that was painfully acquired by thousands of years across

58:09.600 --> 58:14.480
the world. People now, without even knowing what they're rejecting are too quick to say,

58:14.480 --> 58:19.600
well, we can make something new. Yes, we can. Things are always new. A river is always new.

58:19.600 --> 58:24.080
A plant is always growing. Everything is growing and changing. Everything flows,

58:24.160 --> 58:27.920
as Eric Leiter said, but you don't just cut it off from its roots.

58:28.960 --> 58:33.760
All of these things are things that are worth saying. I think rehabilitating intuition is

58:33.760 --> 58:38.960
important. We haven't got time to go into all of that, but I have three whole chapters on intuition.

58:38.960 --> 58:48.160
But this constant dismissing of intuition is a mistake, I believe. Sorry, you were going to say

58:48.160 --> 58:52.320
something. I wanted to hear also before making sense of what these things mean together,

58:52.320 --> 58:57.840
but a little bit on an anti-odromia. Why is it important for us to use this concept as well?

58:59.200 --> 59:03.840
Well, an anti-odromia is the easiest one to deal with. It's a term invented by Yong,

59:04.400 --> 59:13.120
and it really refers to the fact that roads go in two directions. And this was first again

59:14.560 --> 59:19.680
commented on, at least in the West, by Heraclitus, when he said the road up is the road down.

59:20.400 --> 59:25.040
And so this is really the essence of an anti-odromia. We don't need to spend much time on it,

59:25.040 --> 59:35.200
but I think that it is very beautifully, deeply, and with great imagination, and I mean that in

59:35.200 --> 59:42.480
the best sense, unfolded by Yong in his looking at what a human being is. It's a very important

59:42.480 --> 59:51.120
element, as I say, in the practice of anyone trying to help a human being with their suffering,

59:51.120 --> 01:00:00.640
their mental suffering. And I'm just struck by these three terms when I was reading, because

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.240
they're not the kinds of things we bring to bear, right? We use language of systems change,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:12.800
and we speak about regenerative economics, and we speak about a new narrative and all this kind

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:21.280
of stuff. But these things cut much more deeply into the need to perceive reality. We live in

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.600
arguably a reality avoidant culture, much of reality we don't want to attend to in a certain way,

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.480
and some would say it's also a kind of post-truth culture. But in order to sort of reach towards

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.600
the truth and reach towards reality, it feels like our conceptual maps are not fit for purpose.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.800
There's a kind of, there's a linguistic drought of some kind that prevents us from seeing. I'm not

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.560
seeing that we should resuscitate these fairly scholastic terms as the only way. But it does

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:56.080
feel to me a little bit like part of the public education is to bring such terminology to bear

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.520
so that people can actually make sense again of what's actually real and true, rather than

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.800
believing they can't actually articulate their intuitions.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.520
Well, yes, I mean, whether or not these particular terms are the right ones, I wouldn't

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.320
like to say, although there's nothing wrong with them, I suppose. But I think that the perception

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.600
from which they stem is, is explicable in terms that are not so strange. And I suppose that's what

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.400
I've tried to do in my writing, which is why one of the communist things people say is,

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.760
you gave me the words for things that I knew to be the case, but I had no language. I had no way

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.520
of saying these things. And I felt I'd be dismissed if I said them, but I've given

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:45.680
good groundings, reasons, and science behind why these things are important. And we need to

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.320
make this shift. We need to change our perspective on what we're doing here and who we are and what

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.720
the business of being alive is about before it's too late. Anyway, there we are.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.960
Well, just a related example is, if you watch the news and the clamour on social media and the

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:10.960
main forms of debates in public life, there's ubiquitous partial truth, right? People say things,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.720
and then there's a kind of watchable tree that's partially true, and there's a watchable tree

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:19.280
response that's also partially true. But there's very little sort of shared endeavor to get to the

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.000
kind of fuller vision of the truth. Now, there's a whitehead quotation somewhere in your book

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.480
about there are no whole truths or only partial truths. But I feel this is quite fundamental.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:38.720
Again, it's something to do with realizing that to actually have a partial truth is,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.560
in some sense, the truth. There is a meaningful way in which not to know everything is to know

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:51.120
everything. And you're getting towards that in your book, but in a way that is maddeningly elusive

01:02:51.120 --> 01:03:00.000
at a cultural level. Well, I mean, I do, I do talk about the importance of not knowing,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.640
which of course is not the same as ignorance. Ignorance is what you have before you know,

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.080
not knowing is what you have after you've gone through the process of knowledge.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:17.440
So all that is very true. And what Chinese call Wu Wei, non-action, is as important.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.520
And that is really in a very practical sense, people always saying, what do we do? And one of

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.480
the things that comes out of experience as a psychiatrist is the first thing is to see what

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.760
it is that you're doing that's wrong and stop doing it. So before you can actually have room to

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.640
do something new, you've got to get out of the picture, the thing you're doing, which is wrong.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.560
So, you know, all this has very practical meaning in my view. It's not just some strange

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:50.320
insight into the structure of being. But if we are to survive, and if we're to understand

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.400
what we're doing, we do need to have some insight into the structure of being. And at the moment,

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:03.840
our image of a reductionist materialist mechanism is wrong on so many counts. And I give a lot

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.400
of them in the book. I mean, you've quoted Wu Wei, you mentioned Wu Wei there, the principle. In

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:15.280
the book you quote the Tauti Qing a few times, you mentioned the Yi Qing. I mean, many things,

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.520
but you're also a kind of Taoist, right? One way to understand. I am a Taoist. I'm precisely a

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.640
Taoist, yes. That's good to know. And I could be a Christian. And if I was, I'm probably a very

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:37.440
bad one. But I find the Christian mythos and the Christian tradition phenomenally rich. And it's

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.280
very, you know, I couldn't say whether, whether I am a Christian or not, but it's not incompatible

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.200
with being a Taoist at all. Or a Buddhist for that matter. And Thomas Murphy famously was

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.800
Catholic. I wanted to end by just briefly, for those who are curious, today I wrote a little

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.400
piece trying to get my head around what I meant by the McGillchrist maneuver a bit more clearly.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.120
And I just, I've said here just a short definition for those who are interested.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.440
I say the McGillchrist maneuver entails the combined perceptual and conceptual capacity

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:17.120
that transcends contradictions, disclosing the coincidence of opposites as generative of reality,

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:25.920
thereby re-enchanting aspects of lifelong, of, of, of life, re-enchanting aspects of life,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.840
long considered problematic, including tension and paradox. So there's a kind of, you know,

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:38.240
I think there's a real thing going on here in the structure, the underlying structure that

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:47.600
is principally in chapter 20, but pervades to the entire work. And we will go now to something

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.680
else. But I suppose I want to say the whole series is called attention as a moral act. Now,

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.880
as a whole point of discussion, but just to end, please, why is attention a moral act?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.400
What, if it's not obvious already, how would you describe it?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.560
Well, I don't think it is entirely obvious. And when I discovered that

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:16.080
almost the foundational difference, probably the foundational difference between the two hemispheres

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.280
is the very well-known fact that they pay attention in different ways to the world,

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:27.120
it didn't altogether immediately strike me that I'd struck gold. You know,

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:32.320
this was an incredibly important thing, because part of my training was, you know,

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:38.000
attention is a cognitive function, you know, with memory and, you know, other things. And it

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.240
therefore gets reduced to a sort of mechanism of a kind. And I didn't realize how fundamental

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:55.920
this is to being the world that we know is the product of our attention. We cannot know a world

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.800
that is not part of our attention. I must say, first of all, that I don't mean by attention,

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.160
the scrutinizing self-conscious attention. But if it hasn't come to our attention at even an

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.280
unconscious level, if we haven't imbibed it, then it can't be part of our experiential world.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:24.080
So I steer an important course, I think, which is, I say important because at the moment, yet again,

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.760
there is a polarization going on in which either people believe the world is simply

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.520
something that's made up in the individual mind. So this is post-modernism at its worst,

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:47.280
it's certain kinds of philosophy, a kind of naive idealism. And the other is a naive realism,

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:54.000
that the world is just stuff out there and our knowing it makes no difference to what it is.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:01.760
Well, again, we don't have time for this, but how we attend something, whether we attend to it,

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.800
even within the world of physics, never mind in the world of philosophy and psychology,

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:13.840
makes a difference to what we are experiencing. And it's a moral act because it means that we

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:23.120
are not simply observers in this universe, we are creators in this universe. We co-create along with

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:32.880
the universe and along with that divine logos or Lee or Tao or whatever it is, that is the ground of

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:39.920
being. We are not just passive consumers. Once again, it is always a reverberative relationship.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:46.720
I realize in my very early teens that everything has this structure and that therefore we have an

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.400
impact on the world, making it what it is, really literally making it what it is, the ways in which

01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:01.840
we see it, alter what will be there. We know that from quantum mechanics as it's laughably called,

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:11.440
or quantum field theory as I prefer, but it is also part of our experience of the world.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:20.240
So how we see the world creates is a duty laid on us to pay the right kind of attention,

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.680
a kind of nourishing attention that brings things into being, not the kind of attention

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.760
that alienates and that cuts us off from that reality and therefore changes it and changes us.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.600
So it has an effect on the world, it has an effect on us, those who are doing the attending,

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:44.400
a moral effect. You can make yourself a very dubious person by always adopting a stance of

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:53.360
extreme remoteness. You can also get things wrong by engulfing yourself in things. So as

01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:00.320
always, it is a matter of finessing a harmony of positions that look opposed to one another,

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.560
but are equally necessary or at least both necessary. So that's what I mean by it. And I

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:14.560
also mean that if we don't pay the right kind of attention to what we're doing in this world,

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.800
and the moment our attention is up for grabs from every kind of electronic device around us,

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.920
and I don't think that we are taught any longer how to be quiet and still and concentrate on a

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.400
piece of work, on reading or listening to a piece of music for an hour or two at a time,

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.480
if we don't reconnect with this kind of attention, we will lose the world. Literally,

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.280
you know, I'm not speaking in metaphors, we will lose this world, the world may carry on without

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:50.720
us. But that would be very sad for certainly us and possibly for the world because I, you know,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.800
I don't hate humanity. I think we've got things very, very badly wrong. But what humanity is,

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.600
is something very, very special. Well, thank you. And

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.360
all of humanity is indeed special. And the work you've done is certainly very special. And

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.680
I suppose on behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank you for your decades of, you know,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:25.280
scholarship and the fire that has propelled that is something that I think we all admire.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:32.400
And you've done, I feel as though when I asked you earlier, you feel fulfilled about your work,

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:39.360
there's a sense in which you've clearly done with your talents what you alone could do in some

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.400
meaningful sense. And that's also why I wanted to share the biography. And I think it's up to us

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:51.040
as a broader population of people interested in your work, concerned about the world in various

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:58.080
ways to consider what it means to us and how we bring it into being. And with that in mind,

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.880
we're going to move in that direction now. Beginning with, I'll pass over to my colleague,

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.120
Michael Breddy, in a second. And we'll do a very short practice before we move into groups,

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.800
and then we'll come back together where we'll have a chance to ask you questions and I'll

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:24.000
help to field them as well. Okay, so this is a pretty fundamental question from Paul. Paul,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.080
do you want to ask it? If you're there, can we see you and, or is that too much, too difficult,

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.800
Michael, to do that? I can actually, it might be a bit of a challenge, but I can. All right,

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.000
let me just ask it. If you don't mind, Paul, sorry, we better if we ask you. I hope you understand.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.280
I think that's me. Okay, great. Let's hear from you then, Paul.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.360
Thanks very much. So my question relates to how would you say that we could slow down and

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:54.880
nurture the sort of attention that grows out of that slowing down in a world that seems to be

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.720
speeding up and with less and less time to sit for three hours with a piece of literature or enjoy

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:07.040
how do we reconcile the speed of the world as we perceive it with the necessity of slowing down

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.160
with that? Thank you relatively quickly and just so we can get plenty of questions in.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:22.640
Yes, I mean, the question is a very good question. And I think it is difficult.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:29.840
There have never been more pressures on people to do more things in less time.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.320
So the only thing I can suggest is that you stand out against that culture as much as you can.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.520
And it's built into many of the assumptions of the culture that it's better for everyone to be

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.800
doing lots and lots of things. It might be better if we did fewer things but did them

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:57.840
with greater thought and depth. So I think one has to make some decisions. I mean, I'm not

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.600
holding myself out as any kind of example of what to do. I'm not a good example of doing anything,

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:14.160
but I have no television. I've found myself listening less and less to the radio. I hardly

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:22.480
ever do actually listen to the radio, to be honest. And I have switched off alerts when emails come.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.520
I try to limit the times of day in which I will look at them. And I'm not on any of the social

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.880
networks, but I have the luxury of a PA who does and who therefore picks up messages for me.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:44.080
But if you haven't got such a person, on the other hand, you might not have quite as many

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:54.800
requests or questions. But I think it is difficult. I think it's rather like asking

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.480
any kind of spiritual practitioner, how do you do this? And the answer is not some simple thing,

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.120
but it's about embracing a certain relation to the world. And that's really what I'm talking

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:12.320
about. So I think it's a start from day one of thinking, you know, what matters is my relationship

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:17.280
to the world, to people and so on, and all the things that interrupt and make more shallow,

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.040
my connections with them, my experiences also, are to be resisted. Sorry, it's not a very

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.560
satisfactory answer, but that's the best I can say. Thank you, Ian. And I'm looking at these,

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.080
sorry, Paul, thank you for your question. And I'm looking at these questions, all of which are

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:41.600
kind of explosive in their own way. One about AI, one about war and peace is one about God.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:51.600
I want to be honest, I want to ask this because it seems to me something that Perspectiva recently

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.680
did an anti-debate about as a whole conversation. But if you're interested, look at the anti-debate.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:03.920
In what is the question from Christine Miskelly, and it says, in what sense might war be needed

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:14.960
for the development of peace? What sense, if any, perhaps? Well, well, gosh, it's just a very good

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:23.280
question. I don't think it is, it is absolutely necessary, though some degree of difference,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:31.600
competition, conflict is also part of the process of collaboration. So I mean, one of the things I

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:42.800
say about the history of evolution, which is constantly projected as a simple warfare of all

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.360
against all, is that it's not a bit like that. I mean, that it's far more distinguished by

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.600
collaboration and cooperation between species. But as a degree of competition is also extremely

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.600
helpful. And I suppose bringing it back to human war and peace, I would like to say I hope we can

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.880
certainly avoid a war, but that nonetheless some degree of independence of states, but working

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:22.640
together of states is important. That you know, the element of change that comes about when a

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:29.680
country is plunged into a crisis can be extremely helpful. I mean, it's not a bit of a cliche,

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:37.520
really, but it's true that the Second World War produced extraordinary advances in science and

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.080
technology, some of which may not be good in themselves, but some of which very clearly were

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:50.000
and have been used to great advantage. So once again, it's not all or nothing. But I hope that in

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.480
the case of actual human war, it will be as little as conceivably possible. Okay, thank you, Ian.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.240
Gosh, there's so many. Do keep your questions coming just because we will keep a record of all

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.960
of these. So one way or the other, these will be attended to through a moral act, as it were.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.240
And we probably won't manage to answer all of them now. However, there was one question that's

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.560
very much of the moment. There is a more challenging real world question from about AI from Pat Kain.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.720
Pat, do you want to frame that in your own vernacular?

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:30.560
Sure. Hi, Ian, I love your work. But this is a pressing question, which is to say,

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:39.840
to what degree is computation a left brain phenomena? And what are the recent achievements

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.600
in computation, which are basically sort of modelling and building on the precedent of a

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.280
corpus? We all thought that machines, the one thing that machines wouldn't get anywhere near

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.280
would be creativity or responsivity. Maybe even that may be a more technical way to put it.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.560
But it seems that's one of the first things that they've come for. We thought they would

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:08.240
be dealing with our routineized behaviours and liberating us from labour. What it seems to be

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.320
doing is coming in at the kind of formulaic nature of human creativity and intellect itself.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.640
And that's what advanced AI has come to. Now, within the right brain, left brain, complicated

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:28.000
dynamic, which was Jonathan was at pains to say, is complex rather than manacheme. What's your

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.920
perspective on advancing computation and what it does to our sense of appreciation for valuing of

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:46.560
the human? Wow. Well, first of all, to start with the rather limited and more focused

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:54.240
computation is a very left hemisphere element. And it's different from understanding. So it's

01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:02.080
clear that the left hemisphere can manipulate words and manipulate figures. But the right

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.200
hemisphere is better able to understand the overall import of the words and the overall

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.680
nature of what has been computed and what it means. So in other words, it doesn't have the

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.320
degree of understanding of the right hemisphere, but it's able to carry out procedures. It's the

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:23.360
difference between procedures and inhabited processes. So what we're seeing is an enormous,

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:32.960
it is striking and troubling, I agree. But if you can compute so that you can get all the possible

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.360
permutations and possibilities, this is not the way the human mind works intelligently.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:49.360
But you can then single out certain elements. But I doubt that I may live to eat these words,

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:56.160
but I doubt very much that a machine can can produce something that is more than mediocre in

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:06.080
terms of creativity. The business of creativity comes out of the business of having a body,

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:15.280
having a mortal life that is limited in extent, and having emotions. And I think and being conscious.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.160
And there's no evidence that, well, clearly they don't have bodies, they don't have

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.840
emotions, but they could have consciousness. But I think that's a doubtful but not excludable

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:35.600
possibility. But I don't think this is how great creative works are made. There was already a machine

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.640
created by putting all the works of Bach into it, and then asking the machine to sort of

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:49.440
out of this random literature, a new work of Bach. But the trouble is that, although it could pass

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.600
as, yeah, in the genre of Bach, it's not created by a genius. And it doesn't move one in the way

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.400
that the works of Bach do and speak to one in the way that the works of Bach do. Only a human

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:06.000
being a fellow sufferer can actually do that. Is that something to do in with, thanks, Pat,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.680
for the questions? Is it something to do with reverberation? I mean, you mentioned that this

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.480
notion that we have a similar problem in the chess world about whether a computer can play a game.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.880
And there's something about seeing, feeling the other human beings creative acts that is

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:28.160
sort of non negligible, difficult to reproduce. And just you're so fond of the word reverberation

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:34.240
that that came to mind in your response to the question. Well, there's no need whatever for a

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.440
computer that's very good at playing chess to have any form of consciousness. I mean,

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:44.000
that's just absolutely not required. All it has to do is do an immense amount of computing very

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.440
fast, which would be a very stupid thing to do, which is why I reject the term artificial

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.880
intelligence. It's not artificial intelligence. It's artificial information processing that

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.800
could be done incredibly fast, much faster than humans can process information. But my God,

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.440
knowledge is more than processing information. Understanding is more than knowledge, and

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.520
wisdom is more than understanding. Okay, thank you. And you heard it here first,

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.480
there's no such thing as AI. I'm just kidding. So, Emma, you had your photo,

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.280
you had your hand up quite early, so you can go next, please. Emma Morrissey? Yeah.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.920
Hi, yeah, it's Emer, but don't worry, it happens all the time. First, I just want to say a big

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.320
thank you. Your work has had a really profound impact on my life. So, just to get that other

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:40.000
way first. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the role of creativity,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.680
because obviously, a creative act, for example, writing requires both hemispheres of the brain,

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.040
you know, so the right would be kind of free flow of ideas and the left involved in the editing

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.040
process, for example. So, I wanted to ask what you think the role of creativity could be as an

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:03.680
antidote to the imbalance that we see in the world? I think it's terribly important. I mean,

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:10.320
I think we are almost definable as creative beings. And as you know, my philosophy is that

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:15.360
we are here to help create reality, that we are, you know, we're not just

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:24.880
passive passers-through of a slideshow, we are actually interacting with something.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.560
So, we are creating all the time. And emphasising that element is important, but it doesn't mean

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.640
letting go of what the left hemisphere provides, which are the tools. So, for example, in order

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.040
to be a good poet, you have to know your language, you have to understand how it works, and you have

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:46.960
to read a lot. In order to be a good composer, you have to know the rules. Well, I think you do. I

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.360
mean, nowadays, all the rules have been thrown out, but it doesn't necessarily produce wonderful

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.120
works for art. But I think that a composer is at an advantage. Let me put it that way.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.800
If he or she understands the structures of music, the nature of music, and the history of music.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:10.240
So, I think, I believe we create out of a living tradition of which we are the new members who

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.080
will take it in another way or take it further. That is all brilliant. But what I reject is just

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.520
cutting off the ways in which we might learn a skill. Learning a skill, learning an art,

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.640
learning a craft, is very important for creativity. It doesn't just happen by sticking people in a

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:33.360
room and going bluer whatever comes out. That is not needless to say how anything beautiful or

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.360
gracious created. But I do think it is very important. I absolutely agree with you. And I

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:47.040
think that the way children are educated nowadays is adversarial to that impulse.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.920
But again, I want to caution. I don't mean that they should just be allowed to not learn things and

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.040
let it all quote hang out. They really do need to get to grips with things, understand them,

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.520
but then allowed to have their own thoughts, their own, you know, that is what my education

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:12.160
was like all those millions of years ago in the dark ages when I was educated by wonderful people

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.520
who were excited about what they were talking about, didn't have to follow a procedure that was

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.920
sent to them from Whitehall. So, you know, we need to get back to a business of, you know, openness

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.680
and that the mind of the young person needs to be trained to think differently, not just to

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.160
be indoctrinated. This is what you must say. And if you don't say these things, you won't get full

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.960
marks. But no, think for yourself. Turn things on their head. See what happens. It's great.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.880
Okay. Thank you so much. And listen, we're going to have a question from Four Arrows,

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:54.560
which you've raised a few interesting comments throughout the evening and a chance to ask Ian

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.560
directly. Ian, I'll let Four Arrows answer the question, but just so you know, what my interest

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.840
here is something about the nature of hierarchy that's implicit both in or actually quite explicit

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.760
in the master and his emissary, but also to some extent in the myth with which you begin the second

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.240
volume of the new book. And I think this is a question that's sort of challenging that to some

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.680
extent. Can we hear Four Arrows if he's there? Yeah, I'm just asking. I'm wondering if Four Arrows

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.680
could raise their hand, then it's much easier for me to find Four Arrows because we have so many

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:32.320
people here. It's also known as Don Trent Jacobs, PhD. Ah, here I see you now, Four Arrows.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.680
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:52.000
There we go. You found me. I'm a big fan of Ian on many levels. As an indigenous scholar, I appreciate

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.880
your references to the Uroquois Confederacy as a model also. I have a question that is,

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.440
you're in that metaphor that Jonathan just described. I just want to be clear

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.440
that you didn't intend for that relationship of hierarchy to the need to be permanent in order

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.920
to recognize that each person has limitations. And in the indigenous approach, of course,

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.920
hierarchy is contextual. For the buffalo hunt, we'll have a leader, but otherwise it's matriarchal

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.600
and non. So can you clarify what you meant by that using that particular analogy? Because it

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:38.160
was a little bothersome. Okay. Well, have you come across the myth that I use? Have you read it?

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.720
Yes, I have come across it. Oh, you have? Yes. I disagree with it in a way.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:54.240
Explicit in it is that there are these two unequal powers, and one is able to be creative

01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:01.680
and is able to look after the other one that can do good as long as it's under the supervision

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.440
of the greater power. They have two unequal twin brothers.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.240
Just to be clear about the question, as I understand it, that's not in doubt. And I think

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.120
that's even accepted. It's just about the permanence of that relationship and whether the

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.440
hierarchy is a fluid notion that comes and goes according to context, or whether it's...

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.080
Well, in that myth, it isn't. No, in that myth, it is a permanent fact about the relationship.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.720
It's never hinted that the other brother can somehow be the leader because he just doesn't

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.640
have what it takes. He on his own would be dangerous and his attempts to create a negative.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:44.720
And he's jealous of, envious of his brother's position. He's a rival that is an upstart,

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:50.720
basically. This is the same as the story of Lucifer, the brightest of the angels, who became

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:56.480
Satan. And the whole story of Paradise Lost is caused by the resentment of the one that can't

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.880
do what the other one can do. Now, it's a very dangerous human reality, and I wouldn't wish to

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:09.360
gloss over it at all. I think the interpretation is incorrect. It's a Western lens through which

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:17.520
that myth is taught. And so Joseph Campbell actually talks about that myth in a different

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:24.080
way. I take it from Joseph Campbell. I take it direct from Joseph Campbell.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:28.400
Well, then we should have a conversation about that disagree with them, right?

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.600
Yeah, because the twin heroes, the twin heroes is the key. And the twin heroes, which can be,

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.560
yeah, that mythology is, is that these twins work in complementarity with different strengths

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:46.960
and recognize the different patients in different contexts. And so that's why I like what Jonathan

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:54.480
is trying to clarify in terms of the fluidity. But a brief other one. I use the left and right

01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.320
brain here also. I use it all the time. That's the problem with our world, exactly what you're

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:07.760
saying. But science really calls our metaphor a myth. And indeed, it is more complex. Can you tell

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:14.480
how you are still using that idea of left brain hemisphere without getting too shot down by

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:22.960
neuroscience? And then I'll close. I think Ian, briefly on that, because we have several questions.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:31.200
Yeah, okay. Well, gosh, how can I be brief? I think, first of all, that a myth is not

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:40.160
an untrue, but it is a way in which the greatest truths can be expressed. And they can only be

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:46.320
expressed through metaphors, poetry, myth, and ritual. And therefore, these things are very

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:51.440
important elements in language. They're not the stuff of science. That's not a criticism of science.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:59.040
Science starts out by excluding them. So that's fine. And what I've said is robust in neuroscience

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.800
terms. And nobody has really said that it isn't. Nobody with any authority has ever explained to

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:10.400
me that there's anything wrong with it. So thank you, Ian. And we're almost at the end. But there's

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.160
one final question. I just want to let people know that your questions have been seen. Some of them

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.600
are wonderful that we can't answer. So do know that they're appreciated. We'll keep a record

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.200
of them. We may even use them in some other contexts. But there is a very direct question to

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:29.040
end with Ian. And I hope you don't mind. It's from Malband. And it simply says, how do you understand

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:40.240
God? Oh, that's, we have minus 15 seconds for me to answer. And I wrote a whole about the resistance

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:48.480
and all that. So I wrote a 106 page chapter, which is woefully short on it. I can't answer that. In

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.160
fact, the only decent thing to say is it can't be put into words, certainly not into the sort of

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.800
expression you would like. So sorry to disappoint you. But actually, that is the best expression

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:06.160
of what I can say about it. Okay. And the bell, the bell is the answer also. Wonderful. The bells,

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:14.000
the bells. So listen, there are more questions. I see your hands up. I know there are. But there's

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.960
also good to leave. Once again, more and there is more to come. This is the first of several

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.400
in this series. I'll be kind of anchoring most of these conversations. But there will be other

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.280
people speaking to Ian at more length, from different vantage points, exploring different

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:34.480
aspects of both the books, getting a clearer sense of what we mean by attention being a moral act.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.920
So I do hope many of you will come back. A reminder to will be in touch tomorrow and to

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.160
encourage you to sign up to Perspectiva's mailing list so you can hear about this series and the

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:53.360
other work that we do. And also, again, that we are a charity we rely on philanthropic donations.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.000
If any of you feel so inclined, you're very welcome to follow the link that we gave earlier

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.880
in the chat or that you can find on our website to make us a donation or sign up for a subscription.

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:10.640
It's much appreciated. And the next event in two weeks' time is with Zach Stein, a sort of

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:17.200
philosopher of education, a really brilliant guy who I've known for several years now. He's the

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.640
author of a book called Education in a Time Between Worlds. And he is going to be asking Ian

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.440
about many things, but principally this notion of the direct perception of value in the world,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
what's sometimes called value-ception. And they'll be going, getting deep into what that means

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.280
and why it matters today especially. And there'll be other subsequent talks, but that's the next

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.400
one. So I think unless I've forgotten something, we're good to go as it were.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:49.520
Yeah, if I could just give a reminder, Jonathan, but next week we have a Connection to Priory

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:58.320
session, which Ian won't be present at sadly, but it's more focused on connecting with the

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.600
people that have been here tonight and others in kind of structured breakout rooms and different

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:08.160
practices to explore these ideas in greater depth. So to really kind of find the others

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:14.000
and to create a space for that. And it will be directly related to what's been discussed tonight.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:23.120
So yeah, if you can make that, I put the link in the chat to register for that, but I'll just stick

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.800
it in again. And also what I'll do is just put in the link for the main kind of webpage where we're

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:36.320
going to host, make announcements for all of the sessions as they come up. So if you're, you know,

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.080
when you want to check back in, you can just go to that link and you'll see what the next

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:45.600
sessions that come up and register for all the upcoming events. Great. Well listen, Ian, as always

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.800
a huge thank you. I hope this is the first of many of these, well I know I hope it will be

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:58.960
first of many of these conversations. And thanks for everyone for coming and staying

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.520
and your questions and sorry we couldn't get to them all. And I hope now that those who want to

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.120
copy the chat have done so. And we'll see you, most of you hopefully in a couple of weeks,

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:13.600
maybe even in one week if you're joining Michael and Lee for the connection and inquiry session,

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.840
which I encourage you to do because like it's good to talk, right? I mean, this is heavy, heavy,

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:25.440
heady, heady chat, this stuff. So good to be with others who are wrestling with it too and share

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.520
your life experience and how this work comes into your world to be a little bit less alone and maybe

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.880
a bit more creative and productive through that. So pleasure to see you all and we'll see you very

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:45.680
soon. Bye for now. Bye. Thank you. Thanks Ian. Be in touch soon. Thank you everyone.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:54.800
Thank you. Thanks Jonathan. Pleasure.
