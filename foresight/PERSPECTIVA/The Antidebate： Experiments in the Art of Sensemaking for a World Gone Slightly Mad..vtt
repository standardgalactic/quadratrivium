00:00.000 --> 00:13.400
I just want to make sure I want to make sure you ordered last in your class first

00:13.400 --> 00:14.400
in your class.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.840
When inflation gets out of control, interest rates go up.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.840
Rishisuna, please let us trust answer.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.280
Excuse me, Chris, I'm speaking and I'm not done yet.

00:23.280 --> 00:33.280
I haven't heard a time when you weren't speaking.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.200
Welcome everybody to this evening's anti-debates.

00:36.200 --> 00:43.240
Let me say a little bit at the beginning before we start about why we're doing it and what

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
it's about.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
Debate has its place.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.400
Debate can be beautiful, edifying.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.840
It's often a spectacle, a clash, entertaining.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.640
It's often very enlivening and it's done well.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.760
It can even be informative.

00:56.760 --> 01:03.120
But sadly, the way the world is today, there's many structural incentives towards polarization

01:03.120 --> 01:05.760
built into the way we get our information.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.440
So we're in a phase of history where divergence and bifurcation and disagreement is actually

01:10.440 --> 01:16.120
being compounded and exacerbated by the systems and structures that prevail.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.720
And this is a big deal because democracies are even any functioning form of government

01:20.720 --> 01:27.240
that includes people relies on a capacity to discuss adequately what's going on.

01:27.240 --> 01:35.560
So I first encountered the idea of the anti-debate when I read a post by Peter Lindbergh on

01:35.560 --> 01:41.880
the e-merge site, WhatIsEmerging.com, and that was a relatively political version of

01:41.880 --> 01:42.880
the anti-debate.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.040
It was particularly framed with regard to recent debates that were happening in the U.S.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.280
and he was saying, wouldn't it be great if we had something, a different kind of practice

01:51.280 --> 01:55.920
that was, if anything, the exact opposite of all the things that are going wrong with

01:55.920 --> 01:57.760
debate.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.200
Just look at it as a form.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.600
It's typically two people.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.240
Historically, they would be male.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.760
Today, they may not be.

02:05.760 --> 02:11.560
And there would be an audience watching these two people flesh something out and very often

02:11.560 --> 02:15.760
there would be a contention or a proposition.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.400
And that gives rise to a contest.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.720
One side has one view, one side has the other view.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.080
You mobilize the arguments to support your view.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.840
You find the counter arguments to your opponent's view.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.160
And of course, there's a great illustrious history to debate.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.760
So when debates are done well, it can be really rather a beautiful thing.

02:32.760 --> 02:36.560
But there are so many things militating against doing it well.

02:36.560 --> 02:43.000
The very architecture of social media is built upon maximizing polarization.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
And paradoxically, the way it does that is it unites people in what they're against.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.120
People are looking for that sense of contest, even conquest, even humiliation.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.680
So we want debate to be sort of there as a reference point to ground people in what

03:00.680 --> 03:01.680
this is.

03:01.680 --> 03:06.280
It's a kind of public exploration of any given subject.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.040
But it's empty in the sense of antidote.

03:08.040 --> 03:24.720
It's trying to actually get beyond all the things that we see as being wrong with debate.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.800
I was involved with the anti-debate from almost the very beginning.

03:29.800 --> 03:40.280
My involvement really stemmed from my own long-term question about where is the voice

03:40.280 --> 03:42.480
of the people?

03:42.480 --> 03:47.920
We're living in a socioeconomic political system that really only gives voice to the

03:47.920 --> 03:53.160
people once every five years, and then it only requires them to vote in a choice between

03:53.160 --> 03:54.560
two parties.

03:54.560 --> 04:02.120
What I've always been interested in is this idea that every human being plays a part in

04:02.120 --> 04:09.720
a really colorful and rich tapestry of voices that could add up to something that would

04:09.720 --> 04:13.320
respond holistically to the problems that we are facing today.

04:13.320 --> 04:19.480
What I've just realized is that all my decisions on this are made by my feelings.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.440
We live in a time where we're all exposed to things that we struggle to make sense of,

04:24.840 --> 04:27.160
moments where we can't quite agree with ourselves.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.400
Our values don't always align with our actions.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.560
Our ideas don't always chime with our values, and a lot of what the anti-debate is getting

04:33.560 --> 04:35.920
at is that internal struggle.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.520
It's about finding your own inner center in a relationship.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.640
So what are we trying to achieve at the end of it?

04:40.640 --> 04:43.680
It's not some beautiful middle position in which everyone can agree on.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.960
It's not some consensus verdict.

04:45.960 --> 04:52.760
It's a deeper felt sense of your relationship to the issue of hand.

04:52.760 --> 05:00.680
The anti-debate is a process where you can bring much more of who you are as a human

05:00.680 --> 05:06.520
being, your emotional self, what is important to you spiritually, what you value deeply,

05:06.520 --> 05:11.840
and bring that into a conversation about things that really matter and about issues where

05:11.840 --> 05:17.120
there can be contention, where there can be disagreement and dissonance, and to try and

05:17.120 --> 05:25.240
hold that gracefully in the service of a collective wisdom feels like something we deeply need.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.840
As we go through the process, we are experimenting.

05:28.840 --> 05:33.520
And so while we have a methodology and we've done this before, we're ready for surprises

05:33.520 --> 05:36.160
and we're quite happy for you to help us co-create this.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.880
I feel that for me personally, the anti-debate has really come alive since Evo and Indra

05:39.880 --> 05:44.800
have helped me with it because I've realized we've connected it to democracy a bit more

05:44.800 --> 05:46.040
closely.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.680
This is something about a practice of democracy if it's done well.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.240
I have been a designer.

05:53.240 --> 06:00.160
I have been a participant, a guinea pig you could say, and I've been a host.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.480
And I would say it definitely has a lot of potential because it's fun.

06:04.480 --> 06:09.000
It's engaging, it's challenging, it's all those things.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.600
And because it goes just beyond theory, it goes beyond thought.

06:15.640 --> 06:22.120
That's why I think it has such potential because I don't recall who came up with this quote,

06:22.120 --> 06:27.520
but it's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, think yourself into a new

06:27.520 --> 06:31.120
way of acting, and I believe that is very, very true.

06:31.120 --> 06:35.720
I think peace, we don't really know that much about peace and whether it's interesting

06:35.720 --> 06:38.240
or not because we don't know much about it.

06:38.240 --> 06:42.360
So I would suggest that actually peace is a lot more interesting than violence, it's

06:42.360 --> 06:44.840
just that we actually haven't explored it very much.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.960
Action, arguably, is the true transcendent value in the world, so you have to act, you

06:48.960 --> 06:54.600
have to put yourself on the line, you have to take steps, you have to stand, take a stand

06:54.600 --> 07:02.440
of what it is and see how other people receive you or don't, and either way, this is a kind

07:02.440 --> 07:08.240
of courage to put yourself into a new world.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.320
We managed to put together a funding application with the encouragement actually to the credit

07:14.320 --> 07:15.800
of the John Templeton Foundation.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.600
When I first met somebody there, I spoke to them about it as an idea, there's this thing

07:19.600 --> 07:23.360
called the anti-debate, we don't know what it is yet, we need some time to create it,

07:23.360 --> 07:27.560
we've actually no idea what the practice looks like yet, we want to start trying, and we

07:27.560 --> 07:31.280
may even take a while to get to public engagement because until you know what you're doing there's

07:31.280 --> 07:34.920
no point in putting something out there that's just not yet formed.

07:34.920 --> 07:39.640
So the first few anti-debate practice sessions were six people gathering together and we'd

07:39.640 --> 07:46.600
often practice with two people together, choosing an issue we wanted to be somehow contentious.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.920
So the early stages were quite interesting in terms of the one-on-one activity was not

07:51.920 --> 07:56.600
without its value, we learned something about what it was to inhabit another point of view,

07:56.600 --> 08:00.920
but mostly it was slightly underwhelming, it had this feeling of this is not the call,

08:00.920 --> 08:06.320
the anti-debate had its own kind of agenda, its own kind of source energy, most contexts

08:06.320 --> 08:12.080
are not two people, most organizational contexts, most political parties, most communities,

08:12.080 --> 08:17.800
any given electoral system, invariably multiple layers of interest.

08:17.800 --> 08:24.480
So the evolution of the anti-debate was something about recognizing that the one-on-one conversation

08:24.480 --> 08:30.960
while it still had its place wasn't necessarily our touchstone, and there might also be something

08:30.960 --> 08:35.440
about the way the world is evolving that makes it less and less likely that one-on-one will

08:35.520 --> 08:36.520
work.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.360
There's something about social media that's changed from being mere consumers of kind

08:41.360 --> 08:45.320
of information and knowledge to actually what they sometimes call prosumers, you know, we're

08:45.320 --> 08:48.160
actually creating and consuming at the same time.

08:48.160 --> 08:54.680
So most people who inhabit an online space will have a political view or a view of any

08:54.680 --> 08:58.920
given contentious issue, and they'll also be observing views coming in and they'll be

08:58.920 --> 09:00.960
relating to them in various ways.

09:00.960 --> 09:07.440
In that context, watching two people thrash it out is not nearly as interesting as a larger

09:07.440 --> 09:11.360
plural encounter with lots of different views on where they come from.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.400
So we began to think that rather than doing it one-on-one, we needed to set up a process

09:15.400 --> 09:19.400
that was a bit more collective, a bit more plural, a bit more collaborative.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.920
And it was also very clear to me that the anti-debate was a quintessentially offline

09:23.920 --> 09:28.960
activity because it's much more interested in the role of the body, the role of somatic

09:28.960 --> 09:33.240
data, what's happening in your body as part of what's going on in an argument.

09:33.240 --> 09:39.800
One innovation we had was tabloid, where you would show in space your view of the question

09:39.800 --> 09:41.640
at hand or issue at hand.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.640
Agree, disagree.

09:43.640 --> 09:49.680
But I'm going to ask the room to speak to itself.

09:49.680 --> 09:54.920
Just an observation in myself that I notice that when I move to a position, the first

09:54.920 --> 09:58.800
thing I kind of almost unconsciously do is kind of say, who's in my community?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
Hello, Heli.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.920
It's nice to see you there, just noticing that.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.920
So one of the main ways to move beyond debate was the question.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.160
Debate the question is given to you and you may or may not like it.

10:10.160 --> 10:15.040
There's a power struggle in the very question and about what should we be talking about

10:15.040 --> 10:16.400
here and why.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.120
And we felt that needed to be part of the method.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.920
How are you feeling about what you're hearing in relation to your question about is fear

10:23.920 --> 10:25.760
ever useful?

10:25.760 --> 10:29.680
It feels related, but it does feel quite separate, or rather it feels like there's a hearing

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
or a polarity here.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.960
I'm tired of not seeing women in all of the powerful institutions.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.400
I'm tired of women not being acknowledged as voices.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.400
I'm tired of old women being made invisible.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.880
I'm tired of girls being conditioned to become passive with toys.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
I'm tired.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.280
I'm just tired of so many things.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.120
Is masculinity the problem, serve hands?

10:54.560 --> 10:56.640
Okay, we have a question now.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.720
You have completed the first stage of the anti-debate.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.640
We didn't know what we were going to talk about 15 minutes ago.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.760
Now we do.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.760
And so this would move on to the next phase is what we sometimes call the question bomb,

11:07.760 --> 11:12.320
which is that within any good given question, there would be millions of other questions

11:12.320 --> 11:13.440
nested within it.

11:13.440 --> 11:18.200
So for example, one question we had along the way was, is war natural?

11:18.200 --> 11:21.440
That's a good example of a question that needs to be disaggregated.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
What is war?

11:22.440 --> 11:23.440
What is natural?

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
How do we decide what is natural?

11:24.440 --> 11:27.880
What do we what do we imply when we call something natural?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.880
How do we make a distinction between war and conflict?

11:30.880 --> 11:34.440
And it's not for one single authority to answer them.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.280
It's for the room to know that these questions are alive.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.360
And next we'd often have something about thrashing it out.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.520
So we'd say what we feel about this.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.400
We were quite early on keen to get the feelings, right?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.080
This is a very important part of the anti-debate.

11:48.200 --> 11:52.600
And that felt like I was having something taken away from me.

11:52.600 --> 11:59.080
And I don't choose to believe that it exists, but in an individual sense, I don't choose

11:59.080 --> 12:00.840
to give over my power.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.280
It's just not true that human beings are primarily rational creatures, right?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.880
Yes, we have reason.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.960
Yes, we're capable of great rational prowess when the time comes.

12:10.960 --> 12:17.160
But underlying it all, there are these deep feelings of threat perception and anger and

12:17.160 --> 12:22.880
fear and maybe resentment and a kind of identity protection going on.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.280
These are all baked in to any given public conversation.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.000
Our job in the anti-debate is to make them a part of it.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.400
So we're less subject to them and they become more like an object of inquiry that we can

12:32.400 --> 12:34.280
begin to explore together.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.040
Sometimes we succeeded, sometimes we fail, but that's what we're trying to do.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.560
Well, it's very short, really.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.240
I think this is a human-centered question.

12:41.240 --> 12:46.720
And I would like to think that we think beyond the human and natural refers to the whole

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
of creation.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.640
OK, one more question relating to this.

12:51.640 --> 12:56.560
Thinking and feeling are both the same and different.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.480
If you agree with that statement, go here.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.440
If you disagree, you're here.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.480
Who loved the moon?

13:04.480 --> 13:05.280
Who felt great?

13:05.280 --> 13:08.680
And now we're getting somewhere, right?

13:08.880 --> 13:13.080
I was standing in the middle and I didn't feel, you know, I could go to the end of the room

13:13.080 --> 13:16.360
and then you say something like that and I'm like, great, that's exactly where I was.

13:16.560 --> 13:23.040
The fact that the emotion has a legitimate place in the anti-debate, for me, that was a big thing.

13:23.040 --> 13:28.840
I think this idea that reason and emotion are different parts of cognition and they

13:28.840 --> 13:34.280
don't really have a way of working well together, I think it's really outmoded.

13:34.280 --> 13:39.840
We really have to learn to bring our emotion in the way we deal with people in the right way.

13:39.840 --> 13:48.400
This is why these sorts of opportunities to hone your skill, your cognition can be quite helpful.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.120
So for me, I found it quite revelatory.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.760
It was a thrilling experience.

13:54.480 --> 14:00.680
Throughout the anti-debate, we're also very keen to keep in mind the critical mass of people

14:00.960 --> 14:02.920
who just couldn't give a damn, right?

14:02.920 --> 14:05.320
Certain number of people who are like, this is not for me.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.720
I don't particularly want to talk about this.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
They're not going anywhere.

14:08.760 --> 14:13.880
They're part of our world and we need the process to somehow acknowledge them and bring them in

14:13.880 --> 14:19.800
when the time's right because they sort of help to help us to get in perspective,

14:19.800 --> 14:22.160
whether what we're doing is really the right thing.

14:22.560 --> 14:28.040
And over here, still, are the people who felt they couldn't get behind these positions.

14:28.840 --> 14:36.880
And we'd actually like you now to be another group.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.360
That's why we chose the name and the process to call you the enigmatics.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.280
People that we don't actually know really what they think and feel.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.680
They know what they think and feel.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.560
As part of the group in that first anti-debate, they called the enigmatics.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.600
There was a good 15, 20 of us who were just sort of sitting toward the back of the room,

14:54.960 --> 15:02.120
watching this all play out and feeling really just sort of disillusioned, disenfranchised,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.360
disenchanted with the process.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.520
Which I thought was really interesting because I think that's really reflective of what happens in society.

15:10.680 --> 15:17.000
These people are always in the room and they're always in your community and they're always in the public space.

15:17.640 --> 15:24.520
So I'm just going to invite you for a second to hear from the people on this side over here.

15:26.480 --> 15:33.560
Well, kind of standing behind that, but feeling reluctant to move into a new group.

15:34.480 --> 15:40.520
For the same reason I don't join a political party, although I vote.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.360
Because I'm kind of thinking, where's the empathy?

15:44.640 --> 15:51.280
How are we going to shift into empathy where we can sit down with people we really disagree with?

15:51.800 --> 16:13.160
I pull back from the project because I think that that sense of being before what's not known actually takes the development of quite deep relationships between the participants in a debate.

16:13.720 --> 16:20.760
And so bringing two people together for an evening or an evening afternoon when they don't know each other before.

16:21.480 --> 16:42.160
And maybe you're coming together because they feel they're on opposite sides, cultivating the sense of trust and not just in each other, actually, but faith that being mistaken or being exposed to a wider or alternative view point that that can be good for you.

16:42.640 --> 16:47.200
I just felt that we didn't really get to grips with that. We didn't quite know how to bring that about.

16:47.960 --> 17:07.440
I think one of the main challenges has been moving from theory into practice. There are a lot of really good intellectual ideas, concepts, frameworks, but when you move that into live practice with warm bodies, it's difficult, and there's a different skill set that's required.

17:07.880 --> 17:12.320
It's much more important to focus on the relational.

17:13.320 --> 17:21.680
Okay, the answer debate. Where's it going? What's it for? Who's it for? What are we trying to achieve? It always had this feeling, like throughout it, we were like, what the hell are we doing?

17:22.680 --> 17:29.120
We're making this up as we go along. Why does it feel that we have to do this? And yet we don't know what we're doing, right?

17:30.160 --> 17:40.280
It's something to do with, you could say, listening to the future at some level, being pulled along by a certain pattern that is implicit and you're trying to make it a little bit more explicit.

17:41.240 --> 17:55.680
So the evolution of the anti-debate, that point we began to feel, we were missing a little bit of the initial contest. The binary gives you a kind of oscillating energy between two forces that can be quite compelling when it's done well, right?

17:55.680 --> 18:02.920
After a while, we didn't want it to collapse into dialogue, right? So we introduced this innovation. We call it swarming near the end.

18:03.920 --> 18:20.360
And that's where, after you've taken some time with the question, to first of all decide on what you want to share together, and by the way, there's a little voting process for that, where people drop out when they feel the question is not theirs, then you begin to feel the group physically stands around the question they want to go with.

18:20.360 --> 18:29.880
We do that, and then there's a certain amount of time exploring the question, then an engagement with the underlying issues and values in the question, a certain amount of representation of the diversity in the room.

18:30.840 --> 18:47.840
Once you've done all that, there's still this issue of answer what? How can this practice actually in some way focus your mind, actually clarify what's at stake? So what we build up to towards the end is people showing not just their opinion, but their moral and political commitment.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
And this is called taking a stand.

18:49.840 --> 18:54.840
I stand for virtue, cultivation, internally and externally.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.840
Effectively, what's going on here is you're trying to recruit people. You're trying to attract them.

18:59.800 --> 19:07.800
Embodied resistance is with your body. It's not something outside of you. So it's about the earth reflecting into your body and awakening the inner movement of politics.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.800
Okay, who's moving? Who's moving towards Dominique?

19:14.800 --> 19:27.800
I think it's so interesting that I can't speak about it as if it's a static thing. The words that want to come to me is like organism. I don't want to call it a project. I want to find some term for it that speaks to its sort of living essence.

19:28.760 --> 19:42.760
Because I think that's part of its magic and its potential. And also why it's still frustrating to people. Because it's not something that you're necessarily going to come out of with a 12 step action plan.

19:42.760 --> 19:53.760
I'm wondering if anyone here is going to make any difference in their lives or the way they act as a result of this. And depending on the outcome of that, is that what this was designed to do?

19:54.720 --> 20:06.720
Or is this process more like maybe a religious experience or maybe a really good psychedelic trip where it kind of works through you over the coming months and years without you really realising it's somewhere deep inside?

20:06.720 --> 20:16.720
It felt really alive as a process. Sometimes these things can be quite city downy talky talky. But it felt a lot more, yeah, a different energy to that. Which I really appreciated.

20:17.680 --> 20:27.680
And for me personally, I find myself asking myself some difficult questions, some important questions. I may have left with more questions than I have answers, but in a good way.

20:27.680 --> 20:42.680
We all had different takes on the statement. And just through this very short discussion, we were all able to see each other's point and realise that actually we're quite aligned on this even though our focus is on different words in the statement.

20:43.640 --> 21:01.640
For me, the most important thing about the anti-debate is that it transforms the tempo at which people speak and also even the kind of personal involvement, let's say. It allows a different register, different levels.

21:02.600 --> 21:12.600
I think there's so much benefit for a group to unearth what's live and that they want to have a conversation or maybe there wasn't predetermined.

21:12.600 --> 21:26.600
And just the unearthing of unexpected points of view and really tuning into where you might resonate with it or disagree, but we can learn from nature to access our better selves as humans.

21:27.560 --> 21:37.560
We're stretching a muscle here and expanding our capacities here, which is really important. I know this is happening in schools, which is absolutely where it needs to be.

21:37.560 --> 21:48.560
We brought the process into the schools pretty much exactly as we've been running it with adults. And when we did this, prior to this, we had no idea what was going to happen.

21:49.520 --> 21:57.520
We don't know how the young people are going to respond. And so it was a real delight to actually find their engagement with so high with it.

21:59.520 --> 22:10.520
That's an age where developmentally young people are figuring out who they are, what they care about, what they stand for, what they believe, and also making sense of the world.

22:11.480 --> 22:19.480
And so the anti-debate is a kind of process where that's really what you're doing. You're getting clarification on what you feel, what you think, what you believe.

22:19.480 --> 22:25.480
But you're also experiencing that, exploring that in relationship to what other people's thoughts, values and opinions are.

22:25.480 --> 22:37.480
One of the things that's interesting about the anti-debate, as I understand it, is that it's something that many different people have contributed to over its existence.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.440
So it's not just one sole author. Lots of people have kind of given their input.

22:43.440 --> 22:52.440
So the anti-debate is like a mutt. It's kind of this lovable rogue.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.440
And so my hope for the anti-debate is that it actually continues.

22:55.440 --> 23:05.440
My hope is that we can find a way to release it into the world and that more and more people can start to iterate upon it and play with it and bring their innovations to it.

23:06.400 --> 23:25.400
The anti-debate as a piece of social software, if you like, would be very useful if it was simply available to communities to pick up, to learn the mechanics of and to use for themselves, set their own agenda, set their own tone, set their own pace.

23:26.360 --> 23:36.360
I think some of the people, and even my first impression of it, was perhaps like, this is hubris.

23:36.360 --> 23:51.360
This is hubris to try and attempt to devise a new form of civic dialoguing, of relating, of coming into conversation about the world and reality.

23:51.360 --> 24:02.360
And it is hubristic. It is audacious. And yet it's worth trying. It's worth trying.

24:02.360 --> 24:10.360
I do believe that creating new social practices that are worthy of the challenges of our times is a big part of the work.

24:10.360 --> 24:14.360
It's not enough to theorize. It's not enough to persuade.

24:14.360 --> 24:21.360
You actually have to practice in a way that speaks to and from the challenges that you're writing about, thinking about.

24:21.360 --> 24:32.360
It's moving beyond the expectation that a mere idea can change the world. It's the idea enacted socially and culturally that begins to feel more promising.

24:44.360 --> 24:54.360
It's not enough to try and devise a new form of civic dialoguing. It's not enough to persuade.

24:54.360 --> 25:00.360
It's not enough to persuade. It's not enough to persuade.

25:00.360 --> 25:08.360
It's not enough to persuade. It's not enough to persuade.

25:08.360 --> 25:14.360
It's not enough to persuade.

25:14.360 --> 25:20.360
It's not enough to persuade.

25:20.360 --> 25:26.360
It's not enough to persuade.

25:26.360 --> 25:32.360
It's not enough to persuade.

25:32.360 --> 25:42.360
It's not enough to persuade.

25:42.360 --> 25:52.360
It's not enough to persuade.
