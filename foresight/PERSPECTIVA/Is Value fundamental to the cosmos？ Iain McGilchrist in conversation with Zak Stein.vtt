WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Welcome, everyone, to this second event. It's good to see you all. I'm Jonathan Ryerson.

00:09.480 --> 00:15.880
I'm chief executive and co-founder of Perspectiva. Perspectiva is a publisher, and we're very

00:15.880 --> 00:21.160
proud to publish Ian's book. This is the second volume of the Matter of Things, Matter

00:21.160 --> 00:27.000
with Things here. Perspectiva has other things, too, though. We're a charity based in London,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.640
and our general emphasis is on trying to reimagine the world from first principles, giving people

00:31.640 --> 00:36.560
permission to do that, social and intellectual permission, and encouragement to rethink the

00:36.560 --> 00:42.320
world. We see this as a necessary kind of work that we have to do today. That brings

00:42.320 --> 00:46.440
with it certain events, and we have an annual festival. We have a European network called

00:46.440 --> 00:53.960
Emerge. We have a methodology we call the anti-debate, and we're in the business of creating

00:53.960 --> 00:58.880
some course material that we hope to start sharing with you all soon. So watch this space

00:58.880 --> 01:02.440
for further developments on Perspectiva, and in the chat, maybe Michael can just share

01:02.440 --> 01:09.400
our website if anyone's interested to know a little bit more about us. I wanted to say

01:09.400 --> 01:15.160
a few things before Zach and Ian speak, and then I'm going to disappear in the digital

01:15.160 --> 01:20.720
sense of no longer being on your screen. The first is to thank, the tonight's event is

01:20.720 --> 01:27.040
free, and that's partly because we were given a grant to help bring Ian's work to more public

01:27.040 --> 01:32.560
attention and to inquire more deeply into the material in the matter with things. So

01:32.560 --> 01:38.360
I'm very grateful to the inspiration incubator, particularly Nikki and Max, which has made

01:38.360 --> 01:43.200
it possible for these events to be free. And there are going to be, there's already been

01:43.200 --> 01:50.040
one, this is the second, there's going to be double figures events. We don't yet know

01:50.120 --> 01:56.520
if it's 10 or 12 or 15, but we're going to be in that sort of magnitude of events, because

01:56.520 --> 02:01.440
there's a lot to discuss in Ian's book, and because we want to do something a little bit

02:01.440 --> 02:10.880
different. In essence, Ian's work sort of came to public attention around 2011, some

02:10.880 --> 02:18.400
13 or 12 or so years ago. And since then, as Ian, as someone who's followed his work

02:18.400 --> 02:24.640
closely, the wonderful thing is that it's coming to public attention, the big idea, the main idea,

02:24.640 --> 02:30.280
the hemispheric hypothesis. But that's been a good decade now, a good decade of questions

02:30.280 --> 02:34.640
clarifying what exactly Ian means, what's the difference in the right and left hemisphere,

02:34.640 --> 02:39.280
how does it play out in the world? And there's still a place for that. There's a lot of people

02:39.280 --> 02:43.840
catching up with the significance of that and why it's a world changing insight when you

02:43.840 --> 02:50.800
understand properly what Ian's saying. But it's also true that Ian has moved along and deepened

02:50.800 --> 02:57.720
the inquiry and in a more specific way, applied his understanding to particular areas. And they

02:57.720 --> 03:02.800
need greater attention on their own terms. So in this seminar series, there's a kind of presumption,

03:03.400 --> 03:08.880
although we will reiterate and restate the argument as we go, we're trying to move beyond, let's

03:08.960 --> 03:15.360
say McGilchrist 101. We're trying not to be simply, this is the main thesis. Can I ask you again

03:15.360 --> 03:19.360
about that, please? We're trying to assume a level of understanding and engagement with the work

03:19.360 --> 03:23.440
that allows us to move it on. And when I say move it on, I mean move it on philosophically,

03:23.440 --> 03:28.960
to really understand more deeply what's being said. But I also mean move it on kind of

03:30.720 --> 03:37.040
in a more quasi-applied or proto-applied sense, because there's a lot of risk in rushing too

03:37.040 --> 03:42.240
quickly to understand what might follow for Ian's work. But there's also a need to

03:42.240 --> 03:47.120
begin to figure out what it means for each of us in our personal and professional and even political

03:47.120 --> 03:54.240
lives. And with that in mind, the first event was trying to frame the purpose of the series as a

03:54.240 --> 04:00.000
whole. And that was called Attention as a Moral Act. And I also introduced what I called the

04:00.000 --> 04:04.560
McGilchrist Maneuver. And there's a little blog post about what the McGilchrist Maneuver is,

04:04.560 --> 04:12.320
I think, and that can be shared in the chat too. And that's a way of trying to get people to

04:13.040 --> 04:20.320
orient towards how we begin to think about the places where Ian's work makes sense in the public

04:20.320 --> 04:26.000
realm. What value it might have for civil society rethinking things. And we're continuing that

04:26.000 --> 04:31.280
tonight. And just so you know, as a little bit of a preamble, we have future events relating to

04:31.280 --> 04:38.080
sanity and imagination. So we're trying to zoom in on particular issues that are dealt with in

04:38.080 --> 04:45.600
great depth in Ian's books. But which are also of a sort of have a degree of salience and relevance

04:45.600 --> 04:51.040
and tangibility in the real world. We don't want to be in the simple business of because Ian says

04:51.040 --> 04:55.840
X, we should do Y, because Ian would be the first to say that's not how it is. But we are interested

04:55.840 --> 05:00.640
in the shift of perception that arises from Ian's work, and how that begins to look in different

05:00.640 --> 05:07.840
contexts and in different thematic areas. And tonight, we're on a really big one. Values.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.040
Value. And this is one of the things I want Ian and Zach to help clarify for us. Because

05:13.040 --> 05:17.840
when I was reread, by the way, if any of you are wondering about the reading material for tonight,

05:17.840 --> 05:23.360
or what's to read after tonight to sort of cover the ground again, chapter 26 in the second volume

05:23.360 --> 05:29.840
of the matter with things is particularly relevant to what you're about to hear. And it's Ian will

05:30.400 --> 05:36.160
go into it in more depth, but it's a philosophical take on where what value is, where it comes from,

05:36.160 --> 05:42.160
why it matters, and the extent to which it can be perceived directly. And the reason I think I

05:42.160 --> 05:49.840
wanted to inquire into this question is because values are mentioned everywhere. If you're working

05:49.840 --> 05:56.160
in a sort of civil society space as I am, everyone's speaking about trying to work on values for

05:56.160 --> 06:01.120
campaigning. There's a values and frames company that think about messaging to try and get particular

06:01.120 --> 06:07.520
values encoded in the language you use. Political strategy is full of tapping into implicit values.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.120
In the commercial world, the world of commercial ethics, if you order food from, for example,

06:13.120 --> 06:21.040
waitrose in the UK, you hear that they have their chicken, eggs, and milk come from farmers who

06:21.040 --> 06:26.000
share our values. And then of course, if you're working in the business world or the finance world,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.920
you hear a lot about the value proposition of something and the bottom line being about

06:29.920 --> 06:35.600
shareholder value. So this word value kind of permeates society in lots of different ways.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.120
But it's used maybe without adequate reflection to really understand what's going on.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.680
I'd like one of the things for Ian and Zach to clarify is this sort of distinction between

06:47.680 --> 06:51.680
value singular and values plural. I hope that will come up at some point in the discussion.

06:51.680 --> 06:57.200
And also kind of what I sense is a kind of big transcendent sense of value, almost value as

06:57.200 --> 07:01.440
equivalent with Dower or God or something like that. And then a kind of value that's something

07:01.440 --> 07:05.520
to do with truth, beauty, and goodness, and maybe love and maybe meaning and purpose,

07:05.520 --> 07:10.080
the kind of fundamental values. And then there's sort of derivative values like pleasure and maybe

07:10.080 --> 07:15.520
integrity and things like that. I'm curious to understand the kind of reverberations of those

07:15.520 --> 07:20.720
things and the connections between them. With that said, it's a great pleasure to introduce

07:20.720 --> 07:25.280
both of our speakers. Now, Ian, I think, goes pretty much without saying for the audience here.

07:26.160 --> 07:32.800
He is Inter Alia, the author of The Master and His Emissary and The Matter with Things. He's a

07:32.800 --> 07:41.040
well-known polymathic scholar and public speaker. Zach Stein may be a little less known,

07:41.040 --> 07:47.120
but for those who do know him, it's hugely exciting to give him a chance to speak with Ian.

07:47.120 --> 07:54.240
I have known Zach now for about four to five years, and we went to the same graduate school,

07:54.240 --> 07:58.480
although my sense of talking with Zach is always that I've heard of the books that he's actually

07:58.480 --> 08:03.520
read. That's usually my feeling of encountering Zach. He's a very studious, very early diet fellow,

08:04.240 --> 08:08.640
really engages very deeply with all the material that he touches. So when he speaks,

08:08.640 --> 08:13.280
he speaks with a great deal of authority because it comes from a lot of study and consideration.

08:14.240 --> 08:22.320
He is, among many, many other things, one of the co-founders of the Civilization Research Institute.

08:22.960 --> 08:28.880
He is working on a lot of different books, but I happen to know as publisher that he has a manuscript

08:28.880 --> 08:32.080
in preparation that relates to metaphysics, which is one of the reasons I thought he was

08:32.080 --> 08:37.280
particularly well placed to talk with Ian tonight. He's also a philosopher of education,

08:37.280 --> 08:41.520
and he's written several essays for Perspectiva, which you can again,

08:41.520 --> 08:46.080
we'll share with you in the chat in due course. So I think that's all for me,

08:46.080 --> 08:52.400
if I haven't forgotten anything. I hope I've made sense of a thank you to our main sponsors,

08:53.760 --> 08:57.920
why we're having this series at all, why tonight's event matters most, and why our

08:57.920 --> 09:03.920
speakers are great. And with that, I can disappear for 45 to 50 minutes and let you enjoy Ian and

09:04.000 --> 09:10.320
Zach's company. I'll see you later on. Bye-bye. Thank you, Jonathan.

09:11.360 --> 09:20.960
Thank you, Jonathan. It's a pleasure to talk, never spoken before, so it's kind of

09:20.960 --> 09:28.640
interesting to have a first conversation, so publicly. Jonathan mentioned that I'm working

09:28.640 --> 09:34.640
on a book on metaphysics. I have a training in cognitive developmental psychology as a

09:34.640 --> 09:38.640
neo-Pijadian, and so when I encountered work, it was actually like

09:40.400 --> 09:44.880
that experience of someone saying something that I almost completely agreed with,

09:45.760 --> 09:53.840
where there was just this complete absorption of the book and both volumes and the prior work.

09:54.640 --> 10:02.400
And what was interesting to me was that in my own experience and in the branches of psychology

10:02.400 --> 10:08.480
that I explored and philosophy that I explored, value was a given. And so the skepticism and

10:08.480 --> 10:13.280
cynicism about value that I encountered in postmodernism and even some forms of modernism

10:13.920 --> 10:18.880
was actually kind of like I didn't understand it. But I also encountered people who didn't

10:18.880 --> 10:25.600
understand value as a given. So when I got to the places in your work where it was clear that

10:25.600 --> 10:30.800
there were hemispheric dominance patterns that were expressing themselves across these different

10:30.800 --> 10:35.760
philosophical positions and even in the personalities of the people who are holding them,

10:36.800 --> 10:44.960
lights went off. And so I'm just kind of thanking you for your work before I get into it.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.520
No, thank you very, very much. I hope the lights went on as well.

10:54.480 --> 11:02.560
Yes, anyway. No, thank you very much. And yes, I look forward to talking about these things.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.200
Perhaps I should just begin, unless you've got a question lined up. Have you got a question

11:07.200 --> 11:18.400
lined up? I had a prompt, which was page 1122. And so this is the second volume. This is the

11:18.400 --> 11:24.240
chapter on value. You say something and it's just a simple sentence, but it's very, very profound,

11:24.240 --> 11:32.080
which is that you're placing value as equally primordial with time, space, matter, and motion,

11:32.160 --> 11:37.600
and consciousness. And so this is when you think about what is the universe? What is reality?

11:38.320 --> 11:43.840
Time, space, matter, motion, sure, everyone kind of buys that consciousness. You can get people to

11:43.840 --> 11:50.400
do that. Placing value as equally primordial to those elements of cosmos is part of the work

11:50.400 --> 11:55.760
that I'm doing in metaphysics at the Center for Enduroism with Gaffney and Wilbur. And it's

11:55.760 --> 12:01.920
core to the work that I was doing as a psychologist, as a Piagetian, where he was in part with

12:01.920 --> 12:06.800
moral judgment and Kohlberg. What they were looking at was value-ception, was the ability of the

12:06.800 --> 12:13.920
organism itself to perceive the field of value. Kohlberg was a moral realist. He believed that

12:14.880 --> 12:20.560
you equilibrated your moral judgment to a moral reality the way you equilibrate your

12:20.640 --> 12:27.280
socio, excuse me, your sensory motor intelligence to gravity. Gravity exists. So you operate on

12:27.280 --> 12:33.840
gravity as a kid, and you learn to work and navigate space and time with your body.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.640
Kohlberg's basically saying, and you do a similar thing with moral reality, with the field of value.

12:39.360 --> 12:47.520
You learn from it. It's not a simple instruction. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the

12:47.520 --> 12:54.240
philosophical lineage that has always held that as true. Because my sense is that most humans in

12:54.240 --> 13:00.000
most cultures, with most philosophies and worldviews and religions, held this as true. It's only mostly

13:00.000 --> 13:06.320
recently in modernity. That default position has been a value cynicism or value skepticism.

13:07.200 --> 13:13.840
And so I wonder if you could kind of underline that point that, yes, value is life, time, matter,

13:14.560 --> 13:18.320
motion, really primordial, constitutive of universe.

13:20.880 --> 13:29.040
Yes. Well, I believe it to be so. I felt that people would, and I'm glad you have that reaction,

13:29.040 --> 13:33.680
think, goodness, you've talked about all these things that everyone agrees are constitutive of

13:33.680 --> 13:39.600
the cosmos. But now you're talking about things like value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred,

13:39.600 --> 13:44.480
which are my last three chapters. And I left them to that point, because I thought that if

13:44.480 --> 13:50.960
people understood enough about what I said earlier about the more commonly accepted foundations of

13:50.960 --> 13:56.480
reality, they would probably see why I would consider these things also as foundational.

13:59.920 --> 14:06.320
The chapter is called value, not values, as Jonathan pointed out, because

14:06.880 --> 14:14.320
I'm not really talking in this chapter about which particular every day values we might consider to

14:14.320 --> 14:21.360
be the more important ones. I think there is a discussion to be had about values, but often

14:21.360 --> 14:28.160
values boils down to objectives. And that objective is often economic, as Jonathan pointed out.

14:29.440 --> 14:35.520
And I don't think values are objectives exactly. An objective is something that in the

14:36.080 --> 14:41.840
left hand is where you target, you find a line to go to it and achieve it. Whereas what I'm talking

14:41.840 --> 14:49.920
about is something that is, I believe, impossible to do without. I mean, it's not an invention,

14:49.920 --> 14:57.760
it is something that is there in the ground of our being. We don't, I think, a very important

14:57.760 --> 15:05.040
starting point is I don't believe that we invent values and paint them onto reality in order to

15:05.040 --> 15:12.240
cheer ourselves up, but that we actually discover values. They are there for the discovery. We either

15:12.240 --> 15:18.400
respond to them or we don't. And perhaps that would take us too far from this discussion,

15:18.400 --> 15:24.800
which hasn't even got going on value yet. But I do argue that the purpose of life,

15:25.440 --> 15:30.800
the reason the cosmos brings into being something quite so counterintuitive as life

15:31.680 --> 15:41.520
with all its problems is that it is the ability to bring forth in that cosmos something that can

15:41.520 --> 15:49.040
respond to these primordial values. So I think I start by saying something like,

15:49.040 --> 15:54.720
so consciousness is not what life brings, because I've suggested in a previous chapter that

15:54.720 --> 16:00.560
consciousness is everywhere in the universe, and that's becoming not an unusual point of

16:00.560 --> 16:05.600
view. It's, of course, very widely been accepted for thousands of years, particularly in the east,

16:05.600 --> 16:13.920
but it's now being accepted much more in the mainstream of analytic Anglo-American philosophy.

16:14.480 --> 16:21.040
But the idea of value is, I think there are a number of aspects to it, really. And perhaps

16:21.040 --> 16:26.320
if I just say something about what I take it that we generally believe in, something about

16:26.320 --> 16:31.680
what I am going to argue or what I do argue there, that would help. There are about half

16:31.680 --> 16:37.360
a dozen of them, and one I've mentioned, which is this idea that we don't invent but discover it.

16:38.400 --> 16:45.520
And related to that is that it is not a cognitive derivation. It is not something that we look at

16:45.520 --> 16:52.160
life and then we attach certain sort of things and we call those values. But we have this ability

16:52.160 --> 16:56.880
to be in touch with something which is an ontological primitive. And we do it through what

16:57.520 --> 17:02.640
you've already mentioned, this concept of value-ception, which I believe is a translation

17:03.280 --> 17:10.960
from the German of Max Schäler, who invented a word in German, which didn't until he made it up

17:10.960 --> 17:18.640
exist, which is Warnähmung, no, sorry, Warnähmung is perception, but Wertähmung, which is valuing.

17:18.640 --> 17:25.760
And so Wertähmung is really a version of Warnähmung, which is a perfectly straightforward

17:25.760 --> 17:31.360
German word for perception. But the link with perception is interesting, because when we perceive

17:31.360 --> 17:40.640
things, we don't take in a piece of data passively. We're not like receptive plates that absorb

17:40.640 --> 17:50.000
data and then do a calculation on it and have a response. We immediately, as it were, get an idea

17:50.000 --> 17:57.760
of what it is that we're dealing with here. And in fact, we go to meet it, which is another

17:57.760 --> 18:06.400
interesting idea. So it's disclosed in a precognitive take on the Gestalt of what we're seeing. It's

18:06.480 --> 18:13.520
not calculated. And this is particularly important when it comes to my understanding of morality

18:13.520 --> 18:22.320
itself, of goodness. It's now been for a long time normal within the mainstream of Western

18:22.320 --> 18:31.280
academia to consider that anyone who espouses another view of morality than utilitarianism

18:31.360 --> 18:37.200
must be making a fundamental mistake. But utilitarianism is exactly the kind of morality

18:37.200 --> 18:42.960
that is made simply out of making a calculation of what results from it. And that perhaps brings

18:42.960 --> 18:48.400
sharply into focus what I'm talking about. It's not about a result. It's not about

18:49.360 --> 18:57.440
a calculation towards a known goal. It is something that evokes in us a reverberative

18:57.440 --> 19:04.000
relationship. So it calls to us and it calls to us from in front. So it is in that sense rather like

19:05.280 --> 19:11.520
a final cause rather than efficient cause. Most of our thinking is to do with an efficient cause,

19:11.520 --> 19:16.880
which is what pushes us from behind. The thing that makes us do something in the way that one

19:16.880 --> 19:21.760
would make a machine do something. I know you know all this, but I'm just saying it for everyone's

19:21.760 --> 19:30.880
benefit. Whereas a final cause is a cause that brings you to do something because you have a

19:30.880 --> 19:35.760
relationship with it. It's not a self-generated concept, but it is another. And that's a very

19:35.760 --> 19:40.720
important part of what I'm saying. And there are just a couple of things more to say and then I'll

19:40.720 --> 19:48.960
hand back to you. One is that this makes it something that is not determined, but is free.

19:48.960 --> 19:56.880
We can choose to respond or not. And we can choose what we believe actually fulfills each

19:56.880 --> 20:05.040
of these values. So I mentioned that there are goals or objectives or targets or things we like

20:05.040 --> 20:13.040
to do. And which ones we decide are beautiful, good or true is another conversation, an important

20:13.040 --> 20:19.200
one. But I'm talking here about the very fact of the being, beauty, goodness and truth at all.

20:20.720 --> 20:28.480
And the last point I'd like to make is that utilitarian thinking, which is in fact the value

20:28.480 --> 20:37.040
of the left hemisphere, that of utility, means that values are designed to make us do something

20:37.040 --> 20:43.760
that is evolutionarily beneficial. So beauty is just a way of making us choose the right mate

20:43.760 --> 20:52.960
or whatever. The idea of truth is just something that's made up by a powerful hierarchy to

20:52.960 --> 20:58.800
dragoon people into following it. And perhaps goodness is in the same league. Now what I'm

20:58.800 --> 21:07.200
saying is that truly understood, properly understood, these values are fulfilled in

21:07.200 --> 21:14.320
being responded to in themselves, not for any further purpose beyond that. So if I leave it at

21:14.320 --> 21:22.480
that as a sort of laying out my stall, you can now pick it apart. No, I think it's like I said,

21:22.560 --> 21:29.280
I agree with so much of what you're saying. And it's one of the things that I think clarifies the

21:29.280 --> 21:35.680
nature of value as you're trying to express it as a basic property of the cosmos. Something I write

21:35.680 --> 21:42.880
about in this work that Jonathan was speaking to, it is that it pre-exists the human, right?

21:42.880 --> 21:46.720
Because if you're a postmodernist, you take value as a social construction, then there's basically

21:46.720 --> 21:53.760
nothing until the human emerges and then we create value systems and we use them to oppress

21:53.760 --> 22:02.720
people or whatever you do with that. But the take here is that actually no, life emerged to respond

22:02.720 --> 22:08.800
to value which pre-existent. So I think Whitehead spoke of the appetite of the cosmos,

22:08.800 --> 22:14.640
that the cosmos had an appetite that it wanted something, that it moved towards something.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.920
And so that the evolutionary process responds to value makes it teleological.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.520
It also means that there's a dimension in biological evolution

22:27.280 --> 22:35.120
that is responding to the same field of real value that we are responding to. And that's, I think,

22:36.000 --> 22:40.640
again, a position that humans have believed before, like I think of natural law theory. It's not a

22:40.640 --> 22:46.000
great instance of it, but natural law is a case of that. And I think of religious systems where

22:46.800 --> 22:52.720
the ordering of the cosmos, you participated in it as a microcosm, so that there was this

22:52.720 --> 23:01.680
continuity of value across life and human and divine. So it's interesting that the power of

23:01.680 --> 23:10.880
the left hemisphere to reify a worldview that is so much a minority position respective to

23:11.680 --> 23:18.240
most of human thought is one of the things that strikes me. Because again, there's something

23:18.240 --> 23:23.200
about socialization or early childhood education or the nature of the things that get the left

23:23.200 --> 23:28.480
hemispheric dominance put in place. There's a type of person that hasn't been domesticated

23:28.480 --> 23:34.320
to that by the educational system. It's not clear why that occurs. And for them, arguments about value

23:34.320 --> 23:39.360
as I'm making here seem, actually, they like them. Makes you feel good. You feel like you're at home

23:39.360 --> 23:44.480
in the universe. Like the things you care about actually matter to the universe. And then there's

23:44.480 --> 23:51.040
another personality type, let me say, which is deeply skeptical, cynical of that view. In fact,

23:51.040 --> 23:54.800
anything that would make you feel at home in the universe is probably proof that it's not science.

23:54.800 --> 23:59.920
Right. And you think that would make you feel comfortable thinking about

24:01.680 --> 24:08.320
the emergence of human value from biological evolution would be odd. So I guess I'm

24:09.600 --> 24:13.120
Yeah, please. No, I'm just kind of that's, that's, of course,

24:14.640 --> 24:19.840
a case of Petiti Open Kipi, isn't it? I mean, it seems like it must be wrong because

24:19.920 --> 24:26.640
science starts from the standpoint that of course, all this has to be viewed as objectively alien to

24:26.640 --> 24:33.440
us. And so it discovers that it is curious enough alien, you know, after after much looking for things

24:33.440 --> 24:40.960
that it has ruled out from the start, like purpose and real values, it finds that these things can't

24:40.960 --> 24:46.240
exist. Or if you hold that they do exist, you can't be being scientific. Well, I mean, I've tried to

24:46.240 --> 24:51.920
argue from science and philosophy for these very concepts themselves.

24:52.560 --> 24:58.160
Yeah. And it's there, you can see it in the science if you read it from a different angle.

25:00.640 --> 25:05.600
Can I mention Darwin, because people will, you know, we're talking about evolution, you

25:05.600 --> 25:11.760
raised biology. And one of the things that I love about Darwin, apart from anything else,

25:11.760 --> 25:21.200
is that he was motivated in his study by beauty. And that in his earlier writings, beauty is already

25:23.040 --> 25:32.000
beauty or beautiful occurs on one in six of his pages. But in his final writings, it occurs in

25:32.000 --> 25:38.640
on average, every other page he uses the term beauty or beautiful, he's constantly referring to it.

25:38.640 --> 25:45.920
And twice he puzzles over it. Because he says, it's all very well to say that birds choose a mate

25:45.920 --> 25:51.760
because they find them beautiful. And that of course, in itself suggests that it doesn't just

25:51.760 --> 26:02.320
arise with us, with us humans. But the existence of beauty itself remains a mystery. I mean,

26:02.320 --> 26:09.280
what that that observation addresses is given the existence of beauty, how can it be made useful to

26:09.280 --> 26:15.360
evolution? But it doesn't answer the question, how does beauty come about? And what does it lie in?

26:16.240 --> 26:20.640
Yeah, it's interesting. Darwin also writes a lot about love. And I bet they co-occur with beauty.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.800
It's dynamic of allurement and attraction in the animal kingdom.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.480
Not as much. But yes, yes.

26:26.480 --> 26:31.840
Yeah. And the the plentitude of nature in the creation of beautiful things, because it's not

26:31.920 --> 26:36.080
just that the bird is beautiful to the other bird, it also appears beautiful to us, which

26:36.080 --> 26:40.960
seems it seems extravagant. Like, why would it be that the human nervous system responds so

26:40.960 --> 26:50.640
immediately to completely these things? This is a point I make. I mean, why is it that the

26:50.640 --> 26:54.960
things that birds and animals find beautiful? We also find beautiful, even though they have no

26:56.480 --> 27:00.880
relevant. I mean, the fact that a bird has certain colors doesn't or a plant. In fact,

27:02.160 --> 27:08.480
a plant that is poisonous may be very beautiful. So it's not a matter of, you know, being evolution

27:08.480 --> 27:14.480
really beneficial. It just is beautiful. And another thing is trees, the shape of trees,

27:14.480 --> 27:19.600
the shapes of trees are intrinsically beautiful to humans that have been commented on since

27:19.600 --> 27:26.880
time immemorial. But there's nothing about the shape of a tree that can in any sense be attractive

27:26.880 --> 27:33.600
from a propagation of the species point of view. Of course, they need insects. But don't tell me

27:33.600 --> 27:41.200
insects are going around going, that Elm is just exquisite. And why would my nervous system evolve

27:41.200 --> 27:47.360
to be appreciative of the beauty of the tree and indeed, indeed, and it certainly is. And so that

27:47.360 --> 27:53.600
notion of kind of like moving the utilitarian calculus down into evolutionary explanation,

27:53.600 --> 27:58.080
and therefore believing that something that's here, like my whole body and mind involved for

27:58.080 --> 28:05.120
this very narrow function is in fact incorrect. That if value exists and life responds to value,

28:05.120 --> 28:11.520
then it's reasonable that we optimized actually biologically, neurologically for love, beauty,

28:12.240 --> 28:18.240
or a whole host of values that we actually have the ability to respond to. And so value

28:18.240 --> 28:26.640
perception, this gets to a question. Value is like a skill. Like value can be trained. And when

28:26.640 --> 28:32.000
you think of the aesthetic perception, I had training as exactly, it was a music, it was a

28:32.000 --> 28:38.800
music actually where I, I so desperately wanted to have certain albums in my possession, and to

28:38.800 --> 28:43.600
like expose myself to such a beautiful thing specifically jazz and Indian classical music.

28:44.560 --> 28:50.560
Whereas why? When I take a working job at a coffee shop specifically to get money just to buy these

28:50.560 --> 28:56.960
things. So the intrinsic value and the impression. So this question, oh yeah,

28:57.760 --> 29:04.000
how do you build value perception? Why is it that our schools, for example, seem to inhibit it,

29:04.000 --> 29:08.960
that the culture seems to actually create the opposite, where things that happen,

29:09.840 --> 29:14.560
where things that happen are perceived as having value is one way of even describing the commodity

29:14.560 --> 29:24.480
form itself, that you perform a trick. Yes, yes, yes. The exchange value overriding the actual

29:24.480 --> 29:32.720
use value as it were. So yeah, how do we get better value perception? How do we get confused?

29:33.360 --> 29:41.280
Yeah. Yes, it's a very interesting question because like so many things, it's not black

29:41.280 --> 29:51.200
and white in that value section can only exist once it's been trained. But it's also true that

29:51.200 --> 29:59.680
it can be trained, but it is intrinsic. So I think children without any instruction find certain

30:00.240 --> 30:08.400
things beautiful and certain animals, for example, beautiful. And they also find some ugly. And this

30:08.400 --> 30:13.200
is an important point to make because something that might be said is, well, you know, you find all

30:13.200 --> 30:17.280
these beautiful things in nature just because we're trained that whatever is natural is beautiful.

30:17.280 --> 30:23.840
Absolutely not. Although most of nature manages to remain extremely beautiful, there are certainly

30:23.840 --> 30:31.120
lots of things in nature that are just plain ugly. And in the book, I'm afraid I draw attention to the

30:31.120 --> 30:39.520
rather unattractive features of the shoe build stalk, I seem to remember. There it is, it's an

30:39.520 --> 30:45.680
entirely natural bird creation, but it's not a very attractive one, I think to most people.

30:45.680 --> 30:51.360
So I think they're intrinsic and also goodness. I mean, goodness is obviously culturally determined

30:51.360 --> 30:56.800
to a point. But this can be exaggerated. I mean, there are very few cultures in the world

30:56.800 --> 31:08.720
where it's considered good to murder and rape. In fact, beauty too is far more culturally universal

31:08.720 --> 31:16.080
than is made out by people who want to impress on us that it's simply made up. Most Eastern

31:16.080 --> 31:23.280
peoples, Chinese and Japanese, for example, find no problem whatever in enjoying the works of art in

31:23.280 --> 31:29.520
Western works of art in our museums, coming to the plays of Shakespeare, we find no problem at all

31:29.520 --> 31:39.440
in going to in the beauty of their art and their culture. So and interestingly, it's also true that

31:39.440 --> 31:47.520
things can be found that quite specifically mean things that are intrinsic. So for example,

31:47.520 --> 31:55.920
certain intervals and shapes and melodies in an Indian raga can be understood by Norwegians who

31:55.920 --> 32:00.720
know nothing about Indian music. If they're asked to say, what is it that this is expressing,

32:01.360 --> 32:08.000
they are remarkably similar to what an Indian listener trained would say that was being expressed.

32:08.000 --> 32:16.240
So I mean, that's a scientifically verified result. So I think it's like so many things

32:16.240 --> 32:24.160
that you can have a basic understanding of something. But what we can do is help it to

32:24.160 --> 32:29.360
flourish and grow in beneficial directions. And this is a little bit like anything that grows,

32:29.360 --> 32:38.960
a plant. A plant can grow and will grow anyway. But a gardener can actually make plants thrive more

32:38.960 --> 32:45.280
and can make them grow to another shape or to another size or to another color. So there is a

32:45.280 --> 32:51.680
way in which whatever is there can be trained by us. But that doesn't mean that it's made up by us.

32:52.560 --> 32:59.600
I believe that Goethe is right when he says that everything properly considered and appreciated

32:59.600 --> 33:06.240
by us calls out in us the faculty with which we can appreciate it. And so for example,

33:06.800 --> 33:12.080
you talked about music, and I imagine your experience is the same as mine, that when one

33:12.080 --> 33:17.520
starts learning to love music, one loves certain things that one perhaps still loves, but one

33:17.520 --> 33:23.760
can't necessarily immediately respond to other things that as one learns more and more, the faculty

33:23.760 --> 33:29.040
in us to appreciate them grows. And the deepening of value, one way to think about human development,

33:29.840 --> 33:35.120
the human development is just that maturation, if you will, is this deepening of creation of

33:35.120 --> 33:42.240
more and more value. And it's not, it's not the making up more things to care about. It's the

33:42.320 --> 33:47.680
getting deeper in touch with reality. It's actually deepening to this field of value.

33:48.560 --> 33:54.080
And again, from a human development perspective, it does seem that it's a disposition that is deeply

33:54.080 --> 34:04.560
rooted values. And that a lot of what occurs is just the absence of support for that skill and

34:04.560 --> 34:10.640
things that counteract it, which is to say anti-value. So preference, like preference

34:10.720 --> 34:16.640
falsification is the root of advertising. And advertising suffuses our environment. So there's

34:16.640 --> 34:23.440
a intentional thing in our culture to actually disrupt the ability to truly perceive value.

34:23.440 --> 34:29.040
So it's a thing that we need to think about, like how do we protect ourselves from being confused

34:29.040 --> 34:36.240
and then sit and appreciate how does that actually work? Even just the ability to hold

34:36.240 --> 34:43.120
attention for a long period of time is necessary for certain levels of appreciation of value and

34:43.120 --> 34:52.640
beauty. Which is another reason why attention is a moral act, as we have called this series,

34:52.640 --> 34:58.640
which is a phrase that I think I use in both the master and his emissary and the master of things.

34:59.360 --> 35:04.480
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm right there. But the implication also, another implication,

35:04.560 --> 35:11.440
kind of a question is, so therefore, if we really downgrade value exception,

35:11.440 --> 35:18.400
like let's say value collapses at the center of culture, which is what you could say is occurring,

35:18.400 --> 35:27.280
that we've kind of burnt off the fumes of pre-modernity and we're running out of

35:28.080 --> 35:37.360
center of value and even the ability to then perceive value. That's very dangerous. Like if

35:37.360 --> 35:43.760
part of what evolution has been is adapting us to perceive and relate to value. If we cut off

35:43.760 --> 35:52.000
that ability, then we become evolutionarily non adaptive, which means we go extinct. So another

35:52.080 --> 35:57.200
place that this work that I'm doing is the relationship between value and existential

35:57.200 --> 36:02.720
risk and civilization on the rise, which is that the patterns you're pointing to

36:04.240 --> 36:08.720
are actually deep generator functions of existential risk. If you will, let me drop

36:08.720 --> 36:14.320
into that. Okay. I'm saying like the inability to see the simplification of problem to narrow

36:14.320 --> 36:20.480
metric. This characterization of a complex thing as a complicated thing that could be fixed,

36:20.480 --> 36:25.920
but actually you can't. All those characteristics are things that are

36:26.880 --> 36:33.360
leading us to a point in civilization that is treacherous. There's an urgency,

36:33.360 --> 36:39.520
I see it as an educational urgency, to figure out how to rebalance the hemisphere. And that's

36:39.520 --> 36:46.720
why I'm focusing on value exception. What can we actually do to allow ourselves to perceive

36:46.720 --> 36:50.400
what's actually valuable again? Because we're clearly very confused about what value is.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.360
If we've been brought to a place where our civilization is about to self-destruct,

36:54.160 --> 37:00.480
and AI is a great example. The core of the AI risk is the alignment problem, which is a value

37:00.480 --> 37:06.320
alignment problem. So that's me kind of saying help us save civilization, Ian.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.360
How do we learn to perceive value again so that we know?

37:12.240 --> 37:21.360
Thanks. Yes, I can't remember who it is, but you can probably tell me in Silicon Valley who said

37:21.360 --> 37:26.560
that, yes, the way AI is going will probably render us extinct, but it'll be very good for

37:26.560 --> 37:33.280
the economy in the meantime. And that perhaps sums up the left hemisphere's approach to these

37:33.280 --> 37:39.920
things. It only understands power, control, utility, and as a sort of subset of that pleasure,

37:39.920 --> 37:44.080
which is assumed to be what these things give. Although, by the way, they don't.

37:45.760 --> 37:52.480
People who have as much power as you can conceivably imagine lead unhappy, anxious lives.

37:52.480 --> 38:02.320
But there we are. I can tell you for free as a psychiatrist. But yes, how do we get back on

38:02.320 --> 38:06.640
course? Well, partly, of course, you won't be surprised to hear me say that

38:08.400 --> 38:14.720
even below the fixing of values is this business of the hemisphere balance, because you mentioned

38:14.720 --> 38:21.920
there the idea of a complicated machine that can be fixed versus a complex system, which is

38:21.920 --> 38:29.120
the difference being that a complex system is intrinsically indeterminate. It is intrinsically

38:29.120 --> 38:37.280
free. It is intrinsically not controllable. It is intrinsically able to move in a way that we

38:37.280 --> 38:44.800
can't actually program. So that is, that is a kind of slap in the face to the those who hold

38:44.800 --> 38:51.280
this left hemisphere view that we can make ourselves all powerful. And to me, the most

38:51.280 --> 38:56.960
heinous thing that has happened in the last 200 years, or perhaps even since the enlightenment,

38:56.960 --> 39:03.920
is this belief that we can control everything, that we have power. And if only we could have

39:03.920 --> 39:09.840
humility enough to understand how little we know, how little we really understand what we're dealing

39:09.840 --> 39:17.920
with, and how helpless we will be in the face of things that we are now setting loose, and then

39:18.800 --> 39:26.640
if it might not be too late to do something about it. So regaining some sense of humility and

39:26.640 --> 39:33.040
awe before what it is we're seeing, respect for these things, not the whole idea that we

39:33.040 --> 39:40.560
make them all up, of course, is a version of this idea that we are the creators of everything we

39:40.560 --> 39:50.720
see. We are the creators of all that we experience. Excuse me, we are not. We are the receivers,

39:50.720 --> 39:58.720
we are the grateful or should be grateful recipients of some enormous gift that we only

39:58.720 --> 40:06.400
partly understand. And we have a responsibility to respond to that. That's the root of

40:06.400 --> 40:11.680
responsibility is this idea you have to respond to something. And that that something is calling

40:11.680 --> 40:22.160
to us to behave in a different way. So obviously, one of the things I would say is that we need to

40:23.200 --> 40:30.160
open up the minds of those who are both now in control and will control our futures

40:30.880 --> 40:38.240
to the idea of we don't understand this, we don't know what it is, but let us find the good in it,

40:38.240 --> 40:43.920
the beautiful in it, and what is true about it. Because at the moment, I don't think there's ever

40:43.920 --> 40:51.280
been a period since recorded time that I know of when truth has been so profoundly

40:51.280 --> 40:58.160
travested. And with the development of AI, it's going to be almost impossible for education,

40:58.160 --> 41:05.200
for the law, for politics to function if we don't know whether something is a video clip that is

41:05.200 --> 41:12.000
made up by a computer showing a politician saying things he never said. When we get to that, and how

41:12.000 --> 41:17.680
do we know that the children or the young people we're teaching have really understood anything

41:17.680 --> 41:24.960
if they can generate an essay that will satisfy an examiner. And it's going to negate all the

41:24.960 --> 41:31.040
things on which a civilization is built. And what a civilization is for is to guarantee that we are

41:31.040 --> 41:37.200
better at seeing the beautiful, the good, and the true, which to me are with the sacred, which

41:37.200 --> 41:46.160
goes above it, is the most important value of all. Yeah, and this is one of the central risks that

41:46.160 --> 41:51.520
people don't see in terms of catastrophic risk, is the true collapse of culture and truth at this

41:52.640 --> 41:58.960
in value. Because what occurs there is basically, I'm not going to steal Benito Roy's thunder,

41:58.960 --> 42:04.320
but basically it's a schizophrenic break at the level of culture where the entire culture gets

42:04.320 --> 42:13.680
out of touch with the ability to perceive value. And AI is the thing that could perpetrate that

42:13.680 --> 42:20.560
break. I wonder too, though, about the relationship between depression and the hemispheres and

42:20.560 --> 42:24.480
traumatic experience in the hemispheres. So part of me is like, okay, you think you can control the

42:24.480 --> 42:30.960
world, and you kind of pretend you can for a while until it slaps you in the face and something

42:31.520 --> 42:36.160
occurs that forces your identity to reorient. Because I'm thinking like, what is the actual human

42:36.160 --> 42:45.040
development process when someone actually reorients their basic hemispheric dominance pattern?

42:45.040 --> 42:50.880
Maybe that's too simple a way to think. But I wonder if, you know, at various points in history

42:50.880 --> 43:00.640
where we seem to step in and speak from, you know, the master, more times, sometimes after

43:00.640 --> 43:06.720
very hard lessons were learned. And so I'm wondering if one of the things that will reawaken the

43:06.720 --> 43:12.560
perception of value is actually the occurrence of catastrophe and tragedy?

43:13.280 --> 43:21.280
Yes, I think that's right. And I wouldn't cast it myself in terms of depression, trauma and the

43:21.280 --> 43:28.160
hemispheres. Because that's just too complicated. I mean, I think there's something in it. And you

43:28.160 --> 43:36.960
know that I devote a whole chapter in the matter of things to showing what the correspondences are

43:36.960 --> 43:42.320
between a left hemisphere dominated picture of the world and a right hemisphere deficient

43:42.320 --> 43:49.920
picture of the world. And that of the subject of schizophrenia. So that is very much like

43:49.920 --> 43:55.120
left hemisphere overdrive. And it's been commented before I drew these parallels by people like

43:55.120 --> 43:59.760
Louis Sass, that something seems to be happening to our culture, which is rather like what happens

43:59.760 --> 44:05.040
in schizophrenia. And of course, schizophrenia is a very distressing condition, which often

44:05.040 --> 44:12.480
does lead individually to suicide. I believe that we are actually pursuing our own suicide

44:12.480 --> 44:18.320
very rapidly at the moment, we're disemboweling our culture and destroying all the good in it.

44:18.320 --> 44:25.600
We are disemboweling and destroying the beauty and the the vibrance of nature. And we've turned

44:25.600 --> 44:32.160
our backs on the sacred and the divine and said that these are just childish fantasies,

44:32.160 --> 44:38.480
whereas they're probably the most important realities that they're not easy to find for us

44:38.480 --> 44:44.000
now. So I don't disrespect somebody who can't find them and can't see what is meant by them.

44:44.880 --> 44:48.480
And indeed, I think that the talk about them is quite problematic. And no doubt,

44:48.480 --> 44:54.480
I'll talk to someone else in another session about that. But nevertheless, I think these values are

44:54.480 --> 44:59.520
hugely important to me are losing them. It might be worth just mentioning, because I think it's

44:59.600 --> 45:07.760
something helpful to me, I found, which is Schäler's pyramid of values. I'm talking here,

45:08.480 --> 45:16.720
not about Schiller, but Schäler, Max Schäler, S-C-H-E-L-E-R, who was an early 20th century

45:16.720 --> 45:22.720
German phenomenological philosopher, said by Heidegger to be the brightest philosopher in Europe

45:22.720 --> 45:30.720
of his generation. And he wrote about values in a way that Heidegger himself didn't,

45:30.720 --> 45:35.680
nor actually did, Victor Constantine to the same extent. Although in culture and value,

45:35.680 --> 45:41.520
I find he writes beautifully about these things. But in any case, Max Schäler had a pyramid of

45:41.520 --> 45:48.720
values, a hierarchy, and at the bottom were those of use, i.e. utility and pleasure,

45:48.720 --> 45:59.440
and then somewhat above that were what he called the labents, that are the values of life. And he

45:59.440 --> 46:07.360
meant by these things like generosity and courage and magnanimity and loyalty. And then above that

46:07.360 --> 46:13.200
came effectively what he called the geistige, that are meaning either the intellectual, the spiritual

46:14.080 --> 46:20.080
values, which are, I believe, beauty, goodness, and truth, principally. And other values that you

46:20.080 --> 46:26.800
might mention are effectively derivative from either beauty, goodness, or truth, that we value

46:26.800 --> 46:32.320
them because we think they are either good, or we think they're beautiful, or we think they're true.

46:32.320 --> 46:37.840
And then on the top of this pyramid was the sacred. And what I suggest is that in our own time,

46:37.840 --> 46:42.480
we have inverted this pyramid so that the left hemisphere's value is at the top,

46:43.760 --> 46:50.000
that of utility, and the other ones are said to be simply in service utility. That is the vision

46:50.640 --> 46:57.280
of the materialist reductionists who until recently have held the floor in the universities.

46:57.280 --> 47:02.480
That, thank goodness, is changing. There is a wonderful move of foot I see in philosophy,

47:02.480 --> 47:11.600
I see in biology, that people see that this very simplistic, mechanistic vision is gone.

47:11.600 --> 47:19.200
It's over. It just doesn't work. Yeah, thank you for all that. That was intriguing. I'd been saying

47:19.200 --> 47:25.440
for some time that we were dealing with basically a suicidal culture that was running and overdrive

47:25.440 --> 47:32.560
down into those patterns. So it's like this from getting too much into that. But your enumeration

47:32.560 --> 47:41.360
there of the hierarchy of values gets into Jonathan's point about values versus value,

47:41.360 --> 47:47.600
and is there some structure to the organization of first principles and first values? Like the

47:47.600 --> 47:52.800
core of the work that I'm doing at the differential wisdom is that enumerating first

47:52.880 --> 47:58.960
principles and first values from a perspective of continuity with evolution itself, so that

47:58.960 --> 48:04.720
there are some values which are periphery, which occur locally, and then there are other values

48:04.720 --> 48:09.760
which are so core that we can actually say that we share them with like animals, and that we share

48:09.760 --> 48:17.920
them perhaps with cells. That value pre-exists us, then there's a continuity of value that we

48:17.920 --> 48:26.240
participate in. And so things like harmony. Like harmony is expressed very early in physics,

48:27.040 --> 48:33.600
where you either get to land or you do not work. And if you think of multicellular organisms

48:34.480 --> 48:39.760
or complex organisms, a lot of what's occurring there is complex systems of

48:39.760 --> 48:46.880
interest, harmonious things. Humans start to use speech, they start to try to name values,

48:46.880 --> 48:53.200
and you get something like justice or fairness as a continuation of this dimension of. So that's

48:53.200 --> 49:01.520
some of the thing we're doing there. What emerges is that there's a paucity of language of evaluation

49:01.520 --> 49:06.960
in our culture. So this is Charles Taylor makes, he talks about languages of strong

49:06.960 --> 49:13.840
evaluation, being the core of the culture together. And that means a language of shared value. We

49:13.840 --> 49:21.360
talk about a universal grammar of value is absent. We kind of have a grammar to talk about

49:21.360 --> 49:26.000
mathematics and science and all of these other things, but when we get together and we try to

49:26.000 --> 49:33.920
have a conversation about value, our tongues are tied. And especially when we've got our culture.

49:33.920 --> 49:41.040
So there's this need to create some new languages of value, I think.

49:41.840 --> 49:49.440
How much do you think that depends on the level at which one is talking about value?

49:50.080 --> 49:57.360
And I've sort of set up a kind of an idea of certain values such as beauty, goodness and truth.

49:57.360 --> 50:07.200
And it would almost make no sense to say up to a point about these things. We just do think beauty

50:07.200 --> 50:13.520
is good. We do think goodness is good. We do think the truth is good. It's almost a tautology.

50:14.160 --> 50:20.560
But if you start talking about the values that we hold as a society and one may go back to

50:21.200 --> 50:27.920
the call of the French Revolution. And these sound like a very good start.

50:28.560 --> 50:33.040
But immediately one finds oneself and this is where one might get tongue tied and there might be

50:33.040 --> 50:40.160
conflicts is but what exactly do we mean by these things and in what context and how much and for whom.

50:40.800 --> 50:48.640
So liberty is on the face of it highly desirable and I certainly wouldn't admire a culture in

50:48.640 --> 50:56.000
which there was no liberty. But obviously utterly untrammeled liberty is anarchy and restraints and

50:56.000 --> 51:03.920
constraints within reason are very important and we have mature societies able to balance

51:03.920 --> 51:11.120
those things. And you know it's true of egality and fraternity. You know what exactly does one

51:11.120 --> 51:16.960
mean by them? Are they always necessarily good in all contexts or do we have to finesse them?

51:16.960 --> 51:23.680
And I think that's what I would think is the difficulty about values themselves.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.240
Perhaps the only way in which one can

51:28.560 --> 51:34.240
resurrect the good sense of values is in fact by looking at societies that have been stable

51:34.240 --> 51:40.160
for a long time and produced that harmony that you thank you for mentioning that because I think

51:40.160 --> 51:45.920
it's terribly important and it's not only a very important idea in physics but also as you point

51:45.920 --> 51:56.400
out in biology and also of course it was foundational in Greek thinking you know from Pythagoras onwards.

51:56.400 --> 52:01.280
And some of those things you can see like it's a yes and you can hear it.

52:03.520 --> 52:06.960
Yeah so it's just it's a remarkable and suffuses I remember this quote by

52:07.600 --> 52:12.320
Whitehead again where he says you know the circle haunts the universe like a ghost and what he was

52:12.320 --> 52:18.720
talking about was just the presence of universals amongst the flux. And so harmony is harmony kind

52:18.720 --> 52:24.960
of haunts evolution at all stages and we yearn for it like in our in our societies we want

52:24.960 --> 52:32.400
harmony and it's interesting that. And what Harmony points out is it's all in relations.

52:32.960 --> 52:39.760
It's not unison it's relations between things but beautiful and generous relations that work

52:39.760 --> 52:47.920
together to produce only good and beautiful sound. So you know we talk about other species

52:47.920 --> 52:52.880
and humans and one and you talked about how harmony seems to be very much a kind of human

52:52.880 --> 53:00.960
conception I think you hinted that at any rate I hope I'm not misquoting you. But it is also true

53:00.960 --> 53:08.000
that you know birds sing but in essence they sing competitively but only humans can sing

53:08.080 --> 53:15.280
in harmony and attune their voices to one another. So this is I mean there's so much

53:15.280 --> 53:20.320
that one can regret about humanity but the trouble with this is that it leads to a kind of

53:20.320 --> 53:27.920
disparagement of everything that humanity can be and we need to preserve the ideal of what a human

53:27.920 --> 53:35.360
being and a human life and a human society can be what its meaning is at the same time as being

53:35.360 --> 53:41.600
highly critical of many of the things that it's now interpreted as involving and this comes down

53:41.600 --> 53:47.680
to my basic point and the reason I wrote the matter of things is that we no longer understand

53:47.680 --> 53:52.240
what a human being is what the world is and what we're hearing it for.

53:53.280 --> 53:59.200
And that's very unfortunate. That's very unfortunate. I believe in the in the Master's

53:59.200 --> 54:05.040
Emissary you cited that research that the vocal cords were more developed before the

54:05.600 --> 54:09.840
language centers so the very first humans communicated mostly through song basically

54:09.840 --> 54:17.840
that there was this kind of even state where there was this harmonic vocalization of somewhat

54:17.840 --> 54:23.280
sapient you know bipedal creatures who were basically singing together before they were speaking

54:23.280 --> 54:29.040
and that the function of language the function of language to be denotative and descriptive

54:30.400 --> 54:33.680
piggybacked on the use of the vocal cords for basically harmony.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.920
Well you know I mean this is I have to rely here quite a lot on anthropologists

54:42.720 --> 54:47.440
but there is a prominent school of anthropologists who certainly believe this even my than being one

54:47.440 --> 54:55.040
of the most best known exponents of it but what I think is nice is that there is very good

54:58.480 --> 55:05.840
if you like paleo anatomical reasons for believing that this is the case and from the examination

55:05.840 --> 55:12.320
of animals that their ability to vocalize and so on the nature of their skulls and their ribcages

55:12.880 --> 55:19.040
too much to explain now but it's in the Master and his Emissary but what I love about it is that

55:19.040 --> 55:27.440
it inverts this assumption that of course all the business is done with language and music is just

55:27.440 --> 55:34.800
some frivolous exaptation of language but actually it turns out that the science is on the side that

55:34.800 --> 55:40.560
music comes first and that language is a useful exaptation of music.

55:41.120 --> 55:46.000
Exactly that's the idea and were we being stopped was that a bell to intervene Jonathan?

55:46.000 --> 55:53.120
No no it's just that I'm part of my um hopelessly a tech world there's a grandfather clock sitting

55:53.120 --> 56:00.480
just in the next house so it was just yeah. I am ready to I am ready to come in like but carry on for

56:00.480 --> 56:06.320
now. Yeah I mean it's just a very it's a very deep point about what society ought to be like

56:06.320 --> 56:11.520
in things that in fact we listen. It's a knell that summons us to heaven or to hell sorry no

56:12.640 --> 56:16.000
sorry it's like carry on. It's a very pivotal moment in the conversation now.

56:18.240 --> 56:24.880
So the point is both that we misunderstand theoretically the function of language thinking

56:24.880 --> 56:29.920
that its primary function is denotative and descriptive when in fact there's a deeper

56:29.920 --> 56:36.880
function which is the resonance that allows for between us. As someone who's done some clinical

56:36.880 --> 56:41.200
work when you listen to someone speak you're often not listening to what they say you're

56:41.200 --> 56:47.040
listening to the tone and tenor and anxiety or absence of anxiety and the prosody and the

56:47.040 --> 56:53.520
pace of their speech and all the musical tones basically not the content and in fact the mismatch

56:53.520 --> 56:59.040
between content and that underlying musicality is a sign to pay attention to so it's just

56:59.040 --> 57:04.800
interesting to think that in fact we something as basic as language we're not we're missing the

57:04.800 --> 57:10.480
hemispheres are allowing us to misunderstand suddenly and that you know harmony suffuses

57:12.080 --> 57:19.360
this organism and it is resonates with it and yeah the chanting and the music

57:20.000 --> 57:23.840
and then the notion that in the human the value of harmony becomes aware of itself

57:24.480 --> 57:31.040
and so we actually arrange and this is the kind of an interesting note that runs through a couple

57:31.040 --> 57:37.280
of places in the matter of things that there's a something that occurs with the human as an

57:37.280 --> 57:42.400
evolutionary emergent where value and consciousness become aware of themselves in ways that they were

57:42.400 --> 57:49.760
not previously and this is a big I think that's a really important point and it goes back to my

57:49.760 --> 57:56.720
idea which I think is absolutely constant with my understanding of whitehead which is that whatever

57:56.720 --> 58:07.920
we mean by god the creative force logos li burta whatever it may be and that is bringing the cosmos

58:07.920 --> 58:15.200
into being and the cosmos is bringing it further into being so that each is unfolding and discovering

58:15.280 --> 58:22.400
more of its potential in this dynamic relationship it's not a story of a static something that just

58:22.400 --> 58:29.680
is or of two static some things but of a twofold relationship in which something is ever more

58:29.680 --> 58:35.120
coming into being that seems to be at the center of creation and if there's one thing one can say

58:35.120 --> 58:40.480
about the cosmos it is that it is creative in this way that is one of the primary values if

58:40.480 --> 58:48.320
like of the cosmos is simply to make things happen to differentiate out of an enormously

58:50.000 --> 59:00.480
potential unity all that that potential means when it's unfolded and then to refold it again into a

59:00.480 --> 59:06.080
now enriched unity which then carries on this process it's an alternation and of course this

59:06.080 --> 59:13.360
is very much in keeping with david bone's idea of the implicit order the explicit order and then

59:13.360 --> 59:19.760
being re unfolded into the implicit yeah we speak of evolving evolving value or evolving eternal

59:19.760 --> 59:28.880
value yes yes that yes to think about it and in the cabalester tradition there's a saying that

59:28.880 --> 59:35.680
there's more god to come which is basically i i didn't know that if you if you can give me the

59:35.680 --> 59:40.640
reference to that because i'm very keen on the cabala and i've never heard that but i argue of

59:40.640 --> 59:48.560
course that the cabala actually sees that um you know that whatever is the ground of being ends off

59:48.560 --> 59:53.760
is actually coming into being yeah now that's the root of this work because it's the collaboration

59:53.760 --> 59:59.920
with rabbi gaffney and ken wilber both esotericists and gaffney's gaffney's command of the cabalistic

59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.040
literature you know and and it's part of the through line of the matter with things is the

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:11.760
line back through shelling uh you know through bohem to the renaissance basically christian

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.520
and metaphysics has to be implicit there which is of this is the where god invests in the

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.520
cosmos the ability to basically further the divine to create new god and so as something

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:33.360
like harmony falls or beauty evolves um the intensification of the value evolves forever

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:40.960
and we participate in that self-aware you're creating a value so it's a it's a kind of we

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.160
either participate in it or fail to do so and that is the tragedy that at the moment we're

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:54.080
failing to do you say right thank you second ian if you i mean i i'm aware that you guys can talk

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:00.160
for hours further and uh i hope you will at some point and i'm very glad you've met and i i feel

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.560
very validated by the decision to bring you together and i hope it's the first of many

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:12.480
conversations because i'm aware that you're um you share depths um and common interests that are uh

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.480
uh are are sometimes esoteric and are sometimes extremely difficult but of fundamental importance

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.920
and um you know you're both first principles thinkers in a way that the world currently needs

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.120
so i'm very grateful to to have you here and bring you together but i'm also conscious we have 330

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:36.160
odd people um some of whom are keen to ask you things um i will before i'll ask you something

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.680
myself first but just to allow the audience to sort of warm up i am keen as a point of

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.760
principle in these sessions that we try and ask a question about what's just being spoken of

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:58.720
um not to revert back to the gochus 101 as i say um of course uh you may have you may have more

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.480
fundamental queries but it would be good because you've just shared something together that we

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:10.720
that we focus on what we've heard um with that in mind i am feeling significantly clearer about

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:18.400
my sort of quam inquiry earlier vis a vis the mapping of the relationship between

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.280
value values and and so on um but i'm also curious about something that is sort of

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.120
point related to that and it came up last in the last session too for all the bashing of the

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.000
left hemisphere and and i know you you you're quite famous for saying that the left hemisphere is your

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.640
second favorite hemisphere um and that it's you know it's one to be loved and cherished and it

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.640
shouldn't be you know knocked down i i i feel this work that i feel responsible for and the

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.440
perspective is engaged in of working with first principles thinkers like yourselves

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.920
trying to make sense of what they're really saying philosophically about the nature of

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:04.960
reality and our capacity to know it maybe love it um relate to it there is a certain um dignified

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.440
beautiful role for the left hemisphere in taking a few moments as emissary just to get clear about

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.440
what exactly the master's saying right absolutely and that's why when i occasionally feel almost

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:24.000
guilty like when i part of me has a kind of weird socio epistemic guilt about trying to map these

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.720
things mentally in a kind of cartography because i feel shouldn't i just be presencing

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.720
shouldn't i just be with this shouldn't i be playing some music or doing some art here

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.240
instead i'm trying to sort of craft out with these words in a bubble chart how they link

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.040
together and i think no surely it's not that nonetheless what i was trying to get at is that

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:48.240
you you mentioned shellers hierarchy or or rather structure thereof of the sacred giving rise to

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.840
sort of fundamental truth beauty and goodness and then you make mention of this more derivative

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:02.640
values um and that's useful but what i what i was left wondering is if value is primordial

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.880
and pre-human and in some sense something that life is for for us to be in relationship with

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.640
as you argue in the book you go on to have a chapter on the sacred but help me out here with

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.600
the distinction not between values plural and the sacred but values singular and the sacred

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.480
how can we make a distinction between them that's useful to make sense of what's being said here

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:33.680
first of all i should just comment that shaler doesn't imply that um the sacred gives rise to

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:41.280
the next lower line of the pyramid and so on down to utility and he simply says that there is a

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:49.520
hierarchy of values and that um some are simply more important than others they are more central

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:58.720
if you like to the business of leading a fulfilled human life and what i would say my answer to it

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.440
also touches on what you've just said about the importance of the left hemisphere that it's good

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:10.400
that it should um as it were question and and try and make clearer to itself what it is that the

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.960
master is talking about but it has to do so knowing that at the end of the day whatever it

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.240
can come up with for short of whatever it is the master is saying so the process is useful in that

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.880
things come out of it but at the end of the day it's not going to have an equivalent map and say

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.760
ah i've got the master's message now and it's all this because that would automatically be wrong

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:38.160
so having said that and what i think we can see is that the sacred is something that is dark

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:48.480
um it's the mystics talk about it as a kind of visible darkness a light that's so bright that in

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:57.040
fact for us it is invisible and penetrable or unknowable now if that is the case what happens

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:04.720
is that when it passes through a prison we can then perhaps begin to see it it it the light is

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:12.640
somehow um softened felted and the prison through which that light of the sacred comes is the one

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:20.480
that generates in my view beauty goodness and truth that these are manifestations of it that

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:28.000
the creation can respond to and that are its principal lures that are calling to us to to to

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.360
go to it does that help i mean it's beautiful before i can decide whether it has utility in the

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:41.600
sense of helping um so already i'm feeling the feeling the right sort of relative importance

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.040
of things um it does help and i don't it doesn't need to be pristine there was a moment i i shared

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:53.920
this with zack prior to the call um many of you will know uh george lackoff and his work on sort of

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.520
the representation of um concepts predict being embodied and sort of often often grounded

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:07.040
in metaphors of the body so you know an idea is big for an idea is big for example or um

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:14.560
you can um you know you can play with notions of of something being a long shot you know and

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.320
there's these sort of expressions which get at the idea that the way the mind organizes itself

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.600
conceptually is through these spatial metaphors and i found myself having a moment reading your

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:29.680
chapter 26 where i was going okay so you've got this value that's sort of primordial and

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.800
pre-human and fundamental and then you have love which comes up and you speak about the

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.480
relationship between love and then you have meaning and you have purpose and not just

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:46.960
any old purpose but cosmological teleological purpose and and i'm trying my mind to actually

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.640
see this in space so i had this moment of sort of you know um whatever that's called

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.120
edictic imagery or whatever that word is for this sort of thing in your mind and i was trying to

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.120
sort of right trying to picture that in my mind and i suddenly realized how absurd the whole thing

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:07.680
was in the sense that i couldn't possibly capture it because it somehow was as you say

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.720
always going to be an inadequate representation of what was actually being described and it was

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.960
very useful it was almost it was a it was a sort of micro spiritual experience of sorts because

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:25.680
there was a definitely a sense of these fundamental features of the universe love truth beauty goodness

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.360
value the sacred meaning purpose there's a lot of them right it's a family and and and you've said

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.000
before the vis-a-vis the mogulcus maneuver just as the one as many the many as one so it's not true

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.600
that they're all the same there and there's one sense the same and another sense they're not

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.960
and when you try and hold that in your mind and actually see how they map together is if it was

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.440
some kind of flowchart the only answer is a kind of laughter because it doesn't really work and it's

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.320
a liberation in some ways that it doesn't work and yet there's still a part of me that's a little

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:03.840
bit uneasy and i'm curious if anyone else feels that way well and if Zach or Zach or Ian has anything

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.600
to comment before other people come in i'll start looking at people's questions now while you're

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:14.480
answering that okay well i i'd just like to respond since well it's your point is it is

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:22.320
aimed at what i've been saying i suppose and i i i agree with that that idea that there seem to be

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:32.240
a family of these things but another way of looking at it is that i didn't put love in as a value

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:42.880
because i think love is the grounding the nature of being whatever and the sacred is our sense of

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:52.480
that ground of being and you could say that that ground of being and call it god whatever

01:09:52.480 --> 01:10:02.800
one wants to call it but the ultimate essence of of the creation of of the cosmos is itself

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:09.280
purposeful that it in general it generates automatically not as an extra thing not as a

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:16.720
sort of subsequently now i'm going to have a purpose but it is purposive love is purposive

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:27.760
it is ultimately aimed towards something that it's it's directed it is relational automatically

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.520
but i wouldn't again make relation another separate thing the trouble is that we're so

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.440
in hoc to things and i almost called this book there are no things because it isn't a thing

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.960
truth and beauty and goodness but what we're really trying to adumbrate is the nature of this

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:56.000
loving core that is in itself true that is in itself beautiful what it does is automatically

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.560
good although that is something that theologians could dispute for is it good because god automatically

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.760
goes there or does god go there because it's good you know and so forth but what i'm really

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:14.080
saying in brief is that these are different unfoldings of a single element the multiplicity is

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:21.840
the many strands that do nothing to um in any way imperil the integrity of the whole but in fact

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:29.280
enhance it okay the closest the closest thing would be like a field right so we speak of a field

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:36.640
there's a unified field of value but it's not featureless yes basic property by field would be

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.600
eros we talk about eros so we talk about cosmorodic humanism in which eros is the foundational

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.680
field root of value but then all of these values differentiate out but some have existed

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:55.760
since the big bang and others are more or more recent but yeah they're not things and therefore

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:00.400
when you flow chart them and even when you try to sequence them in a strict way you can't

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:08.240
um the left hemisphere will do that at lower moral stages of development but maturity as

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.400
deepening into value perceptions sees inevitable value conflict and again it's not a harmonious

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.400
picture in its totality whitehead speaks about the the intensification of polarities not about

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.320
everything getting better but about the intensification of the polarities and dynamics of

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:35.280
values all co-evolving in tension right erotic kind of like basically self-disclosure

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:46.000
so erotic self-disclosure okay um i i i'm very good in a flash yeah yeah the questions the questions

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.680
are very good um and we'll come to them very quickly moving swiftly along so um i'm conscious that

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.120
we may not get through all of them but we're going to try and get to the best ones at least

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.200
i'm also conscious that for many who are of a philosophical mindset um some of this discussion

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:09.440
will have been delicious and um exactly the kind of their staple diet if you like but for others

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.400
we're more practical mindset perhaps less philosophically um you know adept it can seem

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.240
a little abstract so i have a really good question here which is principally for zack actually although

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.800
i'm sure you will have thoughts on it and because i happen to know that zack has written a great

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.640
deal about propaganda and thought about it at length and written about it on the conciliants

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.560
project website and we're in a time of intense propaganda zack the question here is from kevin

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.760
cotwas if i've said that correctly and he just says can you talk about the weaponization of value

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:48.560
in propaganda and uh i'm sure he has thoughts too but if you could begin yeah i mean a few things

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.320
to say there one and i mentioned already that preference falsification being the foundation

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.680
of advertising just clarify what you mean by that because i didn't quite get at the first

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.080
falsification when you think you value something but you actually don't truly value it you've kind

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:12.960
of been tricked into valuing it sometimes through coercion sometimes through uh tricks of psychology

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:20.320
so so it's like preference falsification is the goal of psychology excuse me of advertising

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.240
advertising was one of the main places where psychology was operationalized after world war

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:32.480
two coming out of large-scale propaganda programs that were built during the cold war and so you're

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:38.800
looking at a science of persuasive communication and if everything we're saying is true about the

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.320
intrinsic nature of value and the way the human nervous system responds to value then if i'm trying

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.360
to get you to do something and i'm a psychologist and i know that then the first thing i do is

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:57.040
manipulate your value systems and your value preferences so without even speaking about

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:06.800
propaganda just staying on advertising we can see that the saturation of that kind of persuasive

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.720
to the point of being coercive style of communication uh is one of the things that

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:19.520
has undermined our ability to perceive actual value right so that's the idea that if you're

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.280
if you're succeeding as an advertiser you're not just getting them to value what

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.280
you want them to value like coca-cola right like why did we drink coca-cola right it's actually bad

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.600
for you but people really want to drink coca-cola the main reason you want to drink coca-cola is

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.080
because of advertising and they're incredibly they've been doing it for decades and they're very

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.320
good at it it's very subtle so the making you want something making you perceive value but it's not

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.160
actually value just to play devil's advocate for coca-cola here i feel like i'm on the bbc or

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.920
something trying to be impartial i mean all all know how that goes but i was going to say it's

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.760
not just caffeine and sugar don't i just want the caffeine and sugar and some some some sweeteners

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.760
yes but that's again part of the falsification of value what you want is to feel good

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.520
what you actually want is to feel good and the falsification of value goes right down into

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:18.000
your actual body and limbic system and so like when so when we sent our boys over there with

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.200
world war two they were not in a position to position to really know geopolitically what was

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.600
going on they were in a position to have been told what was going on right and they fought for

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:34.560
their country with love with full flux of value as a result of propaganda and again propaganda

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.840
is very complex to discuss because there's a thin line between propaganda and education

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:48.240
and it becomes the evil twin of education is propaganda both of them piggyback on value

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:55.040
section both of them deploy strategies of getting you to value something right that's what i was

01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.160
going to ask you zach that's why your question to ian earlier about how one begins to cultivate,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.000
refine, develop the capacity for value section is culturally critical almost a matter of

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.640
civilizational survival and it doesn't just apply sort of in the classroom but you it also applies

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:19.360
more in the front line of culture influencing our everyday activity and then because values

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:27.040
are values they are also explicitly thematized reflectively by propagandists so like the culture

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:36.160
wars are a result of both sides trying to create conflict around value and values so to get that

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.960
one of the things that makes it hard to talk about values is that they've been subject to

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.880
in the united states to a kind of internal informational civil war where just like in the

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.560
30 years war the different visions of heaven and hell and other things were used by propagandists

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.280
to get the Protestants and the Catholics to really fear and hate one another similarly

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.560
digital propaganda is working us into a frenzy mostly along these value fall lines which are

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.880
identified and then cleaved and like salt is thrown on the wound and they're they're trying

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:21.120
to make value conflict as polarized and difficult as possible so there's tons to say but because

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.840
I know you have yeah you have no lack of things to say on propaganda and for those who are interested

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.800
if you go to the conciliants project there is I believe three very considered early day essays

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.080
on propaganda that Zach's written there maybe Michael if you can put that in the chat if you

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.480
can find it but it is there um Ian any thoughts on propaganda before we come on to other things

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:50.160
I think I think Zach covered it perfectly and I agree with him over and I thought the point about

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.280
education and propaganda being evil twins and sometimes being confused with one another

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.760
particularly important at the moment right I agree um this is quite a more refined sort of

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.240
philosophical question but a pretty important one because I've fallen into this trap myself

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.200
it's by Andrew M Davies or Davis sorry much of this conversation has bounced between aesthetic

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:20.720
and moral value a lot of bouncing whitehead makes the claim that moral order is merely

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.720
certain aspects of aesthetic order here aesthetic order is wider and deeper than moral value

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.200
how do you understand the here's the question how do you understand the relationship between

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.360
aesthetic and moral order is one more ontologically primitive than the other so it's an eight

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.160
and a plus for the question there Andrew what's the answer is that can Ian do you want to go first

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:50.640
yes okay um it's a good question and it's one that I do um tackle a bit in in the in the uh

01:19:50.640 --> 01:20:00.640
at least in in this chapter I think um beauty is a difficult one because you know I'm I'm a great

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:07.440
admirer of Keats but he did die when he was 26 and he was a poet um he wasn't on oath as a

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.280
philosopher as it were when he said that beauty is truth truth beauty this is all you know and

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:20.880
all you need to know um if it were as simple as that we wouldn't have two quite distinct terms

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:28.160
and the questioner wouldn't have used them um nor would whitehead have thought that these words

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.960
were worth preserving because I can think of things that are beautiful and definitely not good and I

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:40.560
can think of things that are good that are definitely not beautiful unless you I mean it's

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.800
always open to somebody to so twist the meaning of a word that it will now encompass but in the way

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:53.760
we normally use them they're different um so it causes caused me more trouble than anything to be able

01:20:53.760 --> 01:21:01.040
to um deal with these and it's interesting that whereas moral values seem much more distinctly

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:10.240
carved up between the right and left hemispheres as David Hecht at UCL says um the um the right

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:18.160
hemisphere basically deals in in good and and the left in in what is morally bad I mean that that

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:25.600
that's that's his words um or a paraphrase of them and and um so it's much easier whereas with the

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:30.560
with the matter of beauty both hemispheres do get involved with it and do contribute to it

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:37.840
although to go into the niceties of it I would take us too too long and too far I don't agree

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:45.920
in short um with whitehead on this particular point um uh Andrew uh knows that I'm a great white

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:53.680
hedion um but on this one I just can't really agree with it because it seems to me that in a way

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:02.160
we value beauty because ultimately it is good but we don't value good ultimately because it's

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:11.040
beautiful I that's the way I see it maybe that's a product of my um modern western european education

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:16.960
and a degree of Protestantism in the background that I've overlaid heavily with other strands

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.880
but I don't know that's my take on it what do you say is that I mean I'm not sure either but I think

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:29.040
about just the big three the good the true and the beautiful having been differentiated for quite a

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.720
long time uh so there's something to the value of that differentiation that in modernity they became

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:42.320
disassociated and you know you had science running running hegemonic over the over the good and the

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:48.560
true um but I also think of Kant and the structure of the three critiques right and then at the end

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:55.440
Kant basically is saying that you know it reduces down to this very complex form of aesthetic judgment

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.800
which is which is more than just the judgment of beauty it's also the ability to perceive the

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.400
teleological to basically to perceive value per se would be my reading of the third critique

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:14.320
in which case there is something that is neither of those three that's more deep so if I think

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:20.480
about the sacred I think sometimes that's just an intensification of all three at once and that

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:27.520
there's something like a deeper field of allurement or arrows that is primary to the emergence of

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:33.760
even the differentiation of those three and there's a story that um Weber tells and Habermas

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.600
tells about the differentiation of those value spheres after their pre-modern synthesis that

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:47.360
there was a time when they were merged in the idea of the sacred uh that slowly they were differentiated

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:53.200
out uh Habermas talks about the linguistification of the sacred and the differentiation out of those

01:23:53.200 --> 01:24:00.880
three and then eventually the asymmetry that emerged with uh the unbounded rationality of

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.600
modernity so that's me not really answering the question but talking about what I know about the

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:13.840
person um like what if I could just quickly um come back for a couple of things um the first

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:21.280
is that your um invocation of Kant shows perfectly what I mean by what one can achieve by redefining

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:28.080
what one means by beauty and because if you call this aesthetic then you are enlarging the meaning

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.640
beyond what most people normally use it to mean in order you know like Humpty Dumpty you're allowed

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.840
to do that but then have you really achieved anything by applying this particular term to it

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:44.240
and and the other is just to say that I think your illumination that the sacred is all the

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.400
three of these combined it's just perfect because this is what I was saying about the light being

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:54.480
differentiated through colored glass um but when the the colors are separated one doesn't call red

01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:05.440
blue you know but nonetheless in the light they are together right and it occurs to me Zach um

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.200
and I know Ian you know Daniel Schmackenberger as well a little bit but Daniel has said in

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.280
a couple of his talks I've heard him say I don't know whether he still holds to this philosophically

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.920
but it's a very elegant line he says I wouldn't really care about goodness and truth if it wasn't

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.320
for beauty that was his way of putting it it was something about the charm and sort of um

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.200
intuitive elegance and attraction of beauty was sort of primary that it sort of drew you and you

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.880
know this is how I understand his claim and there was something about beauty that that was the prior

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:42.160
motivation to to look at goodness and truth I'm not saying it's right I'm not saying it's exactly

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.680
of how he means it but for what it's worth he said it and I find it quite quite an elegant

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.000
a proposition or provocation to to think about but Ian you've already answered adequately why

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.160
that might not be the whole story and likewise that yes and I want to get to some other questions

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:05.040
and I can see we still have let's see quite a few more Michael do you want to take a shot um and ask

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:14.320
it yourself yep yep I'm happy to Jonathan thanks for that um yeah so I guess my question stands

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:22.240
from the fact that I feel this view that is being put forth here that value is ontologically

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:29.360
fundamental if that was to take hold more broadly in society and culture I feel it could be very very

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:40.400
powerful like a very very powerful view to transform our way of relating to life um and I guess and

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.760
you know before I ask this question I'm aware that it might be my left hemisphere grasping

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.640
after certainty but I'm wondering and this is really for both of you Zach and Ian

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.520
how likely is it do you think that in time the the evidence for this will become more and more

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:05.200
compelling like do you see that the new scientific findings um will start to make a compelling case

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.160
for the fact that that we can actually quite convincingly say no value is ontologically

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:18.160
fundamental um Zach you mentioned about how we see maybe um in biology values that seem to be

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.680
existence existent out with any need for human beings to exist um so I'm kind of thinking in

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:37.680
those terms um yeah I'll leave out that and I have something to say first and then then use that

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:47.120
yeah sure go ahead um well as I always say prediction is is a fool's game but I don't

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:53.360
think that science will ever answer this question or shed a great deal of light on it it's a

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.960
philosophical question of a kind that science is not really equipped to answer I would say

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.600
and you know that's no disrespect to science but there are certain places

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:11.040
science won't take us profitably I think though that it may become more vivid to us when the

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:20.560
over sophisticated over technical over scientific way of conceiving ourselves has been blown away

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:31.360
by a collapse um some kind of cataclysm that will lead to suffering and here I

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:40.800
go back to something that I think uh Zach um was I think getting at when he talked about

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.520
or hinted at the idea that suffering might actually enable us to see certain things

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.480
that otherwise we wouldn't and I do think that in a paradoxical way but then you know that I

01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:02.640
profoundly believe in the coincidence of opposites that the um the way in which things will get better

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:12.240
is actually by getting worse that in doing that our our vision will become clearer our responses

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:19.040
will become more natural and we will see what matters and that that which matters to us and

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.600
which will enable us to survive will to be to be able to trust people and to achieve something

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:32.240
which really exemplifies goodness truth and beauty and I you might say but in circumstances of

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:39.040
dereliction would beauty matter and in the book I emphasize that the earliest human artifacts that

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:48.000
we know about are are beautiful and seem as um what was he called the chap who did 100 the

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.760
history of the world in 100 objects suddenly forgotten his name Neil um the the director

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.600
of the British Museum for heaven's sake what was he called I don't know anyway well anyway

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.480
you surely know about the history of the world in 100 objects anyway no yeah yeah yeah but not the

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:11.280
author no no okay I mean he's very well known but his name suddenly gone but anyway he he said

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.040
one of the things that he noticed was that when we first started making things the simplest you

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:22.640
know hand actors we required them to be beautiful as much as we required them to be of utility

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:32.080
right and I quote a a consultation on a school in Mexico where the parents in a very poor area

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.160
were going to be gifted with a school and they were asked what above all they would value in

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.760
that school and the first thing they said was that they wanted it to be beautiful

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.400
yeah I mean the return the return to value at the core of culture is inevitable if cultures

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:57.120
to survive that's one almost uh like a a symptom of the state of our civilization is the degree to

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:05.280
which we are removing value from the center of culture and what's interesting is that uh the

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:12.960
native disposition of the human is to respond to value still so we haven't been completely dehumanized

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:18.960
yet and there's evidence to show that like during natural disasters and when other things occur people

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:25.120
spontaneous spontaneously do heroic things they spontaneously collaborate that the number of

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.600
people who go completely sociopathic and actually much smaller than you'd think that our spontaneous

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.680
action under complete adrenal overload is basically to respond to immediate value and save that baby

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.560
and get this person water and just do what needs to be done so there's a fallback position of the

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:48.800
human nervous system that's involved to respond to basic value so I'm isn't green and paxton have

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:54.320
also demonstrated much to their surprise that the default position for us is to be honest

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.200
and that lying is actually stressful and difficult not that we are naturally deceitful

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.760
so I think these things are really important that you you've just said sorry and just just that we

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:12.400
have a few minutes left and I I've been brought to task and quite rightly for the genuine balance

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:18.800
in the questions and it was entirely because I hadn't seen askable questions um but I believe

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:25.120
there's one from clear I can't see you clear very easily on the screen but if you're there please

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.000
let it be known to us with a hand up and that will make it easier to find us

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.600
have find you I know what your question was roughly but it would be better if you can ask it in your

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:40.160
own voice it's early morning here and it's in Wellington New Zealand um and welcome

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:50.560
me thank you no it just sparked my attention was that um when you were saying I'm a PhD student

01:32:50.560 --> 01:33:00.240
and I'm I'm I'm dealing um with these topics and um I've very much focused on the idea that you

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:07.680
know of the paradigm shift to make consciousness fundamental to matter um and you know um matter

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:13.440
as secondary and consciousness as primary I'm looking at that issue um and then you said that

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:20.160
value is fundamental and I thought well how many things can be fundamental and if value and consciousness

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:26.320
are both fundamental um what's the relationship between the two of them and are the other um

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:33.520
qualities that are can be defined as fundamental good question and perhaps I could just have a

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:41.520
quick stab at that um uh I myself hold that consciousness is an ontological primitive and

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:49.680
that matter is an aspect of consciousness um but it seems to me that consciousness is intrinsically

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:55.840
relational that um consciousness is always consciousness towards or consciousness of

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:02.640
something else and therefore immediately comes into the question the nature of this

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:10.720
relationship and if it if there is a relationship um and maybe if one would say that it is intrinsic

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.320
and here I'm not multiplying entities but just saying these are other facets that one can talk

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.920
about about love love is intrinsically relational it is intrinsically beautiful it is intrinsically

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:31.040
good it's intrinsically true when it is a true love so that these things are I mean we get tied up

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:36.960
in in linguistic knots but it's not that there are a whole cupboard full of entities and we come back

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:43.040
to my point that there's a problem when we verify things whereas all we're really alluding to is

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:50.160
different qualities of this primal whatever it is that's would be my answer

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.880
Zach thank you Zach it's a very deep question um and as I alluded to before you know I would take

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:07.200
consciousness matter time space motion value as differentiations from an underlying field

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.560
which I would characterize probably as being a field of value if I had to pick one of them

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.680
which is interesting that again the basic root of the cosmos is like a desire like an

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:28.400
appetite like a wanting to be and so and then once you get after those the question is there's

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.400
some more fundamental set is one of the things that we're working on a limited set of first

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.920
principles and first values that would characterize cosmic evolution basically from the beginning

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.640
which we can either choose to self-consciously align with these first principles and values

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:49.280
of the cosmos or not and this is the view of cosmorodic humanism as we're articulating it recently

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.200
so I'm not clear how to I don't it's kind of above my philosophical pay grade to make the final

01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.080
decision about about those fundamental categories but I but I do think like if I

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.520
that the list that Ian gave where you add consciousness and value to matter time space

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:13.600
and motion that's a very important basic list and the addition of value is just

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.400
one of the most important philosophical moves that that can be made in our culture today because

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:23.440
people kind of buy consciousness they're kind of even physicists are willing to buy consciousness

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.320
but the idea that the universe matters and has a purpose and that the universe responds to value

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:36.320
is intrinsically valuable is a little bit like that so the addition is just so critical I believe

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:44.400
and puts the press on puts the press on the the hardcore left view reductionist view it puts them

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:52.960
into a corner okay thank thank you Zach is that a good enough response to the question yes I will

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.880
ponder that but the the only thing is I was thinking is that matter time space of all three

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.520
dimensional activities or qualities and I'm just you know I always thought things like

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:15.520
consciousness value beyond maybe three dimensions so that's again a deep question Ian I have the

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.160
same similar experience while shifting between these things in the second volume yes that there's

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.680
there are different kinds of things going on that are all fundamental yes you're asking

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:33.920
a very deep question and my attempt to answer it very briefly will not be satisfactory but

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.640
what I would what I would say at the moment is this that

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.640
I believe that matter is a phase of consciousness that could be considered secondary to consciousness

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.160
or could just be a way in which consciousness can manifest under certain circumstances

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.120
its reason for doing so is to provide two things that consciousness can't which is

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.640
a degree of permanence and a degree of resistance and the degree of resistance and permanence up

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.520
related to one another and why resistance is important to creation would take me a long time

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.760
but it's a thing I deal with in the book and once you've got matter and it cannot

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:25.440
we cannot talk about anything material at all or imagine it without the need for time and space

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:32.000
so when people tell me that by some mathematical jiggery-poetry they find equations in which time

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.680
disappears I would say well you've just cut the rug from under science and indeed philosophical

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.120
discourse because without the existence of time we can't say anything know anything and we can't

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:50.560
rely on anything that we empirically experiment with and so we get into knots because of the

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:57.680
limitations of our language but also of our consciousness we're limited beings let's enjoy it

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.240
and let's celebrate it and but what we have is glorious and it's up to us to you know respond

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:10.640
well to what we've been given thank you Ian it's a great thought to end on being limited beings

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:16.960
time is one of our limitations and we were trying perspective or trying to be disciplined

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.600
about our 100 minute events 100 minute 100 minute moments we're thinking of calling them we're

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.760
still working on it internally but really glad that you've all shared this one with us and

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.160
there will be further events coming up we will have one in two weeks like I say we're not

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.840
quite certain who the mystery guest is but it's one of two people we're currently clarifying

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.000
that in the next couple of days that will become clear and and this will carry on for several

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.400
weeks and we the event is free and Perspectiva is a charity but if you've enjoyed this event and you

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.120
want to support our work please go to our website and there is a donate button there if you feel

01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.240
like giving it additionally to allow us to carry on doing this kind of event carry on publishing

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:08.240
this kind of work and all that remains for me to say really is a very deep heartfelt thank you

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:16.960
to Ian McGillchrist and Zachary Stein thank you very much both of you thank you to David

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:22.240
and thank you for those who put questions in the chat if it could be saved and sent to me later

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:28.800
I'd like to see them because I'm very interested in new light on what I'm trying to illuminate myself

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.480
yes and yes thanks a lot for the questions and we'll hopefully see most of you again soon and

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:42.480
I think over and out thanks a lot take care and see you again soon
