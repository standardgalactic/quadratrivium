1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,120
And I'm conscious that you've all had already a very full day, and I'm also conscious that

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,480
many of you came expressly to hear Ian talk and meet him in person.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,680
And Ian has prepared a lecture, you know, something substantive directed at this event,

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,920
the theme of difference from his work.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,280
So I'm going to introduce him, introduce the context of his work a little bit for those

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,720
who don't know it, then step aside, let Ian take the stage, speak to him for 15 or so

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,160
minutes myself, and then pass on to you for Q&A.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
And I'm guessing we're going to have more questions and we'll have time to answer.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,520
So do think not only about what you want to ask, but how you want to ask it while Ian's

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
talking.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
It's a real honor to introduce Ian McGilchrist.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
I've now known Ian since 2011.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,280
There was a moment when I was working at the Royal Society of Arts in London, when the

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,240
chief executive there, Matthew Taylor, who normally chaired events, just couldn't do

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,000
the one with Ian.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
And two days before, I was given his fairly large, but not quite as large as the current

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,160
book, The Master and his Emissary.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
And I was very excited.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,320
I thought, well, very interesting bold thesis here.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Started reading it.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,200
The evening of the event, Matthew actually showed up backstage just before we were about

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,680
to go on stage.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
And I was like, oh, please tell me I can share this event.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
Please, like, last minute.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,480
But actually, it worked.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,440
I went on stage, spoke to Ian, and that was the beginning of a very important professional

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
relationship for me.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,600
And since then, I've done a great deal of work promoting Ian's ideas.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,520
I feature in a documentary about him, visited his house on Sky, and now, by many strange

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,240
twists of fate, became the publisher of his most recent book, The Matter with Things.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
Now, as some of you may know, and even if you don't know, you can just glance at it

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,120
here if you can see the, I might hold it up if I have the strength in my left arm.

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,520
But this is two very significant sized tomes, two volumes of The Matter with Things.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,720
And I believe Ian may have the precise details, but the words alone are roughly 600,000.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,200
And then that's just really kind of where it's getting started, because you also have

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,200
quite significant appendices, notes, bibliography, references, index.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,480
So by the end of it, it's something approaching a million words, I believe, for both volumes

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,600
together.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,920
But they're wonderful, wonderful, wonderful words, and many have read every one of them.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,320
And some have described it as, you know, really the book of our times, the book that everyone

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,080
must read, of course, there's many of them, but this is one of them, I think.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,520
And it's very, very deep, and it does deal with very fundamental matters about the nature

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,720
of life, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life towards the end of the second book,

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
especially.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,720
And so I just wanted to share one more thing, which is that when I was describing my experience

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,840
of reading this book, I posted a photograph of a large pencil that comes from the United

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,960
Nations, so one of these sort of souvenir pencils, and it was put along the spine of

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,600
the book diagonally, so it looked, you could sort of see the sort of significance of the

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,720
book somehow in the image, you know, it's the social media age, I was doing what I could.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,280
And then somebody said to me, ah, yes, this is actually a three-pencil book, and I said,

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
three-pencil book?

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,200
He goes, yeah, that's the sort of, you know, the might of times if you have to scribble

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
and take notes and underline and write in the marginalia, all the different things about

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
the book.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,440
This was Damien Walters, I think his name is, who's a science fiction writer.

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,640
I said only three pencils for the book to this size.

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,520
He goes, well, the complete works of Shakespeare are only two and a half.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,720
So you can see there, it's really a commitment to read the book, but one that's richly rewarded,

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,200
and I believe Ian's going to speak to some major themes from it.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,040
So I think for now that's all I can say, and look forward to talking to Ian later.

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Ian McGillchrist, everyone.

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:30,680
Thank you very much, and I hope you will tell me if I'm not audible, and I'm telling the

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,160
thing is to have it as close to your beard as possible without touching it.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm going to try and do that for however long I speak, and I'm also rather sorry that I

66
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,160
have to do a sort of Tom Jones impersonation.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm slightly beyond that, but this is the way the system works.

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm very pleased to be here.

69
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm delighted, and I think that this is the right audience, the ideal audience, to engage

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,160
with what I felt I was doing in writing this inexcusably long book.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,600
I myself have told that this book was terribly important, and I really got to read it, but

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,640
I had to say how long is it, and when I was told, well, the text goes to 1300 and something

73
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,640
pages, I had to say, well, forget it.

74
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,680
I hope though that you can be encouraged to dip into it.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,920
It covers a lot of ground, and I think it's quite permissible to dip into chapters and

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,920
see how that works, and then I'm rather hoping that in the end you'll see that it's a single

77
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,680
story if you like, and it's best if you can read it that way.

78
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,400
Why did I write it?

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:50,360
Like many people here, I feel that we reached a crisis point in which, frankly, we no longer

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,480
know who we are.

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,040
We haven't the foggiest idea of what we're doing here in this world.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,440
We don't seem to understand any kind of directional meaning in our lives, and if we find anywhere

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,000
told that we've just painted them on the walls of our little cell in order to cheer ourselves

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,720
up, I can't tell you how profoundly I disagree with that formulation, which seems to be a

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,960
pervasive one these days, that of reductive materialism.

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
And A.N.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,840
Whitehead, who's a philosopher I very greatly admire, said, as we think we live, and I think

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,000
there's something wrong with our thinking processes, and that's what I was hoping to

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,040
have a little influence over.

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,280
You may know that I wrote an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary, and that

91
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,800
concerns the division of the brain into two hemispheres, and this book, the newer book,

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,080
also begins from that standpoint.

93
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,440
This is not reductive in any sense, and it has been put to me by one person, only one

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,240
person, but he does persistently say it.

95
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,160
He's a philosopher who will remain nameless, I want to spare him his blushes, but he seems

96
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,680
to think that just because I talk about the structure of the brain, I must be reducing

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
mind to brain.

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,440
However, I've now over pretty much 2,000 pages between those two books, made it very

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,880
clear that my whole thrust is anti-reductionist.

100
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,220
Why would one be interested in the structure of the brain?

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,000
You might well say, I'm really interested in the mind, but I don't really care where

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,120
things go on in my brain, it's not relevant.

103
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,120
And I'm sympathetic with that, but I also think there's something very, very important

104
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,720
about the way the brain is structured, and whether the brain gives rise to consciousness

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,400
which I can't believe, or it transmits consciousness which it might, or it permits consciousness

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,840
which is what I do believe, it will shape the nature of that consciousness.

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,280
And it's therefore quite relevant that this organ is divided in two right down the middle.

108
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,360
If you've never seen a brain, it's rather like a walnut, and it has that division down

109
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
the middle.

110
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:26,760
If you have an organ which is said to be a computer, I mean that's an image that I very

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,040
much detest, and it's entirely wrong on a whole range of grounds, but if you do think

112
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,320
of it as having computing power, why would you make an enormous division down the middle

113
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,840
of it, since its computing power exists in the number of connections it can make?

114
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,520
Why is the brain asymmetrical?

115
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,400
The world around us isn't asymmetrical exactly, and the skull is pretty much symmetrical.

116
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,240
So what's this about?

117
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,400
Why is the right hemisphere broader at the front and larger altogether, in fact the biggest

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,000
asymmetry in the entire brain, is the largeness of the right frontal cortex?

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
And why something that one did learn about in medical school and never heard about the

120
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
right hemisphere?

121
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,000
It's broader towards the back on the left, and this was always said to be because of

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,960
the invention of language, which is a very important part of the history of humanity.

123
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:31,680
But that can't be right, because we know that plenty of the great primates, Bonobos, Gorillas,

124
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,800
chimpanzees have these expansions, but they don't have language.

125
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
And I suppose the final thing is these two hemispheres are connected by a band of fibres

126
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,400
at the base of the brain, over which 2% of the neurons in the brain actually cross.

127
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,560
So it's set up for two rather distinct conscious nexuses.

128
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,680
Why is that?

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Is it just us?

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
No, it isn't.

131
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:08,200
The difference between us, or at least mammals, and other living creatures, is that they don't

132
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
even have a corpus callosum.

133
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,480
So the corpus callosum was a mammalian invention, and it's gradually getting smaller in relation

134
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
to the size of the brain.

135
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,240
So our brains have expanded, but the corpus callosum remains small, and a lot of its traffic

136
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,440
is saying, I'm dealing with this, you keep out of it.

137
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,480
And that's true as you go down, as we like to think of it, down the evolutionary tree.

138
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,440
So it's true of amphibians, it's true of reptiles, it's true of insects, it's true

139
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,600
of every creature that we know of, including the most ancient creature, still extant.

140
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,320
It's 700 million years old, nematostelovectensis, and it lives off the Isle of Wight, where

141
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,800
it only marginally raises the average age of the inhabitants.

142
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,080
And it already has this asymmetry in its neural network, described by Thomas Holstein, who

143
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,760
discovered it at some Heidelberg, as the origin of the mammalian, and eventually the human

144
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
brain.

145
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
Well, I think there is an answer to that, and it's quite a simple one, and I've never

146
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,360
heard any explanation that goes near doing as good a job, and nobody's told me I'm wrong.

147
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,840
And it's this, every living creature has to be able to do two incompatible things at once.

148
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,320
They have to enable themselves to survive by eating, and they have to enable themselves

149
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
to survive by not being eaten.

150
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,080
And for the first, you need to have highly targeted, precise attention to a detail, for

151
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,440
a bird to pick up that seed accurately and swiftly, for an eagle to be able to catch

152
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
that hair.

153
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,520
Whatever it is, you lock onto your target, you know what it is, you go for it.

154
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,560
And that attention is very, very precise, but it's only about three out of the 360 degrees

155
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,640
of the per view that we might have.

156
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,840
Meanwhile, the right hemisphere, sorry, I haven't mentioned yet that the left hemisphere

157
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,840
is the one that does the targeting, the right hemisphere is tasked with doing the whole

158
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,280
of the rest, basically, of seeing the whole picture, looking out for predators, looking

159
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,720
out for corn specifics, looking out for offspring that need feeding and protecting.

160
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,360
And so, this can't be done, actually, it's not just like trying to pat your tummy and

161
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,240
rub your head or whatever it is you're supposed to do, pat your head and rub your tummy as

162
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
well.

163
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,200
It's actually impossible unless you have two ways in which you can dispose your consciousness

164
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,480
at once, and that requires two neuronal masses capable of being conscious at all.

165
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,880
So that explains this division, and it's based, as I say, on attention.

166
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,640
And when I realized this, the penny didn't drop immediately, because I had been chained

167
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:06,320
in a rigorously analytic, cognitive way, and I saw attention as another interesting cognitive

168
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:15,800
function like memory and language and so on, but no, attention is something very, very special.

169
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,320
It's how we bring the world into being.

170
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,560
Let me just explain a little about that, because it's central to what I'm going to say.

171
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,440
I repudiate either of the two main alternatives that are put up these days in the public arena

172
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
as possible ways of understanding the world.

173
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,440
I think most of us detect that it's not quite true that there's just a world out there.

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,240
First of all, it might not be out there, and secondly, it's not just out there in that

175
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:56,800
we are connected to it somehow, and how we experience it changes at least the weak claim

176
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,240
as it changes for us what it is we experience.

177
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
That's obvious.

178
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,440
I believe it actually helps to mould what is there in a less personal way, in a more

179
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,920
universal way, eventually, but it also makes us who we are.

180
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
If I get in the habit of attending to things that are living as machines, I will see only

181
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,440
their mechanical aspects, and I will see that this works very well, and so it worked last

182
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,920
time, it'll work next time, and soon I can't see any alternative to seeing living things

183
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,080
as mechanism.

184
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:41,360
I call attention a moral act, by which I mean that we have a responsibility, and that word

185
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,560
responsibility is important because it suggests the coming and the going, the giving of something

186
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,200
and something responding, a reverberative relationship.

187
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,680
I actually also claim in this book, and argue for the position, that relationships are primary,

188
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,200
relationships are prior to the things that are related, the so-called relux.

189
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
How can that be, you might say?

190
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,320
How can you have a relation before you've got the things that need to be related?

191
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,960
Well I take the view that actually everything is related, and that it gets its being from

192
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,600
the context of all the other things to which it's primarily very directly related, but

193
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,680
ultimately to the rest, and that therefore you can't tell what that thing is until you've

194
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,000
understood the network of webs of relationships out of which it arises.

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,720
In any case, attention is important in this way, and I have this view that it's neither

196
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,360
what I call rot reality out there, and we are just passive receivers of it, nor is it

197
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,640
mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves.

198
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Sorry, those were acronyms in case you're...

199
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,240
It's something very important, an encounter.

200
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,280
So every experience is an encounter, and it's not made up of things, it's made up of encounters

201
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,960
with what are effectively processes, relationships.

202
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:24,320
For this reason, the way in which we attend to the world matters enormously, and the

203
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,040
title of my latest offering, this enormous book, is the Matter with Things, which is...

204
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,720
We read on several levels, I mean on the first level obviously, I think we probably all agree

205
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,160
there's something that is the matter with things, and I think that what's the matter

206
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,400
is our obsession with matter, partly, and at least if you assume matter is the simple

207
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,320
stuff that has nothing to do with consciousness, if you think it has a bit of consciousness

208
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,520
about it, then you've already smuggled consciousness in, and we don't have to explain how it somehow

209
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,320
mysteriously arises out of matter.

210
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,080
But if you think of matter as simple, well you're on to hiding to nothing, because if

211
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,840
matter has nothing of consciousness about it, and has no direction, and no knowledge of

212
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,480
any of the things that make life worth living for us, how is it that after a few million

213
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,000
years this completely blind collision of senseless particles gives rise to Bach's St.

214
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Matthew Passion?

215
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,720
This is a miracle, if ever there was one, and reductionists always end up having to do

216
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,480
it, and here a miracle happens.

217
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,080
I don't do that, because I believe, and I may come onto that later, I believe that consciousness

218
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,240
is foundational, I think it is what the philosopher's called an ontological primitive, which means

219
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:51,680
it can't be derived from anything else, it is the primary stuff of the cosmos.

220
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:59,760
But if attention changes what we experience, how we relate to it, how we act, how we think,

221
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
it's pretty important, and if the two halves of the brain have manifested different ways

222
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,120
of attending, and there's not a single neurologist, psychiatrist, physician, neuroscientist anywhere

223
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,760
in the world who will deny that these two hemispheres have this greatly different way

224
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,000
of attending, if that's the case, then it follows that they produce two different kinds

225
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,360
of experiential worlds, they'd have to, and I haven't got time to go through all the things

226
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:33,840
that differentiate them, but let me just give a sort of lightning sketch of how they differ.

227
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,200
So you can see that if you are paying attention to something that you already know is important

228
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,600
for you, and latching onto it, and then later latching onto something else, and then seeing

229
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:54,960
one of those two, it produces a picture of isolated fragments that are already known,

230
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,840
familiar, useful, they're decontextualised, they're abstracted because they're an example

231
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,200
of a kind, it's another seed, another rabbit, whatever, the differences between Peter Rabbit

232
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,720
and his brethren are not available to the left hemisphere, and this picture in the left hemisphere

233
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,760
is one which is effectively inanimate, literal, it takes language literally,

234
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:30,320
because it's not very good at reading subtle signs, so body language, facial expression,

235
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,120
tone of voice, you don't even need to get into the complexities of metaphor,

236
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,200
but already the right hemisphere is much more skilled at this than the left,

237
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,160
but the left hemisphere simply takes poetry, metaphors, literally,

238
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,040
and then pronounces, as some philosophers have, that they're lies.

239
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,880
However the ancient Greeks thought that metaphors were the key to understanding, Aristotle says

240
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,680
that this is the key to every kind of thinker, the strength of that thinker or of that artist,

241
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,600
is to be able to produce new metaphors that illuminate, and indeed I think it's very well

242
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,280
accepted now that all language is metaphorical, in particular scientific language and philosophical

243
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,920
language are metaphorical because they're often dealing with abstractions, and we don't have

244
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,240
the words for those, we have the words for the things we encounter in daily life.

245
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,640
So you've got on the one hand this picture of isolated fragments that have no meaning,

246
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,120
purposeful direction until we put them together, that are inanimate, decontextualised, abstracted,

247
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,120
and they co-together to form a picture of a lifeless diagram, a theory, a map of the world.

248
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,240
Now there's nothing wrong with a map, and there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere, we need it,

249
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:01,440
but it won't give us the full story, just as consulting a map of this area before you've

250
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,040
came wouldn't tell you what you see outside the window, what you would experience in this house,

251
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,600
that's all left as it were in the realm of the right hemisphere. So what does the right hemisphere

252
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,720
see? It sees that nothing is ever certain fixed and fully known, that there is always a degree of

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,600
possibility that it may be something slightly different, and indeed since it sees unique cases

254
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,880
rather than just general categories, it's aware that actually every blade of grass is different.

255
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:45,000
So it sees a picture of these undrasped before, but processually knowable, not known already

256
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,200
completely, but something we can come into a knowing of, it sees them as interconnected with

257
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,200
other things, constantly flowing, not fixed down so that we can easily grasp, and as I say

258
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,760
individual, implicit, and embodied. Now all that implicit and embodied stuff is terribly

259
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,840
important, and it's all the kind of things that a computer won't be able to understand until it's

260
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,840
got a body, and until blood is flowing through its cheeks, and it knows that it's going to die,

261
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,400
and it's suffered, and so on. So the left hemisphere is, I hate the idea that the brain is like a

262
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,640
computer as I've already said, but there is something about the left hemisphere that is

263
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,560
rather like one's personal computer, in that its level of understanding is very low, very poor,

264
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,560
but it's very efficient at carrying out procedures. There's a division of labor really. The right

265
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,480
hemisphere is rather like you when you've gathered data, and you want the computer to process it,

266
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,760
to shove it into the computer, the computer wears away cleverly for a short while, and produces an

267
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,680
answer. The computer doesn't know what the answer means, but you take that back into the real-life

268
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,840
world and reinterpret it. So it's this dynamism in which you begin from the right hemisphere,

269
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,720
move to the left, and move to the right, and I'm indebted to Jonathan for having christened this

270
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,880
and McGill christened maneuver. I don't believe it's a maneuver, but anyways, whatever, and it's

271
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,680
best imaged by the idea of learning a piece of music. You're first attracted to it as a whole by

272
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,080
the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere sees the whole picture, the left hemisphere sees parts,

273
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,040
and analyzes. So then you start to play it, and you realise that you've got to take it apart,

274
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,240
you've got to really keep practising that passage of bar 18, and then you sort of understand the

275
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,840
theory of this structure of the piece. So you see how it's here that we return to the tonic,

276
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,320
and that's all very well. It's important, it's good. But when you go out to play the piece,

277
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,080
finally, you must forget all of that. You'll give the most terrible performance. And there's very

278
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
much in life that is like this. But at the moment, I believe we live in a world in which we take the

279
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,440
lived experience. We then turn it into a map, a theory, a diagram, take it apart, leave it bits

280
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,200
all over the floor, and then go, well, it doesn't seem to mean anything to me. And this is surely a

281
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,160
very bad way to be understanding the vibrant, living, complex, rich, beautiful world around us.

282
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:22,440
So that's the sort of neurology part of it, if you'd like. And I begin the book. It has three

283
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:32,600
parts. In part one, I talk about the neuropsychology. And I begin with looking at the ways in which we

284
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,040
could gather some knowledge about the world to gather it, not to process it, but just to begin

285
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,920
the process of having anything there. And I take these to be attention, but also perception, which

286
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,960
is not the same as attention, judgment, which is formed on the basis of what you've attended to

287
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,360
and what you've perceived, emotional and social intelligence, and cognitive intelligence, IQ,

288
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:04,680
in other words, and creativity, because nothing ever comes to us just as a blank. It comes to us

289
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,120
as a something. And sometimes we need to be able to revision what that is before it sets. And we

290
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,240
can do this very, very rapidly, so that we don't even know what we're doing. But all those faculties,

291
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:25,240
all those portals to the world, as I call them, are more reliably exercised by the right hemisphere

292
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,360
than by the left. All of them, including cognitive intelligence, IQ, it's very, very clear. And

293
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,480
that might surprise a lot of people. And you may well say, well, that's ridiculous. That can't be it.

294
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,360
I mean, how on earth would we get by with a brain that only half of which is really reliable? Well,

295
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:52,440
the answer is that the very important business of getting stuff accumulating power is the job of

296
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,400
the left hemisphere. And that it does exceptionally well. So that when you have a stroke in the left

297
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:04,200
hemisphere, the right hand with which you manipulate the world and use tools and operate machines is

298
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:15,080
dysfunctional or nonfunctional, you may lose the power to use language. And one way of looking at

299
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,320
language is we didn't need it when we lived in small communities where we understood one another

300
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,280
directly and lived together. But we needed it as communities became larger and larger. And instead

301
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:31,320
of having I, thou communication, we had to have I, it communication, and I, they communication.

302
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,840
And that is also damaged. But get this, it's much easier to rehabilitate somebody after a left

303
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,320
hemisphere stroke, despite all that, than it is after a right hemisphere stroke, because somebody

304
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,360
who has a right hemisphere stroke may well not understand the world at all. It's not that they

305
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:55,400
can't manipulate it. They just can't understand it. And people complain that their partner,

306
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,960
they have a father who suffered such an injury or stroke is no longer empathic in the way that

307
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,000
they used to be, doesn't seem to understand a joke, doesn't seem to understand what's going on around

308
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,080
him, doesn't understand the conversation. So that's kind of important. In the second part of the book,

309
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,760
I deal with epistemology, which is how do we get from our findings, our data, our information,

310
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:32,360
our percepts, our judgments? How do we get from there to broader conclusions about the world?

311
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,880
And how do we build up a picture of the world? And I suggest that there are four of these,

312
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:46,760
science, reason, intuition, and imagination. And in the world in which we live, none of these

313
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,200
is quite perceived right. So excessive claims are made for science. And at the same time,

314
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,840
science is not scientific enough. If science were properly scientific, it wouldn't be as

315
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,200
dogmatic as it is. It wouldn't dismiss things that don't fit the current paradigm, because the whole

316
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,240
history of science is of people finding things that don't fit the current paradigm and then revising.

317
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,720
And again, we don't respect science enough. So there are now movements that disrespect science

318
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,280
or disregard science or refuse to publish science if it doesn't happen to fit with your political

319
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:28,040
view. This sounds remarkably like 1930s Germany. Then there is reason. And reason is very important.

320
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,560
And again, I think the world has lost its reason. It's lost its reason of boldness.

321
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,320
How rarely do we hear that concept, which seems to be central of the reason of bold,

322
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,720
not just the rationalistic. And I'm making a distinction there, which is made in other

323
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,480
languages between different types of reason. In German, there's a difference between

324
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,320
Vernunft and Verstand. And there's a kind of procedure or logic, which is not

325
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,560
unnecessary. It's very important that you ought to be able to synthesize that with the products of

326
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,560
a life well lived for kind of experiential wisdom. And that is reason. And then there's intuition,

327
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,640
which has had a very bad press lately, because there are lots of psychologists who go around

328
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,320
to companies making a lot of money, telling them they must never trust their intuitions,

329
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:22,680
because they're all wrong. And psychologists rather like the feeling of having power over

330
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,920
other people and seeing things they don't see. And so there's a kind of a chauvinism about

331
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:36,760
their wish to dispense with intuition. When I say the examples they come up with,

332
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,440
which is quite true, our intuition would probably guide us to the wrong answer. There

333
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,400
are such things that can be set up, and our delivery is set up by psychologists. They draw on

334
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,880
principles that would normally lead us to the right conclusion, but on this occasion just don't

335
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,880
happen to it. And I can show you optical illusions, which are so extraordinary, that you can't believe

336
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,760
it until it's demonstrated. And yet, I don't know many people who say, well, after seeing that,

337
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm never going to open my eyes again, because they might mislead me. We need these fantasies.

338
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,240
And imagination, I just want to make an important distinction between imagination and fantasy.

339
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,280
Fantasy is something that takes us away from where we are. And it sometimes

340
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,480
thought that imagination is like this as well. But imagination is not. Imagination

341
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:34,680
is the only way in which we can truly enter into and understand the life, the existence

342
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:42,440
of whatever it is we're contemplating. So it's a completely different thing, imagination.

343
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Words from the Coleridge wrote about this very interestingly. I haven't got time to talk about

344
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,360
that now, but they did. And they contrasted the sort of dressing up of something in a fancy way

345
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:00,520
in order to make it look different and funny or moving or sentimental. They contrasted that with

346
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:10,200
the sort of deep gaze of attention in which the thing at last is permitted to come to be itself

347
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,920
in your presence. In a word of Heidegger's translation of what Heidegger used in German

348
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:25,320
unreason, it presences. And that's slightly different from being present. Being present is

349
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,720
very passive. But the idea of presencing is the thing comes into being through the encounter.

350
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,840
Now, in the world we're in at the moment, I just think there's an awful lot already that one could

351
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,160
say that we're missing here. But what I do, and I just finished the counter through the book,

352
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,320
not three years. So we've looked at which hemisphere is more trustworthy. And the answer is

353
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,280
in almost every case, the left hemisphere will mislead us, is literally delusional. I'm not

354
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,720
using that word in a pop sense. I'm using that in a psychiatric sense. It gives rise to Frank

355
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,760
delusions left with self. It's not reliable. So we know that. We know we should be paying

356
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,640
attention to what the right hemisphere tells us, even if it's harder to grasp. And we now know that

357
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,240
we need to bring at least three out of these four science, reason, intuition and imagination,

358
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,320
if not all four to bear on all our problems. But I find that generally we divide into camps

359
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,400
who use either the first two or the last two or nothing at all. That's three camps. And then we

360
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,680
come on to the last part of the book. And in that I sort of say, well, how do we understand the

361
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,280
cosmos and ourselves? How do we understand our position here? What do we think the cosmos is like?

362
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,960
And I begin with a couple of chapters about its structure. The first one is on the coincidence

363
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:58,200
of opposites, which is a very, very important point, which has gone out of our culture and with

364
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:06,040
it has gone some massively important insights, wise insights. We think that things are arranged

365
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,520
in linear fashion. So on one end of a line, there's something you like. On the other end,

366
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,680
there's something you hate. And it's just where you graduate yourself on this position. But this

367
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,680
is not true. If you pursue something that you think is good more and more, you will definitely

368
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,760
end up with the thing that you were fleeing from. Thus it's famous that anarchy leads to tyranny.

369
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:34,680
And we don't understand this. It was obviously as a child that people on the extreme left of

370
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:42,120
politics were awfully like people on the extreme right of politics. But the answer in calibrating

371
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:50,040
these things is not just to find a midpoint where things go flabby as it were. The secret of making

372
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:56,120
a good apple tart is have sour apples and lots of good honey. And this produces a wonderful apple

373
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,880
tart, but just bland apples won't produce any of this. And the image I like to give here is one

374
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:09,880
that is made by my favorite philosopher of all time, Heraclitus, 6th century BC, far more interesting

375
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:17,880
than Plato. They're called pre-Socratic philosophers. I think the so-called Plasonic philosophers

376
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,800
should be called post-Heraclitian philosophers, but anyway. In this realm there were a lot of very

377
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,480
interesting voices and then we got thrown off track for about 2,000 years. We began to recover it in

378
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:39,240
the 19th century. I'm being brief and flippant. I'm a great admirer of Plato. I studied him in

379
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,920
Greek at school. I don't know all of that. But nonetheless, I think that there's a lot about

380
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:53,720
the way in which Plato has been interpreted, his legacy and Aristotle's legacy, that we have had to

381
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:03,320
try and finesse and make more complex and pass on from. The image from Heraclitus is that of the

382
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,800
string of a light, the musical instrument, or the string of a bow. And the point he makes is it

383
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,520
must be pulled apart in both directions very hard. And you might say, well, that's a waste of energy.

384
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,280
Why don't we just let it go slack? And then, of course, the string will not let fly the note.

385
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,840
It will not let fly the arrow. So the tension between these opposites held together, but not

386
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:35,960
collapsed into one or the other. But both genuinely held is very important. And some people get around

387
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,000
this by collapsing the two. It's just saying they're all one. They're not all one. They're

388
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,840
importantly rather different. Or they say they're so different from one another that you can't say

389
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,640
that they coincide. I would suggest that both of these positions is wrong. And then I talk about

390
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,960
the one and the many. I won't go into that, but that's another whole famous philosophical problem

391
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,280
that I think is very interesting about the relation between the general and the unique.

392
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,080
And the particular and the eternal. And the insight I just want to pass on briefly is one that I

393
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,000
think is best expressed in the work of Goethe, which is that you find the particular, sorry,

394
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,880
you find the general and the universal, not by turning your back on the particular, but by

395
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,520
going through the particular more deeply. And you find eternity, not by turning your back on the

396
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,840
temporal, but by going through the temporal and seeing eternity there in the temporal.

397
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,760
That of course is itself a paradox, but I'm no foe of paradox. In part two, I have a whole

398
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,800
chapter on logical paradox, which I think explains, I take about 30, one's known to philosophers,

399
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,560
and suggest that the reason that these paradoxes arise is that there is a conflict here between

400
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,200
the way the left hemisphere sees it and the way the right hemisphere sees it. And guess what?

401
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,880
The way the right hemisphere sees it is more in touch with reality.

402
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,800
Thank you. I'll give you an example of Achilles and the tortoise. Achilles was famously swift

403
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,680
to foot. The tortoise challenged him to a race. Achilles said, no, I don't think so. Come on,

404
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,280
you can never catch me. Achilles thinks, well, okay. And being a generous kind of guy gives the

405
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,520
tortoise a head start. The tortoise, however, is right. Because first of all, Achilles has

406
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,200
got to get where the tortoise now is. But by the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved on to

407
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,600
a new place. Now his job is to get to where the tortoise has gone to. But by the time he gets

408
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,560
there, the tortoise has moved on. And this is an infinite series, so he can never actually

409
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,680
overtake the tortoise. However, we know that he'll overtake the tortoise in two strides.

410
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,120
And the problem there, which I can't unpack now because I've got to get to the end of my talk

411
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:55,160
quite quickly, is that effectively the mistake is thinking of a continuum

412
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:03,960
retrospectively as fragmented and analyzed. And then in the rest of the chapters of part three,

413
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:15,960
I deal with the trivia, time, space, matter, consciousness, value, purpose,

414
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:23,240
and the sense of the sacred. And most people are with me when we get time yet, very interesting,

415
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:30,120
yes, space, matter and consciousness are very important. What a hell, why do you put values,

416
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,920
purpose and the sense of the sacred in there? And I believe these are things that are absolutely

417
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,800
essential to our understanding of the universe of the cosmos and of life. And they've been dismissed

418
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,920
from discourse by science not out of malice, but out of a very good principle.

419
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,880
It decided that the way it wanted to investigate things was what it calls objective,

420
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,200
and in that it didn't want to introduce values, it didn't want to introduce any kind of purpose,

421
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,600
it just wanted to see what was there. And then it reports back solemnly after its investigation,

422
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:12,120
it couldn't find any values, couldn't find any purpose. But to borrow an image from C.S.

423
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,840
Lewis, this is like a policeman who stops all the traffic in the street and then solemnly notes

424
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:24,520
in his notebook, the silence in this street is very suspicious. Science has not proved that

425
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,640
light is meaningless, that there is no purpose, that there are no values, it's not its job to do

426
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,160
that, and we need to see that and it needs to see that. But I believe that all consciousness,

427
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,720
and let me say it briefly, I think the consciousness matter relate like this. I believe

428
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,720
that consciousness is the primary substance of the universe, if you like. Although substance is

429
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,840
exactly the wrong word because nothing needs to be under it, it is the stuff, if you like,

430
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,720
of the cosmos. But again, it's not stuff, our language, stuff says when we try to talk about

431
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:02,600
this matter. So consciousness is that elementary stuff, and consciousness is always directed

432
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,760
towards something else. We are seeing something, we are taking it, being aware of something,

433
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:16,040
we're examining something, we're just contemplating something, but that is directional and it's guided

434
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:25,080
by value, and it's guided by purpose, and these things are throughout in the living world, and

435
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:31,480
I would say having read Jude Caravan's latest book, which is very interesting, that in the

436
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:38,200
cheese, a lot of the book is about the preanimate world, that there is evidence of clear purpose

437
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:45,320
and value in terms of beauty already present in this cosmos. I think what life does is not just

438
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,080
bring consciousness, because as I say consciousness I think is everywhere, but it brings two things.

439
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:58,760
It speeds up the process of responsiveness and intensifies it and broadens it. So

440
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,800
unlike the Roth in my garden, I can appreciate more of what there is in the cosmos, that's

441
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:15,160
life given to me, and what that life means is something that I can come to understand very

442
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,760
much faster than any of the processes that would have existed pre-life. There are animate processes

443
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,720
that can happen a thousandth of a second, that if they were in an inanimate context would take

444
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:33,000
billions of years. So what is matter? Well I think matter is a phase of consciousness. I think that

445
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,720
consciousness exhibits matter to us, that's indisputable, we wouldn't know matter if we

446
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,560
didn't have consciousness. However it's not true that we wouldn't know consciousness if we weren't

447
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,960
material, we don't know that. A lot of scientists assume the brain somehow nobody has ever got

448
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,360
even with a whisker of explaining how it could possibly happen, but if matter were to give rise

449
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:07,800
to consciousness it's a matter of dispute, and I for one reject it, but we can't deny that matter

450
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,800
is something that's in our experience, and I say why is matter there? I think it does

451
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,400
one main thing that can be seen in two ways, it allows things to persist for a while,

452
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,520
always only for a while, and it also offers some resistance, and I believe that creation,

453
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:35,640
creativity depends on resistance, in the face of resistance it can't happen, and resistance is

454
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,720
paradoxical like everything else. What is friction? Friction is what stops motion,

455
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,360
that's what a physicist will tell you, but it's also what starts motion. I'm not able to move

456
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:53,720
at all without friction, so things have dual roles and this resistance is highly creative,

457
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,280
as has been seen by many of my favorite philosophers including Whitehead and others.

458
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,840
So where am I going with this? I could talk to you about the sense of the sacred, I included a

459
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:13,080
chapter on that, and many of my philosophical friends who'd read the draft said don't include it,

460
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,920
you've got some really important philosophical things to say here, but nobody will take you

461
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,920
seriously if you talk about the sacred, and they'll go oh he's a faith head, and so I almost,

462
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,720
for a nanosecond, wavered, but I realized that I couldn't not write it, even though it was the most

463
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:39,000
difficult thing I've ever written in my life. It cost me more blood, sweat, and tears than anything

464
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,440
else I've done, because I wanted to be honorable to what was there, I wanted to be truthful to it,

465
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:58,200
I wanted to be faithful to it, and neither oversell something or understated, and of course I believe

466
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,360
that all that realm of the sacred and divine is not, is not expressible in ordinary language,

467
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,440
and is not grasped by our common concepts, it is itself beyond such things, but that doesn't mean

468
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,680
it's unreal, I mean it's just an elementary logical mistake to say well we can't talk about it,

469
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,800
we can't conceive it, then it can't exist, but it can, and we can't measure it in the lab,

470
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,640
I know that, but we can't measure love in the lab, I can't demonstrate love to somebody who's never

471
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,120
experienced it, and the sacred is like that, you can't get it from, it's like trying to learn

472
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,880
how to swim by sitting on the bank of the river reading a book, you actually have to get into

473
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,880
the stream, but if you do you will find that something responds to you, I swear that it will,

474
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,720
it may not be what you expect, but there will be this responsive encounter, and it's that that we

475
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,640
are made for, and I believe that it's that, the business of seeing, experiencing, reflecting,

476
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:06,200
doing our best to magnify in the world what is beautiful, good, and true, that is the reason

477
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,800
we're here at all, so we have an important, if you like, role, and we started rather late, so I'm

478
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,640
just gonna, I'll wind up in five minutes, and you've probably heard of Pascal's wager, yeah,

479
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,440
and Pascal's wager for those of you who don't know it was, the maybe a god or the may not,

480
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:34,520
if there is a god and you decide to deny him, you made a big mistake, but if there isn't a god

481
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,960
and you think there is, well no harm will come of it, it's always seemed to me not really to cover

482
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,920
the basis and to be a little bit venal in its, in its motivation, but there's something called

483
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,000
the Galperist wager which goes like this, either there is a god, in which case, yep, we'd better

484
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,640
get to know that god, or there isn't a god, in which case no harm is done, ala Pascal, but

485
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,640
there is this possibility that whatever the divine and the sacred is, it is exploring itself,

486
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:15,160
it is coming to know itself in its creation, one might ask why did this logos, this

487
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:25,400
ble, this ultra, this ala, this god, why did it bother with the creation, and the answer in most

488
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,440
religions is that god is love, and love is relational, coming back to my idea that everything,

489
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:37,160
everything is actually relational, and relations are two way relations, so you have to have a

490
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:45,880
cosmos in which something can come that can appreciate that divine ground, and it's exploring

491
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:54,840
that, unfolding the beauty of it, that is the purpose of the creation, and here at the very last

492
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,200
minute I come to the question of division and union, which I would love to give a whole hour's

493
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,840
tour of them, because it's very, very important, but let me be very brief. Goethe, again another

494
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:15,320
person I very greatly admire, said, dividing the united, uniting the divided, this is the business

495
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:21,960
of nature, and it is like he says, the sisterly and diastole, which are the two beats of the heart,

496
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:29,560
it is like the inhalation and the exhalation, and he also suggests, or hints that it's like the

497
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:37,480
warp and weft of a fabric, into which our being is woven, he said. Now I think that is extraordinarily

498
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,240
important, and perhaps I'd just leave it there and we can explore it a bit, but in my view,

499
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,760
everything depends on seeing this importance of having division and union, but of having them

500
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:56,200
unified, not divided. This is an example of the meta position that I held on many things,

501
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,640
for example, I think it's great that we have both and, but we also sometimes need either all,

502
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:10,360
but we don't need either both and, or either or, we need both, both and, and, and I, of course my

503
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,520
whole works about symmetry and asymmetry, which I think goes much further than the brain, goes into

504
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,640
the substance of life, and I believe there that we need not just symmetry or asymmetry,

505
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,520
but we need the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry. That really is a lot of work,

506
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:38,280
and it's all there in the postage of one of fire.

507
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,880
I'll give you a chance to take a rest in for a second or two. Yep. Quite a tour de force,

508
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,600
and I'm keen because of time to really involve the audience quite quickly, so I'm going to just

509
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:06,360
have one question on the sacred, and it relates to an experience I had with you

510
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:12,840
on the out of sky. A little minor tragedy is that before the book came out, I traveled up to

511
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,880
the sky to film a day, a day long interview with Ian about every aspect of the book,

512
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,360
which was recorded, of course, but for a range of reasons that won't go into,

513
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,760
we could never retrieve the recording, but there was a moment towards the end of that,

514
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,120
that time that I particularly wished we'd, we'd got on camera, and it was a moment where Ian

515
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:38,040
started welling up with, with tears, and it was speaking about Christian mythology

516
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,760
and how beautiful you found it, and one question I have for you here is, it's,

517
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:52,280
to speak of the sacred, might be threatening to scientific peers in a scientific context,

518
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:59,080
and it might be risky, risky because you're invoking quality of life that's, well, you can

519
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,320
tell me in a minute whether you think it's supernatural or not, or whether that's the

520
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:07,960
right expression, but it's invoking something entirely natural, but outside of our normal

521
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:16,040
sort of capacity to empirically perceive things that would be a more sort of orthodox

522
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,000
way of looking at things, but in that moment, you know, I felt you emotionally were,

523
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,360
you know, very deeply invested in this, and I've also noticed in some of the reviews,

524
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,920
perhaps by Rowan Williams, perhaps by a few others, they wonder if you're sort of pulling

525
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:39,640
your punches a bit, that actually, far from not including this in the book, you culminate in the

526
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:49,640
sacred, and yet, even in the sacred chapter, it's quite cautious and quite tempered, and we just,

527
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,640
I just wonder what stops you from saying what you just said towards the end there,

528
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:59,000
something in, of the order that like, God exists, it's very important we come to know

529
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,720
God, and our life should be directed in that, in that sense. What's, what's pulling you back from

530
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:10,760
that? Yeah, I, I, I consistently, as you say, pull my punches for a good reason, and actually,

531
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:17,480
at the end, I don't say, and I say that although I'm very suspicious of a lot of God talk, and

532
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,680
although the very word God produces all kinds of complications that need to be dispensed with,

533
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,720
but I think we're too quick to say we can bypass this or dismiss it, and that I think it's our job

534
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,920
to try harder to understand what this ancient truth that people have always believed is about.

535
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,880
Why do we think we're wiser than they were? And I do actually say that nothing I have experienced

536
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:53,560
is in a sense more certain to me that there is some meaning to this idea. And that's expressed in

537
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:59,960
that way carefully, because as Jesus said, we should be as wise as serpents, but as gentle as

538
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:07,880
dubs. And part of my job was not to draw people to Christianity, I think I'm a rather bad Christian,

539
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,480
and I'm not a committed Christian, and I don't go to church. On the other hand, I cannot think of a

540
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:20,680
more wonderful mythos, and I use that word without any implication that is false. The mythoi by which

541
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,360
we live are the most important kinds of truth, and if you think you don't have one, you've probably

542
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,240
bought into the one of our age, which is that everything is a machine. That's a myth as well.

543
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:42,200
And I think it's such a powerful myth about a God who is involved in the creation in such a way

544
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:48,600
that he actually also experiences suffering, although there's a complex concept in theology,

545
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,760
by the way, because he may be so-called impassable, but I don't want to go into all the details.

546
00:52:52,760 --> 00:53:05,560
But the beauty of this idea, and the extraordinaryness of the art, and the music, and the poetry,

547
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:12,840
the architecture, the words of the liturgy, the words of the King James Byron, I think these are,

548
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,880
they speak to me directly, and I came from a family that were neither very well educated nor at all

549
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:27,640
religious, and I sort of first encountered all this in my early teens, and I just thought whatever

550
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,400
it is that I've been taught to believe about the world is not right. I need to commit myself

551
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,240
to understanding this, and I thought that I would probably actually become a monk after I'd

552
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,600
gone to Oxford and graduated, but by then I saw sense and realized I'd be a very bad monk,

553
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,160
and would also make a very bad monastery. So there we are.

554
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,920
Just a little follow-up. We heard from Linda this morning about fortune telling,

555
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,600
and in my group afterwards we spoke about astrology, and there's a sort of

556
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,160
book you may know by Jeffrey Kreipo called The Flip, which is premised partly on seeing

557
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,960
consciousness as primary, but not just that. There's also a lot of parapsychological data in it,

558
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,920
and he's arguing that really there's a moment at which suddenly the world looks very, very different.

559
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:25,320
Now my impression, knowing you for many years, you care very deeply about your scientific

560
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,080
authority and respectability, and for good reason, but I also wonder if, you know,

561
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:38,600
to what extent can we go there as it were? To what extent is it legitimate to wonder if the

562
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,640
eaching might actually speak to you, or the tarot cards might actually have something to say about

563
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:49,800
your psyche that's meaningful? Is this beyond the pale, or is this...? Well, not to me.

564
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:58,440
I'm far from being able to say that I know or experience or have in my world picture the whole

565
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:08,040
story. I haven't, none of us has, and it's the hubris of modern humanity that seems to me it's

566
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:16,040
worst trait, and what we need is a massive dose of humility which may come, alas, with societal

567
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:25,320
collapse, but we certainly need to re-embrace modesty, war, and compassion rather than anger,

568
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:35,480
division, power struggles, and all of that. There are a couple of things really, and

569
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,720
one of the things I forgot to say, and I just want to say this about why I didn't bang on about

570
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,760
Christianity is that as I say I'm not necessarily sure I'm a Christian, but I also didn't want to

571
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,080
be exclusive. I didn't want people to get there and go, oh God, he's a Christian, so now we've got

572
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:57,400
one of all that, but I wanted to draw on religions worldwide, and I found that they had enormous

573
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,200
wisdom and that these wisdoms cohered, and what's more they cohered? With the position I'd been

574
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:12,840
arguing for through neuro psychology, philosophy, and, um, slightly physics. I have a band of what

575
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,440
I call tamed physicists, and when I want to say something in physics I, there are people who

576
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,960
approached me and said, far more than biologists, this book is terribly interesting to us as physicists,

577
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,800
I know that's good, so then I tend to, is this okay to say, and they go very up, probably.

578
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:36,920
So why am I saying that? I just don't want people to think that anybody should be excluded from this,

579
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,200
even though to a very, very tentative, and I often think that the honest agnostic is the closest

580
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,920
to somebody who's really honestly searching for God.

581
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,840
Sorry, where were we before that?

582
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,080
Well, just that, um, I think,

583
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,480
yes, um, well it depends what you define as natural and supernatural, and I think that

584
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,680
lots of the stuff that we've now sequestered in the cupboard mark supernatural is not at all unnatural,

585
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,960
it depends how you look at things, if you happen to notice certain things and things,

586
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,760
events in life or reading something can make you open your eyes to it, you start to see it,

587
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,240
and that doesn't necessarily mean that it's real, I think we should be skeptical,

588
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,240
I think that scientists are not skeptical enough about their own findings,

589
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,840
and I think we should be skeptical as thinkers, as philosophers, as scientists,

590
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,600
but I also think we need in the end to be skeptical about skepticism,

591
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,600
in the sense that you can take it too far so that you're paralyzed and don't really know

592
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,840
that you can believe anything, that would be a mistake, but you see, it's not,

593
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,560
what one believes is not something one worked out in a seminar room, it's not just the

594
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,320
culmination of a series of propositions, the root of the word belief is from love,

595
00:57:53,320 --> 00:58:01,240
it's liven, you know, and the old English word leaf, dear, and um, what we believe

596
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:08,680
is very importantly what we are attracted to is right, what we have faith, faith is uncertain,

597
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,480
faith is incompatible with certainty, and faith is more valuable than certainty, certainty means

598
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,080
you're certainly wrong, it's one of the only certainties we can have, and so it's very important

599
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:26,200
to maintain this idea, I mean I want to say this whatever, because I think it's so important,

600
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,640
a reconceptualization of truth, truth is not something out there, a distant goal that we

601
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:39,160
can work our way towards, truth is something we can encounter in this world, and it's not a thing,

602
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,760
it's a process, it's a journey, and it's about not something being definite, but of a continual

603
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,840
unconcealing, so we are unconcealing the truth, we are sweeping away misconceptions as we find

604
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:59,960
our way to it, as we find our way to God, whatever you mean by that word, and this idea of truth

605
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,720
is very important, because truth is at the basis of fidelity, when we talk about truth,

606
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,960
and Calvin just talked about two surfaces that are true, indeed they say they marry, and truth

607
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:19,560
is what happens when warring factions stop fighting with one another, and come to what

608
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:27,400
we call a truce, a truce is derived from the word true, and truth is something that we uncover

609
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,280
in the business of living, so it's a very different thing from what goes on in the seminar room

610
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:38,280
usually, but if the seminar room takes into account pre-socratic philosophers,

611
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,160
modern phenomenological philosophers, it may get close.

612
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,120
Okay, thank you, so questions now from the audience, if you can put your hands up, I think

613
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:53,000
I'm going to have to do this roving for the recording sake, so the mic is there to be recorded,

614
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,160
I think if you want to ask a question, but you don't want to be recorded, let me know,

615
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,200
but I'll assume you do, so I'm going to bring the mic to you, and I'll begin,

616
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:11,960
yes, does anyone else want to play the roving role? Nick are you sure? Okay, so then we'll take

617
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,360
these two at the front, if we can take a few together, it helps, not too many because it can

618
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,280
become overwhelming, but maybe two at a time, and we'll see how it goes.

619
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,920
Thank you Ian, I think we all want to thank you for persevering with the million words.

620
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:36,520
You live on sky, I live in a tiny house on wheels in the Derbyshire Dales,

621
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,360
and I'm very careful what goes in, and your book is in, so thank you.

622
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:49,720
Thank you. You say consciousness is primary, for you is consciousness mental or material,

623
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:00,600
or neither of the above? Okay, is that one? Thank you Ian, I'm looking at the two lights behind

624
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,720
you which are on all the time, and it made me think about the right hemisphere and the left

625
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:11,960
hemisphere, do they flicker one on then the other, one on the other, or are they both

626
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,440
on at the same time, or do they fade in and out, do you have a sense of that? We take those two

627
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,440
together. I'll deal with that question first, and based on our hemispheres are operating all the

628
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:38,680
time. Which one is guiding our attention is more a matter of a divided role, and so effectively we

629
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:43,800
don't need to be thinking and shouldn't be thinking that we are just using our left hemisphere or right.

630
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,760
What I'm talking about there is a short hand, I believe that in this world when we enter into

631
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,400
discourse we don't like contradictions, if you contradict yourself that's almost worse than

632
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,920
talking nonsense, anyone will listen to nonsense as long as it's coherent with itself, but actually

633
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,880
truths are often very very complicated and require different things that we go, well that

634
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,800
doesn't add up, I mean the left hemisphere is very quick to dismiss anything that seems

635
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,440
contradictory or paradoxical. The second question, or the first question actually,

636
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,680
and is very good, but I think that what you've done there is reinforce a division that I don't

637
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:24,680
think is correct between the mental and the physical. So consciousness is the ground of

638
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:30,600
both mental and physical life, and the physical life is the material expression of consciousness

639
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:40,200
which we also have in an immaterial way. So consciousness, let me give you this image,

640
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:47,400
and what is water? Well you think you know what water is, it's that translucent stuff that flows,

641
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:54,200
but it's also that very hard opaque white stuff that's extremely cold and can crack your head open,

642
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,840
and it's also in this room, I mean this upper part of this room is filled with water,

643
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,280
but we're alive and we don't see it. So there are different ways in which consciousness can be

644
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,800
manifest, and if you like a congealed form of consciousness is more of a matter. I want to

645
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:15,720
get to the position where I don't collapse the division between my mind and the consciousness of

646
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:23,400
the rest of the universal garden law with you, but we don't collapse the two, but we don't entirely

647
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:29,240
divide the mind. We live in a country in which we think division means separation, but it doesn't,

648
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,520
it doesn't mean actually having to separate. It's being able to see the difference, and the best

649
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,920
example of this is in a bar magnet, where there's another north pole and the south pole, they're

650
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,240
completely connected to one another, but they never separate. In fact night and night can possibly

651
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,920
exist without the other, it isn't a hard division where they cease. Okay, thank you. Wow, more

652
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:58,600
hands. Okay, Isabella and Milky, just opposite. Yeah, thank you again for this great talk. I moved

653
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:07,720
again to hear your story, and I'm most interested right now to hear whether you had an experience

654
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:16,120
that brought you to the place you are right now in terms of your feeling of the sacred,

655
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:23,160
or was it purely through studying? So from my experience, reading you and poetry has brought

656
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:30,840
me as close to a religious experience as I've ever had, and that sounds too much, but it is true,

657
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:36,040
and I'm wondering whether it's for you becoming a scientist and doing the work and thinking

658
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:42,680
concessually and feeling something that you didn't get from that that brought you to digging

659
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,080
deeper and then having an experience or the other way around. Okay, thank you, and take Milky's

660
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:51,880
question as well, please, just there, Nick. I believe you kind of touched on it with your

661
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:59,320
conversation with Jonathan, but you mentioned four elements, science, rationality, imagination,

662
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,920
science reason, reason, reason, yeah, and I forgot the other one. Imagination, intuition,

663
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:10,200
but there is, I think there is a missing, at least it appeals to me, memory, memory,

664
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:17,560
remembrance, footprints of people who have been, you touched on it at the end, I think, in your

665
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,840
conversation, and another thing I wanted to add was if you give an advice to a technologist,

666
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,880
someone working in the tech sector, what would that be? Okay, I'll just speak that one in the end.

667
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,560
How do you save the world from AI quickly? So Isabella's question, where did the sense come

668
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,960
from, from ratiosination and study, or from some kind of revelation or experience?

669
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,880
It's never come from revelation, and oddly, I didn't think I've had any revelations in

670
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,720
I mean, other than suddenly, wow, when I experience a work of art and something like that, I don't

671
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,360
know whether that counts, or just a very beautiful scene. I've been saying, oh wow, all my life,

672
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,480
are these really revelations? Not in the kind of way that I think you're suggesting. So it's

673
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:07,000
been an equation of experience that has been cohesive since I was a teenager. I mean, I

674
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,160
remember as a teenager having a very strong view that the whole was not the same as the

675
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,640
sum of the parts, and I couldn't explain it, and people would say, so what's this mysterious

676
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,120
something else that gets put in when you put the parts together? And of course, I didn't know how

677
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:26,280
to answer that, I wouldn't know now, but so he was continuous as a piece of life.

678
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:37,640
The question that you asked, Milti, yes, memory. You see, the way I think of that is that he's

679
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:45,080
a sort of subset of all the things I've mentioned. So science needs to remember to amass, and to

680
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:52,360
bear in mind past experience. Reason is based, in my view, not just on logical working of things

681
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:58,520
out, but being able to make the right analogies to see the correct context, all of which comes from

682
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:04,040
experience, and one way of talking about experience is memory. And I would say the same thing about

683
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,880
intuition and imagination that they're fed into by memory. But thank you for drawing my attention

684
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,400
to it, because I think memory is a very interesting topic. And I'm thinking hard about

685
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:21,640
actually what I think about memory now, because we're beginning to think that living organisms

686
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:29,800
must respond to imprints that we can't find in DNA, and they may be in fields that bear such

687
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,560
memories. This has been considered rather wacky in the past. I hope Rupert Sheldrake will live

688
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,280
long enough, dear man, to see himself indicated, as I'm sure he will be.

689
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:46,520
Thank you. And just a follow up on Isabella's question, because it was such a profound one.

690
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,000
You did say that you're not enduring the talk. I thought I heard you say words to the effect

691
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,240
that if you there was something along the lines of if you listen, if you attend,

692
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,960
you will feel a response. It wasn't it wasn't quite if you listen for God, you'll hear,

693
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,760
but it was a little bit like that. And so I just wondered to push back slightly on what you said

694
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,000
about the accretion, because that makes it sound still quite safe. There is a sense in which you're

695
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:20,840
experiencing a relationship in your life, is there not? Many relationships with the divine,

696
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:29,000
if one can say that, I believe, with nature, with people. And I sometimes think, you know,

697
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:36,040
you mentioned, if you listen, you'll hear God speak. I do listen, and God doesn't speak. And

698
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:47,640
I sometimes said, look, it wouldn't hurt you just once. They something. Does human family

699
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:53,320
you are there in communication with me? And then I made it, I think, and maybe that is God speaking

700
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:59,480
but I spoke to you this morning when you looked out of the landscape. I spoke to you this morning

701
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:05,560
when you got a phone call from your door. I speak to you all the time. What's the problem? Okay,

702
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:11,240
wonderful. Thank you. More questions. Darius and Zordek, just one over this corner here,

703
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,520
because then we'll get the cluster. You can see a cluster emerging. We're coming to you.

704
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,920
We'll take Darius and then we'll move to the cluster. Thank you. So you've been using two

705
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:26,040
sets of terms. One is ground of being, and then you've also talked about God. So

706
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:34,280
is that a distinction that is clear to you? I mean, God is generally like a personification,

707
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:40,600
some entity with a personality, while ground of being connects to other traditions like Taoism,

708
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:48,520
which do not personify the ground of being. It's a profound mystery. And once we personify it,

709
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,200
we're actually over defining it and making too many assumptions about it.

710
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,680
I think we'll take this. No, you're not such a big one, I think. Basically, we just asked,

711
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:07,880
is God a person if I understood it correctly? I think so, because it's too big to get with

712
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:15,880
another question. A very good one. Of course, what I mean by the ground of being is that which,

713
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:23,480
in a way, doesn't kickstart being in a temporal sense. It's not the cause in the sequence,

714
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:31,400
but that underwrites all being. So it is there as the ground of being. And

715
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,760
this is where I want to mention the Trinity, a Christian concept, although I discovered that

716
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:45,400
it's actually a very ancient concept that was in many pre-Christian belief systems.

717
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,280
But at school, this always seemed to be manifest absurd, and I always felt

718
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,560
a squirm factor when the Trinity was mentioned. I mean, what is this about the man, the boy,

719
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:04,120
and the bird? It doesn't make any sense to me. As I matured in my thinking, I realized it's

720
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:11,960
extremely important as an expression of what I was much more able to accept, which is Panentism.

721
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,720
Just to gloss out for people who are not familiar with the term,

722
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,560
Panentism is the belief that God is just the sum of everything. I don't believe that.

723
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:26,280
But Panentism is the belief that God is in everything, and that everything is in God,

724
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:32,600
has its being in God. So that God is never separate from anything in the cosmos. And

725
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:40,520
the way in which that manages to work for me is that it manages to bridge

726
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:50,040
the debate about whether God is... What's the word? I certainly lost the word.

727
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,800
Female? Female? I'm just kidding. That wasn't the word.

728
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,240
No, whether God is... I hate this.

729
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:08,760
With transcendent, whether God is transcendental or imminent.

730
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:16,120
And I believe that it's important to be able to hold both of these things without

731
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:23,160
collapsing into one or the other. And in that sense, God is both the sort of ground of being

732
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:30,200
and the process of this cosmos. I said that it was in, or he, or however you like to put it.

733
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,800
I mean, it's unsatisfactory. She is also unsatisfactory. I just stick with he because it's

734
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:44,600
conventional. And he or whatever is that other is also in the process of creation

735
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:55,400
and is present in within us right now. And it was made clear to me by a simple Franciscan monk

736
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:00,840
in my teens who said, well, think of it like a book. Where is the book? Is it in the mind of the

737
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:06,840
writer? Or is it in this book on the table here? Or is it what happens when you read the book?

738
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,360
And those are the three things. And it's also in Rumi. I like to be able to bridge these things.

739
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:19,480
Rumi says it is the water source. It is the water that flows to the cup. And it is the water that

740
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,920
is drunk. Thank you. I can just check with the audience. I'm conscious of time and energy.

741
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,600
And so at the beginning of the end, there's a cluster of questions here that we will take.

742
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:37,960
But I'm just conscious that we're talking about God. And there was a time when I first met Ian,

743
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,560
maybe a decade or so ago, where that would have created quite a strong degree of discomfort.

744
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:49,160
And I'm just wondering if anyone cares to put their hand up. If you feel that talking about God

745
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:55,480
is somehow discomforting, uncomfortable. Okay, thank you. Anyone else? Yep. Any more? Don't be

746
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:00,520
shy. I'm sure you have lots of allies. Right. Because some people might, yeah, this is sort of

747
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,240
tacit coercion, sometimes baked into the conversation. Just good to know you're, you know,

748
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,680
that's not surprising. And many would feel it. Other questions now, the cluster.

749
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:17,400
Can I just comment on that? It's exactly avoidance of coercion that led me into the position you

750
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,200
put me with first, because you don't seem to come out.

751
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,520
I don't want any, I didn't want any of my readers to feel he's got design.

752
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:33,080
But I don't, and I'm constantly, you know, going, it doesn't have to, nobody has that view.

753
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,040
I do appreciate that's the intent. I'm also wondering, though, whether it's felt so palpably

754
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:44,280
that the intent is somehow less important than the experience that this is in the room, as it were.

755
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,480
And so, okay, we have a cluster here. Let's take it. Yes, the hands have been up for a long time.

756
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:59,080
Thank you, Ian. I wanted to follow up and dive a bit deeper into what you mentioned about friction,

757
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,360
as not only that, which creates resistance and conflict, but that which propels it sort of

758
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,360
the heart, at the heart of the fabric of drama and expression in the cosmos. And particularly in

759
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:18,200
within your work, how you see deception as an essential part of this friction.

760
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:25,560
I want to differentiate it in two ways, perhaps the left brain side of deception being that which

761
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:32,920
is asserting a particular story to enable a certain way of being to sort of self-justify itself,

762
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:39,560
and the perhaps more right side, right side of deception, which would be

763
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:46,040
that which you find in the greatest forms of art, whether it's poetry or comedy or even science,

764
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:52,840
where it's a form of deception that unearths its own limitation, speaking to its own limits of

765
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,680
language, or it's something that unravels into further creativity. And I'll be curious how deception

766
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,360
ties into your work. Okay, Ian, thank you. We'll take a few more questions if you don't mind

767
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,680
hold the question about deception. One bridge was just in front of there, Nick, and thank you.

768
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:17,000
Thank you, Ian, for your very important ideas. My thoughts are in Alice in Wonderland and Moby

769
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,840
Ticks, some very important ideas were hidden and passed on to a public that might not go very deep

770
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:33,080
initially. In the age of shortened attention span, which we have now, how would you feel and have

771
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:43,320
you thought about if your ideas were packaged in, say, a Netflix show or something that would

772
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:49,240
make it more accessible? And for what age group would you feel it would be most appropriate and

773
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:55,000
effective? Okay, thank you. So let's take those two then deception and then genres.

774
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,680
The first thing I'd have to say about perception is to go back to the neuroscience.

775
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:06,360
It was deception, right? If I heard correctly, not perception, but yeah, no deception.

776
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,920
And the different kinds of deception that there was might be a kind of creative deception in the

777
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,720
right hemisphere, as I understood it, whereas the left hemisphere's deception is invariably

778
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:26,840
maladaptive in some way. If I've done justice to the question. To understand if I can relate to

779
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:45,000
right hemisphere deception. Well, yeah. The trouble is that I think that, as even Mike

780
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,120
Gazzaliga, who's the biggest mechanist in the world, believes the left hemisphere is not really

781
01:17:54,120 --> 01:18:02,920
interested in truth. And so it does project the most massive lies. And it's also vastly

782
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:10,840
overconfident that it's right. So it is the home of mistakes and deception. I'm trying to think

783
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,440
how the right hemisphere would deceive us, except in as much as it would not contain what it is the

784
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:22,360
left hemisphere can say or would say. So the left hemisphere is different from the right hemisphere

785
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,600
in its relation with the other hemisphere. So the left hemisphere is exclusive of the right

786
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,200
hemisphere, but the right hemisphere is inclusive of what the left hemisphere knows. And actually,

787
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,520
in the image of the master and his emissary, the title of my earlier book, it's the master that

788
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,920
actually instructs the emissary to go and do this work, expects the emissary to report back,

789
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:50,600
but the emissary goes off on a thing that it's the master. Okay. Yeah, I would just feel that

790
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,080
there's so much more to come. I don't know how to present. Yeah, it's it's it will hold the question

791
01:18:55,080 --> 01:19:00,680
in the air. And but the subsequent question about genre, I mean, you have had almost like I see a

792
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:05,160
sort of, you know, many different kinds of, I was about to say Russian doll, if I'm honest,

793
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,480
then I suddenly felt that sort of political weight of that. But I was thinking that the

794
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:16,040
number of different kinds you've had, you know, RSE animate that there weren't seeming any millions,

795
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,960
there's been a kind of documentary, there's been yeah, all that. And I have Jonathan very

796
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:28,600
much to thank for this, because he said after I'd given this talk, we have somebody who will turn

797
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,640
it into a cartoon. And I said, Oh, God, no, that's the absolute worst thing they can have, because

798
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:38,760
this stuff is already, you know, in most people's mind, the pop idea of the two hemispheres is

799
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,880
ridiculously caricature. I don't want that. And then after a while, he said, No, I've talked to

800
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:49,320
the guy and he's read your book, and he really understands it. Okay. And then on the day the

801
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:54,120
thing came out, the actual talk, it's about 11 months after the talk had gone up, my talk had

802
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:01,400
12,000 views. That afternoon, the animate had 46,000 views. And so I'm completely converted to this.

803
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,880
And I'm delighted to report, I don't know if you've known this, actually. You do, yes. The guy who

804
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,080
did it contacted me and said that he wanted to come and interview me for the purposes of making

805
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:19,720
some more. And he came and interviewed me for three or four hours. And he's going to make, he says,

806
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:27,320
five or six very short animus. And that will, that will be a very helpful move, I think. I don't

807
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,880
think it's that people have become incapable of this kind of attention, but they, you're quite

808
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,440
right that they need some kind of weigh in. They need a lure. Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. We

809
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:43,560
have a few more questions. So Nick, yeah, a lot. Yeah, thank you at the back. We've noticed you

810
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,360
at the site. I've noticed the two wings here. We have Dominic. I know Dominic, you've been trying

811
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:52,440
for a while, I get it. And we have, take one at the back first. Quick question. You, you're a very

812
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,120
observation. You're a very convinced monotheist. Whereas very convinced monotheist.

813
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:04,680
No, isn't it? Monotheist. Whereas most religious people entertain the existence of many spirits

814
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:09,000
and beings and gods and goddesses and demons and so on. So that's an observation. The question is,

815
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:18,040
different traditions and communities use the word spirit or energy. And you use consciousness.

816
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,200
Are they talking about the same thing? Or is there a reason? Is consciousness somehow

817
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,800
different? Talking about something different? Yeah. I think that's a big one, Nick. We'll take

818
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:33,560
that one first. I mean, ultimately, I say that these things can't be neatly carved out from one

819
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,920
another. But I still think it's very useful to use different terms. It's very important to use the

820
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:44,840
terms North Pole or South Pole correctly of a magnet. But, you know, effectively, they exist

821
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:53,160
together. They co-create one another and so on. I mean, polytheism is interesting. But I think

822
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:59,080
that it's a step behind what I'm trying to say, which is that is the union of division and union.

823
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:10,120
So it's not unreasonable for this God that is, if you like, ever present in the world to take

824
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:15,960
different manifestations at different times. And maybe when I have an experience that I think

825
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,000
is of the sacred, then that is a very particular thing. And in the past, if it had taken place in

826
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,680
a wood or a mountain, it would have been a different God. I don't think that's really necessary.

827
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:34,680
And I think that there are differences between spirit and consciousness and God. I mean,

828
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:44,280
consciousness is part of the cosmos that God is the ground of. What I mean by spirit is not just

829
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:51,560
my consciousness. My consciousness could be engaged in something absolutely nefarious or horrible or

830
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:57,640
trivial. But that is not spirit. What you mean by spirit, I believe, or what I mean by spirit is

831
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:02,200
something rather special, not just any other consciousness. And so we have a word for it.

832
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,880
That seems to me okay. Okay. Thank you. There's so many other questions, Nick.

833
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,520
And also, you've described yourself as a Taoist, but we'll come back to that maybe in

834
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:14,520
subsequent question. Yes, thank you. Yeah, I know. I know Dominic. Don't worry, saving the best for

835
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:22,680
last. I just want to thank you for the ways that you articulate and bring to language and things

836
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:31,560
around. Maybe I'll have a quiet voice. Just extending gratitude for the ways that you're

837
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:40,840
bringing to language. Matters of the sacred. Okay, try again, Zoya. Sorry.

838
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:59,000
Okay. Just expressing deep gratitude for the ways that you're bringing to lexicon

839
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:06,840
ideation of the sacred and innate ways of knowing. I feel like the colonization of God

840
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,000
is like one of the greatest unravelings that many of us experience in this age.

841
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:19,000
And I found the metaphor of the violin and that duality being important and of the

842
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,200
poles being really important, really poignant in this time of what we witness all around or what's

843
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:33,480
bombarded all around us around division. And I wanted to ask this, I wanted to like

844
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,320
zoom in on this duality of division and unifying or how you might bring that to words.

845
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:45,720
What does that mean for each of us acting in this age in response to the extent of the divisive

846
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:52,680
epistemologies of material reductionism? What kind of rigor does that require of each of us

847
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:57,640
acting as agents? Okay, thank you, Zoya. Before you answer, we need to take the last

848
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,560
round of questions, okay, because I think just because of time. So I've got this question

849
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:08,040
in mind and hopefully you have too. Okay, quickly, please. Yeah. What's driving you? What's your

850
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:14,040
life's mission? Okay, good one. Good one. We'll hold that thought. And a few more, please. Yes,

851
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,760
Dominic, okay. Well, Dominic's going last because I've already promised that.

852
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Yeah, this is sort of related to what Linda was saying about. I was very struck by her talking

853
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:32,600
about this morning about things like fortune telling and which is a long way from the sense

854
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:38,840
of the sacred that I was getting from your book. But it's a lot more closer to what every day

855
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:47,480
understanding of the spiritual is. And there's one part in your book where you touch on near

856
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:54,680
death experiences, but say you're not going to go into that. And I suspect for the reasons you've

857
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:00,520
already explained around other stuff with the spiritual. What I'm fascinated by is that near

858
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:09,240
death experiences are actually very, very well documented now. And in a way, if that were better

859
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:16,200
known, that might be a way of pushing us past this sense that the place we're in at the moment,

860
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,360
where basically humanism rules and says, when you're dead, you're dead. We've got the question

861
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,480
near death experiences question mark. And okay, Steve, and then Oh, we got one, two, three,

862
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,160
and then we're done. Okay, yes, please won't be able to answer all of them. But Ian's such a

863
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,000
brilliant synthesizer, he'll get to the gist. Okay, so question.

864
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:43,560
I'm interested in how you feel this work is landing in society. So how have you been most

865
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:51,240
touched by the receipt of this work and most disappointed? Okay, great. And then Steve.

866
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,840
Yeah, we'll go. Yeah, we'll take two more of them or them or really. Okay, okay, okay, okay,

867
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:04,520
let's let's answer that. So yeah. Okay, we can do two sets then if people can. Yeah, fine, go ahead.

868
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,600
So kind of what I'm here for, but that's okay, go ahead.

869
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,080
So Zoya has a question about the violin metaphor, the tension. What does it mean in real life?

870
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,040
How do you put it into action?

871
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:32,840
It's the technique, I suspect, not the microphone. Why is this? This always happens to me that the

872
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,040
person who's interviewing has a good microphone. This has repeatedly happened. There is a God,

873
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:44,760
after all. And also, I was amused when I was at the Chalk Valley Festival. I was being interviewed

874
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,880
by Jonathan Gaysman and he had 25 questions and we had about 30 minutes. And he said,

875
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,000
I'm going to try and be concise. And he said, well, I've never seen that before.

876
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,640
But the trouble is that I'm trying to compress a lot. And that's my excuse anyway. I think that

877
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:05,400
the idea of the division and union is very important in resolving tensions because we're not,

878
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:12,120
but almost more important because I'm short of time, I'm going to say this. I think that the

879
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:20,920
elements that are required are humility, charity, or compassion, and a degree of awe before the

880
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:27,160
extent of the things we can't know, don't know. So people certainty that they're right, that the

881
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,400
other person must be wrong, that they must be terrible because they held an opinion that they

882
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:38,360
don't hold. This is all utterly horrible. And nobody should be forbidden to say what they

883
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,800
honestly and truly believe as long as they don't say it in a very inflammatory and horrible way.

884
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,000
So I'm really worried about that in society. And I think the answer is not to ban people all the

885
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,640
time, but actually to do the precise opposite, but to sit people down and listen. And look,

886
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:58,040
it's not very complex. You can have marital therapy between a couple that are at one another's

887
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:03,080
roads. And you get the person to speak and then you say, no, your turn's coming. Now,

888
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:09,240
what did your partner just say? No, that wasn't what I said at all. Now, that actually would be a

889
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:15,640
very, very useful exercise. I'm going to be really annoying to you because I wonder why I'll say

890
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,760
something else while I'm on this topic because I didn't have a chance to talk about, which is

891
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:24,440
values. Effectively, there is only one value for the left hemisphere and its power. And the entire

892
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:29,480
debate about everything since about the middle of the 19th century from Marx onwards has been

893
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:34,360
about power. Every way we look at things is about power. It's the only value that counts.

894
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,080
If you're an artist, it's no longer good enough to be beautiful. To have beautiful work is almost

895
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:44,920
a put down. It's powerful. And that's the only thing we respect nowadays is power. And you may say,

896
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:50,680
well, that's the way men have left it. But don't let's embrace that. Let's try to get away from it.

897
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:57,000
Let's not just drill further into power. Let's talk about beauty, goodness, and truth. Until

898
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,840
we talk about beauty, goodness, and truth as our guide, we are stuffed. Now, there was another

899
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:09,800
question on another one and another. Yeah. Well, the big question was the purpose of your life.

900
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,880
There was a big question about what's driving you and what's... Oh, yeah.

901
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:19,560
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's quite easy to answer. I don't know. But in retrospect, my life has

902
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:25,880
made sense at the time it never did. Yeah. I mean, why did I... I wanted to do philosophy

903
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:30,760
at university, but for various reasons I didn't. It wasn't an honest degree, the one I wanted to do

904
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:36,040
philosophy and theology. So instead, I read literature. Why did I do that? I know. Why did I

905
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,240
switch to science in medicine? Why... In retrospect, it all makes sense. But what drives me is,

906
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:50,680
if you like... And it is a driver. It's a demon. I mean, I have a diamond in Plato's sense. It is

907
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,720
very cruel and won't give me time off and says, no, you might want to do that, but no,

908
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,680
you're sitting down at this desk and you're going to write. But the reason I want to do that is

909
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:06,040
because I believe that I have a vision that is coherent and I believe that it changes the way

910
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:11,560
people look at life. I know this. I absolutely know it from all the feedback I get. And so,

911
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,120
as long as I've got breath in my body, I'm willing to go around trying to promulgate it.

912
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:27,480
My impression is that it's landing very well across the educated, intelligent reading public.

913
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:35,560
There's a deafening silence from neurology and... No, not from neurology and psychiatry,

914
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:42,920
but from neuroscience. So I've had tons of wonderful messages from neurologists and

915
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:48,280
psychiatrists all around the world, but not from neuroscientists, except for Roman Chandran,

916
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,600
but he's a clinician as well. And so some very big names in the field have responded,

917
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,240
but what hasn't happened is I've been able to move on neuroscience. And neuroscientists are

918
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:04,520
people who let spend their life in the lab, but neurologists and psychiatrists actually encounter

919
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:12,840
people. And the brain has got nothing to do with people, but it has. And I've got

920
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:18,680
Mike Gazaniga on the film, The Storm, The Divided Brain, and he actually says, you know, he takes

921
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:24,440
these findings of neuroscience and so on, and then he applies them to the lives of real people.

922
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:30,200
I'm not comfortable with that. Well, I'm not comfortable with you, Mike, because you're not

923
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:37,080
doing the job you should be doing there. Anyway. Well, is there really another one there? Are you

924
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,160
sure? Or do we just not get to it? No, there is. There's a man who asked me over here.

925
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:49,560
There's one more question over here, which was, what has pleased me or displeased me? Yeah.

926
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:00,120
Well, it's not the same. I want to respond to it. I was just asking about that thing about

927
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:10,040
near-death experiences. I'm not against them. I wouldn't mind having one. None of these things

928
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:18,440
ever seems to come my way, but maybe one day it will. But no, I'm appropriately detached from it.

929
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:23,560
I'm prepared to believe the evidence. I know there are very good scientists involved in the area,

930
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:29,400
but I have enough battles to fight without people going, oh, I see. So he's one of those people

931
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:35,400
who believes in seances and things. I don't know what I think about seances. But I really have to

932
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:41,720
fight my battles a bit, and it's about restricting. I've got enough to cover without having to cover

933
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:47,080
things that will only land me in the soup. Okay. Okay. Stephen and Dominic. But I want, yeah,

934
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:55,640
who was the man who asked me what pleased me? Stephen and Dominic. All right. I want to say

935
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:03,240
what pleased me and what didn't. You can answer that at the end. I can say, all right.

936
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:13,240
Hey, and my question is, it might be a little late for this question now, but I'm curious,

937
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:20,440
why do you think we went in the direction in the Western world after the pre-Socratics in the

938
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:28,040
direction that we went and didn't follow what, you know, some of the profound, because I'm with you,

939
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:32,360
I think the pre-Socratics are extraordinary. So why did we take that direction?

940
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:47,080
Dominic. So actually, my question is quite quick, I think. Do my tongue. Perhaps it's quick,

941
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:51,720
but I wanted to go back to the brain. And you said something, you were talking about Jude

942
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:58,280
Coravan, and you said that animate life enables the speed of consciousness. And I wondered why

943
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:03,480
that's important. And then it was kind of a follow up on that question, which was related to what

944
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:08,520
Linda said, which was, could we, you know, you're talking about consciousness and matter,

945
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:16,120
and could consciousness be another way to think of time and that matter enables the flow of time?

946
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:27,560
Okay. If I could remember all of that when we get there. So history of ideas, yes.

947
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:35,480
I mean, really, so is not to waste time. I don't really know. I think what happened was there was

948
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:42,040
a great deal of commerce with the East, with India, with Persia, and so forth, and that many of the

949
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:47,560
ideas one finds in those cultures and in Greece at the time of the Pre-Socratics are very consonant

950
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:53,400
with one another. And then something happened in which we took a step back and started to inspect

951
01:35:53,400 --> 01:36:01,080
ourselves more self-consciously. And that's what gave rise to this process. And I found something

952
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:05,960
very interesting in Whitehead the other day, which is a society thrives until it starts to

953
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:16,520
overanalyze itself. I believe that's where we're at now. Yes. Well, rather as I said before,

954
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,080
there's a reason why we have these different words because

955
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:33,640
yes. Yes.

956
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:45,960
Yes. All right. I think probably the way I put it was suboptimal. Thank you.

957
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:57,800
What I would have been better to say was that responsiveness is what life magnifies. So

958
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:04,040
there is a way in which inanimate matter is responsive if water comes, eventually it moves,

959
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:09,400
and so on. So there's a kind of very slow process, but it's not going to give rise to a satisfying

960
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:15,080
sense of the divine. So you need to create, as it were, creatures that are much,

961
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:22,040
much more responsive. And they respond faster, they respond more deeply, and they respond more

962
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:28,360
broadly. So that's what I meant to say. And I think that's what life brings to the party.

963
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:36,760
Finally, I think we have a chat. No, no, no, there's a time thing. Yeah. I mean,

964
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:42,520
in the chapter on time, I think we miss, I suggest that we misconceive time because we don't

965
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,720
understand the nature of flow. And consciousness may be a kind of flow. But first of all, I'd

966
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:51,640
have to talk about how flow is different when you're inspecting it from the outside,

967
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,560
and when you're actually in it. And so when you're standing on the edge of a river with

968
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:03,880
stopports and a clipboard, time and the river seem to be passing. If you get into that river and

969
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:09,880
move in the exact flow of the river, time will appear no longer to be an issue, because you're

970
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:17,720
moving with it. And so time is in itself absolutely fascinating. But I wouldn't want to say collapse

971
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:27,640
it into consciousness. I think time can exist without our self-consciousness. If you say that

972
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:31,640
it's part of the structure of the universe, which I believe it is, and consciousness is the origin

973
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:38,040
of everything there, then I see what you're getting at. But I'm just nervous of conflating

974
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:46,040
things that ought to be kept separate. No, I just wanted to say, I mean, I really,

975
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:53,000
my first book I wrote in my twenties was called Against Criticism, and it sold about 400 copies,

976
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,080
and it then got unceremoniously remained it. It's slightly satisfying to me that if you now

977
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:07,720
try to buy a copy, it will cost you £2,000. But I didn't believe that the master and his

978
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:12,200
emissary would take off. I genuinely didn't, and it caused a change in my life, because I actually

979
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:17,800
gave up the day job in order to lecture and write further. And the good side of that was I could live

980
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:26,600
on sky, and the bad side of that was that I took a 90% cut in income. But what has really

981
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:34,920
staggeringly moved me, and it really does move me every day, is people who write to me saying,

982
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:42,520
this book changed my life. I mean, if an author gets that once in a lifetime, they should be

983
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:50,520
overjoyed. But I do hear it time and again. And people also say, which makes me feel I must be on

984
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:58,600
to something, somehow I knew all this, but I had no way of articulating it, defending it,

985
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:05,480
but you have given me confidence. This is so moving. I mean, after all, one of the reasons

986
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,320
I went to the psychiatry, I can say is because I wanted to investigate the mind-body problem.

987
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:14,920
That's true. That's very sort of top level. But another level, I had wanted to be a monk. I

988
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:19,960
decided I didn't really want to be a priest, but I felt very happy being a doctor. And I had a very

989
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:25,080
warm relationship with my patients. And one of the things that crossed my mind is if I'm going to

990
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:31,160
retire from that, that's going to give a huge hole in your life. Actually, it didn't, because I've

991
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:36,520
met so many people through this work, and I was freed to do other things. But anyway, I just wanted

992
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:43,960
to say that I'm enormously grateful to them for that. And I hope that people will continue to write,

993
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:50,200
because everybody's contribution is somehow different and increases the feeling that it was

994
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:55,320
okay to go through all the loneliness of the long-distance runner, because it really has been

995
01:40:55,320 --> 01:41:01,800
a very, very, very long and hard grind at many times. And I don't really, although I may appear

996
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,840
to be confident, I don't really have that kind of imposter syndrome. And when people say, no,

997
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,640
this thing really means something to me, that means something very great to me. So I just

998
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,480
want to thank you all very much.

999
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,540
you
