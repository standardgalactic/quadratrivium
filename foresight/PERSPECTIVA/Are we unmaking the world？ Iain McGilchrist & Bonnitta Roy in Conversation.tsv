0	10680	Listen, it's wonderful to see you all, all 334 and rising. I'm Jonathan Rison. I'm chief
10680	15600	executive and co-founder of Perspectiva, who are putting on tonight's event. We're also
15600	19900	very proud publishers of Ian's most recent book, The Matter With Things. I'm going to
19900	26740	work on the assumption that you know Ian pretty well, but he is as well as a now quite famous
26740	32740	author and I use quite there more in the North American sense of very rather than the sort
32740	42720	of British sense of not so much. Really, you know, very much famous and celebrated writer
42720	48420	and thinker with an increasingly international reputation. So it's no wonder that so many
48420	51900	of you are here to see him.
51900	59540	Tonight we're going to carry on our series called Attention as a Moral Act. And we've
59540	63140	spoken already in the first session about what we meant by that. We might sort of reiterate
63140	68980	it a little bit tonight. Some of you may know the first session was between Ian and I. We
68980	74940	were sort of trying to reassert, reaffirm, reestablish the nature of Ian's most fundamental
74940	81580	argument. We spoke a little bit about my own take on it, calling it the McGilchrist manoeuvre.
81580	86220	And we tried to establish what that was. And we just more generally sort of updated ourselves
86220	92700	prior to the plunge into the more specific aspects of the book. In the second session,
92700	98460	we spoke with Zachary Stein, who had an amazing conversation with Ian about value as a fundamental
98460	107380	feature of the cosmos. It was a very richly metaphysical, somewhat spiritual, fundamental
107380	111220	conversation about the nature of reality. And we've had a great deal of positive feedback
111220	118940	about it since. As some of you may know, in between our sessions, we also have bi-weekly
118940	123020	connection and inquiry sessions, which are run by Michael and Lee, my colleagues. And
123020	127300	so if you have questions or you want to have further conversations, you're welcome to just
127300	133300	go to those events. And they're quite informal and you have a chance to reflect and do some
133300	139700	practices and get to know the work a bit more deeply. Tonight we have an unusual situation,
139700	144700	which is that earlier today, I was in touch with Benita Roy, whom I've known for quite
144700	151300	some time. And she gave me chapter and verse on how she's prepared for this evening's event.
151300	156580	And she will be joining us very shortly. For some reason, we can't currently contact her.
156580	162900	And we're waiting for her to arrive. So I'm going to briefly introduce her. I hope that
162900	167740	she shows up. And if she doesn't show up, I'm going to begin speaking to Ian myself, partly
167780	172780	based on Benita's notes. But it's just a matter of time until she shows up, because we have
172780	178460	now reminded her. And my only assumption is that she may have got the time zone conversion
178460	184020	mixed up because of some daylight saving time change, which we thought we were on top of,
184020	190500	but evidently not. So give us a few minutes as she manifests herself. Benita, many of you
190500	196180	will know already, but many of you may not. And she's really a rather extraordinary human
196220	205260	being with a multitude of different character traits, skills, assets, interests. It's quite rare
205260	210420	for someone to get deeply into metaphysical philosophy. And by that, I don't mean so much
210420	216020	the metaphysical and the sort of new age sort of irrational kind of philosophy. I mean, more
216020	221540	profoundly in engagement with metaphysics as it's studied in classical philosophy and in
221860	228340	analytic philosophy. And she's written papers on why metaphysics matters. She wrote one of the
230020	235140	one of the most profound chapters in a book released by Perspectiva Press called Dispatches
235140	240100	from a Time Between Worlds. And it was about the idea of metamorphosis. And a lot of Benita's work
240100	245780	is about emphasizing not just the kind of how we have to improve things, but also a little bit
245780	250100	of how we have to allow things to end. Michael, are you showing me signs of life there? Or am I
250100	259620	imagining it? I'm imagining it. Okay. So Benita is also a horse trainer, a farmer. And like Ian,
259620	265940	she describes herself as a Taoist. One of my favorite conversations with her was when she
265940	272740	spoke about the enormous tomatoes that she had in her farm after using some new unsuspecting
272740	277220	variety of manures to make them grow. But she'll switch from that to speaking about
277300	284420	whitehead and heart short and so on. So Benita is a rather extraordinary person and I'm very
284420	293940	much hoping she'll join us in just a second. I'm just noticing I have a problem with my battery.
293940	300020	So if I disappear too, Michael, you'll have to take it up. I think I've got it covered,
300020	305220	but just a second. So I want to start Ian with a question that Bonnie was going to ask you.
305940	311060	She had something else to say first, but I'll let her say that because it's very personal to her.
311700	317380	She was very interested in your subtitle. She wants to understand a little bit more about
318100	321860	after the matter with things, which you might want to remind us why you chose that title.
322820	327780	More precisely the subtitle, our brains, our delusions, and the unmaking of the world. And I
327780	332420	know it took you quite a while to come up with that. But if you can share anything about why exactly
332420	335780	those words and what you're getting at, I know that's one thing Bonnie wanted to ask you.
337380	344420	Well, of course, in choosing the title in the matter with things, I was addressing myself
344420	350580	to the idea that we often have problems understanding elements of our experience because
350580	361620	we thingify them. We see them as things and in essence, many of the things that we think of in
361620	368900	this way, I think a better thought of as adverbs probably, in other words, they are not elements
368900	375300	that we have to pin down or we can find in certain places, but they are ways in which we relate
376020	389540	to everything else that exists. And so the idea would be that you don't look for an entity,
389540	396900	but a web of relationships that allows what this entity is thought to refer to to become real.
396900	403940	It's always a reverberative relationship. And why I chose the subtitle is, of course, it has a
404820	410980	kind of glancing nod towards the subtitle of the master and his emissary. But what I'm talking
410980	417780	about there is that I believe that we've started to use our brains in a particularly limited way.
418740	423060	When I say started, I think we've been doing it now for a couple of hundred years at least,
424100	429780	in which we disattend to whatever it is the right hemisphere is able to tell us and instead
429780	437700	focus on what the left hemisphere would have us believe. And the delusions comes from, as I
437700	444100	demonstrate in the first nine chapters of the book, which are all dedicated to neuroscience.
444180	449140	And it's more fascinating, I hope, than that makes it sound. It's not abstract. It's looking
449140	455460	at what actually happens to people and their lives and their world and their whole way of being
455460	462100	when part of their brain is not functioning correctly. And this may be because of an injury
462100	467940	to the right hemisphere or a stroke in the right hemisphere. But it may also be because of
467940	474980	developing a disease such as schizophrenia, which has many, many, many parallels with a
474980	483620	right hemisphere deficit state. And I go into all of that in that chapter. And the left hemisphere
483620	490500	is literally deluded. And that's not just me who says that. I mean, I'm very happy to quote
490500	495700	other, and I do other neuroscientists who say, yes, the left hemisphere is on its own deluded.
495700	499700	Sorry, Jonathan, are you just just for a point of clarification, because the word delusion is
499700	503540	used a lot. And I know you're very precise with your words. It's one of the reasons people love
503540	510260	your words much. And what exactly is a delusion? I mean, as opposed to an unreality and illusion
510260	513780	and lots of other concepts around it, what makes a delusion a delusion as such?
514900	523380	Well, I think that the standard definition is something like an incorrigible false belief
523380	532820	that is not explained by the person's culture or other context. So, you know, there are things
532820	538180	that we would call unexplained false beliefs, but they're part of somebody's religion. And
538180	543220	it doesn't mean that they've become crazy. It means that because of belonging to that religion,
543220	552180	that's the way they think, for example. And so it's got to be something, and it's not just
552180	561940	false, but it is in this sense incorrigible. Because there are false beliefs, which can be
561940	567540	corrected. But in the case of a delusion, it is pointless arguing with somebody about it, because
568900	573780	you're relying on a shared way of seeing the world, that is, as it were yours and mine,
573780	577700	and the patient's in order to explain to the patient that this cannot be the case.
578340	582980	But you've got to remember that for the patient, the whole world that they are experiencing is
582980	589860	based on this certain way of, that certain disposition towards it, this way of experiencing it.
589860	596340	And so it's a very obvious and common observation that however bizarre a delusion is,
596340	601540	it is absolutely fruitless trying to argue with the patient about whether this is evidentially
601540	612900	likely. And also, there's a sort of gray area where, for example, you may believe that your
612900	621940	spouse is unfaithful to you, and your spouse may be being unfaithful to you. But there is
621940	626820	still a delusional way of believing it, because you believe it not in the way that somebody would
626820	635140	normally frame this, but you believe it with a sort of determination and on the basis of evidence
635140	641540	that other people would not consider a reasonable basis for making decisions. So there's no very,
641540	647140	very clear way of putting it. But when you meet somebody who's deluded, you sure know what you're
647140	656500	encountering. And I believe that we as a society have started to believe obviously false things
656580	662900	about ourselves that experience, intuition, the business of living, would tell us must be false
662900	668500	and have always been seen by people as false, but we now believe them to be the case. So that's
668500	674340	that bit about the delusions and the unmaking. Joe, before you get to the unmaking, I just want to
674340	680260	get the delusions very clear, because again, as with last week, or two weeks ago, when we had the
681140	685780	necessary, but sometimes confusing, a lesion between value and values.
687860	692580	With delusion and delusions, I'm just curious, you're speaking in the subtitle about
693380	700020	particular delusions that you outline in those chapters that you mentioned. But there's also
700020	705860	something you say about shared reality here. So I'm just wondering the relationship between
705860	709540	particular delusions, which might make it difficult for people to interact in a shared
709540	715860	reality, and the idea that the whole perception that shared is somehow deluded. And what it's
715860	720180	like, are we living in both of those kinds of delusion? Or, and if so, what's the relationship
720180	723700	between them? And if you don't mind while you answer that, I have to go and get another charger
723700	727780	for my computer or they will disappear. So I'm still with you and I'm turning off my video,
727780	730420	and I'll be back. So make it a long, good answer. I'll be back in two minutes.
730420	740900	Okay, I'll do my best. Yes, I see the distinction that Jonathan's making there.
743140	749700	And, you know, for example, if we are as a whole society seeing things in a certain way,
749700	755860	is this still delusional since part of the idea of delusion is believing something that cannot be
755860	764340	explained by your societal beliefs? And I suppose this is a very new situation. I don't think there's
764340	772500	been an example in the past, where a whole society has been in the grip of ways of thinking that are
772500	778900	frankly delusional, and like those that are held by patients with major psychoses who are
778980	786580	out of touch with reality. And so this, this is a new era that we've entered where,
787700	794660	as it were, there is a mass psychosis. And I don't think I'm the only person actually who's used
794660	805860	that conception of a mass psychosis. But what we see is that, for example, people with delusions
805860	811220	based on the fact that they have got a psychotic illness will find many things
812660	818820	apparent that we would not think apparent and make things that we do see apparent as completely
820100	829300	probable or impossible. And I could go back to chapter nine, which is the chapter in which I do
829300	836420	look at schizophrenia, but just illuminate the, I don't know, possibly I would say about 30 different
836420	844340	ways in which people with schizophrenia demonstrate the same sorts of aberrational thinking that we do.
845460	850820	And one thing that's interesting about this is that it, I mean, a lot of it, one might think
850820	855940	is because we're interacting with machines. People with schizophrenia see themselves as machines
855940	862340	often and call themselves machines and have been known to do things like cut open their
862340	869460	wrists to see whether there's blood or engine oil in their veins. So they can often have this very
869460	876660	disturbing feeling that nothing is right. It's all mechanical. It's all abstracted engineering
877300	882660	rather than anything embodied. Sorry. I put my hand up because I've got an email notification
882660	887940	from our esteemed guest that she's waiting to be let in. Yeah. Oh, good. Yeah, I just want to say
887940	894420	Hey, so here we go. You've managed to bring fabulous. Yeah. And I'm just gonna bring it up
894420	900740	to speed then and let you take over from there. Hi, Bonnie. Nice to see you. Are you with us?
901780	907940	I am. Sorry. I'm so sorry about my tardiness. No, that's okay. That's okay.
908820	914900	Good to have you with us. You may not, I know you've been in touch with Ian by email, but
914900	923140	nice to introduce you. I'll be in front of 300 odd people. So, you know, I've spoken with many
923140	929780	times and I think you'll know, Bonnie, I've already introduced you to some extent to the audience.
929780	934420	What I didn't mention is that over the last year or so, you've maybe more than a year now, you've
934420	940500	created something with a lovely fetching straightforward title, a pop-up school. And
941540	945300	just briefly tell us what a pop-up, what your pop-up school is so that before we get into the
945300	953060	discussion, people get a better sense of where you're coming from. Well, hi, Ian. Nice to see you.
953060	962500	Hello, Bonnie. So, for almost 15 years, I taught a master's course in consciousness studies and
962500	968980	transpersonal psychology or transformational psychology, which we called it at the end.
969700	977620	And COVID pretty much was the straw that broke the back for that program, which was always kind
977620	991780	of an off-broadway struggling private program. And so, I graduated my last cohort in August of 2022
992340	1001140	and in August of 2021, kind of anticipating the end of that, I wanted to offer something similar
1001140	1007940	that was equally robust that could speak to what people were starving for, but had a much lower
1007940	1018820	onboarding threshold. So, instead of paying $17,000 a year, you could pay like $40 a month. And I
1018820	1025540	kind of modified sub-stack so people could enroll on and off or enroll on a yearly basis. And I
1025540	1032740	called it the pop-up school because in Zach Stein, whom you met a couple of weeks ago, Ian, in his
1032740	1038740	book, he predicted that schools might be these little pop-up initiatives. And I wanted to give
1038740	1047860	it this sense of like serial learning, like you could pop in and pop out. And yeah, so it's been
1047860	1054980	almost two years now and it's quite a growing, growing community. And I suspect there's several
1054980	1060260	of the students or our community on this call today. Okay, great. Well, I'm glad to hear it.
1060260	1063700	And, Bonnie, while you're getting settled, just as far as I understand it, where we were in the
1063700	1070180	conversation was, I didn't say anything about your observations about the book, but I did use your
1070180	1075540	email from this morning to ask Ian about the subtitle. And so, we spoke a little bit about
1075540	1081460	why the matter with things. We spoke a little bit about brains, which could be somewhat self-evident.
1082100	1085940	We spoke a little bit about delusions and the difference between delusion sort of
1086580	1090580	singular and delusions plural and individual and collective delusions, but only really
1090580	1094900	scratched the surface of that. And Ian was just about to come on to the unmaking of the world
1095460	1100900	when various things kicked off, including my computer running out of battery. So, Ian, if you
1100900	1106180	want to finish that thought on why the unmaking of the world allowed me to get settled and once
1106180	1111700	you finish that, I'm happy to disappear until the Q&A. So, if you can go on the unmaking of the
1111700	1116180	world, Michael, you can allow me to disappear. Yes. And then you carry on talking together
1116180	1118420	and I'll be back with the Q&A in about 50 minutes.
1121060	1129380	Yes, what I wanted to indicate by the phrase the unmaking of the world is that the various habits
1129460	1138900	of mind that I believe are toxic, which we've adopted more in the last few decades, but certainly
1139620	1147460	going back further than that, the last century or two, lead to us no longer having a world. And
1147460	1152900	a world is a very special thing. If you like to put it that way, it's an experience really,
1152900	1158980	like all the things I talk about, that it's not really a thing. But it's a place in which we
1158980	1170020	dwell. It's a home. It's a living thing. And therefore, in schematizing, mechanizing, abstracting,
1170580	1178340	decontextualizing, ignoring the uniqueness of individual cases, in ordering, ignoring the
1178340	1185780	individual uniqueness of people, we have come to inhabit an enormously impoverished version
1186420	1193380	of what that world should be. We're in a sort of lost place, which has none of the
1194100	1203540	feel of a living, vibrant world in which we are committed, orientated, and find a place of being.
1204180	1212660	That's really what I was getting at. Yeah, so thank you. When I read that, I was struck by,
1213460	1218900	I just had this impression, you put a lot of thought into the subtitle, and that it was very,
1221140	1230980	it was a more poignant message, maybe, than a lot of people might think about at first. And
1234820	1240340	something that strikes me as being of grave concern, I think there's a lot at stake. I think you
1240340	1245620	would agree that there's a lot at stake. And I think sometimes people think, they take you
1245620	1252260	seriously, but they think it's like a metaphor. And I think that it's more than a metaphor. It's
1252260	1259380	more than a passing concern. It's more than almost a sci-fi movie, let's say. Some people with all
1259380	1266500	these crises go into their consciousness like it's almost a sci-fi movie. It makes us nervous, but
1267300	1273300	I think that, like for me, a lot of what you're talking about, I see every day. I've seen the
1273300	1280100	erosion of the adult mind through the 15 years that I've been doing teaching. And, you know, of
1280100	1288660	course, my course selects some people who have maybe a little bit of spiritual emergencies and
1288660	1297940	stuff, but the nature of the question of whether reality is real is extraordinary now. And these
1298980	1304900	programs that people go to, that question whether we share the same world or we all have different
1304900	1311060	worlds, you know? There's this, and I know the sense in which we all live in our own perspective,
1311060	1316580	but the emphasis is always on that the world is a simulation, that we share different worlds,
1316580	1323540	like the sense that the humanities and the science are teaching this extraordinary
1323540	1330420	fragmentation, I call it locked-in syndrome, that we can't perceive the world really.
1330980	1345300	And my question for you is where is the fever? Why are we so feverishly trying to convince ourselves
1346580	1355060	that we live in a simulation? I mean, where is that pain coming from? That we don't want to live in,
1356260	1357700	let's say, the natural world?
1360340	1367540	Gosh, there's so many things to say about that. Well, one is that the natural world imposes limits
1367540	1374980	on us, like we die and we have bodies that have certain inclinations and so on. We're busy trying
1374980	1380100	to pretend that none of this is true and we can remake everything according to our whim,
1380100	1390180	but that is not the case. And in fact, the limits that are imposed by life are extremely healthful
1390180	1394900	and important. It's a mistake to think that we ought to be railing against them and trying to
1394900	1405860	get rid of them in my view. But of course, like everything, it's a matter of degree. Nature is
1405860	1415700	something that medicine has always interfered with. Nature tries to overcome some of the
1415700	1423540	unnecessarily adverse effects of disease and so forth. So we are always juggling these things.
1423540	1430420	I think another reason why we're addicted to this idea of a representation is because
1432020	1437620	the left hemisphere is a representation of the world. The right hemisphere has
1437620	1443940	a presencing of the world. It allows the world to presence to us. That is a vibrant two-way
1443940	1451940	experience. But once it is taken up by the left hemisphere, it is dislocated, dismembered,
1452020	1458100	analyzed, categorized, and turned into something abstract, a map of the world. And you cannot
1458100	1464500	live in a map. You've unmade the world once you do that. But the left hemisphere can only trust
1464500	1472020	the things that itself has made. Heidegger actually said that he was, of course, not talking about
1473780	1480580	hemispheres at all. But he did say that modern man needs to be able to tell himself that he is the
1480580	1487060	giver to himself of everything that he has. And that is part of this problem that we have,
1487060	1494180	that we must be the all-powerful and we must be the one that can do anything. This is extraordinary
1494180	1503300	in a way because, you know, for decades I've been puzzled by the kind of paradox that at the same
1503380	1509700	time we believe ourselves to be capable of doing almost anything we want to,
1510660	1518740	and believe ourselves to be basically pointless, worthless. So the dignity of humanity has hugely
1518740	1525140	plummeted, and so is its happiness and its sense of longing and everything else, at the same time
1525140	1532980	that our hubris about humanity has gone through the roof. So adopting a certain degree of
1532980	1541860	modesty and a sense of proper limits to what we can do and what we can know would actually
1541860	1548420	perhaps help us to regain a sense of respect for what we in fact are and what we can do. But
1548420	1554420	those would be some of the thoughts I'd have about why that is so promoted. And I'm afraid it
1554420	1560740	is very much promoted, and I just like to say that there are a number of philosophers quite
1561460	1567380	amongst the foremost at the moment is Donald Hoffman, who says that what we see is a readout
1567380	1575060	of an instrument panel. This is an idea that has been offered many times in the past and was really
1575060	1580740	in Damasio's early work as well, for which I criticised him and for which he hasn't forgiven me.
1582820	1586340	But this idea that actually what we're doing is reading out something,
1587060	1592660	which is what the left hemisphere does, but in fact we're experiencing something real. There are
1593380	1598500	things in the cosmos that correspond to all those things that we perceive and value.
1599380	1604420	Now I'm not saying that there's only one way of seeing them, but once again in our culture what
1604420	1611620	we've done is we've taken a partial truth and made it the whole story. So it is true that everyone
1611620	1617940	to some extent sees the world differently and that's an important and beautiful fact. But
1617940	1625460	it is also a very important and beautiful fact that generally speaking we see things in a common
1625460	1631940	world. We don't all live in so vastly different worlds that we have no common ground. And at
1631940	1639860	the moment there's a general tendency to say that if something is the case up to a degree,
1639860	1646420	which wasn't thought to be so perhaps recently, then it's true to the max across the board. We go
1646420	1651940	to extremes. We have black and white positions and I'd like to present myself as a photo of
1651940	1657060	black and white positions. It's very important that there are masses of degree and things that are
1657860	1660420	implicit and not fully made explicit.
1660980	1670580	You know so you said that you know we kind of have this hubris that we imagine ourselves
1670580	1680100	are all powerful, that all the gifts we have we've made ourselves. And it seems to me that
1681220	1688100	there's a pickle in this because somehow deep down inside we do know that we haven't made the
1688100	1694740	earth and we haven't made the trees and we haven't made ourselves and everything that we actually are
1695540	1701700	has been given to us freely by nature through no account of our own. I mean this is more it's
1701700	1706020	you know people will when I say that they say oh that's very spiritual and I say no it's just a
1706020	1714180	strong naturalism. It's just actually the case it's rather mundane and for me there's something that
1714740	1726020	if I thought I was responsible for booting up my enthusiasm every morning I would be overwhelmed
1726580	1734420	you know. It's like so much of who we are that gives us the possibility to pretend we're all
1734420	1743300	powerful comes to us through this intelligence that we don't we we don't maybe you know we don't have
1745700	1755620	you know it's not it's not been it's all given to us and and so it seems to me like the thing I
1755620	1763300	can't understand is that and I don't know this is seem off topic to you or is this kind of interesting
1763860	1771140	to talk about. Yeah so I went to a conference the other day and this young man was presenting an
1771140	1778100	argument that that the world is intelligible and that communication between people is possible
1778980	1784580	and to do that he took this huge journey through theoretical cognitive science and
1784580	1794580	opponent processing and and free energy principle and I thought something very odd he's a very nice
1794580	1803620	man and I thought something very odd is happening here like if if people had to understand all that
1803620	1809220	to understand that the world is intelligible it's a possibility of communication then most people
1809220	1816980	would be lost and I thought like I told my dog you have absolutely no no chance at all for being
1816980	1825940	in the world you know and so this question this crisis of how so this is an example of something
1825940	1834180	that looked like a well presented presentation but it really was to me a sense of collective madness
1834180	1844980	and and yeah no well this kind of thing goes on all the time it's just that we've completely lost
1845700	1854900	any kind of contact with the the live intuitive reverberative business of experiencing the world
1854900	1862020	in which the world approaches us becomes available to us and we to it and it's in this encounter
1862020	1873300	that whatever it is that we we we know comes about so what you're describing is this unnecessarily
1874180	1879140	complex way of approaching it and there's a lot of this in science in which frankly the
1879140	1886500	extraordinarily opposite is sorry obvious I meant to say extraordinary obvious is is demonstrated
1886500	1892820	at costly and great length where at the same time oddly there are things that are completely
1892820	1898100	obvious that are wholly denied and people go around believing them because they think oh well
1898100	1905140	people say this so I better believe it but I want a bit of the touch of the the little boy who
1905940	1911860	said the emperor's wearing no clothes yeah I mean I'm sorry guys he's nude
1912180	1919460	and there's just so much rubbish talk these days and it's very confusing disorientating
1919460	1924980	to agreeable and leads them to a sense of desperation they don't know what to believe who
1924980	1932020	to believe what to believe in the intuitive spirituality has been dead and by the way
1932020	1936580	they've been brought up and by everything they experience in the world their capacity to pay
1937540	1943860	um continuous sustained vigilant attention open attention respectful attention the sort
1943860	1952660	of attention that leads to real sense of meaning and or is has been undermined and they've been
1952660	1961060	told they have thousands of choices that in reality are not helpful and it it's a well-known
1961060	1969380	fact in in psychological research that beyond a few choices too many choices make people less happy
1969380	1976820	more stressed than they would have been content with fewer choices so it's not as I'm always saying
1976820	1981140	it's not an argument for having no choice but it's an argument for saying that choice doesn't
1981140	1986660	get better and better if you try and say well you can be anything you want you can't I mean
1987620	1995780	get real it's a horrible fantasy that creates enormous stress and the fear of missing out
1995780	2001060	and the fear of having failed and the need to do all kinds of incompatible things at once
2001060	2007940	in order to prove that you're okay it's a horrible world to bring up young people in I mean I I just
2009300	2014180	feel for young people whose rates of mental illness I was just zooming through the roof
2017140	2025060	yeah so we do live live in a mad world my master's when you think of young people it's really very
2025060	2036580	sad and and I've read a statistics that one out of very 16 kids in the United States is diagnosed
2036580	2042500	with a severe mental illness and whether it's because the DSM has gone mad or the children
2042900	2052420	gone mad it doesn't really matter it's an alarming alarming fact and you know I talked to sometimes
2052420	2062420	I coach some young parents and we we we try to teach parents how to have unstructured time with
2062420	2072420	their children and and I often get the response you know I I blocked out time she she was playing
2072420	2077540	I was there nothing was happening but I got bored I don't know what to do with my body I don't know
2077540	2086420	how to put my body in a in play I don't I'm just stiff and I pretend and and and this is all by
2086420	2092100	way of trying to say to the listeners like it's not a joke and it's not science fiction
2092100	2099380	and something really disturbing is happening right in front of our eyes
2100820	2107220	but I thought you know I have this this note here and there's this beautiful word that you use
2108180	2118420	if I don't know how to say it city if city if say it if say it and you have a quote from sass
2118420	2126340	in his book about this crucial self sense of self sameness a fundamental and therefore nearly
2126340	2133780	indescribable experience of existing as a vital and self identity identical subject of experience
2133780	2144820	and action and and I thought um this is one of these experiences that we can no longer take
2144820	2154980	for granted that people have any intuition of and so I thought maybe you could if you were talking
2155940	2166500	to aliens who had had had not this experience what what what is what is that experience
2168100	2173460	the trouble is that it's not something that's improved by being put into words it's something
2173460	2181940	that has to be experienced and I take the word it say it largely from louis sass um a very great
2181940	2193220	mind I think um and what he's talking about there is the natural um unselfconscious awareness of a
2193220	2200100	continuous functioning self we've so eroded our intuition and we've been encouraged to attack
2200100	2207540	our intuitions to reject our intuitions that we can no longer act unselfconsciously and this happens
2207540	2212660	in schizophrenia people say I don't know how to walk I have to think put one foot in front of the
2212660	2219380	other and so on I don't know how to sit down um or whatever it may be so they've become paralyzed
2220020	2227940	by a kind of gorgon stare of the intellect on everything they're doing and the beauty of life
2227940	2234660	is that things work well only when it's not like that imagine um how bad the performance
2234660	2240100	of a piece of music would be if the pianist was thinking all the time consciously about what he
2240100	2247460	was doing with his fingers imagine how um how diminished an act of sexual love would be if it
2247460	2254500	was entirely contrived according to a plan an algorithm or a worked out schema it's this way
2254580	2264420	of thinking that is absolutely crazy and a huge affliction and makes life impossibly difficult
2264420	2271780	for us the trouble is that if we adopt a legalistic frame of mind I mean a lot of this comes back to
2271780	2284660	a sort of legalistic um incorporation of um the redress in the the redress for any kind of
2284660	2291140	wrong that happens to you is to accuse somebody so nowadays we we we have this sort of idea or
2291140	2297780	some people seem to have this idea that we're owed a pain-free life and if there's pain there's
2297780	2302180	suffering things are not good in it there's somebody to blame for that and they must be
2302180	2310980	brought to account preferably through the law this has a deleterious effect on whole sways
2310980	2318660	of life where in fact we need to trust and to accept that there will be ups and downs and
2318660	2326020	things but not to become um you know reaching for our handy attorney at every turn in events
2326020	2334340	this is the problem and this is why schools find teachers harder to recruit hospitals are finding
2334340	2340260	doctors harder to recruit because first of all they've been told that unless they follow certain
2340260	2345540	written procedures they will be vulnerable to being sued and that will completely destroy their
2345540	2351700	career and and that's you know nothing any longer can be done according to the wonderful way in which
2351700	2359220	I was taught and it was taught medicine too which was from experience from people who'd had you
2359220	2365780	know 40 years of experience of whatever it was talking to me from that base of what goes well
2365780	2372260	and what doesn't and and you know the teachers at school were people who had had an enormous
2372260	2378100	enthusiasm for things that they had learned to love and they communicated that to me and that's
2378100	2384580	in itself worth a thousand hours of just following rules and procedures it's this
2384580	2393700	awful business of rules procedures theories that have overtaken our ability to be naturally responsive
2394660	2401860	creatures and when we can try to recover that we may be able to get back some of our moral self
2401860	2407220	because that's also a very important thing isn't it I mean since we have rules about absolutely
2407220	2414660	everything now I think back to when I was was young and one I mean it's a it's a cliche but one
2414660	2420180	didn't need to have the same numbers of locks and the cameras watching everything and so on
2420180	2426500	but on the whole although certainly crime existed it didn't seem to exist on the level that it would
2426500	2432660	if we now took away all the the locks and the and the cameras that we've since instituted and
2432660	2439220	there's a sort of belief that if you can get away with it then you're entitled to do so there's no
2439220	2445620	kind of strong innocence of I would never do this because I'm not that kind of person and I don't
2445620	2451540	want to live in a world where human beings do this kind of thing that seems to me one of the most
2451540	2458100	important moral act um stimuli to action I don't want to do this because I don't want to be in a
2458100	2464100	world where we can assume that people will do this unless some law restrains them from doing it
2464100	2472180	so we've moved such a terrifically long way from anything intrinsic and spontaneous and intuitive
2472980	2477780	um to the world of somebody who is unable to stand unless they've got
2477780	2484820	scaffolding all around them a support and of course such a person is a feeble version of a
2484820	2489860	healthy living individual yeah and of course that's what you think about that yeah and of
2489860	2496260	course that scaffolding is actually fragmented right just like this so I was thinking of the
2496260	2503860	other day we were talking about wisdom like what is it to cultivate wisdom and I was saying that
2503860	2512820	years ago both of us will use that phrase quite a bit I think um doctor for example could grow
2512820	2520180	wise in his career right so he would give birth to children he'd watch them grow he put their
2520180	2527700	help their parents in the dying process he'd be in the community and this kind of embedded
2527700	2536100	in the community in the local with his expertise um having what I call a voluntary obligation to
2536100	2546180	his practice um through the thick and thin and the difficulties this is a formula for having wise
2546180	2556180	people embedded in relationships but a doctor's career is not a formula for wisdom today not at
2556180	2561380	all it's completely fragmented and they're systematically standardizing things so all the
2561380	2565300	doctor does is go on the computer and tell you some things are pretty soon you don't need the doctor
2566020	2573780	and we feel we we've we've slowly redefined intelligence as something machines are good
2573780	2579300	at and so you see the standardizing of teaching the standards of this is what machines are good at
2579300	2585860	and now we have you know chat gpt is going to be our teachers because it's better at that than we
2585860	2594500	are but we've been we've redefined intelligence is what people are good at well we need to redefine
2594500	2603060	intelligence I mean yeah yes I I mean I I always say AI is not artificial intelligence
2603060	2609060	it's artificial information processing and that's what it does but intelligence involves
2609060	2617140	a full understanding and that can only come if you if you are embodied if you have emotions if you
2617140	2622580	form um relations on the basis of that and if you're aware that you were only here for a while
2622580	2629060	and are going to die the all these things are very important to making us what we are we need all
2629060	2634500	these elements including the element of death which is not our foe but in many ways our friend
2635620	2639220	that's a whole other topic but but I what I'm really saying is that
2640980	2648260	intelligence isn't is is at risk and I think you're saying this as well um have been replaced
2648260	2655220	by just very rapidly and mechanically following every kind of pathway that a computer can find
2655220	2662100	but having no sense of a context in which to properly evaluate these things and and will
2662820	2668340	fill in things which are absolutely not true on the basis that it looks like in this pattern
2669300	2674260	this ought to be happening so it actually states that certain things have happened in a person's
2674260	2679860	life for example based on a probability but they didn't and that person rather specifically
2679860	2686500	didn't do those things so I mean not only have you got the problem of telling true from false in
2687140	2693380	educating children and and students who may waste their time and their teacher's time by
2694100	2701780	using chat gpt to write their essays um but it will also make the the sphere of the law very
2701780	2709220	difficult our is the evidence fabricated what do we really believe here um can we believe
2709220	2715300	something we see our politicians saying when you can't believe and you can't trust the civilization
2715300	2725220	collapses and you know that's this wonderful saying uh Chinese third century is saying um
2725220	2734980	one of the emperors that for a society for a civilization to thrive you need guns food and
2734980	2740820	trust and if you have to do away with one of them do away with guns and if you have to do
2740820	2747620	another one do away with food but the one you cannot do away with this trust and we've done away with it
2756180	2759300	sorry I hope I haven't depressed you too badly don't you think of something
2759300	2768900	no no no I I see something good for the end um um and no I think that I what I'm trying to
2770900	2780340	collaborate with you on is it's really to open people's eyes we know we get so habituated to
2780340	2790820	the way things are and open people's eyes to see how extraordinarily unmade the world is
2791460	2800820	I mean we we think we think we have to encounter people who are paranoid schizophrenics to
2801380	2806340	understand what you're talking about and yet this kind of unmaking of the world
2807060	2813460	is the world that is being unmade right right in front of our right in front of our very eyes
2814500	2822740	and um it's the world is an organism it's not a machine and the trouble with the way we think
2822740	2828260	is that we think it's just a machine and can therefore be reduced to parts and all we find
2828260	2835220	after you've done this is a lot of of material elements that have been broken out of a hole
2835220	2841860	and the hole cannot conceivably be reconstructed from these bits these inanimate bits and what I
2841860	2847620	mean by the unmaking of the world is all that structure all these relationships that enable
2847620	2855060	things or people and the feelings that they have experiences they have to interrelate with one
2855060	2860900	another are being shorn away the world view is becoming simpler and simpler and simpler
2860900	2866900	not because it's approaching truth but because it's moving away from truth it's it's running away to
2867620	2873780	a blatant falsehood which it feels it can't escape because of a certain way of thinking
2873780	2879140	which is that the only thing that matters is that we should be able to be in control
2879940	2886820	and amass material goods those are the values of the left hemisphere and all the other important
2886820	2891220	values are better served by the right and it's anyway that was what I talked about last week so
2891220	2899300	we won't go there now I think that another thing that the way to another way to look at it and of
2899300	2908340	course you've done incredible detail on this is people a lot of times people are let's say their
2908340	2916900	teachers or educators or their psychiatrists or their spiritual teachers they assume that the
2916900	2926980	kinds of minds we have is the nature of mind and then they try to work with that or or you know
2926980	2932900	people will say because our minds are constructing reality and and I always say no that's the kind
2932980	2939300	of mind we have thinks it's a simulation but what I hear you saying is that this integrated mind
2939300	2946340	and of course we have to we're off balance so we're going to emphasize what the what we've lost
2946340	2955700	with the right brain a contribution this kind of mind looks at nature and sees home and and and
2955700	2965620	moves around the world and sees that every act of life is a gift from nature from my home from
2965620	2976900	where I've become this kind of mind trusts that there's such a larger intelligence that an envelopes
2976900	2984500	envelopes all of us and that's like a tissue from which we dialogue is possible you know the left
2984500	2990180	hemisphere like the difference between concepts as you know you hold your baby like this and it's
2990180	2997300	right hemisphere to right hemisphere and yet we're talking at odds like we think that if we can come
2997300	3004580	to some conceptually agreed upon solution then there's a possibility of a communication and I'm
3004580	3012420	saying that like because we our bodies are inhabit the tissue of the living world then this is why
3012420	3020260	this communication is possible not because it's an effort in this direction it should be a joy in
3020260	3028900	this direction and and yeah I I totally agree with that and I think you know the phrase constructing
3028900	3035060	the world is very important because it's a fashionable conception has been since the 60s
3035060	3043220	that effectively we make up the world according to you know who we are then what we what we want
3044180	3051700	but I reject this idea that we fabricate it because that is dependent on this idea that
3051700	3058100	we are cut off from any kind of reality and that all we have are the bits that come to us in our
3058100	3063860	in our mind and we put together a world out of those but that is not in my view the case because
3063860	3070820	we do have contact with something beyond ourselves and unless you tell yourself that that cannot be
3070820	3075140	and cut yourself off from it in which case of course you won't find that there is anything
3075140	3082180	beyond yourself if you don't do that but cultivate a kind of humble awareness of things that are far
3082180	3090820	beyond what we know right now you start to feel experience those things they start to to give
3091140	3096660	something with which to build the world and so it's not a fabrication or a construction of the
3096660	3102580	world it's a helping to bring into being something that is there to bring it more into being and
3102580	3108420	we play a part in that and so the world comes about for each of us in a slightly different way
3108420	3113460	because if each of us brings something different to it but this is wonderful it's not a negation
3113460	3119540	of the idea that there is a common core to the world it's the idea that each person's contribution
3119540	3124660	brings a slightly different uniqueness to an aspect of the world we still have something
3124660	3132180	that is vibrant living evolving it's not a finished product it's a thing that is in process
3132180	3138020	as we ourselves are in process and that process is a resonant thing between our consciousness
3138020	3143860	and whatever the rest of the conscious cosmos gives that's my my view of it so instead of
3143860	3149380	saying that we construct the world we make it up in some mechanistic engineering way which
3149380	3154500	is exactly how the left hemisphere we would think was the only possible way we are in fact
3154500	3160820	if you like midwifing into existence helping to burst something that is natural something
3160820	3169060	that is nature which is that which is always about to be yeah so i want to move on a little bit and
3169140	3179140	um there's this notion this philosophical notion which i think is is true and that is that
3180820	3186740	reason i'm going to use the word reason because rationality is is associated with just like left
3186740	3194580	brain typically that reason is isomorphic to reality in the sense that there's something about
3195540	3202580	human reasoning and i'm not just talking about the brain but you can unpack this that is
3204020	3211700	isomorphic to reality such that there is the possibility for a direct attunement let's say
3213380	3215300	yes and um
3217620	3222660	and so that's the first question and if you can speak to that then there's a question just to
3222660	3230900	build after after that to kind of yes i think that's a wonderful observation and i certainly
3230900	3236180	believe this and i think i've made it myself and in a way it was what einstein was saying when he
3236180	3245620	said what is so wonderful and so unexpected is that the world is understandable why should the
3245620	3252340	world be understandable by our minds and the idea that our minds um
3254580	3261140	would evolve naturally to understand the world is not necessarily correct it might have adopted
3261140	3270260	various kind of um entirely false positions for a while um in order to deal with a certain situation
3270260	3277460	but over time our understanding of the world has increased i mean we i'm not saying that we
3279220	3284340	most of us in in the modern world are making the best of that fact but there is something heroic
3284340	3290820	about the degree to which over thousands of years we have come to understand more and more of the world
3290820	3298340	and the world is um as david deutch says speaking to us in english i mean he means if english is your
3298340	3303780	natural language why is it that when you approach the world the world speaks to in your own language
3303780	3309940	which is another way of putting einstein's remark about extraordinary fact and i think what this
3309940	3318660	gives us is the opportunity to trust what reason tells us not as you say i make this distinction
3318660	3323540	between it's not really one that's a core english distinction but we have to have two different
3323540	3327780	words for it one is for simply the following of rules and procedures in the way that computer
3327780	3332900	would and the other is tempering all that with the wisdom that comes from experience
3332900	3337860	the understanding of context and so on and so forth in fact what a wise judge would do you know
3337860	3342340	you're talking about wisdom and wisdom and interestingly judges are being more and more
3342340	3347380	constrained by mechanical sets of rules and procedures so that they're no longer free
3347380	3354900	to use um wisdom that they've acquired over an arduous training and and decades of experience
3354900	3361460	so that's what i say is that these things are naturally resonant and i do also believe the
3361460	3366900	imagination is like this and unfortunately we haven't got time to go into that enormous topic
3366900	3373060	of what is imagination but with courage and with shelling and so forth i take the imagination to
3373060	3379300	be a faculty which enables us to be in touch with reality beyond the things that we can reason about
3380180	3385300	it's not fantasy which takes us away from reality he makes a very strong distinction
3385300	3390820	between fantasy and imagination and imagination on the other hand is our one chance of actually
3391780	3398260	feeling our way into the inside of the world and experiencing it yeah that's that's beautiful
3398260	3406740	so my last question actually somebody asked me to tag on and that is so we have this notion that
3406740	3413700	reason is isomorphic with the world so there's a possibility for not only attunement but
3414420	3421460	yeah for deep mutuality um so the question and then is what is the relationship between
3422260	3428980	goodness and reason because it's a little hard tricky to say they're isomorphic
3428980	3439780	um well we're talking in a different way than we were about whether reason is isomorphic with
3439780	3446820	reality or perhaps even with truth i i distinguish between different kinds of meaning of truth
3447540	3453620	one being something abstract that we have an analytic past towards and we get closer and
3453620	3459540	finally we get it and a different one which is a form of attunement of coming together of meeting
3459540	3466340	of resonating a completely different kind of sense of truth and of course the word truth has
3466340	3472740	as a core this idea of being true to something of surfaces being true to one another as a carpenter
3472740	3478820	says or a couple being true to one another if they love one another so it is about a relationship
3478820	3487860	that is that is truthful and real and goodness um well all i would say is that reason is obviously
3488580	3496100	another tool that we can use in helping work out what is good but it shouldn't be the only
3496100	3503220	or the limiting tool because there is very much more to goodness than calculation and one of the
3503220	3510900	things that um i i write about in chapter 26 i think is the way in which in academe in the west
3511940	3517700	the philosophy of utilitarianism has more or less ousted every other kind of way of thinking about
3517700	3525220	what is naturally good and the odd thing is that what is being praised is a way of thinking which
3525220	3532900	is archetypally not good in moral to always calculate about things is is immoral and often
3532900	3539700	leads you to um horrible conclusions that it's okay to kill one person in order to um harvest
3539700	3546180	their organs and give them to five other people awaiting transplants for example so um reason
3546180	3553220	has a dual aspect as it's there often that it can be extremely helpful but if used in a rigid
3553300	3558420	fashion it approximates what people who are mentally ill do with it people who have frontal
3558420	3564020	they've damaged right hemisphere damage who are psychopaths and who have schizophrenia all have
3564020	3571620	in common that their idea of morality is based on rationalizing calculations whereas i hope that most
3571620	3578900	of the rest of us see it in a broader sense yeah that was the trick i think now that i now i
3578900	3586500	understand it thank you very much because what what what was the tension in his question was
3586500	3592740	in the assumption that goodness is utility right so that he it was like well when i'm
3592740	3600820	reason when i reason i don't always get the good but i but that was more like he yeah so now i
3600820	3609700	understand what that tension was but when i reason and i don't get what i want it may be
3609700	3616900	the good and so then you start to see that there is the potential for more attunement between reason
3616900	3623380	and the good versus reason and then thinking of the good as a utility especially an ego
3623380	3628820	referential utility so that was that was very helpful thank you very much i knew there was a
3628820	3634420	thank you that kind of tension where there's an assumption that is yeah yeah creating the
3634420	3641780	tension in the question so yeah thank you very much thank you bonnie and um i hope you mind
3641780	3647060	if i come in yes you could you can uh i'm aware of bonnie that another question might come to you
3647060	3654420	as you're um you know watching the questions that follow um but i want to give a chance for
3654420	3659780	the audience to come in now um before that i just want to i want to ask you one question
3660820	3664900	um about something bonnie alluded to earlier vis-a-vis what's at stake here
3665620	3673700	um because we don't often flesh this out you know the source of the sense of mattering
3674580	3682260	um because you know there's a certain intuition about moral acts and our proximity about good
3682260	3687220	behavior with our peers and then our society and then you get into the health of the planet
3687220	3690980	you might think about the cosmos you might think about the ultimate nature of reality
3690980	3695940	you might even wonder about life on other planets and other forms of intelligent life as many do
3697140	3702020	and i say all of that because i've noticed between the two of you a sort of difference in tenor
3702740	3711220	um if i can if it's i think it's reasonable to say that in you um although there's you you
3711220	3716100	offer a great deal of uh emphasis on beauty and love and goodness and there's a great deal of
3716100	3721460	positivity in your work it's also true that you lament a great deal about the world and there's a
3721460	3730340	a certain um spirit of let's say melancholy about about how things are turning out and a sort of
3730340	3736100	urgency to to redirect things and we perceive them as the premise of your work bonnie with us
3736180	3740900	sense something altogether more chipper at something altogether more kind of lively and
3740900	3745620	playful and i don't know i don't want to sort of make this too personal but i am just trying to
3745620	3751780	get at this idea of you know when we what's at stake are we talking about the end of human
3751780	3757300	habitation on planet earth are we talking about um the capacity to destroy ourselves with
3757300	3764020	exponential technology are we talking about the intrinsic value of things that will be destroyed
3764020	3770500	pointlessly can you give me some sense when you this question of what's at stake both of you please
3770500	3776420	like what's your sense of um why we should care about any of this if i can ask such a
3777780	3783540	big context question like ultimately at the end of these searches what are we trying to protect
3783540	3788420	what are we trying to safeguard what is it that actually matters to you both and i think even
3788500	3792340	years will be more more familiar to people so i'm going to come to bonnie first
3794020	3802980	it's a great question um so for me i'm trying to say i'm trying to
3805460	3813380	say don't think what's at stake in the future don't worry about what's coming don't take what
3813380	3821220	we're saying and and draw it out in a narrative arc and figure out what's going to be left right
3823140	3831060	we just be with reality right now every single person alive is going to die is that a crisis
3831060	3837220	it's just just you know what i'm saying if i put it within all the middle crisis and everybody
3837220	3844660	will die you have a different reality to it if we put it in right here now what's at stake
3845220	3855140	is every person in this call could be deeply wedded with reality deeply feel belonging to the earth
3856340	3864980	feel the generosity of having been given a life experience the beauty of the perceptual world
3865700	3872100	um when you listen to read ian's writing on music
3873700	3882740	that people don't have those experiences anymore they completely robbed of who people are
3883780	3891620	the fantastic joy and voyage of being a human being is not present in people's lives
3892500	3900660	they don't know how to get to it this is what's at stake and in young people
3902180	3908660	there's a struggle because they haven't yet forgotten something
3910820	3919380	and um you know used to be when i worked with young adults going through the individuation
3919380	3926260	stage let's say their problems were like problems with the intergenerational change
3926260	3932420	between their families different how societies conventions like change now they say things like
3932420	3939380	when i was seven i felt like i was hooked up to a machine that was sucking out my blood
3939380	3946740	this is like the the metaphors that seven year olds use like it's so bad now that young people
3946740	3952900	who are still kind of like organisms and then they don't blame their parents because they're like
3952900	3958580	their parents are sucked into the machine you know they use these metaphors it's extraordinary how
3959620	3968180	poignant the lack of world living world is for them and so for me what i think what's at stake is
3968180	3978820	you know trying to connect with young people make a world for them but right here and now
3979460	3988420	all the things that you may imagine were possible are possible
3990900	3997460	as long as you're still a living breathing organism and people don't believe that anymore
3998420	4006980	thank you bonnie and um it's lovely to hear you say that i've heard you say similar things but
4006980	4012420	great to hear it again um you know makes me think of the unmaking of the world again are we to
4012420	4018100	understand that the world is inevitably being unmade that it has to be unmade for it to be
4018100	4021860	remade or that we're called in some sense to protect what is already made
4022420	4030420	well i think what i'm saying is is that we are in the process of unmaking the world not
4030420	4036740	that it has to and not that it can't be reversed or but that we are we're simply unmaking it
4037540	4042820	and and that's the the predicament we find ourselves in and that's not i can't just to
4042820	4047780	be clear there's some people who the reason i asked that question in that way is there are
4047780	4054500	some people who want to tear it all down you know i have met people of persuasion and are they
4054500	4061300	entirely wrong i mean how how do you see this quite simply anybody who wants to just tear down
4061300	4070180	a civilization or tear down a world is is crazy foolish arrogant and what we need to do is to
4070180	4077540	work with what is in fact as i say not a machine but an organism to change the parts that we feel
4077540	4084980	need to be changed and to respect the wholeness of it and i find myself um after your um perfectly
4084980	4093620	accurate portrayal of me as a miserable old git i find myself i find myself curiously more um
4093620	4101700	optimistic perhaps than um bonita in that uh i don't think that people lack all these things
4101700	4108580	i mean i'm i'm sure she's right that the world is a much less hospitable place than it was for
4108580	4115060	finding these things for being encouraged to to to nourish oneself on them and we're offering
4115060	4122180	children a diet of gruel and which is a great shame but but there'll always be people who
4122180	4127940	will gravitate towards the magnificence of what the you know what there is and who will see life
4127940	4135780	as you and i i think both see it as an awe-inspiring gift and and that this is a very important
4136420	4142260	way to be i i often think you know if you say what do we do and this is a famously difficult
4142260	4148820	question to answer but i was thinking that there would be some value in saying pray
4150100	4156100	and what i wouldn't mean by that is well the only thing that's left open to us now is to pray
4156100	4160740	and hope that there's some divine being that will change it all that's not at all what i mean
4160740	4170980	what i mean is by adopting a devout and awe-filled compassionate vision of the world not striving
4170980	4178580	to know alter take and all the rest but actually so first of all to understand is in all its awe
4178580	4185140	inspiring complexity and that if we did that a lot of things would start happening differently
4185140	4191620	because so much of what's wrong is due to simple hubris the pronouncements of people who
4191620	4196100	think we can do it all and only a few more tweaks and we'll be able to achieve this that and the
4196100	4202260	other well this is this is how things get destroyed it's in all the old mythologies
4202260	4209860	the the arrogant know-it-all upstart who doesn't realize what he's destroying and becomes that
4210740	4217300	demi-edge that that brings the cosmos to ruin so that that's that's my thinking about that
4217300	4224980	i'm not surprised though that you ask jonathan so what is it that is worth saving or what is it
4224980	4230260	that we're trying to save because surely the answer to that is everything that inspires in us love
4230260	4238420	and beauty and and it speaks to us of all these things that are so life-enhancing i mean you can
4238420	4244020	live in a world in which everything is is is bleak meaningless pointless i mean you can create
4244020	4249860	that for yourself but don't kid yourself that that's necessarily the reality you can also live in a
4249860	4259220	world where you are maximally responsive to what is what is good beautiful and true and and worthy
4259220	4264900	of our love and respect and and that don't get me wrong good beautiful and true there's a reason
4264900	4269300	we have three different words they're not interchangeable with one another they sometimes
4269300	4275140	conflict with one another but nonetheless they have this family relationship with one another
4275700	4280980	in which all these positives come together they don't have to be mechanically related they don't
4280980	4286580	they hasn't doesn't have to be an algorithm saying go to beauty then if this then go to good or it
4286580	4293300	just doesn't work like that i got a lot out of that answer because um you know to be maximally
4293380	4298820	responsive to the possibility of love or those weren't your words but but but paraphrasing the
4298820	4306260	idea of being maximally responsive to what is good beautiful and true um is what's at stake in some
4306260	4312020	sense and also reminds me in one back in the day at one at some seminar or event you were at
4312020	4315460	i once remember writing something down quickly because the turn of phrase was so beautiful when
4315460	4322100	you put it you said that life is life is a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness
4322100	4327220	and you said it off the bat as if it was one of many lines but i'd love that particular formulation
4327220	4332500	a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness with that thought i want to bring in
4332500	4338420	the others now the the technicalities of what's about to follow are not altogether trivial so
4338420	4345860	please pay attention and if you have a question you'd like to answer ask and please type it in the
4345860	4351700	chat while also putting your hand up it's a double whammy we're asking you to do both because it
4351700	4357140	helps us to find you you might think it's just self-evident but we are we do have a 380 participants
4357140	4362580	and we can only see them on a relatively small screen a certain number at a time so if you raise
4362580	4369300	your hand through the reactions icon i believe um or at least one of the icons down below while
4369300	4374100	simultaneously typing your question um in some cases we'll ask you to speak it in some cases we'll
4374100	4382020	read it out um also let me say this quite important point um we're very keen to hear from all kinds of
4382020	4390340	people um that i mean men and women i mean young and old um and so if if you're in any doubt about
4390340	4396740	answering asking a question um can i particularly encourage you to do so if you're feeling that
4396740	4401780	you're somewhat uncomfortable or not too sure if you should um we're very keen to get from here from
4401860	4408260	a wider variety of people as possible and we'll do everything we can to make that happen okay with
4408260	4414100	that thought in mind i'm going to look at the google doc that michael has helpfully prepared for me
4417860	4422180	um and i'll take a take one and while you're asked while you're answering i'll look for others
4427380	4428420	okay um
4429220	4438580	um the questions so far are very technical um but actually there's one here from jane's van
4438580	4444340	leuwen which i think is a good one it's a direct message he says um and this comes to the premise
4444340	4452340	of tonight's talk is there a root mass delusion um is there something is there some i think that
4452340	4457780	it's i understand the question he's trying to get a um is there something inherent like a premise
4457780	4466500	or an axiom or a fundamental part of the delusion that we need to take stock of collectively
4466500	4471380	and if so what is it and that's initially a question for ian while i look through the other questions
4474660	4482820	well i i suppose that um i would say inevitably that the there is a core
4483780	4492340	mass delusion which is indoctrination into the vision of the world which is delivered to us by
4492340	4499060	the left hemisphere untempered or relatively untempered by the right and so which is one
4499060	4508260	orientated towards um greed gain power i mean effectively it's about power and control
4509220	4516180	and it's lost intellectual subtlety because the left hemisphere doesn't have much intellectual
4516180	4523300	subtlety and is literally less intelligent than the right it also has no nowhere near
4523300	4531700	the understanding of social and emotional matters of intelligence and so inevitably once this
4532180	4539300	this way of thinking becomes the standard way in which all discourses is carried on in the public
4539300	4547300	sphere and children are brought up no longer to believe in or take pleasure in all the the beautiful
4547300	4553380	things that are now associated with the past because we've now moved into this brave new world
4553380	4559220	where we we have technical machines we don't need to read literature and look at painting and listen
4559220	4568260	to music and do drama and all the other things or for goodness sake develop some kind of spiritual
4568260	4577380	sense of something beyond you know that's if we're like that then that is it is a mass delusion
4577940	4586660	which will lead to great unhappiness conflict and and destruction the destruction of the valuable
4586660	4594180	that's what i see around me people at loggerheads much more than they were um 30 years ago interestingly
4594180	4600660	the relationships between all the societal groups that are now so strictly policed and and and
4600660	4607060	boundaryed and so on have become worse rather than better through this process so anyway there we are
4608340	4612420	okay thank you bonnie do you have a direct answer to that question or should we take some more
4612420	4623620	questions i think that um if you want to think of root um causes or or the root problem i think
4623620	4631460	it's one of fragmentation in alienation at all scales so um the the left hemisphere wants to
4631460	4638420	analytical analytically reduce something to study it and so it feels fragmented and separated
4639140	4647300	we feel that matter is different than life and in a kind of alienated way we feel that humans
4647300	4653700	are separate from nature we feel individualistic we feel our countries are separate and sovereign
4653700	4660420	so this whole notion i guess the left brain thinks it's separate from the right brain i would say
4660420	4667540	that the lack and loss of any kind of sense of understanding a deep continuity at all levels
4668260	4675780	vertical and um vertical dimensions and horizontal dimensions uh could characterize the
4676420	4681540	the sum total of the problem okay thank you bonnie i'd like to see a question from lisa
4681540	4687460	maros maroski if i said that correctly lisa you're welcome to ask it yourself but yeah there you go
4687460	4696020	hi uh thank you for hosting these wonderful talks i've really enjoyed them um the context
4696020	4705140	for my question um to to both of you is imagine is the imagination so i'm not really looking for
4705940	4714180	a factual response um but given uh as you've said that the world is an organism
4714420	4725860	and yet is being unmade uh are there models such as uh the caterpillar becoming butterfly that
4725860	4739380	uh barbremark's hubbert refers to um that uh you know show us um or could help us understand what is
4739940	4750660	what is happening to us um help us get through this process of unmaking and remaking um and
4752100	4764100	and then second to that what might be we what might we be remade into like as the next phase
4764100	4773620	of evolution um my my own hunch is that endosymbiosis might give us a clue um but not the answer
4775860	4782580	so so this is an imaginative question thank you very much and bonnie i know you might have an
4782580	4788340	angle on the butterfly uh caterpillar metaphor from a piece of writing that i'm familiar with
4788900	4791140	um ian if you have any thoughts initially
4794740	4804340	well um the the caterpillar butterfly flightings is is extraordinary in in nature and as we know
4804340	4809700	the butterfly actually has a completely different genome from the caterpillar so what one's seeing
4809700	4817540	there is a transmogrification what um what i think i'm being asked to do is to say what this
4817620	4825140	butterfly is going to be like and um how we can bring about its release and and i first of all
4825140	4832500	what it what it is like i will be extremely cautious in predicting because i do believe
4832500	4840420	that one of the glories of existence is that things are not determined fully and that we when
4840420	4848100	we predict the future we are very often wrong so i i i would resist being asked to make any
4848100	4853860	prediction about that i mean although i have my own hunches which are limited by my imagination
4853860	4862500	which are that probably some people will survive and will survive by leading much more simple
4862500	4868820	modest lives closer to nature and closer to one another than our human lives have become
4868820	4876020	um so i i i don't know quite how to exercise the imagination that you are asking me to exercise
4876020	4882180	except that i guess that my books are i hope works of an imagination and that i appeal
4882820	4889060	to many great works of art and literature to illustrate my my drift but i i think i'm not
4889060	4894900	entirely in tune with the the drift behind that there's a little thrust behind that question
4895700	4899300	thank you ian and bonnie i want you to answer this because i know you've got a great take on
4899300	4903460	this but while i'm doing that if celeste flavan could put her hand up please because i want to
4903460	4908820	take your question but we can't find you um after this but bonnie first of all on uh
4909620	4916260	caterpillar butterfly and what lies between yeah i'll start with that but i wanted to answer
4916260	4924660	the question also in a larger context so um we and i think this is a little bit
4925220	4930580	building on what ian said is that we can't we we shouldn't imagine that the caterpillar
4930580	4936580	imagines itself to be a butterfly it's much more scary than that right like if we if we
4936580	4944900	had to voluntarily go through the metamorphosis process without understanding it um that would
4944900	4955220	truly be an act of imagination um to be to be open and welcome and inviting surprise um but you
4955220	4960900	said something beautiful you talked about endo i think endo symbiosis and what i wanted to say
4960900	4968740	is there's many places where people are using their imaginations to thread a different story
4969300	4978260	through the scientific facts so ian uses scientific facts any any threads a beautiful
4978260	4985940	story and other people can use the same facts and they'll thread a different story um and so we need
4985940	4993060	all all science is based on what are called interaction metaphors they're deep metaphorical
4993460	5001700	um assumptions about the way things are and what we need are people who are uh understand the science
5001700	5009860	and using it to thread a different story um and so that actually separates i think imagination
5009860	5016180	from fantasy so that's that's one thing and the work on counterfactuals is very important so
5016180	5024340	you might say but what if what if the Darwinian attitude of the survival of the fittest
5024340	5032260	and complex adaptive systems is not true is there a story that threads the same evidence
5033540	5041780	that is more aligned with goodness truth and beauty so i've done that in writing speculative
5041860	5048260	philosophy on complex potential states it takes into account everything that the Darwinian attitude
5048260	5055460	takes into account but it tells a different story so endosymbiosis is one of those great
5055460	5062340	imaginative things that are emerging in our culture that want to be true to the science
5062980	5068500	but understand that there's a different story that can thread it and that's a power the
5068500	5074660	imagination and the other thing i'm going to say that is something that i think is
5074660	5082260	we should do i see there's a question of education um there's something called empathic projection
5082260	5088740	and kids do it really well when they're young and that is they imagine what it might be like
5088740	5095780	to be a pencil and they imagine what it might be like to be an ant and they imagine and in this
5096660	5103540	experience it's not like fantasy where you go away from the world you enter the spaces in
5103540	5115860	between the world that you don't understand and this is a valuable exercise in um in becoming
5115860	5124180	attuned to the reality of things and nature and animals so it's the process of the imagination
5124180	5129860	it's called empathic projection thank you bonnie i'm just going to get other questions in um
5129860	5134020	celeste you're welcome to ask it yourself if you're happy to do that i think we find you now
5142500	5147460	can we hear you i'm not sure we can hear you i can see you but maybe your volume's not on or
5147460	5154420	what's the shall i just ask it for you are you ready to go yeah okay thumbs up okay i can ask
5154420	5159540	it for you well thank you celeste it was really a question about poetry i'll i'll it's to do with
5159540	5165540	precision of language being a kind of antidote i'm going to get the exact wording here um
5166660	5173140	what celeste asked here we go can language especially that which is used with extraordinary
5173140	5180260	deliberation and care i.e poetry be an antidote to this wide-scale delusion can we use the tool
5180260	5187140	that makes us feel tethered to our humaneness to combat feelings of robotic or uninsuitive
5187140	5193860	existence so you can already see the poet in the question um i'm assuming the answer might be yes
5193860	5201060	but what's the what's the sort of bigger answer it's very much yes i i would say um
5202580	5208980	and it's interesting this idea of the carefully considered uh or precise because of course
5210260	5217460	both here and in science there is this interplay between the the precise and the imaginative which
5217540	5224900	which means that although in science you're working with something that seems very strict
5224900	5230820	in its structure in fact the discoveries come through the exercise of intuition and imagination
5230820	5236980	there's just so many examples of this in the history of mathematics and science and something similar
5238180	5243780	um could be said of course about poetry but what i was alerted to by your question was the idea
5244740	5249460	there's a certain sort of precision involved as well and that we need to be precise
5251700	5255380	as the situation will allow us to be but not a wit more than that
5256340	5263620	otherwise there is a word that is precisely right because it opens itself to a number of
5263620	5270100	possibilities being experienced or felt at the same time so the great thing about poetic language
5270100	5280740	is its ability to be single and multiple at once this is really a theme that should be throughout
5280740	5289300	everything we've talked about this evening that i feel at some points there was a tendency to say
5289300	5296580	that you know it's bad that there are individuals um but i'm sure that wasn't what was was was meant
5296580	5303220	by bonita um but but individuals are terrifically important what's important is that the distinction
5303220	5313780	and the um um the differences don't imply a severance in fact they imply a something bigger
5313780	5319860	out of which they come and to which they contribute in turn so it's always this alliance of division
5319860	5328180	with union of the individuation with togetherness and integration and so i would say that poetry is
5328180	5334580	an example of this because in poetry we are trying to bring together or not trying but
5334580	5340420	allowing things that are multiple to come together in our minds in a very clear and
5340420	5346020	precise way that if you've changed a little bit of it would ruin it so it has a very individual
5346020	5352820	existence but it arises from a process which is unconscious and which is about the coming together
5352820	5359700	of the many into the one thank you ian bonita don't have to add to that if you don't want to
5359700	5366340	but you're welcome to okay i am i know it's a beautiful answer but there's a lot of questions
5367380	5373860	thank you bonita i'm madalina machado a great question you're welcome to ask it yourself
5373860	5378980	or give me a thumbs up if you're happy for me to ask it but you're welcome to you i'd rather you
5378980	5382740	asked it much rather you asked it you can do it yeah so you're unmuted now you're welcome to go ahead
5385140	5395780	well um i'm i'm actually quoting gregory baitson he says this question what have we here um 400
5395780	5403300	plus people on a zoom call is this not radically new what sense does it make to speak of what we've
5403380	5411940	lost does this mostly apply to accidentals and a cosmo vision of domination which is now
5411940	5420420	eroding is it not about time we learn planetary interdependency for the first time together
5420980	5427460	as online ancestors because we're all online ancestors this is basically 10 years old
5428340	5435460	this duality of technology versus life is manachistic nothing on this planet is not natural
5436100	5444660	there's nothing not natural as spinoza said the 24 years old 400 years ago with the printing press
5444660	5451380	we began propaganda propaganda pd that was the Vatican now we are in a participatory age for
5451380	5457780	the first time ever can we give ourselves permission not to know and honestly this is what
5457780	5467700	i feel bonita is teaching at the pop-up school which i've joined and it has for me for example
5467700	5475220	i'll just add one little footnote in the two p language in the amazon there's no word for sin
5475220	5483700	there's no word for temptation there's no word for kingdom i mean what would our language
5484740	5495540	be languaging had those concepts not you know abducted our capacity to think differently
5496340	5503460	thank you wow well i would love to ask you some questions medelina another time maybe
5503460	5505380	but for now ian do you want to respond to that
5510900	5514100	bonnie you ian if you want to pause for some thought bonnie do you have a more immediate
5514100	5521700	response yeah because i i think it ties into the previous question on poesis so she so medelina
5521700	5530020	is saying what would our language be like and i think um you know there's poetic language
5530900	5541380	is a contemplation on ideas or things that language seems to contradict right so how can
5541380	5549140	everything already be nature and is nature then destroying itself is nature unmaking the world
5549140	5555140	is like the question if everything's nature then isn't this just make nature unmaking the world
5555140	5562100	and i think this kind of tension if you sit with it in a certain way so you so you have
5562100	5571860	both trust and doubt and belief and skepticism and confidence in the in the intellect the
5571860	5579060	intelligence of the world and humility then something like poetry comes out and we might
5579060	5585780	imagine that that's something that shares with earlier languages so i would say that
5586420	5591220	that's that's how it seemed to me that as the question came up right after the last question
5594500	5602340	ian i wasn't really quite sure what the question was i i heard that we that we were in a more
5602340	5607860	positive way we could communicate with one another and so on then there was a sudden remark about
5607860	5613060	the word sin which by the way not only in the toupee language but also across many parts of
5613060	5622180	the world there isn't such a word um but what am i supposed to okay if i if i dare give my own
5622180	5626980	interpretation the reason i chose medellina's question it it actually was it was it reminded
5626980	5632580	me of a colleague and friend idra adnan who was on a zoom call a bit like this one with several
5632580	5636900	hundred people from across the world and one of the speakers was lamenting how disconnected we
5636900	5640660	all are all were how how we've lost connection with each other and she's saying what the hell
5640660	5644900	are you talking about look at this extraordinary process that we're part of who knows where this
5644900	5649700	might lead this is the beginning of something amazing and we should all get over ourselves and
5649700	5655140	stop complaining and start using the technology we have to you know reckon with the no doubt
5655140	5661300	profound problems we have um but also to trust that something is emerging that's of great value
5661300	5665940	and promise um and as i understand medellina's question i think she's just using that as a
5665940	5671220	counterweight to the sense that the things are inevitably collapsing something is also arising
5672420	5679860	that that is right and if we could find a way of using the interconnecting capacity sparingly
5679860	5686820	when it is really important and not allowing all the dross that comes with it to drown out the good
5686820	5693700	then that would be a marvelous thing but i remember when i went to johns hopkins in in 1922
5695860	5705780	1922 1992 i'm not that in 1992 um we were i was in a in a in a lab um looking at scans
5707300	5713940	of brains and the head of the department came in and said you guys are great you know work you're
5713940	5720580	doing is great but you know what we need is more communication and i was already aware that in
5720580	5728980	england had started this sort of over communicative style and in america it was already a huge problem
5728980	5735300	people spent so much time um recording communicating and so on that the actual business of what they
5735300	5741220	were doing got somehow left behind and i said actually what we need is to communicate less
5741220	5747140	but to communicate when it's really important so i do think this is a i'm not saying this just to be
5747140	5755220	sort of a bit flippant um there is a huge problem with what technology is doing to our attention
5755220	5761140	it is it is fighting for our attention which has been monetized and destroying our attention
5761140	5767220	is destroying our intelligence destroying our capacity to imagine it is degrading at the level
5767220	5773700	of our experience and the being so this is a worry to me i i love the fact that we're all
5773700	5781620	here on this call and so it's best to focus on the good bits and um but but there are mighty
5781620	5788260	problems as well and and and also i'd just like to say in the way that the coincidence of opposites
5788260	5794580	works is that if there is too much cacophony and too much actually people fall out with one another
5794580	5800660	and don't actually become closer to one another it's a really difficult one to to call that life
5800660	5806980	is complex it's not just a simple question of there being more or less communication what is
5806980	5813220	the quality of that communication is a very important question can i just follow up i think
5813220	5820820	i think to put it short i think um i think communication like this is neither necessary
5820820	5830740	nor sufficient for to to stop the unmaking of the world and so when but it can be helpful or it
5830740	5837860	can be harmful but to think that it's either necessary or sufficient i think is is both of
5837860	5846500	those are a mistake um and i agree with you and the the the the cost in general is currently
5846500	5854420	out outweighing the benefit the new the new chipper non-hyperaclitian ian says um well it's
5854420	5861140	it's not um uh sufficient but it might might be necessary to have these sorts of conversations
5861860	5869140	but i mean technology technology yeah okay well i i do like the i do like the chipper ian as you
5869140	5875300	know um listen um there were i can i encourage everyone here to please take a look at the chat
5876020	5880100	um because there are some mind-blowingly good questions in there and i'm really very grateful
5880100	5887300	for all of them um back in the day when i worked at the rsa i um i chaired quite a lot of events
5887300	5892020	and before i started doing that matthew taylor who was the chief executive at the time taught me
5892020	5897140	that it's always better to end an event leaving people wanting more rather than drag on with
5897140	5902180	further questions even though there are great questions to come so i'm going to leave leave
5902180	5906580	you with that thought and end now um i'm very grateful for all the questions that haven't been
5907380	5912180	aired but they are there in the chat you can write them down we will take note of them they
5912180	5917540	may come up again i notice some about education about parenting about love great stuff there will
5917540	5924660	be more there will be another of these events um in two weeks and another two weeks after that and
5924660	5930180	another two weeks after that watch this space for more information um there's also a connection
5930180	5935060	and inquiry session as i say um those of those of you on this event will now be signed up the
5935060	5939700	perspective as mailing list so you will hear from us about all of those things very shortly
5941060	5944260	but i really want to just thank you all for being there it's been a great attendance
