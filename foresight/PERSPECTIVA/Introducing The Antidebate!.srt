1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, welcome everybody to this evening's anti-debate.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,600
As you know, I'm Jonathan Rouson, I'm Director of Prospectiva and the anti-debate process

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,560
has been funded by the John Templeton Foundation to give us two years to create this thing.

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,140
And we're currently a few months into that, so what you're about to observe is a kind

5
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,120
of toddler rather than a fully fledged adolescent or adult.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,840
It's something in the process of creation, but let me say a little bit at the beginning

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,520
before we start about why we're doing it and what it's about.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
It has its place.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,680
The debate can be beautiful, edifying, it's often a spectacle, a clash, entertaining,

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,640
it's often very enlivening, it's done well, it can even be informative.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,000
But sadly, the way the world is today, there's many structural incentives towards polarization

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,080
built into the way we get our information, not just our papers, but the channels we watch,

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,320
the social media feeds that we have algorithmically being done to us, means that on any given

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,440
issue we're less likely to see it in the round and more likely to see it in a way that reinforces

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
our biases.

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,280
So we're in a phase of history where divergence and bifurcation and disagreement is actually

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,240
being compounded and exacerbated by the systems and structures that prevail.

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,280
And this is a big deal because democracies or even any functioning form of government

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,760
that includes people relies on a capacity to discuss adequately what's going on.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,160
It relies on a sense-making process, if you like, a meaning-making process.

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,680
And debate was the sort of high end of what it was like to observe a culture talking to

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
itself.

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
So there will be a future for debate.

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,640
It's not that we're against all forms of it, but we do think there's a case for trying

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,880
to develop something radically new.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,480
I would say that the key idea to grasp here is that whereas debate is primarily about opposing

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,000
views in which the center of inquiry is somehow in the middle of the room and people are trying

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,280
to figure out who's winning, which side am I on?

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,680
That's sort of debate classically conceived.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,040
But we live in a time where we're all exposed to things that we struggle to make sense of,

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,760
moments where we can't quite agree with ourselves.

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,040
Our values don't always align with our actions.

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Our ideas don't always chime with our values.

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,000
And a lot of what the anti-debates are getting at is that internal struggle.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,800
And it's a struggle you'll see between us on stage, probably, but it's also one we want

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,520
you to experience, too.

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,120
It's about finding your own inner center in a relationship.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,240
So what are we trying to achieve at the end of it?

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,280
It's not some beautiful middle position in which everyone can agree on.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,600
It's not some consensus verdict.

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,480
It's a deeper felt sense of your relationship to the issue of hand.

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,320
And another beauty is that we don't know what the issue is yet.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
We're about to find out.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Thank you.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm going to ask my colleagues here to spend a moment now just going into themselves and

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,400
asking for a provisional question that feels it matters right now, that feels maybe a little

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,560
bit uncomfortable, maybe a little bit pregnant with possibility.

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Would you like to get us going with a provisional question?

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,440
Is this a moment in history?

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Maybe we shouldn't be striving so much.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
If I could put it more bluntly, it's like, should we feel guilty about not being able

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,440
or what is this consternation?

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Elizabeth, how are you feeling about what you're hearing in relation to your question about

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
is fear ever useful?

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
It feels related, but it does feel quite separate.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Or rather, it feels like there's a hearing or a polarity here.

57
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
And they're related because they're about, oh, who do we be?

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,440
What is the state of being we should be seeking?

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
What's come to meaner now?

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Is masculinity the problem?

61
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,440
I just worry that a lot of the conversations we've been having feel quite abstract, maybe.

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,440
And I think I don't mean to pose this question so that we can find the bogeyman and blame

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,440
something, but I feel like we need something tangible to unpack and to look at.

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,440
How are you guys doing with this now as well, in particular?

65
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,440
There's something about my question, which would definitely include this question.

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
There's no question of that.

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
So I'm certainly not attached to my way into the problem.

68
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I think that's another way into the same problem.

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,440
And I'm going to ask, first of all, for a show, a question for Indra's question,

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,440
is this a moment in history asking us to step up?

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
And then let's, oh, we've got a couple here as well.

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
OK, thank you.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So let's now get a show of hands.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Is masculinity the problem?

75
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Show of hands.

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
OK.

77
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,440
So is masculinity the problem we will go with?

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Would anyone in the room just like any kind of clarifications about the question?

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,440
I mean, I guess people have at least a start of 10 on what masculinity is.

80
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Mina, are you happy with the way that the question is framed, as you originally framed it?

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Yeah.

82
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
The question stems from the many discussions that we've been having.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:00,440
So is it the problem for many of the big challenges of the 21st century?

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,440
My sense is that there's sort of two things that are really causing a lot of the problems,

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,440
whether it's the climate emergency or polarization, poverty and inequality, those kinds of things.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
But one is the kind of the economic model that we have.

87
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
It's completely unsustainable.

88
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
We are exploiting our planet.

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,440
We're exploiting ourselves in order to sustain the economic model that reigns.

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,440
And then there's the kind of the model of social, of relationship,

91
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,440
not just social relations between humans, but relationship with ourselves individually,

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,440
with each other, and then with the more than human natural world.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,440
And in both of these, like both relationship and the economic model,

94
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:01,440
I feel as though without reimagining masculinity, which has shaped our largest economies

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,440
and family structures that feed into economies and so on.

96
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,440
And also, I guess, a kind of quest to explore other parts of the world,

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
which has resulted in colonialism and neocolonialism.

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,440
It's men who have done these things and continue to largely lead the world.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:34,440
And also, in so far as our relationships and how we may not be able to express emotions with each other,

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:43,440
how we denounce interiority and always stay on this kind of abstract space.

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,440
And that feels to me like it's actually very connected to how we perceive masculinity.

102
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,440
We have a question now. You have completed the first stage of the anti-debate.

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,440
We didn't know what we were going to talk about 15 minutes ago. Now we do, my goodness.

104
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,440
We're going to invite you to come outside and we're going to create a line where we ask you to

105
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,440
place yourself on this line between yes and no and all that lies between.

106
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,440
So is masculinity the problem now? Yes, we'll be right here on the left

107
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
and then you can place yourself anywhere on that line. That's how you feel.

108
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,440
We're going to add one extra dimension to this. We're going to turn this into an axis.

109
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
We still have yes and no, but then we're going to add,

110
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
do we believe we can make progress on this together this evening?

111
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
And really take a personal note of your own position so that you,

112
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
because later we'll come back to at the end of the process

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
and just to see if we have felt a shift in ourselves.

114
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,440
We want to just get everything in the room that is relevant on the table.

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,440
So if you have a metaphor or a short story that relates to this bigger social issue,

116
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
if you have a strong emotional reaction to it, please say it.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
If this is okay with you guys, I don't think we're going to get into the biology of sex and gender.

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Let's keep that down off my board.

119
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,440
We're talking about masculinity in its kind of broadest cultural sense.

120
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
And I will guide a little bit, but I want to hear from everyone.

121
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,440
So please do not hold back. You don't need to try and be clever.

122
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
That's not what this is about. It's something else.

123
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
The first thing to say is that the question may be sad,

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,440
even though it's about masculinity and not maleness or being a man.

125
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Nonetheless, the first reaction was one of really, can this be true?

126
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
There's such great men out there. Can it really be inherently about masculinity?

127
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
For me, it's more to do with design.

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,440
It's how we've designed a public space and that men have designed a public space in a certain way.

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,440
And it's not holistic. It doesn't really draw on the more complex resources that we have.

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:10,440
If there's a problem, it's the lack of culturally appropriate, sacred initiation into the masculine.

131
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,440
And that's what we lost. And ever since we lost it, patriarchy developed.

132
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,440
And men aren't doing very well. Some of them are killing themselves.

133
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
They're trying to live up to this. Men are depressed.

134
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Men have sacrificed themselves for centuries in wars, running into machine guns and bayonets.

135
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I don't want to because you're opening, so I just want to say that completely.

136
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Patriarchy doesn't do men any favour.

137
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,440
So a better question might be, what does it even mean to be human?

138
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
That goes up there.

139
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,440
The problem is the question.

140
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
The question itself is very masculine.

141
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
A binary.

142
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,440
I had a very strong visceral and personal response to looking at that quality.

143
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,440
And it sort of hues around two significant losses in my life.

144
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,440
The first was my father, who died in a reckless accident, a careless violent accident.

145
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,440
And then 40 years later, my husband hung himself.

146
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,440
And so there's something around that like sort of heedless physicality or bravado.

147
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
These are, particularly my husband, was a lovely sensitive man.

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,440
And whatever made him turn to that kind of violent response.

149
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I mean, I think it works with Michael's sense of the lack of initiation into a whole being.

150
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,440
So I wanted to add violence over here, Marley Charmin and Nina.

151
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
And other things that there is just...

152
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
This is a big thing in the world.

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,440
And it's mainly men who perpetuate it.

154
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,440
But then over here, I want to put education, because I think what I see as the mother of a son.

155
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
And I actually don't think it's shameful to say, as a father of daughters, I get feminism.

156
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Because I think when we encounter people in human relationships, that's how our empathy deepens.

157
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,440
But as a mother of a son, I see the way the education system actually problematises young male

158
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,440
who develop more slowly, generally, and can't sit still and need to run around in general.

159
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,440
And actually the discipline system in schools is problematising masculinity at that age.

160
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,440
The first thing that sprung to my mind was the image of Yin Yang and the movement of one into the other.

161
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,440
And the fact that one contains the other as well.

162
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
And it kind of frapped all the way.

163
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,440
And that describes Sun and Moon or North slope or South slope of the same mountain.

164
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,440
And that, I suppose, to one extent, if you kind of get it back here into balance

165
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,440
and remove the extreme masculinity, the thing that you used to call feminine has its kind of masculine side.

166
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Just with that, I want men to be men and I know that my power is as a female in the feminine.

167
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Perhaps the majority of the things that were coming up and are going on that board

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,440
are still being viewed through a structure of masculinity that is unsaid and largely invisible to us.

169
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:29,440
And that there's this profound absence in our thinking overall about a sort of missing femininity.

170
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
And I mean the feminine principle here, I don't mean women.

171
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Just as there's this extraordinary accumulation of historical absence in the institutions that we're dealing with.

172
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
It's even in our framing of how we speak about this.

173
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Now, I can't take everyone who's got their hands up, so just take a second and think, is this missing on the board?

174
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
I think there's quite a lot missing on the board, so I'll try to just say it as briefly as possible.

175
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,440
But yeah, starting with the question being the problem, I don't think that it is.

176
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:24,440
But one of the clarifications to make again is that, of course, to Dominique's point, masculinity is intersectional, you could say.

177
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:33,440
So it's layered with race and ethnicity and culture and class and all of those kinds of things.

178
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,440
The reason that the question I think is far more important than the question of just human interactions

179
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,440
is because we are talking about things like toxic masculinity and crisis and masculinity.

180
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,440
And even the conversation here in this room has kind of been talking a lot about kind of striving for balance

181
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
and we brought up male pain, if you like.

182
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
And I do want to acknowledge that that exists and it's important to talk about.

183
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,440
But actually, if you really think about it, masculinity and men are thriving.

184
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Men are leading countries. Men are doing less domestic work.

185
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Men are wealthier than women. Men are just incredibly privileged in comparison to women.

186
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,440
So if any group is in or any construct is in crisis or it would be femininity.

187
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm tired of women not having power, not being able to shape our societies, not being able to shape conversations that impact our lives.

188
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm tired of women being raped and abused and killed and beaten up in their homes.

189
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm tired of not seeing women in all of the powerful institutions.

190
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm tired of women not being acknowledged as voices.

191
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm tired of old women being made invisible.

192
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm tired of girls being conditioned to become passive with toys.

193
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm just tired of so many things.

194
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:09,440
And what I'm tired of of all perhaps is that men are not talking really about how masculinity is the problem.

195
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
And so women once again have to do even that.

196
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm just tired of those conversations not happening and yet there is so much pain and so much suffering for women

197
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
because masculinity and not humanity is the problem.

198
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Thank you so much. Thank you for being honest and bringing your feelings.

199
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Sorry, Michael. I'm going to just call a halt.

200
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,440
If there's anything I could say to help at the end or if the question.

201
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,440
I just, I think it's been really useful somehow.

202
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I hope everybody else felt that way but I just think that we should not leave this space and leave the question behind.

203
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Okay, so this is after the entry debate.

204
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,440
We're now sort of reconfiguring our positions on this question and we have two axes basically.

205
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,440
We have an axis on the existing question, is masculinity the problem?

206
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,440
And if it's a yes, it's over here and if it's a no, it's over here.

207
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,440
And now we have another dimension which is about our chance of making progress on this question in the wider world.

208
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,440
And if it's a yes, it's in that direction and if it's a no, it's in that direction.

209
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,440
In other words, you have to find yourself across two axes,

210
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,440
both where you are on the issue and how constant you are that we can make progress on it.

211
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
So for me, I'm somewhat towards the yes but quite close to the middle.

212
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
And after that debate, after the entry debate, which went, I feel quite well,

213
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,440
I'm inclined to move backwards towards the yes.

214
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,440
And I feel like I'm about happy here.

215
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Thank you for being part of the first public anti-debate.

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I can add a couple of things. One is that, as you know, it's still in its early stages,

217
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
but it has very different principles.

218
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
It's involving the audience in a certain way.

219
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
It's bringing in emotions in a certain way.

220
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,440
It's taking quite a lot of time to get the question right so that we feel a shared investment in the inquiry.

221
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,440
It's stopping to check with the question holder about whether they sent the energy that they brought into the room

222
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
as being honoured in the right way.

223
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,440
And it's also about finding the disagreement within ourselves, not just between each other,

224
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,440
but also our own grappling, our own dissonance, our own sense of struggle.

225
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Because if the question is a good question, we're likely to feel somewhat conflicted about it.

226
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,440
And the anti-debate is about giving each of us a chance to feel that we can make some kind of progress

227
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,440
within ourselves as well as in the shared context, what we might call collective individuation,

228
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
something that we get closer to our own sense of who we are because of the question asked

229
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
and because we're sharing it together.

230
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
And that's the beginning of the anti-debate.

231
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Future trinkets and alterations might include bringing in a longer spell.

232
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
As we felt there, there was more to be said.

233
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
It could last a whole day even, potentially.

234
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Some feel not, but we're discussing that.

235
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Someone to bring in metaphor to have a phase where we talk only about metaphor.

236
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Someone to improvise a little bit more.

237
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Someone a bit more ding-dong and a bit more clash.

238
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
But for now, we're pretty happy that we have a template to work with,

239
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
and I thank you all very much for joining us.

240
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Thank you.
