0	28000	Okay, welcome everybody to this evening's anti-debate.
28000	35600	As you know, I'm Jonathan Rouson, I'm Director of Prospectiva and the anti-debate process
35600	40560	has been funded by the John Templeton Foundation to give us two years to create this thing.
40560	44140	And we're currently a few months into that, so what you're about to observe is a kind
44140	48120	of toddler rather than a fully fledged adolescent or adult.
48120	51840	It's something in the process of creation, but let me say a little bit at the beginning
51840	57520	before we start about why we're doing it and what it's about.
57520	58520	It has its place.
58520	64680	The debate can be beautiful, edifying, it's often a spectacle, a clash, entertaining,
64680	69640	it's often very enlivening, it's done well, it can even be informative.
69640	76000	But sadly, the way the world is today, there's many structural incentives towards polarization
76000	82080	built into the way we get our information, not just our papers, but the channels we watch,
82080	87320	the social media feeds that we have algorithmically being done to us, means that on any given
87320	92440	issue we're less likely to see it in the round and more likely to see it in a way that reinforces
92440	93440	our biases.
93440	99280	So we're in a phase of history where divergence and bifurcation and disagreement is actually
99280	106240	being compounded and exacerbated by the systems and structures that prevail.
106240	113280	And this is a big deal because democracies or even any functioning form of government
113280	119760	that includes people relies on a capacity to discuss adequately what's going on.
119760	125160	It relies on a sense-making process, if you like, a meaning-making process.
125160	130680	And debate was the sort of high end of what it was like to observe a culture talking to
130680	131680	itself.
131680	132920	So there will be a future for debate.
132920	136640	It's not that we're against all forms of it, but we do think there's a case for trying
136640	138880	to develop something radically new.
138880	146480	I would say that the key idea to grasp here is that whereas debate is primarily about opposing
146480	152000	views in which the center of inquiry is somehow in the middle of the room and people are trying
152000	154280	to figure out who's winning, which side am I on?
154280	156680	That's sort of debate classically conceived.
157520	164040	But we live in a time where we're all exposed to things that we struggle to make sense of,
164040	166760	moments where we can't quite agree with ourselves.
166760	169040	Our values don't always align with our actions.
169040	171720	Our ideas don't always chime with our values.
171720	175000	And a lot of what the anti-debates are getting at is that internal struggle.
175000	178800	And it's a struggle you'll see between us on stage, probably, but it's also one we want
178800	180520	you to experience, too.
180520	183120	It's about finding your own inner center in a relationship.
183120	185240	So what are we trying to achieve at the end of it?
185240	188280	It's not some beautiful middle position in which everyone can agree on.
188280	190600	It's not some consensus verdict.
190600	194480	It's a deeper felt sense of your relationship to the issue of hand.
194480	196320	And another beauty is that we don't know what the issue is yet.
196320	198320	We're about to find out.
198320	199320	Thank you.
199320	221400	I'm going to ask my colleagues here to spend a moment now just going into themselves and
221400	231400	asking for a provisional question that feels it matters right now, that feels maybe a little
231400	236560	bit uncomfortable, maybe a little bit pregnant with possibility.
236560	241080	Would you like to get us going with a provisional question?
241080	244440	Is this a moment in history?
244440	245440	Maybe we shouldn't be striving so much.
245440	250440	If I could put it more bluntly, it's like, should we feel guilty about not being able
251440	254440	or what is this consternation?
254440	258440	Elizabeth, how are you feeling about what you're hearing in relation to your question about
258440	260440	is fear ever useful?
260440	262440	It feels related, but it does feel quite separate.
262440	266440	Or rather, it feels like there's a hearing or a polarity here.
266440	269440	And they're related because they're about, oh, who do we be?
269440	272440	What is the state of being we should be seeking?
272440	274440	What's come to meaner now?
274440	276440	Is masculinity the problem?
276440	282440	I just worry that a lot of the conversations we've been having feel quite abstract, maybe.
282440	288440	And I think I don't mean to pose this question so that we can find the bogeyman and blame
288440	293440	something, but I feel like we need something tangible to unpack and to look at.
293440	296440	How are you guys doing with this now as well, in particular?
296440	300440	There's something about my question, which would definitely include this question.
300440	303440	There's no question of that.
303440	308440	So I'm certainly not attached to my way into the problem.
308440	311440	I think that's another way into the same problem.
311440	315440	And I'm going to ask, first of all, for a show, a question for Indra's question,
315440	319440	is this a moment in history asking us to step up?
319440	321440	And then let's, oh, we've got a couple here as well.
321440	322440	OK, thank you.
322440	324440	So let's now get a show of hands.
324440	326440	Is masculinity the problem?
326440	327440	Show of hands.
327440	328440	OK.
328440	331440	So is masculinity the problem we will go with?
331440	337440	Would anyone in the room just like any kind of clarifications about the question?
337440	342440	I mean, I guess people have at least a start of 10 on what masculinity is.
342440	346440	Mina, are you happy with the way that the question is framed, as you originally framed it?
346440	347440	Yeah.
347440	351440	The question stems from the many discussions that we've been having.
351440	360440	So is it the problem for many of the big challenges of the 21st century?
361440	367440	My sense is that there's sort of two things that are really causing a lot of the problems,
367440	375440	whether it's the climate emergency or polarization, poverty and inequality, those kinds of things.
375440	379440	But one is the kind of the economic model that we have.
379440	381440	It's completely unsustainable.
381440	383440	We are exploiting our planet.
383440	389440	We're exploiting ourselves in order to sustain the economic model that reigns.
389440	395440	And then there's the kind of the model of social, of relationship,
395440	400440	not just social relations between humans, but relationship with ourselves individually,
400440	406440	with each other, and then with the more than human natural world.
406440	412440	And in both of these, like both relationship and the economic model,
412440	421440	I feel as though without reimagining masculinity, which has shaped our largest economies
421440	427440	and family structures that feed into economies and so on.
427440	433440	And also, I guess, a kind of quest to explore other parts of the world,
433440	437440	which has resulted in colonialism and neocolonialism.
437440	445440	It's men who have done these things and continue to largely lead the world.
445440	454440	And also, in so far as our relationships and how we may not be able to express emotions with each other,
454440	463440	how we denounce interiority and always stay on this kind of abstract space.
463440	469440	And that feels to me like it's actually very connected to how we perceive masculinity.
469440	474440	We have a question now. You have completed the first stage of the anti-debate.
474440	479440	We didn't know what we were going to talk about 15 minutes ago. Now we do, my goodness.
483440	489440	We're going to invite you to come outside and we're going to create a line where we ask you to
489440	494440	place yourself on this line between yes and no and all that lies between.
494440	498440	So is masculinity the problem now? Yes, we'll be right here on the left
498440	502440	and then you can place yourself anywhere on that line. That's how you feel.
504440	508440	We're going to add one extra dimension to this. We're going to turn this into an axis.
508440	511440	We still have yes and no, but then we're going to add,
511440	515440	do we believe we can make progress on this together this evening?
515440	518440	And really take a personal note of your own position so that you,
518440	521440	because later we'll come back to at the end of the process
521440	524440	and just to see if we have felt a shift in ourselves.
531440	536440	We want to just get everything in the room that is relevant on the table.
536440	543440	So if you have a metaphor or a short story that relates to this bigger social issue,
543440	547440	if you have a strong emotional reaction to it, please say it.
547440	552440	If this is okay with you guys, I don't think we're going to get into the biology of sex and gender.
552440	556440	Let's keep that down off my board.
556440	561440	We're talking about masculinity in its kind of broadest cultural sense.
561440	565440	And I will guide a little bit, but I want to hear from everyone.
565440	569440	So please do not hold back. You don't need to try and be clever.
569440	573440	That's not what this is about. It's something else.
573440	575440	The first thing to say is that the question may be sad,
575440	580440	even though it's about masculinity and not maleness or being a man.
580440	584440	Nonetheless, the first reaction was one of really, can this be true?
584440	587440	There's such great men out there. Can it really be inherently about masculinity?
587440	589440	For me, it's more to do with design.
589440	595440	It's how we've designed a public space and that men have designed a public space in a certain way.
595440	602440	And it's not holistic. It doesn't really draw on the more complex resources that we have.
602440	610440	If there's a problem, it's the lack of culturally appropriate, sacred initiation into the masculine.
610440	616440	And that's what we lost. And ever since we lost it, patriarchy developed.
616440	621440	And men aren't doing very well. Some of them are killing themselves.
621440	625440	They're trying to live up to this. Men are depressed.
625440	632440	Men have sacrificed themselves for centuries in wars, running into machine guns and bayonets.
632440	636440	I don't want to because you're opening, so I just want to say that completely.
636440	639440	Patriarchy doesn't do men any favour.
639440	644440	So a better question might be, what does it even mean to be human?
644440	647440	That goes up there.
647440	650440	The problem is the question.
650440	653440	The question itself is very masculine.
653440	656440	A binary.
656440	663440	I had a very strong visceral and personal response to looking at that quality.
663440	668440	And it sort of hues around two significant losses in my life.
668440	674440	The first was my father, who died in a reckless accident, a careless violent accident.
674440	677440	And then 40 years later, my husband hung himself.
677440	683440	And so there's something around that like sort of heedless physicality or bravado.
683440	687440	These are, particularly my husband, was a lovely sensitive man.
687440	692440	And whatever made him turn to that kind of violent response.
692440	698440	I mean, I think it works with Michael's sense of the lack of initiation into a whole being.
698440	703440	So I wanted to add violence over here, Marley Charmin and Nina.
703440	707440	And other things that there is just...
707440	709440	This is a big thing in the world.
709440	712440	And it's mainly men who perpetuate it.
712440	718440	But then over here, I want to put education, because I think what I see as the mother of a son.
718440	722440	And I actually don't think it's shameful to say, as a father of daughters, I get feminism.
722440	726440	Because I think when we encounter people in human relationships, that's how our empathy deepens.
726440	733440	But as a mother of a son, I see the way the education system actually problematises young male
733440	739440	who develop more slowly, generally, and can't sit still and need to run around in general.
739440	746440	And actually the discipline system in schools is problematising masculinity at that age.
746440	752440	The first thing that sprung to my mind was the image of Yin Yang and the movement of one into the other.
752440	756440	And the fact that one contains the other as well.
756440	758440	And it kind of frapped all the way.
758440	765440	And that describes Sun and Moon or North slope or South slope of the same mountain.
765440	772440	And that, I suppose, to one extent, if you kind of get it back here into balance
772440	778440	and remove the extreme masculinity, the thing that you used to call feminine has its kind of masculine side.
778440	786440	Just with that, I want men to be men and I know that my power is as a female in the feminine.
786440	790440	Perhaps the majority of the things that were coming up and are going on that board
790440	797440	are still being viewed through a structure of masculinity that is unsaid and largely invisible to us.
797440	809440	And that there's this profound absence in our thinking overall about a sort of missing femininity.
809440	813440	And I mean the feminine principle here, I don't mean women.
813440	825440	Just as there's this extraordinary accumulation of historical absence in the institutions that we're dealing with.
825440	829440	It's even in our framing of how we speak about this.
833440	841440	Now, I can't take everyone who's got their hands up, so just take a second and think, is this missing on the board?
841440	847440	I think there's quite a lot missing on the board, so I'll try to just say it as briefly as possible.
847440	854440	But yeah, starting with the question being the problem, I don't think that it is.
854440	864440	But one of the clarifications to make again is that, of course, to Dominique's point, masculinity is intersectional, you could say.
864440	873440	So it's layered with race and ethnicity and culture and class and all of those kinds of things.
873440	879440	The reason that the question I think is far more important than the question of just human interactions
879440	887440	is because we are talking about things like toxic masculinity and crisis and masculinity.
887440	893440	And even the conversation here in this room has kind of been talking a lot about kind of striving for balance
893440	897440	and we brought up male pain, if you like.
897440	900440	And I do want to acknowledge that that exists and it's important to talk about.
900440	905440	But actually, if you really think about it, masculinity and men are thriving.
905440	909440	Men are leading countries. Men are doing less domestic work.
909440	915440	Men are wealthier than women. Men are just incredibly privileged in comparison to women.
915440	922440	So if any group is in or any construct is in crisis or it would be femininity.
922440	932440	I'm tired of women not having power, not being able to shape our societies, not being able to shape conversations that impact our lives.
932440	937440	I'm tired of women being raped and abused and killed and beaten up in their homes.
937440	941440	I'm tired of not seeing women in all of the powerful institutions.
941440	945440	I'm tired of women not being acknowledged as voices.
945440	948440	I'm tired of old women being made invisible.
948440	954440	I'm tired of girls being conditioned to become passive with toys.
954440	957440	I'm just tired of so many things.
958440	969440	And what I'm tired of of all perhaps is that men are not talking really about how masculinity is the problem.
969440	973440	And so women once again have to do even that.
973440	980440	I'm just tired of those conversations not happening and yet there is so much pain and so much suffering for women
980440	984440	because masculinity and not humanity is the problem.
984440	988440	Thank you so much. Thank you for being honest and bringing your feelings.
988440	991440	Sorry, Michael. I'm going to just call a halt.
991440	996440	If there's anything I could say to help at the end or if the question.
996440	1002440	I just, I think it's been really useful somehow.
1002440	1011440	I hope everybody else felt that way but I just think that we should not leave this space and leave the question behind.
1015440	1019440	Okay, so this is after the entry debate.
1019440	1027440	We're now sort of reconfiguring our positions on this question and we have two axes basically.
1027440	1031440	We have an axis on the existing question, is masculinity the problem?
1031440	1034440	And if it's a yes, it's over here and if it's a no, it's over here.
1034440	1040440	And now we have another dimension which is about our chance of making progress on this question in the wider world.
1040440	1043440	And if it's a yes, it's in that direction and if it's a no, it's in that direction.
1043440	1047440	In other words, you have to find yourself across two axes,
1047440	1051440	both where you are on the issue and how constant you are that we can make progress on it.
1051440	1055440	So for me, I'm somewhat towards the yes but quite close to the middle.
1055440	1059440	And after that debate, after the entry debate, which went, I feel quite well,
1059440	1062440	I'm inclined to move backwards towards the yes.
1062440	1066440	And I feel like I'm about happy here.
1074440	1079440	Thank you for being part of the first public anti-debate.
1079440	1083440	I can add a couple of things. One is that, as you know, it's still in its early stages,
1083440	1085440	but it has very different principles.
1085440	1087440	It's involving the audience in a certain way.
1087440	1089440	It's bringing in emotions in a certain way.
1089440	1095440	It's taking quite a lot of time to get the question right so that we feel a shared investment in the inquiry.
1095440	1100440	It's stopping to check with the question holder about whether they sent the energy that they brought into the room
1100440	1102440	as being honoured in the right way.
1102440	1108440	And it's also about finding the disagreement within ourselves, not just between each other,
1108440	1112440	but also our own grappling, our own dissonance, our own sense of struggle.
1112440	1116440	Because if the question is a good question, we're likely to feel somewhat conflicted about it.
1116440	1122440	And the anti-debate is about giving each of us a chance to feel that we can make some kind of progress
1122440	1127440	within ourselves as well as in the shared context, what we might call collective individuation,
1127440	1131440	something that we get closer to our own sense of who we are because of the question asked
1131440	1133440	and because we're sharing it together.
1133440	1135440	And that's the beginning of the anti-debate.
1135440	1141440	Future trinkets and alterations might include bringing in a longer spell.
1141440	1143440	As we felt there, there was more to be said.
1143440	1147440	It could last a whole day even, potentially.
1147440	1149440	Some feel not, but we're discussing that.
1149440	1154440	Someone to bring in metaphor to have a phase where we talk only about metaphor.
1154440	1156440	Someone to improvise a little bit more.
1156440	1159440	Someone a bit more ding-dong and a bit more clash.
1159440	1163440	But for now, we're pretty happy that we have a template to work with,
1163440	1165440	and I thank you all very much for joining us.
1165440	1167440	Thank you.
