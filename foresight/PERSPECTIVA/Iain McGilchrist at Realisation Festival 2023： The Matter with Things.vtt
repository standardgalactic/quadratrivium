WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
Thank you very much.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.120
And I'm conscious that you've all had already a very full day, and I'm also conscious that

00:14.120 --> 00:20.480
many of you came expressly to hear Ian talk and meet him in person.

00:20.480 --> 00:26.680
And Ian has prepared a lecture, you know, something substantive directed at this event,

00:26.680 --> 00:29.920
the theme of difference from his work.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.280
So I'm going to introduce him, introduce the context of his work a little bit for those

00:33.280 --> 00:40.720
who don't know it, then step aside, let Ian take the stage, speak to him for 15 or so

00:40.720 --> 00:44.160
minutes myself, and then pass on to you for Q&A.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.000
And I'm guessing we're going to have more questions and we'll have time to answer.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.520
So do think not only about what you want to ask, but how you want to ask it while Ian's

00:53.520 --> 00:55.360
talking.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.160
It's a real honor to introduce Ian McGilchrist.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.600
I've now known Ian since 2011.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.280
There was a moment when I was working at the Royal Society of Arts in London, when the

01:06.280 --> 01:10.240
chief executive there, Matthew Taylor, who normally chaired events, just couldn't do

01:10.240 --> 01:12.000
the one with Ian.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.600
And two days before, I was given his fairly large, but not quite as large as the current

01:15.600 --> 01:19.160
book, The Master and his Emissary.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
And I was very excited.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.320
I thought, well, very interesting bold thesis here.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.320
Started reading it.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.200
The evening of the event, Matthew actually showed up backstage just before we were about

01:28.200 --> 01:29.680
to go on stage.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.840
And I was like, oh, please tell me I can share this event.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.680
Please, like, last minute.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.480
But actually, it worked.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.440
I went on stage, spoke to Ian, and that was the beginning of a very important professional

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
relationship for me.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.600
And since then, I've done a great deal of work promoting Ian's ideas.

01:46.600 --> 01:53.520
I feature in a documentary about him, visited his house on Sky, and now, by many strange

01:53.560 --> 01:58.240
twists of fate, became the publisher of his most recent book, The Matter with Things.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.840
Now, as some of you may know, and even if you don't know, you can just glance at it

02:01.840 --> 02:07.120
here if you can see the, I might hold it up if I have the strength in my left arm.

02:07.120 --> 02:14.520
But this is two very significant sized tomes, two volumes of The Matter with Things.

02:14.520 --> 02:20.720
And I believe Ian may have the precise details, but the words alone are roughly 600,000.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.200
And then that's just really kind of where it's getting started, because you also have

02:24.200 --> 02:32.200
quite significant appendices, notes, bibliography, references, index.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.480
So by the end of it, it's something approaching a million words, I believe, for both volumes

02:37.480 --> 02:39.600
together.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.920
But they're wonderful, wonderful, wonderful words, and many have read every one of them.

02:44.920 --> 02:49.320
And some have described it as, you know, really the book of our times, the book that everyone

02:49.320 --> 02:53.080
must read, of course, there's many of them, but this is one of them, I think.

02:53.080 --> 02:58.520
And it's very, very deep, and it does deal with very fundamental matters about the nature

02:58.520 --> 03:04.720
of life, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life towards the end of the second book,

03:04.720 --> 03:05.720
especially.

03:05.720 --> 03:11.720
And so I just wanted to share one more thing, which is that when I was describing my experience

03:11.720 --> 03:16.840
of reading this book, I posted a photograph of a large pencil that comes from the United

03:16.840 --> 03:21.960
Nations, so one of these sort of souvenir pencils, and it was put along the spine of

03:21.960 --> 03:26.600
the book diagonally, so it looked, you could sort of see the sort of significance of the

03:26.600 --> 03:32.720
book somehow in the image, you know, it's the social media age, I was doing what I could.

03:32.720 --> 03:38.280
And then somebody said to me, ah, yes, this is actually a three-pencil book, and I said,

03:38.280 --> 03:39.280
three-pencil book?

03:39.280 --> 03:42.200
He goes, yeah, that's the sort of, you know, the might of times if you have to scribble

03:42.200 --> 03:46.600
and take notes and underline and write in the marginalia, all the different things about

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
the book.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.440
This was Damien Walters, I think his name is, who's a science fiction writer.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.640
I said only three pencils for the book to this size.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.520
He goes, well, the complete works of Shakespeare are only two and a half.

03:59.520 --> 04:05.720
So you can see there, it's really a commitment to read the book, but one that's richly rewarded,

04:05.720 --> 04:09.200
and I believe Ian's going to speak to some major themes from it.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.040
So I think for now that's all I can say, and look forward to talking to Ian later.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.040
Ian McGillchrist, everyone.

04:16.040 --> 04:30.680
Thank you very much, and I hope you will tell me if I'm not audible, and I'm telling the

04:30.680 --> 04:34.160
thing is to have it as close to your beard as possible without touching it.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.520
I'm going to try and do that for however long I speak, and I'm also rather sorry that I

04:38.520 --> 04:42.160
have to do a sort of Tom Jones impersonation.

04:42.800 --> 04:49.280
I'm slightly beyond that, but this is the way the system works.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.080
I'm very pleased to be here.

04:51.080 --> 04:57.720
I'm delighted, and I think that this is the right audience, the ideal audience, to engage

04:57.720 --> 05:05.160
with what I felt I was doing in writing this inexcusably long book.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.600
I myself have told that this book was terribly important, and I really got to read it, but

05:09.600 --> 05:13.640
I had to say how long is it, and when I was told, well, the text goes to 1300 and something

05:13.640 --> 05:16.640
pages, I had to say, well, forget it.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.680
I hope though that you can be encouraged to dip into it.

05:20.680 --> 05:27.920
It covers a lot of ground, and I think it's quite permissible to dip into chapters and

05:27.920 --> 05:33.920
see how that works, and then I'm rather hoping that in the end you'll see that it's a single

05:33.920 --> 05:38.680
story if you like, and it's best if you can read it that way.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.400
Why did I write it?

05:41.400 --> 05:50.360
Like many people here, I feel that we reached a crisis point in which, frankly, we no longer

05:50.360 --> 05:53.480
know who we are.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.040
We haven't the foggiest idea of what we're doing here in this world.

05:57.040 --> 06:03.440
We don't seem to understand any kind of directional meaning in our lives, and if we find anywhere

06:03.440 --> 06:11.000
told that we've just painted them on the walls of our little cell in order to cheer ourselves

06:11.000 --> 06:19.720
up, I can't tell you how profoundly I disagree with that formulation, which seems to be a

06:19.720 --> 06:24.960
pervasive one these days, that of reductive materialism.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
And A.N.

06:25.960 --> 06:31.840
Whitehead, who's a philosopher I very greatly admire, said, as we think we live, and I think

06:31.840 --> 06:37.000
there's something wrong with our thinking processes, and that's what I was hoping to

06:37.000 --> 06:43.040
have a little influence over.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.280
You may know that I wrote an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary, and that

06:48.280 --> 06:55.800
concerns the division of the brain into two hemispheres, and this book, the newer book,

06:55.800 --> 06:58.080
also begins from that standpoint.

06:58.080 --> 07:04.440
This is not reductive in any sense, and it has been put to me by one person, only one

07:04.440 --> 07:08.240
person, but he does persistently say it.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.160
He's a philosopher who will remain nameless, I want to spare him his blushes, but he seems

07:14.160 --> 07:18.680
to think that just because I talk about the structure of the brain, I must be reducing

07:18.680 --> 07:19.920
mind to brain.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.440
However, I've now over pretty much 2,000 pages between those two books, made it very

07:24.440 --> 07:30.880
clear that my whole thrust is anti-reductionist.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.220
Why would one be interested in the structure of the brain?

07:34.220 --> 07:39.000
You might well say, I'm really interested in the mind, but I don't really care where

07:39.000 --> 07:44.120
things go on in my brain, it's not relevant.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.120
And I'm sympathetic with that, but I also think there's something very, very important

07:48.120 --> 07:53.720
about the way the brain is structured, and whether the brain gives rise to consciousness

07:53.720 --> 08:00.400
which I can't believe, or it transmits consciousness which it might, or it permits consciousness

08:00.400 --> 08:05.840
which is what I do believe, it will shape the nature of that consciousness.

08:05.840 --> 08:12.280
And it's therefore quite relevant that this organ is divided in two right down the middle.

08:12.280 --> 08:16.360
If you've never seen a brain, it's rather like a walnut, and it has that division down

08:16.360 --> 08:17.680
the middle.

08:17.680 --> 08:26.760
If you have an organ which is said to be a computer, I mean that's an image that I very

08:26.760 --> 08:32.040
much detest, and it's entirely wrong on a whole range of grounds, but if you do think

08:32.040 --> 08:37.320
of it as having computing power, why would you make an enormous division down the middle

08:37.320 --> 08:43.840
of it, since its computing power exists in the number of connections it can make?

08:43.840 --> 08:46.520
Why is the brain asymmetrical?

08:46.520 --> 08:53.400
The world around us isn't asymmetrical exactly, and the skull is pretty much symmetrical.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.240
So what's this about?

08:55.240 --> 09:00.400
Why is the right hemisphere broader at the front and larger altogether, in fact the biggest

09:00.400 --> 09:06.000
asymmetry in the entire brain, is the largeness of the right frontal cortex?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.320
And why something that one did learn about in medical school and never heard about the

09:10.320 --> 09:12.120
right hemisphere?

09:12.120 --> 09:17.000
It's broader towards the back on the left, and this was always said to be because of

09:17.000 --> 09:22.960
the invention of language, which is a very important part of the history of humanity.

09:22.960 --> 09:31.680
But that can't be right, because we know that plenty of the great primates, Bonobos, Gorillas,

09:31.680 --> 09:38.800
chimpanzees have these expansions, but they don't have language.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.560
And I suppose the final thing is these two hemispheres are connected by a band of fibres

09:42.560 --> 09:49.400
at the base of the brain, over which 2% of the neurons in the brain actually cross.

09:49.400 --> 09:55.560
So it's set up for two rather distinct conscious nexuses.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.680
Why is that?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
Is it just us?

09:58.680 --> 10:00.520
No, it isn't.

10:00.520 --> 10:08.200
The difference between us, or at least mammals, and other living creatures, is that they don't

10:08.200 --> 10:09.720
even have a corpus callosum.

10:09.720 --> 10:15.480
So the corpus callosum was a mammalian invention, and it's gradually getting smaller in relation

10:15.480 --> 10:16.720
to the size of the brain.

10:16.720 --> 10:21.240
So our brains have expanded, but the corpus callosum remains small, and a lot of its traffic

10:21.240 --> 10:25.440
is saying, I'm dealing with this, you keep out of it.

10:25.440 --> 10:31.480
And that's true as you go down, as we like to think of it, down the evolutionary tree.

10:31.480 --> 10:36.440
So it's true of amphibians, it's true of reptiles, it's true of insects, it's true

10:36.440 --> 10:44.600
of every creature that we know of, including the most ancient creature, still extant.

10:44.600 --> 10:50.320
It's 700 million years old, nematostelovectensis, and it lives off the Isle of Wight, where

10:50.320 --> 10:56.800
it only marginally raises the average age of the inhabitants.

10:56.800 --> 11:03.080
And it already has this asymmetry in its neural network, described by Thomas Holstein, who

11:03.080 --> 11:08.760
discovered it at some Heidelberg, as the origin of the mammalian, and eventually the human

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
brain.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.560
Well, I think there is an answer to that, and it's quite a simple one, and I've never

11:14.560 --> 11:20.360
heard any explanation that goes near doing as good a job, and nobody's told me I'm wrong.

11:20.360 --> 11:25.840
And it's this, every living creature has to be able to do two incompatible things at once.

11:25.840 --> 11:31.320
They have to enable themselves to survive by eating, and they have to enable themselves

11:31.320 --> 11:34.320
to survive by not being eaten.

11:34.320 --> 11:40.080
And for the first, you need to have highly targeted, precise attention to a detail, for

11:40.080 --> 11:46.440
a bird to pick up that seed accurately and swiftly, for an eagle to be able to catch

11:46.440 --> 11:47.440
that hair.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.520
Whatever it is, you lock onto your target, you know what it is, you go for it.

11:52.520 --> 11:58.560
And that attention is very, very precise, but it's only about three out of the 360 degrees

11:58.560 --> 12:02.640
of the per view that we might have.

12:02.640 --> 12:07.840
Meanwhile, the right hemisphere, sorry, I haven't mentioned yet that the left hemisphere

12:07.840 --> 12:13.840
is the one that does the targeting, the right hemisphere is tasked with doing the whole

12:13.840 --> 12:18.280
of the rest, basically, of seeing the whole picture, looking out for predators, looking

12:18.280 --> 12:23.720
out for corn specifics, looking out for offspring that need feeding and protecting.

12:23.720 --> 12:29.360
And so, this can't be done, actually, it's not just like trying to pat your tummy and

12:29.360 --> 12:33.240
rub your head or whatever it is you're supposed to do, pat your head and rub your tummy as

12:33.240 --> 12:34.240
well.

12:34.240 --> 12:39.200
It's actually impossible unless you have two ways in which you can dispose your consciousness

12:39.200 --> 12:46.480
at once, and that requires two neuronal masses capable of being conscious at all.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.880
So that explains this division, and it's based, as I say, on attention.

12:51.880 --> 12:57.640
And when I realized this, the penny didn't drop immediately, because I had been chained

12:57.640 --> 13:06.320
in a rigorously analytic, cognitive way, and I saw attention as another interesting cognitive

13:06.320 --> 13:15.800
function like memory and language and so on, but no, attention is something very, very special.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.320
It's how we bring the world into being.

13:18.320 --> 13:23.560
Let me just explain a little about that, because it's central to what I'm going to say.

13:23.560 --> 13:31.440
I repudiate either of the two main alternatives that are put up these days in the public arena

13:31.440 --> 13:34.160
as possible ways of understanding the world.

13:34.160 --> 13:40.440
I think most of us detect that it's not quite true that there's just a world out there.

13:41.200 --> 13:48.240
First of all, it might not be out there, and secondly, it's not just out there in that

13:48.240 --> 13:56.800
we are connected to it somehow, and how we experience it changes at least the weak claim

13:56.800 --> 13:59.240
as it changes for us what it is we experience.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.240
That's obvious.

14:00.240 --> 14:07.440
I believe it actually helps to mould what is there in a less personal way, in a more

14:07.440 --> 14:13.920
universal way, eventually, but it also makes us who we are.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.800
If I get in the habit of attending to things that are living as machines, I will see only

14:18.800 --> 14:25.440
their mechanical aspects, and I will see that this works very well, and so it worked last

14:25.440 --> 14:30.920
time, it'll work next time, and soon I can't see any alternative to seeing living things

14:30.920 --> 14:34.080
as mechanism.

14:34.080 --> 14:41.360
I call attention a moral act, by which I mean that we have a responsibility, and that word

14:41.360 --> 14:46.560
responsibility is important because it suggests the coming and the going, the giving of something

14:46.560 --> 14:52.200
and something responding, a reverberative relationship.

14:52.200 --> 14:59.680
I actually also claim in this book, and argue for the position, that relationships are primary,

14:59.800 --> 15:06.200
relationships are prior to the things that are related, the so-called relux.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.760
How can that be, you might say?

15:07.760 --> 15:12.320
How can you have a relation before you've got the things that need to be related?

15:12.320 --> 15:16.960
Well I take the view that actually everything is related, and that it gets its being from

15:16.960 --> 15:21.600
the context of all the other things to which it's primarily very directly related, but

15:21.600 --> 15:28.680
ultimately to the rest, and that therefore you can't tell what that thing is until you've

15:28.680 --> 15:35.000
understood the network of webs of relationships out of which it arises.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.720
In any case, attention is important in this way, and I have this view that it's neither

15:42.720 --> 15:49.360
what I call rot reality out there, and we are just passive receivers of it, nor is it

15:49.360 --> 15:54.640
mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.600
Sorry, those were acronyms in case you're...

15:58.600 --> 16:04.240
It's something very important, an encounter.

16:04.240 --> 16:10.280
So every experience is an encounter, and it's not made up of things, it's made up of encounters

16:10.280 --> 16:14.960
with what are effectively processes, relationships.

16:14.960 --> 16:24.320
For this reason, the way in which we attend to the world matters enormously, and the

16:24.320 --> 16:32.040
title of my latest offering, this enormous book, is the Matter with Things, which is...

16:32.040 --> 16:36.720
We read on several levels, I mean on the first level obviously, I think we probably all agree

16:36.720 --> 16:41.160
there's something that is the matter with things, and I think that what's the matter

16:41.160 --> 16:47.400
is our obsession with matter, partly, and at least if you assume matter is the simple

16:47.400 --> 16:52.320
stuff that has nothing to do with consciousness, if you think it has a bit of consciousness

16:52.320 --> 16:58.520
about it, then you've already smuggled consciousness in, and we don't have to explain how it somehow

16:58.520 --> 17:01.320
mysteriously arises out of matter.

17:01.320 --> 17:07.080
But if you think of matter as simple, well you're on to hiding to nothing, because if

17:07.080 --> 17:12.840
matter has nothing of consciousness about it, and has no direction, and no knowledge of

17:12.840 --> 17:17.480
any of the things that make life worth living for us, how is it that after a few million

17:17.480 --> 17:24.000
years this completely blind collision of senseless particles gives rise to Bach's St.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.400
Matthew Passion?

17:25.400 --> 17:30.720
This is a miracle, if ever there was one, and reductionists always end up having to do

17:30.720 --> 17:33.480
it, and here a miracle happens.

17:33.480 --> 17:38.080
I don't do that, because I believe, and I may come onto that later, I believe that consciousness

17:38.080 --> 17:43.240
is foundational, I think it is what the philosopher's called an ontological primitive, which means

17:43.240 --> 17:51.680
it can't be derived from anything else, it is the primary stuff of the cosmos.

17:51.680 --> 17:59.760
But if attention changes what we experience, how we relate to it, how we act, how we think,

17:59.760 --> 18:04.240
it's pretty important, and if the two halves of the brain have manifested different ways

18:04.240 --> 18:11.120
of attending, and there's not a single neurologist, psychiatrist, physician, neuroscientist anywhere

18:11.120 --> 18:15.760
in the world who will deny that these two hemispheres have this greatly different way

18:15.760 --> 18:21.000
of attending, if that's the case, then it follows that they produce two different kinds

18:21.000 --> 18:26.360
of experiential worlds, they'd have to, and I haven't got time to go through all the things

18:26.360 --> 18:33.840
that differentiate them, but let me just give a sort of lightning sketch of how they differ.

18:33.840 --> 18:39.200
So you can see that if you are paying attention to something that you already know is important

18:39.200 --> 18:44.600
for you, and latching onto it, and then later latching onto something else, and then seeing

18:44.600 --> 18:54.960
one of those two, it produces a picture of isolated fragments that are already known,

18:54.960 --> 19:02.840
familiar, useful, they're decontextualised, they're abstracted because they're an example

19:02.840 --> 19:08.200
of a kind, it's another seed, another rabbit, whatever, the differences between Peter Rabbit

19:08.240 --> 19:14.720
and his brethren are not available to the left hemisphere, and this picture in the left hemisphere

19:14.720 --> 19:21.760
is one which is effectively inanimate, literal, it takes language literally,

19:21.760 --> 19:30.320
because it's not very good at reading subtle signs, so body language, facial expression,

19:30.320 --> 19:36.120
tone of voice, you don't even need to get into the complexities of metaphor,

19:36.160 --> 19:40.200
but already the right hemisphere is much more skilled at this than the left,

19:40.200 --> 19:45.160
but the left hemisphere simply takes poetry, metaphors, literally,

19:45.160 --> 19:50.040
and then pronounces, as some philosophers have, that they're lies.

19:50.040 --> 19:55.880
However the ancient Greeks thought that metaphors were the key to understanding, Aristotle says

19:55.880 --> 20:02.680
that this is the key to every kind of thinker, the strength of that thinker or of that artist,

20:02.720 --> 20:09.600
is to be able to produce new metaphors that illuminate, and indeed I think it's very well

20:09.600 --> 20:16.280
accepted now that all language is metaphorical, in particular scientific language and philosophical

20:16.280 --> 20:21.920
language are metaphorical because they're often dealing with abstractions, and we don't have

20:21.920 --> 20:25.240
the words for those, we have the words for the things we encounter in daily life.

20:25.240 --> 20:31.640
So you've got on the one hand this picture of isolated fragments that have no meaning,

20:31.640 --> 20:39.120
purposeful direction until we put them together, that are inanimate, decontextualised, abstracted,

20:39.120 --> 20:48.120
and they co-together to form a picture of a lifeless diagram, a theory, a map of the world.

20:48.120 --> 20:53.240
Now there's nothing wrong with a map, and there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere, we need it,

20:53.240 --> 21:01.440
but it won't give us the full story, just as consulting a map of this area before you've

21:01.440 --> 21:06.040
came wouldn't tell you what you see outside the window, what you would experience in this house,

21:06.040 --> 21:12.600
that's all left as it were in the realm of the right hemisphere. So what does the right hemisphere

21:12.600 --> 21:19.720
see? It sees that nothing is ever certain fixed and fully known, that there is always a degree of

21:19.720 --> 21:25.600
possibility that it may be something slightly different, and indeed since it sees unique cases

21:25.640 --> 21:31.880
rather than just general categories, it's aware that actually every blade of grass is different.

21:31.880 --> 21:45.000
So it sees a picture of these undrasped before, but processually knowable, not known already

21:45.000 --> 21:51.200
completely, but something we can come into a knowing of, it sees them as interconnected with

21:51.200 --> 21:58.200
other things, constantly flowing, not fixed down so that we can easily grasp, and as I say

21:58.200 --> 22:05.760
individual, implicit, and embodied. Now all that implicit and embodied stuff is terribly

22:05.760 --> 22:12.840
important, and it's all the kind of things that a computer won't be able to understand until it's

22:12.840 --> 22:17.840
got a body, and until blood is flowing through its cheeks, and it knows that it's going to die,

22:17.880 --> 22:25.400
and it's suffered, and so on. So the left hemisphere is, I hate the idea that the brain is like a

22:25.400 --> 22:31.640
computer as I've already said, but there is something about the left hemisphere that is

22:31.640 --> 22:36.560
rather like one's personal computer, in that its level of understanding is very low, very poor,

22:36.560 --> 22:41.560
but it's very efficient at carrying out procedures. There's a division of labor really. The right

22:41.560 --> 22:46.480
hemisphere is rather like you when you've gathered data, and you want the computer to process it,

22:46.480 --> 22:52.760
to shove it into the computer, the computer wears away cleverly for a short while, and produces an

22:52.760 --> 22:57.680
answer. The computer doesn't know what the answer means, but you take that back into the real-life

22:57.680 --> 23:03.840
world and reinterpret it. So it's this dynamism in which you begin from the right hemisphere,

23:03.840 --> 23:08.720
move to the left, and move to the right, and I'm indebted to Jonathan for having christened this

23:08.720 --> 23:13.880
and McGill christened maneuver. I don't believe it's a maneuver, but anyways, whatever, and it's

23:13.880 --> 23:18.680
best imaged by the idea of learning a piece of music. You're first attracted to it as a whole by

23:18.680 --> 23:24.080
the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere sees the whole picture, the left hemisphere sees parts,

23:24.080 --> 23:29.040
and analyzes. So then you start to play it, and you realise that you've got to take it apart,

23:29.040 --> 23:35.240
you've got to really keep practising that passage of bar 18, and then you sort of understand the

23:35.240 --> 23:39.840
theory of this structure of the piece. So you see how it's here that we return to the tonic,

23:39.840 --> 23:45.320
and that's all very well. It's important, it's good. But when you go out to play the piece,

23:45.320 --> 23:50.080
finally, you must forget all of that. You'll give the most terrible performance. And there's very

23:50.080 --> 23:54.880
much in life that is like this. But at the moment, I believe we live in a world in which we take the

23:54.880 --> 24:01.440
lived experience. We then turn it into a map, a theory, a diagram, take it apart, leave it bits

24:01.440 --> 24:07.200
all over the floor, and then go, well, it doesn't seem to mean anything to me. And this is surely a

24:07.200 --> 24:14.160
very bad way to be understanding the vibrant, living, complex, rich, beautiful world around us.

24:14.160 --> 24:22.440
So that's the sort of neurology part of it, if you'd like. And I begin the book. It has three

24:22.440 --> 24:32.600
parts. In part one, I talk about the neuropsychology. And I begin with looking at the ways in which we

24:32.640 --> 24:38.040
could gather some knowledge about the world to gather it, not to process it, but just to begin

24:38.040 --> 24:44.920
the process of having anything there. And I take these to be attention, but also perception, which

24:44.920 --> 24:49.960
is not the same as attention, judgment, which is formed on the basis of what you've attended to

24:49.960 --> 24:56.360
and what you've perceived, emotional and social intelligence, and cognitive intelligence, IQ,

24:56.360 --> 25:04.680
in other words, and creativity, because nothing ever comes to us just as a blank. It comes to us

25:04.680 --> 25:10.120
as a something. And sometimes we need to be able to revision what that is before it sets. And we

25:10.120 --> 25:15.240
can do this very, very rapidly, so that we don't even know what we're doing. But all those faculties,

25:15.240 --> 25:25.240
all those portals to the world, as I call them, are more reliably exercised by the right hemisphere

25:25.240 --> 25:32.360
than by the left. All of them, including cognitive intelligence, IQ, it's very, very clear. And

25:32.360 --> 25:39.480
that might surprise a lot of people. And you may well say, well, that's ridiculous. That can't be it.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.360
I mean, how on earth would we get by with a brain that only half of which is really reliable? Well,

25:44.360 --> 25:52.440
the answer is that the very important business of getting stuff accumulating power is the job of

25:52.440 --> 25:57.400
the left hemisphere. And that it does exceptionally well. So that when you have a stroke in the left

25:57.400 --> 26:04.200
hemisphere, the right hand with which you manipulate the world and use tools and operate machines is

26:07.160 --> 26:15.080
dysfunctional or nonfunctional, you may lose the power to use language. And one way of looking at

26:15.080 --> 26:19.320
language is we didn't need it when we lived in small communities where we understood one another

26:19.320 --> 26:24.280
directly and lived together. But we needed it as communities became larger and larger. And instead

26:24.280 --> 26:31.320
of having I, thou communication, we had to have I, it communication, and I, they communication.

26:32.040 --> 26:38.840
And that is also damaged. But get this, it's much easier to rehabilitate somebody after a left

26:38.840 --> 26:43.320
hemisphere stroke, despite all that, than it is after a right hemisphere stroke, because somebody

26:43.320 --> 26:48.360
who has a right hemisphere stroke may well not understand the world at all. It's not that they

26:48.360 --> 26:55.400
can't manipulate it. They just can't understand it. And people complain that their partner,

26:56.440 --> 27:01.960
they have a father who suffered such an injury or stroke is no longer empathic in the way that

27:01.960 --> 27:07.000
they used to be, doesn't seem to understand a joke, doesn't seem to understand what's going on around

27:07.000 --> 27:17.080
him, doesn't understand the conversation. So that's kind of important. In the second part of the book,

27:17.640 --> 27:24.760
I deal with epistemology, which is how do we get from our findings, our data, our information,

27:24.760 --> 27:32.360
our percepts, our judgments? How do we get from there to broader conclusions about the world?

27:33.240 --> 27:37.880
And how do we build up a picture of the world? And I suggest that there are four of these,

27:39.320 --> 27:46.760
science, reason, intuition, and imagination. And in the world in which we live, none of these

27:46.760 --> 27:52.200
is quite perceived right. So excessive claims are made for science. And at the same time,

27:52.200 --> 27:56.840
science is not scientific enough. If science were properly scientific, it wouldn't be as

27:56.840 --> 28:02.200
dogmatic as it is. It wouldn't dismiss things that don't fit the current paradigm, because the whole

28:02.200 --> 28:07.240
history of science is of people finding things that don't fit the current paradigm and then revising.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.720
And again, we don't respect science enough. So there are now movements that disrespect science

28:13.720 --> 28:18.280
or disregard science or refuse to publish science if it doesn't happen to fit with your political

28:18.280 --> 28:28.040
view. This sounds remarkably like 1930s Germany. Then there is reason. And reason is very important.

28:28.040 --> 28:33.560
And again, I think the world has lost its reason. It's lost its reason of boldness.

28:33.560 --> 28:39.320
How rarely do we hear that concept, which seems to be central of the reason of bold,

28:39.320 --> 28:43.720
not just the rationalistic. And I'm making a distinction there, which is made in other

28:43.720 --> 28:47.480
languages between different types of reason. In German, there's a difference between

28:47.480 --> 28:53.320
Vernunft and Verstand. And there's a kind of procedure or logic, which is not

28:53.960 --> 28:59.560
unnecessary. It's very important that you ought to be able to synthesize that with the products of

28:59.560 --> 29:05.560
a life well lived for kind of experiential wisdom. And that is reason. And then there's intuition,

29:05.560 --> 29:09.640
which has had a very bad press lately, because there are lots of psychologists who go around

29:10.600 --> 29:15.320
to companies making a lot of money, telling them they must never trust their intuitions,

29:15.320 --> 29:22.680
because they're all wrong. And psychologists rather like the feeling of having power over

29:22.680 --> 29:28.920
other people and seeing things they don't see. And so there's a kind of a chauvinism about

29:29.160 --> 29:36.760
their wish to dispense with intuition. When I say the examples they come up with,

29:36.760 --> 29:40.440
which is quite true, our intuition would probably guide us to the wrong answer. There

29:40.440 --> 29:45.400
are such things that can be set up, and our delivery is set up by psychologists. They draw on

29:45.400 --> 29:49.880
principles that would normally lead us to the right conclusion, but on this occasion just don't

29:49.880 --> 29:55.880
happen to it. And I can show you optical illusions, which are so extraordinary, that you can't believe

29:55.880 --> 30:02.760
it until it's demonstrated. And yet, I don't know many people who say, well, after seeing that,

30:02.760 --> 30:07.800
I'm never going to open my eyes again, because they might mislead me. We need these fantasies.

30:07.800 --> 30:13.240
And imagination, I just want to make an important distinction between imagination and fantasy.

30:14.040 --> 30:20.280
Fantasy is something that takes us away from where we are. And it sometimes

30:20.280 --> 30:25.480
thought that imagination is like this as well. But imagination is not. Imagination

30:26.360 --> 30:34.680
is the only way in which we can truly enter into and understand the life, the existence

30:34.680 --> 30:42.440
of whatever it is we're contemplating. So it's a completely different thing, imagination.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.440
Words from the Coleridge wrote about this very interestingly. I haven't got time to talk about

30:46.520 --> 30:52.360
that now, but they did. And they contrasted the sort of dressing up of something in a fancy way

30:52.360 --> 31:00.520
in order to make it look different and funny or moving or sentimental. They contrasted that with

31:00.520 --> 31:10.200
the sort of deep gaze of attention in which the thing at last is permitted to come to be itself

31:10.200 --> 31:16.920
in your presence. In a word of Heidegger's translation of what Heidegger used in German

31:16.920 --> 31:25.320
unreason, it presences. And that's slightly different from being present. Being present is

31:25.320 --> 31:29.720
very passive. But the idea of presencing is the thing comes into being through the encounter.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.840
Now, in the world we're in at the moment, I just think there's an awful lot already that one could

31:36.840 --> 31:43.160
say that we're missing here. But what I do, and I just finished the counter through the book,

31:43.720 --> 31:49.320
not three years. So we've looked at which hemisphere is more trustworthy. And the answer is

31:50.280 --> 31:56.280
in almost every case, the left hemisphere will mislead us, is literally delusional. I'm not

31:56.280 --> 32:01.720
using that word in a pop sense. I'm using that in a psychiatric sense. It gives rise to Frank

32:01.720 --> 32:08.760
delusions left with self. It's not reliable. So we know that. We know we should be paying

32:08.760 --> 32:15.640
attention to what the right hemisphere tells us, even if it's harder to grasp. And we now know that

32:15.640 --> 32:21.240
we need to bring at least three out of these four science, reason, intuition and imagination,

32:21.240 --> 32:27.320
if not all four to bear on all our problems. But I find that generally we divide into camps

32:27.320 --> 32:33.400
who use either the first two or the last two or nothing at all. That's three camps. And then we

32:33.400 --> 32:40.680
come on to the last part of the book. And in that I sort of say, well, how do we understand the

32:40.680 --> 32:46.280
cosmos and ourselves? How do we understand our position here? What do we think the cosmos is like?

32:47.080 --> 32:51.960
And I begin with a couple of chapters about its structure. The first one is on the coincidence

32:52.040 --> 32:58.200
of opposites, which is a very, very important point, which has gone out of our culture and with

32:58.200 --> 33:06.040
it has gone some massively important insights, wise insights. We think that things are arranged

33:06.040 --> 33:10.520
in linear fashion. So on one end of a line, there's something you like. On the other end,

33:10.520 --> 33:14.680
there's something you hate. And it's just where you graduate yourself on this position. But this

33:14.680 --> 33:20.680
is not true. If you pursue something that you think is good more and more, you will definitely

33:20.680 --> 33:26.760
end up with the thing that you were fleeing from. Thus it's famous that anarchy leads to tyranny.

33:28.120 --> 33:34.680
And we don't understand this. It was obviously as a child that people on the extreme left of

33:34.680 --> 33:42.120
politics were awfully like people on the extreme right of politics. But the answer in calibrating

33:42.120 --> 33:50.040
these things is not just to find a midpoint where things go flabby as it were. The secret of making

33:50.040 --> 33:56.120
a good apple tart is have sour apples and lots of good honey. And this produces a wonderful apple

33:56.120 --> 34:01.880
tart, but just bland apples won't produce any of this. And the image I like to give here is one

34:01.880 --> 34:09.880
that is made by my favorite philosopher of all time, Heraclitus, 6th century BC, far more interesting

34:09.880 --> 34:17.880
than Plato. They're called pre-Socratic philosophers. I think the so-called Plasonic philosophers

34:17.880 --> 34:23.800
should be called post-Heraclitian philosophers, but anyway. In this realm there were a lot of very

34:23.800 --> 34:29.480
interesting voices and then we got thrown off track for about 2,000 years. We began to recover it in

34:29.480 --> 34:39.240
the 19th century. I'm being brief and flippant. I'm a great admirer of Plato. I studied him in

34:39.240 --> 34:44.920
Greek at school. I don't know all of that. But nonetheless, I think that there's a lot about

34:44.920 --> 34:53.720
the way in which Plato has been interpreted, his legacy and Aristotle's legacy, that we have had to

34:53.720 --> 35:03.320
try and finesse and make more complex and pass on from. The image from Heraclitus is that of the

35:03.320 --> 35:09.800
string of a light, the musical instrument, or the string of a bow. And the point he makes is it

35:09.800 --> 35:16.520
must be pulled apart in both directions very hard. And you might say, well, that's a waste of energy.

35:16.520 --> 35:22.280
Why don't we just let it go slack? And then, of course, the string will not let fly the note.

35:22.280 --> 35:28.840
It will not let fly the arrow. So the tension between these opposites held together, but not

35:28.840 --> 35:35.960
collapsed into one or the other. But both genuinely held is very important. And some people get around

35:35.960 --> 35:41.000
this by collapsing the two. It's just saying they're all one. They're not all one. They're

35:41.000 --> 35:48.840
importantly rather different. Or they say they're so different from one another that you can't say

35:48.840 --> 35:55.640
that they coincide. I would suggest that both of these positions is wrong. And then I talk about

35:55.640 --> 35:59.960
the one and the many. I won't go into that, but that's another whole famous philosophical problem

35:59.960 --> 36:04.280
that I think is very interesting about the relation between the general and the unique.

36:05.080 --> 36:11.080
And the particular and the eternal. And the insight I just want to pass on briefly is one that I

36:11.080 --> 36:17.000
think is best expressed in the work of Goethe, which is that you find the particular, sorry,

36:17.000 --> 36:21.880
you find the general and the universal, not by turning your back on the particular, but by

36:21.880 --> 36:28.520
going through the particular more deeply. And you find eternity, not by turning your back on the

36:28.520 --> 36:36.840
temporal, but by going through the temporal and seeing eternity there in the temporal.

36:37.640 --> 36:42.760
That of course is itself a paradox, but I'm no foe of paradox. In part two, I have a whole

36:42.760 --> 36:49.800
chapter on logical paradox, which I think explains, I take about 30, one's known to philosophers,

36:49.800 --> 36:55.560
and suggest that the reason that these paradoxes arise is that there is a conflict here between

36:55.560 --> 37:00.200
the way the left hemisphere sees it and the way the right hemisphere sees it. And guess what?

37:00.200 --> 37:03.880
The way the right hemisphere sees it is more in touch with reality.

37:05.240 --> 37:09.800
Thank you. I'll give you an example of Achilles and the tortoise. Achilles was famously swift

37:09.800 --> 37:14.680
to foot. The tortoise challenged him to a race. Achilles said, no, I don't think so. Come on,

37:14.680 --> 37:20.280
you can never catch me. Achilles thinks, well, okay. And being a generous kind of guy gives the

37:20.280 --> 37:26.520
tortoise a head start. The tortoise, however, is right. Because first of all, Achilles has

37:26.520 --> 37:30.200
got to get where the tortoise now is. But by the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved on to

37:30.200 --> 37:34.600
a new place. Now his job is to get to where the tortoise has gone to. But by the time he gets

37:34.600 --> 37:39.560
there, the tortoise has moved on. And this is an infinite series, so he can never actually

37:39.560 --> 37:44.680
overtake the tortoise. However, we know that he'll overtake the tortoise in two strides.

37:44.680 --> 37:48.120
And the problem there, which I can't unpack now because I've got to get to the end of my talk

37:48.200 --> 37:55.160
quite quickly, is that effectively the mistake is thinking of a continuum

37:55.960 --> 38:03.960
retrospectively as fragmented and analyzed. And then in the rest of the chapters of part three,

38:04.520 --> 38:15.960
I deal with the trivia, time, space, matter, consciousness, value, purpose,

38:16.840 --> 38:23.240
and the sense of the sacred. And most people are with me when we get time yet, very interesting,

38:23.240 --> 38:30.120
yes, space, matter and consciousness are very important. What a hell, why do you put values,

38:30.120 --> 38:34.920
purpose and the sense of the sacred in there? And I believe these are things that are absolutely

38:34.920 --> 38:41.800
essential to our understanding of the universe of the cosmos and of life. And they've been dismissed

38:41.800 --> 38:48.920
from discourse by science not out of malice, but out of a very good principle.

38:49.640 --> 38:53.880
It decided that the way it wanted to investigate things was what it calls objective,

38:53.880 --> 38:58.200
and in that it didn't want to introduce values, it didn't want to introduce any kind of purpose,

38:58.200 --> 39:04.600
it just wanted to see what was there. And then it reports back solemnly after its investigation,

39:04.920 --> 39:12.120
it couldn't find any values, couldn't find any purpose. But to borrow an image from C.S.

39:12.120 --> 39:16.840
Lewis, this is like a policeman who stops all the traffic in the street and then solemnly notes

39:16.840 --> 39:24.520
in his notebook, the silence in this street is very suspicious. Science has not proved that

39:24.520 --> 39:29.640
light is meaningless, that there is no purpose, that there are no values, it's not its job to do

39:29.640 --> 39:35.160
that, and we need to see that and it needs to see that. But I believe that all consciousness,

39:35.160 --> 39:39.720
and let me say it briefly, I think the consciousness matter relate like this. I believe

39:39.720 --> 39:43.720
that consciousness is the primary substance of the universe, if you like. Although substance is

39:43.720 --> 39:48.840
exactly the wrong word because nothing needs to be under it, it is the stuff, if you like,

39:48.840 --> 39:53.720
of the cosmos. But again, it's not stuff, our language, stuff says when we try to talk about

39:53.800 --> 40:02.600
this matter. So consciousness is that elementary stuff, and consciousness is always directed

40:02.600 --> 40:08.760
towards something else. We are seeing something, we are taking it, being aware of something,

40:08.760 --> 40:16.040
we're examining something, we're just contemplating something, but that is directional and it's guided

40:16.040 --> 40:25.080
by value, and it's guided by purpose, and these things are throughout in the living world, and

40:25.080 --> 40:31.480
I would say having read Jude Caravan's latest book, which is very interesting, that in the

40:31.480 --> 40:38.200
cheese, a lot of the book is about the preanimate world, that there is evidence of clear purpose

40:38.200 --> 40:45.320
and value in terms of beauty already present in this cosmos. I think what life does is not just

40:45.400 --> 40:51.080
bring consciousness, because as I say consciousness I think is everywhere, but it brings two things.

40:51.640 --> 40:58.760
It speeds up the process of responsiveness and intensifies it and broadens it. So

41:00.200 --> 41:05.800
unlike the Roth in my garden, I can appreciate more of what there is in the cosmos, that's

41:05.800 --> 41:15.160
life given to me, and what that life means is something that I can come to understand very

41:15.160 --> 41:20.760
much faster than any of the processes that would have existed pre-life. There are animate processes

41:20.760 --> 41:25.720
that can happen a thousandth of a second, that if they were in an inanimate context would take

41:25.720 --> 41:33.000
billions of years. So what is matter? Well I think matter is a phase of consciousness. I think that

41:33.000 --> 41:39.720
consciousness exhibits matter to us, that's indisputable, we wouldn't know matter if we

41:39.720 --> 41:45.560
didn't have consciousness. However it's not true that we wouldn't know consciousness if we weren't

41:45.560 --> 41:51.960
material, we don't know that. A lot of scientists assume the brain somehow nobody has ever got

41:51.960 --> 42:00.360
even with a whisker of explaining how it could possibly happen, but if matter were to give rise

42:00.360 --> 42:07.800
to consciousness it's a matter of dispute, and I for one reject it, but we can't deny that matter

42:08.040 --> 42:13.800
is something that's in our experience, and I say why is matter there? I think it does

42:14.920 --> 42:21.400
one main thing that can be seen in two ways, it allows things to persist for a while,

42:22.840 --> 42:28.520
always only for a while, and it also offers some resistance, and I believe that creation,

42:28.520 --> 42:35.640
creativity depends on resistance, in the face of resistance it can't happen, and resistance is

42:35.640 --> 42:41.720
paradoxical like everything else. What is friction? Friction is what stops motion,

42:41.720 --> 42:46.360
that's what a physicist will tell you, but it's also what starts motion. I'm not able to move

42:46.360 --> 42:53.720
at all without friction, so things have dual roles and this resistance is highly creative,

42:53.720 --> 43:00.280
as has been seen by many of my favorite philosophers including Whitehead and others.

43:00.280 --> 43:06.840
So where am I going with this? I could talk to you about the sense of the sacred, I included a

43:06.840 --> 43:13.080
chapter on that, and many of my philosophical friends who'd read the draft said don't include it,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.920
you've got some really important philosophical things to say here, but nobody will take you

43:18.920 --> 43:24.920
seriously if you talk about the sacred, and they'll go oh he's a faith head, and so I almost,

43:25.880 --> 43:31.720
for a nanosecond, wavered, but I realized that I couldn't not write it, even though it was the most

43:31.720 --> 43:39.000
difficult thing I've ever written in my life. It cost me more blood, sweat, and tears than anything

43:39.000 --> 43:46.440
else I've done, because I wanted to be honorable to what was there, I wanted to be truthful to it,

43:46.440 --> 43:58.200
I wanted to be faithful to it, and neither oversell something or understated, and of course I believe

43:58.200 --> 44:04.360
that all that realm of the sacred and divine is not, is not expressible in ordinary language,

44:04.360 --> 44:10.440
and is not grasped by our common concepts, it is itself beyond such things, but that doesn't mean

44:10.440 --> 44:16.680
it's unreal, I mean it's just an elementary logical mistake to say well we can't talk about it,

44:17.640 --> 44:23.800
we can't conceive it, then it can't exist, but it can, and we can't measure it in the lab,

44:24.440 --> 44:29.640
I know that, but we can't measure love in the lab, I can't demonstrate love to somebody who's never

44:29.640 --> 44:36.120
experienced it, and the sacred is like that, you can't get it from, it's like trying to learn

44:36.120 --> 44:39.880
how to swim by sitting on the bank of the river reading a book, you actually have to get into

44:39.880 --> 44:45.880
the stream, but if you do you will find that something responds to you, I swear that it will,

44:46.600 --> 44:51.720
it may not be what you expect, but there will be this responsive encounter, and it's that that we

44:51.720 --> 44:59.640
are made for, and I believe that it's that, the business of seeing, experiencing, reflecting,

44:59.640 --> 45:06.200
doing our best to magnify in the world what is beautiful, good, and true, that is the reason

45:06.200 --> 45:13.800
we're here at all, so we have an important, if you like, role, and we started rather late, so I'm

45:13.800 --> 45:21.640
just gonna, I'll wind up in five minutes, and you've probably heard of Pascal's wager, yeah,

45:22.600 --> 45:26.440
and Pascal's wager for those of you who don't know it was, the maybe a god or the may not,

45:27.240 --> 45:34.520
if there is a god and you decide to deny him, you made a big mistake, but if there isn't a god

45:34.520 --> 45:39.960
and you think there is, well no harm will come of it, it's always seemed to me not really to cover

45:39.960 --> 45:46.920
the basis and to be a little bit venal in its, in its motivation, but there's something called

45:46.920 --> 45:53.000
the Galperist wager which goes like this, either there is a god, in which case, yep, we'd better

45:53.000 --> 45:59.640
get to know that god, or there isn't a god, in which case no harm is done, ala Pascal, but

46:00.600 --> 46:07.640
there is this possibility that whatever the divine and the sacred is, it is exploring itself,

46:07.640 --> 46:15.160
it is coming to know itself in its creation, one might ask why did this logos, this

46:15.800 --> 46:25.400
ble, this ultra, this ala, this god, why did it bother with the creation, and the answer in most

46:25.400 --> 46:30.440
religions is that god is love, and love is relational, coming back to my idea that everything,

46:30.440 --> 46:37.160
everything is actually relational, and relations are two way relations, so you have to have a

46:37.160 --> 46:45.880
cosmos in which something can come that can appreciate that divine ground, and it's exploring

46:45.880 --> 46:54.840
that, unfolding the beauty of it, that is the purpose of the creation, and here at the very last

46:54.840 --> 47:00.200
minute I come to the question of division and union, which I would love to give a whole hour's

47:00.200 --> 47:06.840
tour of them, because it's very, very important, but let me be very brief. Goethe, again another

47:06.840 --> 47:15.320
person I very greatly admire, said, dividing the united, uniting the divided, this is the business

47:15.320 --> 47:21.960
of nature, and it is like he says, the sisterly and diastole, which are the two beats of the heart,

47:21.960 --> 47:29.560
it is like the inhalation and the exhalation, and he also suggests, or hints that it's like the

47:29.560 --> 47:37.480
warp and weft of a fabric, into which our being is woven, he said. Now I think that is extraordinarily

47:37.480 --> 47:43.240
important, and perhaps I'd just leave it there and we can explore it a bit, but in my view,

47:43.240 --> 47:48.760
everything depends on seeing this importance of having division and union, but of having them

47:48.760 --> 47:56.200
unified, not divided. This is an example of the meta position that I held on many things,

47:56.200 --> 48:01.640
for example, I think it's great that we have both and, but we also sometimes need either all,

48:01.640 --> 48:10.360
but we don't need either both and, or either or, we need both, both and, and, and I, of course my

48:10.360 --> 48:14.520
whole works about symmetry and asymmetry, which I think goes much further than the brain, goes into

48:14.520 --> 48:19.640
the substance of life, and I believe there that we need not just symmetry or asymmetry,

48:19.640 --> 48:26.520
but we need the asymmetry of symmetry and asymmetry. That really is a lot of work,

48:26.520 --> 48:38.280
and it's all there in the postage of one of fire.

48:45.240 --> 48:51.880
I'll give you a chance to take a rest in for a second or two. Yep. Quite a tour de force,

48:53.240 --> 48:58.600
and I'm keen because of time to really involve the audience quite quickly, so I'm going to just

48:58.600 --> 49:06.360
have one question on the sacred, and it relates to an experience I had with you

49:06.360 --> 49:12.840
on the out of sky. A little minor tragedy is that before the book came out, I traveled up to

49:12.840 --> 49:17.880
the sky to film a day, a day long interview with Ian about every aspect of the book,

49:19.080 --> 49:22.360
which was recorded, of course, but for a range of reasons that won't go into,

49:22.360 --> 49:26.760
we could never retrieve the recording, but there was a moment towards the end of that,

49:26.760 --> 49:32.120
that time that I particularly wished we'd, we'd got on camera, and it was a moment where Ian

49:32.120 --> 49:38.040
started welling up with, with tears, and it was speaking about Christian mythology

49:39.000 --> 49:44.760
and how beautiful you found it, and one question I have for you here is, it's,

49:45.800 --> 49:52.280
to speak of the sacred, might be threatening to scientific peers in a scientific context,

49:52.280 --> 49:59.080
and it might be risky, risky because you're invoking quality of life that's, well, you can

49:59.080 --> 50:01.320
tell me in a minute whether you think it's supernatural or not, or whether that's the

50:01.320 --> 50:07.960
right expression, but it's invoking something entirely natural, but outside of our normal

50:08.040 --> 50:16.040
sort of capacity to empirically perceive things that would be a more sort of orthodox

50:16.920 --> 50:23.000
way of looking at things, but in that moment, you know, I felt you emotionally were,

50:23.000 --> 50:28.360
you know, very deeply invested in this, and I've also noticed in some of the reviews,

50:28.360 --> 50:32.920
perhaps by Rowan Williams, perhaps by a few others, they wonder if you're sort of pulling

50:32.920 --> 50:39.640
your punches a bit, that actually, far from not including this in the book, you culminate in the

50:39.640 --> 50:49.640
sacred, and yet, even in the sacred chapter, it's quite cautious and quite tempered, and we just,

50:49.640 --> 50:53.640
I just wonder what stops you from saying what you just said towards the end there,

50:53.640 --> 50:59.000
something in, of the order that like, God exists, it's very important we come to know

50:59.000 --> 51:03.720
God, and our life should be directed in that, in that sense. What's, what's pulling you back from

51:03.720 --> 51:10.760
that? Yeah, I, I, I consistently, as you say, pull my punches for a good reason, and actually,

51:10.760 --> 51:17.480
at the end, I don't say, and I say that although I'm very suspicious of a lot of God talk, and

51:17.480 --> 51:22.680
although the very word God produces all kinds of complications that need to be dispensed with,

51:23.000 --> 51:31.720
but I think we're too quick to say we can bypass this or dismiss it, and that I think it's our job

51:32.440 --> 51:38.920
to try harder to understand what this ancient truth that people have always believed is about.

51:38.920 --> 51:45.880
Why do we think we're wiser than they were? And I do actually say that nothing I have experienced

51:45.880 --> 51:53.560
is in a sense more certain to me that there is some meaning to this idea. And that's expressed in

51:53.560 --> 51:59.960
that way carefully, because as Jesus said, we should be as wise as serpents, but as gentle as

51:59.960 --> 52:07.880
dubs. And part of my job was not to draw people to Christianity, I think I'm a rather bad Christian,

52:07.880 --> 52:13.480
and I'm not a committed Christian, and I don't go to church. On the other hand, I cannot think of a

52:13.480 --> 52:20.680
more wonderful mythos, and I use that word without any implication that is false. The mythoi by which

52:20.680 --> 52:26.360
we live are the most important kinds of truth, and if you think you don't have one, you've probably

52:26.360 --> 52:31.240
bought into the one of our age, which is that everything is a machine. That's a myth as well.

52:32.200 --> 52:42.200
And I think it's such a powerful myth about a God who is involved in the creation in such a way

52:42.200 --> 52:48.600
that he actually also experiences suffering, although there's a complex concept in theology,

52:48.600 --> 52:52.760
by the way, because he may be so-called impassable, but I don't want to go into all the details.

52:52.760 --> 53:05.560
But the beauty of this idea, and the extraordinaryness of the art, and the music, and the poetry,

53:05.560 --> 53:12.840
the architecture, the words of the liturgy, the words of the King James Byron, I think these are,

53:14.360 --> 53:19.880
they speak to me directly, and I came from a family that were neither very well educated nor at all

53:19.880 --> 53:27.640
religious, and I sort of first encountered all this in my early teens, and I just thought whatever

53:27.640 --> 53:33.400
it is that I've been taught to believe about the world is not right. I need to commit myself

53:33.480 --> 53:37.240
to understanding this, and I thought that I would probably actually become a monk after I'd

53:38.680 --> 53:44.600
gone to Oxford and graduated, but by then I saw sense and realized I'd be a very bad monk,

53:44.600 --> 53:49.160
and would also make a very bad monastery. So there we are.

53:50.360 --> 53:54.920
Just a little follow-up. We heard from Linda this morning about fortune telling,

53:55.800 --> 54:00.600
and in my group afterwards we spoke about astrology, and there's a sort of

54:04.120 --> 54:09.160
book you may know by Jeffrey Kreipo called The Flip, which is premised partly on seeing

54:09.160 --> 54:13.960
consciousness as primary, but not just that. There's also a lot of parapsychological data in it,

54:14.520 --> 54:18.920
and he's arguing that really there's a moment at which suddenly the world looks very, very different.

54:19.560 --> 54:25.320
Now my impression, knowing you for many years, you care very deeply about your scientific

54:26.120 --> 54:31.080
authority and respectability, and for good reason, but I also wonder if, you know,

54:32.040 --> 54:38.600
to what extent can we go there as it were? To what extent is it legitimate to wonder if the

54:38.600 --> 54:43.640
eaching might actually speak to you, or the tarot cards might actually have something to say about

54:43.640 --> 54:49.800
your psyche that's meaningful? Is this beyond the pale, or is this...? Well, not to me.

54:51.560 --> 54:58.440
I'm far from being able to say that I know or experience or have in my world picture the whole

54:58.520 --> 55:08.040
story. I haven't, none of us has, and it's the hubris of modern humanity that seems to me it's

55:08.040 --> 55:16.040
worst trait, and what we need is a massive dose of humility which may come, alas, with societal

55:16.040 --> 55:25.320
collapse, but we certainly need to re-embrace modesty, war, and compassion rather than anger,

55:26.200 --> 55:35.480
division, power struggles, and all of that. There are a couple of things really, and

55:37.000 --> 55:41.720
one of the things I forgot to say, and I just want to say this about why I didn't bang on about

55:41.720 --> 55:46.760
Christianity is that as I say I'm not necessarily sure I'm a Christian, but I also didn't want to

55:46.760 --> 55:51.080
be exclusive. I didn't want people to get there and go, oh God, he's a Christian, so now we've got

55:51.080 --> 55:57.400
one of all that, but I wanted to draw on religions worldwide, and I found that they had enormous

55:57.400 --> 56:02.200
wisdom and that these wisdoms cohered, and what's more they cohered? With the position I'd been

56:02.200 --> 56:12.840
arguing for through neuro psychology, philosophy, and, um, slightly physics. I have a band of what

56:12.840 --> 56:16.440
I call tamed physicists, and when I want to say something in physics I, there are people who

56:16.440 --> 56:21.960
approached me and said, far more than biologists, this book is terribly interesting to us as physicists,

56:21.960 --> 56:25.800
I know that's good, so then I tend to, is this okay to say, and they go very up, probably.

56:27.800 --> 56:36.920
So why am I saying that? I just don't want people to think that anybody should be excluded from this,

56:36.920 --> 56:42.200
even though to a very, very tentative, and I often think that the honest agnostic is the closest

56:42.280 --> 56:44.920
to somebody who's really honestly searching for God.

56:47.560 --> 56:48.840
Sorry, where were we before that?

56:48.840 --> 56:51.080
Well, just that, um, I think,

56:53.240 --> 56:59.480
yes, um, well it depends what you define as natural and supernatural, and I think that

56:59.480 --> 57:04.680
lots of the stuff that we've now sequestered in the cupboard mark supernatural is not at all unnatural,

57:04.680 --> 57:09.960
it depends how you look at things, if you happen to notice certain things and things,

57:10.040 --> 57:14.760
events in life or reading something can make you open your eyes to it, you start to see it,

57:15.480 --> 57:19.240
and that doesn't necessarily mean that it's real, I think we should be skeptical,

57:19.800 --> 57:23.240
I think that scientists are not skeptical enough about their own findings,

57:23.800 --> 57:28.840
and I think we should be skeptical as thinkers, as philosophers, as scientists,

57:28.840 --> 57:32.600
but I also think we need in the end to be skeptical about skepticism,

57:32.600 --> 57:36.600
in the sense that you can take it too far so that you're paralyzed and don't really know

57:36.600 --> 57:40.840
that you can believe anything, that would be a mistake, but you see, it's not,

57:42.200 --> 57:47.560
what one believes is not something one worked out in a seminar room, it's not just the

57:47.560 --> 57:53.320
culmination of a series of propositions, the root of the word belief is from love,

57:53.320 --> 58:01.240
it's liven, you know, and the old English word leaf, dear, and um, what we believe

58:01.800 --> 58:08.680
is very importantly what we are attracted to is right, what we have faith, faith is uncertain,

58:09.800 --> 58:15.480
faith is incompatible with certainty, and faith is more valuable than certainty, certainty means

58:15.480 --> 58:21.080
you're certainly wrong, it's one of the only certainties we can have, and so it's very important

58:21.080 --> 58:26.200
to maintain this idea, I mean I want to say this whatever, because I think it's so important,

58:26.200 --> 58:31.640
a reconceptualization of truth, truth is not something out there, a distant goal that we

58:31.640 --> 58:39.160
can work our way towards, truth is something we can encounter in this world, and it's not a thing,

58:39.960 --> 58:46.760
it's a process, it's a journey, and it's about not something being definite, but of a continual

58:46.760 --> 58:52.840
unconcealing, so we are unconcealing the truth, we are sweeping away misconceptions as we find

58:52.840 --> 58:59.960
our way to it, as we find our way to God, whatever you mean by that word, and this idea of truth

58:59.960 --> 59:05.720
is very important, because truth is at the basis of fidelity, when we talk about truth,

59:05.720 --> 59:11.960
and Calvin just talked about two surfaces that are true, indeed they say they marry, and truth

59:12.600 --> 59:19.560
is what happens when warring factions stop fighting with one another, and come to what

59:19.560 --> 59:27.400
we call a truce, a truce is derived from the word true, and truth is something that we uncover

59:27.400 --> 59:32.280
in the business of living, so it's a very different thing from what goes on in the seminar room

59:32.280 --> 59:38.280
usually, but if the seminar room takes into account pre-socratic philosophers,

59:38.280 --> 59:41.160
modern phenomenological philosophers, it may get close.

59:43.480 --> 59:48.120
Okay, thank you, so questions now from the audience, if you can put your hands up, I think

59:48.120 --> 59:53.000
I'm going to have to do this roving for the recording sake, so the mic is there to be recorded,

59:54.200 --> 59:57.160
I think if you want to ask a question, but you don't want to be recorded, let me know,

59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.200
but I'll assume you do, so I'm going to bring the mic to you, and I'll begin,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:11.960
yes, does anyone else want to play the roving role? Nick are you sure? Okay, so then we'll take

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.360
these two at the front, if we can take a few together, it helps, not too many because it can

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.280
become overwhelming, but maybe two at a time, and we'll see how it goes.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.920
Thank you Ian, I think we all want to thank you for persevering with the million words.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.520
You live on sky, I live in a tiny house on wheels in the Derbyshire Dales,

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.360
and I'm very careful what goes in, and your book is in, so thank you.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:49.720
Thank you. You say consciousness is primary, for you is consciousness mental or material,

01:00:50.440 --> 01:01:00.600
or neither of the above? Okay, is that one? Thank you Ian, I'm looking at the two lights behind

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.720
you which are on all the time, and it made me think about the right hemisphere and the left

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.960
hemisphere, do they flicker one on then the other, one on the other, or are they both

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.440
on at the same time, or do they fade in and out, do you have a sense of that? We take those two

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:24.440
together. I'll deal with that question first, and based on our hemispheres are operating all the

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:38.680
time. Which one is guiding our attention is more a matter of a divided role, and so effectively we

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.800
don't need to be thinking and shouldn't be thinking that we are just using our left hemisphere or right.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.760
What I'm talking about there is a short hand, I believe that in this world when we enter into

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.400
discourse we don't like contradictions, if you contradict yourself that's almost worse than

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.920
talking nonsense, anyone will listen to nonsense as long as it's coherent with itself, but actually

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.880
truths are often very very complicated and require different things that we go, well that

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.800
doesn't add up, I mean the left hemisphere is very quick to dismiss anything that seems

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.440
contradictory or paradoxical. The second question, or the first question actually,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.680
and is very good, but I think that what you've done there is reinforce a division that I don't

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:24.680
think is correct between the mental and the physical. So consciousness is the ground of

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.600
both mental and physical life, and the physical life is the material expression of consciousness

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:40.200
which we also have in an immaterial way. So consciousness, let me give you this image,

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.400
and what is water? Well you think you know what water is, it's that translucent stuff that flows,

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:54.200
but it's also that very hard opaque white stuff that's extremely cold and can crack your head open,

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.840
and it's also in this room, I mean this upper part of this room is filled with water,

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:04.280
but we're alive and we don't see it. So there are different ways in which consciousness can be

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.800
manifest, and if you like a congealed form of consciousness is more of a matter. I want to

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.720
get to the position where I don't collapse the division between my mind and the consciousness of

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:23.400
the rest of the universal garden law with you, but we don't collapse the two, but we don't entirely

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:29.240
divide the mind. We live in a country in which we think division means separation, but it doesn't,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.520
it doesn't mean actually having to separate. It's being able to see the difference, and the best

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.920
example of this is in a bar magnet, where there's another north pole and the south pole, they're

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.240
completely connected to one another, but they never separate. In fact night and night can possibly

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.920
exist without the other, it isn't a hard division where they cease. Okay, thank you. Wow, more

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:58.600
hands. Okay, Isabella and Milky, just opposite. Yeah, thank you again for this great talk. I moved

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:07.720
again to hear your story, and I'm most interested right now to hear whether you had an experience

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:16.120
that brought you to the place you are right now in terms of your feeling of the sacred,

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:23.160
or was it purely through studying? So from my experience, reading you and poetry has brought

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:30.840
me as close to a religious experience as I've ever had, and that sounds too much, but it is true,

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:36.040
and I'm wondering whether it's for you becoming a scientist and doing the work and thinking

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.680
concessually and feeling something that you didn't get from that that brought you to digging

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.080
deeper and then having an experience or the other way around. Okay, thank you, and take Milky's

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.880
question as well, please, just there, Nick. I believe you kind of touched on it with your

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:59.320
conversation with Jonathan, but you mentioned four elements, science, rationality, imagination,

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.920
science reason, reason, reason, yeah, and I forgot the other one. Imagination, intuition,

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:10.200
but there is, I think there is a missing, at least it appeals to me, memory, memory,

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.560
remembrance, footprints of people who have been, you touched on it at the end, I think, in your

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.840
conversation, and another thing I wanted to add was if you give an advice to a technologist,

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.880
someone working in the tech sector, what would that be? Okay, I'll just speak that one in the end.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.560
How do you save the world from AI quickly? So Isabella's question, where did the sense come

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.960
from, from ratiosination and study, or from some kind of revelation or experience?

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.880
It's never come from revelation, and oddly, I didn't think I've had any revelations in

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.720
I mean, other than suddenly, wow, when I experience a work of art and something like that, I don't

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.360
know whether that counts, or just a very beautiful scene. I've been saying, oh wow, all my life,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.480
are these really revelations? Not in the kind of way that I think you're suggesting. So it's

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:07.000
been an equation of experience that has been cohesive since I was a teenager. I mean, I

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.160
remember as a teenager having a very strong view that the whole was not the same as the

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.640
sum of the parts, and I couldn't explain it, and people would say, so what's this mysterious

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.120
something else that gets put in when you put the parts together? And of course, I didn't know how

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:26.280
to answer that, I wouldn't know now, but so he was continuous as a piece of life.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:37.640
The question that you asked, Milti, yes, memory. You see, the way I think of that is that he's

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:45.080
a sort of subset of all the things I've mentioned. So science needs to remember to amass, and to

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:52.360
bear in mind past experience. Reason is based, in my view, not just on logical working of things

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:58.520
out, but being able to make the right analogies to see the correct context, all of which comes from

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:04.040
experience, and one way of talking about experience is memory. And I would say the same thing about

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:09.880
intuition and imagination that they're fed into by memory. But thank you for drawing my attention

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.400
to it, because I think memory is a very interesting topic. And I'm thinking hard about

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.640
actually what I think about memory now, because we're beginning to think that living organisms

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:29.800
must respond to imprints that we can't find in DNA, and they may be in fields that bear such

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.560
memories. This has been considered rather wacky in the past. I hope Rupert Sheldrake will live

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.280
long enough, dear man, to see himself indicated, as I'm sure he will be.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:46.520
Thank you. And just a follow up on Isabella's question, because it was such a profound one.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.000
You did say that you're not enduring the talk. I thought I heard you say words to the effect

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.240
that if you there was something along the lines of if you listen, if you attend,

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.960
you will feel a response. It wasn't it wasn't quite if you listen for God, you'll hear,

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.760
but it was a little bit like that. And so I just wondered to push back slightly on what you said

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.000
about the accretion, because that makes it sound still quite safe. There is a sense in which you're

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:20.840
experiencing a relationship in your life, is there not? Many relationships with the divine,

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:29.000
if one can say that, I believe, with nature, with people. And I sometimes think, you know,

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.040
you mentioned, if you listen, you'll hear God speak. I do listen, and God doesn't speak. And

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:47.640
I sometimes said, look, it wouldn't hurt you just once. They something. Does human family

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.320
you are there in communication with me? And then I made it, I think, and maybe that is God speaking

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.480
but I spoke to you this morning when you looked out of the landscape. I spoke to you this morning

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:05.560
when you got a phone call from your door. I speak to you all the time. What's the problem? Okay,

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:11.240
wonderful. Thank you. More questions. Darius and Zordek, just one over this corner here,

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.520
because then we'll get the cluster. You can see a cluster emerging. We're coming to you.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.920
We'll take Darius and then we'll move to the cluster. Thank you. So you've been using two

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:26.040
sets of terms. One is ground of being, and then you've also talked about God. So

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:34.280
is that a distinction that is clear to you? I mean, God is generally like a personification,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.600
some entity with a personality, while ground of being connects to other traditions like Taoism,

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:48.520
which do not personify the ground of being. It's a profound mystery. And once we personify it,

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.200
we're actually over defining it and making too many assumptions about it.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.680
I think we'll take this. No, you're not such a big one, I think. Basically, we just asked,

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.880
is God a person if I understood it correctly? I think so, because it's too big to get with

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:15.880
another question. A very good one. Of course, what I mean by the ground of being is that which,

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:23.480
in a way, doesn't kickstart being in a temporal sense. It's not the cause in the sequence,

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:31.400
but that underwrites all being. So it is there as the ground of being. And

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.760
this is where I want to mention the Trinity, a Christian concept, although I discovered that

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:45.400
it's actually a very ancient concept that was in many pre-Christian belief systems.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.280
But at school, this always seemed to be manifest absurd, and I always felt

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.560
a squirm factor when the Trinity was mentioned. I mean, what is this about the man, the boy,

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:04.120
and the bird? It doesn't make any sense to me. As I matured in my thinking, I realized it's

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:11.960
extremely important as an expression of what I was much more able to accept, which is Panentism.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.720
Just to gloss out for people who are not familiar with the term,

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.560
Panentism is the belief that God is just the sum of everything. I don't believe that.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:26.280
But Panentism is the belief that God is in everything, and that everything is in God,

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:32.600
has its being in God. So that God is never separate from anything in the cosmos. And

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.520
the way in which that manages to work for me is that it manages to bridge

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:50.040
the debate about whether God is... What's the word? I certainly lost the word.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.800
Female? Female? I'm just kidding. That wasn't the word.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.240
No, whether God is... I hate this.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:08.760
With transcendent, whether God is transcendental or imminent.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:16.120
And I believe that it's important to be able to hold both of these things without

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:23.160
collapsing into one or the other. And in that sense, God is both the sort of ground of being

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:30.200
and the process of this cosmos. I said that it was in, or he, or however you like to put it.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.800
I mean, it's unsatisfactory. She is also unsatisfactory. I just stick with he because it's

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:44.600
conventional. And he or whatever is that other is also in the process of creation

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:55.400
and is present in within us right now. And it was made clear to me by a simple Franciscan monk

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:00.840
in my teens who said, well, think of it like a book. Where is the book? Is it in the mind of the

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.840
writer? Or is it in this book on the table here? Or is it what happens when you read the book?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.360
And those are the three things. And it's also in Rumi. I like to be able to bridge these things.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:19.480
Rumi says it is the water source. It is the water that flows to the cup. And it is the water that

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.920
is drunk. Thank you. I can just check with the audience. I'm conscious of time and energy.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.600
And so at the beginning of the end, there's a cluster of questions here that we will take.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:37.960
But I'm just conscious that we're talking about God. And there was a time when I first met Ian,

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.560
maybe a decade or so ago, where that would have created quite a strong degree of discomfort.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.160
And I'm just wondering if anyone cares to put their hand up. If you feel that talking about God

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.480
is somehow discomforting, uncomfortable. Okay, thank you. Anyone else? Yep. Any more? Don't be

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.520
shy. I'm sure you have lots of allies. Right. Because some people might, yeah, this is sort of

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.240
tacit coercion, sometimes baked into the conversation. Just good to know you're, you know,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.680
that's not surprising. And many would feel it. Other questions now, the cluster.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.400
Can I just comment on that? It's exactly avoidance of coercion that led me into the position you

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.200
put me with first, because you don't seem to come out.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.520
I don't want any, I didn't want any of my readers to feel he's got design.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:33.080
But I don't, and I'm constantly, you know, going, it doesn't have to, nobody has that view.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.040
I do appreciate that's the intent. I'm also wondering, though, whether it's felt so palpably

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.280
that the intent is somehow less important than the experience that this is in the room, as it were.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.480
And so, okay, we have a cluster here. Let's take it. Yes, the hands have been up for a long time.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:59.080
Thank you, Ian. I wanted to follow up and dive a bit deeper into what you mentioned about friction,

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.360
as not only that, which creates resistance and conflict, but that which propels it sort of

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.360
the heart, at the heart of the fabric of drama and expression in the cosmos. And particularly in

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.200
within your work, how you see deception as an essential part of this friction.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.560
I want to differentiate it in two ways, perhaps the left brain side of deception being that which

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.920
is asserting a particular story to enable a certain way of being to sort of self-justify itself,

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:39.560
and the perhaps more right side, right side of deception, which would be

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:46.040
that which you find in the greatest forms of art, whether it's poetry or comedy or even science,

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:52.840
where it's a form of deception that unearths its own limitation, speaking to its own limits of

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.680
language, or it's something that unravels into further creativity. And I'll be curious how deception

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.360
ties into your work. Okay, Ian, thank you. We'll take a few more questions if you don't mind

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.680
hold the question about deception. One bridge was just in front of there, Nick, and thank you.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:17.000
Thank you, Ian, for your very important ideas. My thoughts are in Alice in Wonderland and Moby

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.840
Ticks, some very important ideas were hidden and passed on to a public that might not go very deep

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:33.080
initially. In the age of shortened attention span, which we have now, how would you feel and have

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:43.320
you thought about if your ideas were packaged in, say, a Netflix show or something that would

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.240
make it more accessible? And for what age group would you feel it would be most appropriate and

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:55.000
effective? Okay, thank you. So let's take those two then deception and then genres.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.680
The first thing I'd have to say about perception is to go back to the neuroscience.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.360
It was deception, right? If I heard correctly, not perception, but yeah, no deception.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.920
And the different kinds of deception that there was might be a kind of creative deception in the

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.720
right hemisphere, as I understood it, whereas the left hemisphere's deception is invariably

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:26.840
maladaptive in some way. If I've done justice to the question. To understand if I can relate to

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:45.000
right hemisphere deception. Well, yeah. The trouble is that I think that, as even Mike

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:54.120
Gazzaliga, who's the biggest mechanist in the world, believes the left hemisphere is not really

01:17:54.120 --> 01:18:02.920
interested in truth. And so it does project the most massive lies. And it's also vastly

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:10.840
overconfident that it's right. So it is the home of mistakes and deception. I'm trying to think

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.440
how the right hemisphere would deceive us, except in as much as it would not contain what it is the

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:22.360
left hemisphere can say or would say. So the left hemisphere is different from the right hemisphere

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.600
in its relation with the other hemisphere. So the left hemisphere is exclusive of the right

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.200
hemisphere, but the right hemisphere is inclusive of what the left hemisphere knows. And actually,

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.520
in the image of the master and his emissary, the title of my earlier book, it's the master that

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.920
actually instructs the emissary to go and do this work, expects the emissary to report back,

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:50.600
but the emissary goes off on a thing that it's the master. Okay. Yeah, I would just feel that

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.080
there's so much more to come. I don't know how to present. Yeah, it's it's it will hold the question

01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.680
in the air. And but the subsequent question about genre, I mean, you have had almost like I see a

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.160
sort of, you know, many different kinds of, I was about to say Russian doll, if I'm honest,

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.480
then I suddenly felt that sort of political weight of that. But I was thinking that the

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:16.040
number of different kinds you've had, you know, RSE animate that there weren't seeming any millions,

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.960
there's been a kind of documentary, there's been yeah, all that. And I have Jonathan very

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:28.600
much to thank for this, because he said after I'd given this talk, we have somebody who will turn

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.640
it into a cartoon. And I said, Oh, God, no, that's the absolute worst thing they can have, because

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.760
this stuff is already, you know, in most people's mind, the pop idea of the two hemispheres is

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.880
ridiculously caricature. I don't want that. And then after a while, he said, No, I've talked to

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.320
the guy and he's read your book, and he really understands it. Okay. And then on the day the

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:54.120
thing came out, the actual talk, it's about 11 months after the talk had gone up, my talk had

01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:01.400
12,000 views. That afternoon, the animate had 46,000 views. And so I'm completely converted to this.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:07.880
And I'm delighted to report, I don't know if you've known this, actually. You do, yes. The guy who

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:13.080
did it contacted me and said that he wanted to come and interview me for the purposes of making

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:19.720
some more. And he came and interviewed me for three or four hours. And he's going to make, he says,

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:27.320
five or six very short animus. And that will, that will be a very helpful move, I think. I don't

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.880
think it's that people have become incapable of this kind of attention, but they, you're quite

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.440
right that they need some kind of weigh in. They need a lure. Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. We

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:43.560
have a few more questions. So Nick, yeah, a lot. Yeah, thank you at the back. We've noticed you

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.360
at the site. I've noticed the two wings here. We have Dominic. I know Dominic, you've been trying

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:52.440
for a while, I get it. And we have, take one at the back first. Quick question. You, you're a very

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.120
observation. You're a very convinced monotheist. Whereas very convinced monotheist.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:04.680
No, isn't it? Monotheist. Whereas most religious people entertain the existence of many spirits

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.000
and beings and gods and goddesses and demons and so on. So that's an observation. The question is,

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:18.040
different traditions and communities use the word spirit or energy. And you use consciousness.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.200
Are they talking about the same thing? Or is there a reason? Is consciousness somehow

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:27.800
different? Talking about something different? Yeah. I think that's a big one, Nick. We'll take

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.560
that one first. I mean, ultimately, I say that these things can't be neatly carved out from one

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.920
another. But I still think it's very useful to use different terms. It's very important to use the

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:44.840
terms North Pole or South Pole correctly of a magnet. But, you know, effectively, they exist

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:53.160
together. They co-create one another and so on. I mean, polytheism is interesting. But I think

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:59.080
that it's a step behind what I'm trying to say, which is that is the union of division and union.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:10.120
So it's not unreasonable for this God that is, if you like, ever present in the world to take

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.960
different manifestations at different times. And maybe when I have an experience that I think

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:21.000
is of the sacred, then that is a very particular thing. And in the past, if it had taken place in

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.680
a wood or a mountain, it would have been a different God. I don't think that's really necessary.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:34.680
And I think that there are differences between spirit and consciousness and God. I mean,

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:44.280
consciousness is part of the cosmos that God is the ground of. What I mean by spirit is not just

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:51.560
my consciousness. My consciousness could be engaged in something absolutely nefarious or horrible or

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:57.640
trivial. But that is not spirit. What you mean by spirit, I believe, or what I mean by spirit is

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:02.200
something rather special, not just any other consciousness. And so we have a word for it.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.880
That seems to me okay. Okay. Thank you. There's so many other questions, Nick.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.520
And also, you've described yourself as a Taoist, but we'll come back to that maybe in

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:14.520
subsequent question. Yes, thank you. Yeah, I know. I know Dominic. Don't worry, saving the best for

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:22.680
last. I just want to thank you for the ways that you articulate and bring to language and things

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:31.560
around. Maybe I'll have a quiet voice. Just extending gratitude for the ways that you're

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:40.840
bringing to language. Matters of the sacred. Okay, try again, Zoya. Sorry.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:59.000
Okay. Just expressing deep gratitude for the ways that you're bringing to lexicon

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:06.840
ideation of the sacred and innate ways of knowing. I feel like the colonization of God

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.000
is like one of the greatest unravelings that many of us experience in this age.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:19.000
And I found the metaphor of the violin and that duality being important and of the

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.200
poles being really important, really poignant in this time of what we witness all around or what's

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:33.480
bombarded all around us around division. And I wanted to ask this, I wanted to like

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.320
zoom in on this duality of division and unifying or how you might bring that to words.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:45.720
What does that mean for each of us acting in this age in response to the extent of the divisive

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.680
epistemologies of material reductionism? What kind of rigor does that require of each of us

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:57.640
acting as agents? Okay, thank you, Zoya. Before you answer, we need to take the last

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.560
round of questions, okay, because I think just because of time. So I've got this question

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:08.040
in mind and hopefully you have too. Okay, quickly, please. Yeah. What's driving you? What's your

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:14.040
life's mission? Okay, good one. Good one. We'll hold that thought. And a few more, please. Yes,

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.760
Dominic, okay. Well, Dominic's going last because I've already promised that.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:24.920
Yeah, this is sort of related to what Linda was saying about. I was very struck by her talking

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:32.600
about this morning about things like fortune telling and which is a long way from the sense

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:38.840
of the sacred that I was getting from your book. But it's a lot more closer to what every day

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:47.480
understanding of the spiritual is. And there's one part in your book where you touch on near

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:54.680
death experiences, but say you're not going to go into that. And I suspect for the reasons you've

01:25:54.680 --> 01:26:00.520
already explained around other stuff with the spiritual. What I'm fascinated by is that near

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:09.240
death experiences are actually very, very well documented now. And in a way, if that were better

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:16.200
known, that might be a way of pushing us past this sense that the place we're in at the moment,

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.360
where basically humanism rules and says, when you're dead, you're dead. We've got the question

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.480
near death experiences question mark. And okay, Steve, and then Oh, we got one, two, three,

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.160
and then we're done. Okay, yes, please won't be able to answer all of them. But Ian's such a

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.000
brilliant synthesizer, he'll get to the gist. Okay, so question.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:43.560
I'm interested in how you feel this work is landing in society. So how have you been most

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:51.240
touched by the receipt of this work and most disappointed? Okay, great. And then Steve.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.840
Yeah, we'll go. Yeah, we'll take two more of them or them or really. Okay, okay, okay, okay,

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:04.520
let's let's answer that. So yeah. Okay, we can do two sets then if people can. Yeah, fine, go ahead.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.600
So kind of what I'm here for, but that's okay, go ahead.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:21.080
So Zoya has a question about the violin metaphor, the tension. What does it mean in real life?

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.040
How do you put it into action?

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.840
It's the technique, I suspect, not the microphone. Why is this? This always happens to me that the

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.040
person who's interviewing has a good microphone. This has repeatedly happened. There is a God,

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:44.760
after all. And also, I was amused when I was at the Chalk Valley Festival. I was being interviewed

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:49.880
by Jonathan Gaysman and he had 25 questions and we had about 30 minutes. And he said,

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.000
I'm going to try and be concise. And he said, well, I've never seen that before.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:59.640
But the trouble is that I'm trying to compress a lot. And that's my excuse anyway. I think that

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:05.400
the idea of the division and union is very important in resolving tensions because we're not,

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:12.120
but almost more important because I'm short of time, I'm going to say this. I think that the

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:20.920
elements that are required are humility, charity, or compassion, and a degree of awe before the

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:27.160
extent of the things we can't know, don't know. So people certainty that they're right, that the

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.400
other person must be wrong, that they must be terrible because they held an opinion that they

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:38.360
don't hold. This is all utterly horrible. And nobody should be forbidden to say what they

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.800
honestly and truly believe as long as they don't say it in a very inflammatory and horrible way.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.000
So I'm really worried about that in society. And I think the answer is not to ban people all the

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.640
time, but actually to do the precise opposite, but to sit people down and listen. And look,

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.040
it's not very complex. You can have marital therapy between a couple that are at one another's

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:03.080
roads. And you get the person to speak and then you say, no, your turn's coming. Now,

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:09.240
what did your partner just say? No, that wasn't what I said at all. Now, that actually would be a

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:15.640
very, very useful exercise. I'm going to be really annoying to you because I wonder why I'll say

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.760
something else while I'm on this topic because I didn't have a chance to talk about, which is

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:24.440
values. Effectively, there is only one value for the left hemisphere and its power. And the entire

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.480
debate about everything since about the middle of the 19th century from Marx onwards has been

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:34.360
about power. Every way we look at things is about power. It's the only value that counts.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.080
If you're an artist, it's no longer good enough to be beautiful. To have beautiful work is almost

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.920
a put down. It's powerful. And that's the only thing we respect nowadays is power. And you may say,

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:50.680
well, that's the way men have left it. But don't let's embrace that. Let's try to get away from it.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:57.000
Let's not just drill further into power. Let's talk about beauty, goodness, and truth. Until

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.840
we talk about beauty, goodness, and truth as our guide, we are stuffed. Now, there was another

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.800
question on another one and another. Yeah. Well, the big question was the purpose of your life.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.880
There was a big question about what's driving you and what's... Oh, yeah.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:19.560
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's quite easy to answer. I don't know. But in retrospect, my life has

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:25.880
made sense at the time it never did. Yeah. I mean, why did I... I wanted to do philosophy

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:30.760
at university, but for various reasons I didn't. It wasn't an honest degree, the one I wanted to do

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.040
philosophy and theology. So instead, I read literature. Why did I do that? I know. Why did I

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:43.240
switch to science in medicine? Why... In retrospect, it all makes sense. But what drives me is,

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:50.680
if you like... And it is a driver. It's a demon. I mean, I have a diamond in Plato's sense. It is

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:55.720
very cruel and won't give me time off and says, no, you might want to do that, but no,

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.680
you're sitting down at this desk and you're going to write. But the reason I want to do that is

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:06.040
because I believe that I have a vision that is coherent and I believe that it changes the way

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.560
people look at life. I know this. I absolutely know it from all the feedback I get. And so,

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:16.120
as long as I've got breath in my body, I'm willing to go around trying to promulgate it.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:27.480
My impression is that it's landing very well across the educated, intelligent reading public.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:35.560
There's a deafening silence from neurology and... No, not from neurology and psychiatry,

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:42.920
but from neuroscience. So I've had tons of wonderful messages from neurologists and

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:48.280
psychiatrists all around the world, but not from neuroscientists, except for Roman Chandran,

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.600
but he's a clinician as well. And so some very big names in the field have responded,

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.240
but what hasn't happened is I've been able to move on neuroscience. And neuroscientists are

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:04.520
people who let spend their life in the lab, but neurologists and psychiatrists actually encounter

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:12.840
people. And the brain has got nothing to do with people, but it has. And I've got

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:18.680
Mike Gazaniga on the film, The Storm, The Divided Brain, and he actually says, you know, he takes

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:24.440
these findings of neuroscience and so on, and then he applies them to the lives of real people.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.200
I'm not comfortable with that. Well, I'm not comfortable with you, Mike, because you're not

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:37.080
doing the job you should be doing there. Anyway. Well, is there really another one there? Are you

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:41.160
sure? Or do we just not get to it? No, there is. There's a man who asked me over here.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:49.560
There's one more question over here, which was, what has pleased me or displeased me? Yeah.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:00.120
Well, it's not the same. I want to respond to it. I was just asking about that thing about

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:10.040
near-death experiences. I'm not against them. I wouldn't mind having one. None of these things

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:18.440
ever seems to come my way, but maybe one day it will. But no, I'm appropriately detached from it.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:23.560
I'm prepared to believe the evidence. I know there are very good scientists involved in the area,

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:29.400
but I have enough battles to fight without people going, oh, I see. So he's one of those people

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:35.400
who believes in seances and things. I don't know what I think about seances. But I really have to

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:41.720
fight my battles a bit, and it's about restricting. I've got enough to cover without having to cover

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.080
things that will only land me in the soup. Okay. Okay. Stephen and Dominic. But I want, yeah,

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:55.640
who was the man who asked me what pleased me? Stephen and Dominic. All right. I want to say

01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:03.240
what pleased me and what didn't. You can answer that at the end. I can say, all right.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:13.240
Hey, and my question is, it might be a little late for this question now, but I'm curious,

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.440
why do you think we went in the direction in the Western world after the pre-Socratics in the

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:28.040
direction that we went and didn't follow what, you know, some of the profound, because I'm with you,

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.360
I think the pre-Socratics are extraordinary. So why did we take that direction?

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:47.080
Dominic. So actually, my question is quite quick, I think. Do my tongue. Perhaps it's quick,

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.720
but I wanted to go back to the brain. And you said something, you were talking about Jude

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:58.280
Coravan, and you said that animate life enables the speed of consciousness. And I wondered why

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.480
that's important. And then it was kind of a follow up on that question, which was related to what

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.520
Linda said, which was, could we, you know, you're talking about consciousness and matter,

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:16.120
and could consciousness be another way to think of time and that matter enables the flow of time?

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:27.560
Okay. If I could remember all of that when we get there. So history of ideas, yes.

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:35.480
I mean, really, so is not to waste time. I don't really know. I think what happened was there was

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.040
a great deal of commerce with the East, with India, with Persia, and so forth, and that many of the

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.560
ideas one finds in those cultures and in Greece at the time of the Pre-Socratics are very consonant

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:53.400
with one another. And then something happened in which we took a step back and started to inspect

01:35:53.400 --> 01:36:01.080
ourselves more self-consciously. And that's what gave rise to this process. And I found something

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:05.960
very interesting in Whitehead the other day, which is a society thrives until it starts to

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:16.520
overanalyze itself. I believe that's where we're at now. Yes. Well, rather as I said before,

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.080
there's a reason why we have these different words because

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:33.640
yes. Yes.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.960
Yes. All right. I think probably the way I put it was suboptimal. Thank you.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:57.800
What I would have been better to say was that responsiveness is what life magnifies. So

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:04.040
there is a way in which inanimate matter is responsive if water comes, eventually it moves,

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.400
and so on. So there's a kind of very slow process, but it's not going to give rise to a satisfying

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.080
sense of the divine. So you need to create, as it were, creatures that are much,

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:22.040
much more responsive. And they respond faster, they respond more deeply, and they respond more

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:28.360
broadly. So that's what I meant to say. And I think that's what life brings to the party.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:36.760
Finally, I think we have a chat. No, no, no, there's a time thing. Yeah. I mean,

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.520
in the chapter on time, I think we miss, I suggest that we misconceive time because we don't

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.720
understand the nature of flow. And consciousness may be a kind of flow. But first of all, I'd

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.640
have to talk about how flow is different when you're inspecting it from the outside,

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:57.560
and when you're actually in it. And so when you're standing on the edge of a river with

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.880
stopports and a clipboard, time and the river seem to be passing. If you get into that river and

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.880
move in the exact flow of the river, time will appear no longer to be an issue, because you're

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:17.720
moving with it. And so time is in itself absolutely fascinating. But I wouldn't want to say collapse

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:27.640
it into consciousness. I think time can exist without our self-consciousness. If you say that

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.640
it's part of the structure of the universe, which I believe it is, and consciousness is the origin

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:38.040
of everything there, then I see what you're getting at. But I'm just nervous of conflating

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:46.040
things that ought to be kept separate. No, I just wanted to say, I mean, I really,

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.000
my first book I wrote in my twenties was called Against Criticism, and it sold about 400 copies,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.080
and it then got unceremoniously remained it. It's slightly satisfying to me that if you now

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:07.720
try to buy a copy, it will cost you £2,000. But I didn't believe that the master and his

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.200
emissary would take off. I genuinely didn't, and it caused a change in my life, because I actually

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.800
gave up the day job in order to lecture and write further. And the good side of that was I could live

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:26.600
on sky, and the bad side of that was that I took a 90% cut in income. But what has really

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:34.920
staggeringly moved me, and it really does move me every day, is people who write to me saying,

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:42.520
this book changed my life. I mean, if an author gets that once in a lifetime, they should be

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:50.520
overjoyed. But I do hear it time and again. And people also say, which makes me feel I must be on

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:58.600
to something, somehow I knew all this, but I had no way of articulating it, defending it,

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.480
but you have given me confidence. This is so moving. I mean, after all, one of the reasons

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.320
I went to the psychiatry, I can say is because I wanted to investigate the mind-body problem.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.920
That's true. That's very sort of top level. But another level, I had wanted to be a monk. I

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.960
decided I didn't really want to be a priest, but I felt very happy being a doctor. And I had a very

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.080
warm relationship with my patients. And one of the things that crossed my mind is if I'm going to

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:31.160
retire from that, that's going to give a huge hole in your life. Actually, it didn't, because I've

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.520
met so many people through this work, and I was freed to do other things. But anyway, I just wanted

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:43.960
to say that I'm enormously grateful to them for that. And I hope that people will continue to write,

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:50.200
because everybody's contribution is somehow different and increases the feeling that it was

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.320
okay to go through all the loneliness of the long-distance runner, because it really has been

01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:01.800
a very, very, very long and hard grind at many times. And I don't really, although I may appear

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.840
to be confident, I don't really have that kind of imposter syndrome. And when people say, no,

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.640
this thing really means something to me, that means something very great to me. So I just

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.480
want to thank you all very much.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.540
you
