1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Welcome. Good to be here. Thank you for coming. My name is Jonathan Rousson. I am Director

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,040
of Perspectiva and I have known Ian for 12 years, I realized today, and in that time

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,840
come to understand his work, I hope, and certainly enjoyed his work and found a great

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,920
deal of importance in it, and we're the very proud publishers of The Matter with Things,

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,560
which is an extraordinary book over two volumes, and the paperback has just come out officially

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,320
today. So tonight's event is partly a way of marking the, I don't know if it's still a launch

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
when it happens the second time, but the kind of re-enchantment of the book through the act,

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,000
let's say, and Perspectiva, for those who don't know, we think that based on the

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,800
data we could receive from who's joining tonight, roughly a third of you are familiar with

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,120
Perspectiva, and maybe roughly two-thirds not so much. We are a charity based in London,

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,360
although our reach is quite global because of the digital world, and we have staff that are

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,840
outside of London as well, and we are funded primarily by the Fetzer Institute in the USA,

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
and I say that now because that's what makes tonight's event being free possible,

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,120
that and an additional funding that we've received, particularly for this event, and

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,160
Perspectiva, it's worth just saying a few things about it to contextualize why we're

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,200
interested in Ian's book and what the series is about. So we sometimes call ourselves an urgent

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,360
100-year project, and it's interesting when you say that. Some people hear the 100 years and think

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,440
that's far too long, and the point of saying urgent 100-year project is deliberately to get that

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,600
problem of sort of playful paradox being somehow the reality of things, that we think that we do

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,920
urgently need to rethink the world, reimagine the world, we conceive the world, but at the same

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,640
time, it's not something that is in kind of action panic mode, we're not in the business of

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,560
trying to put fires out as such, we're trying to reconceive the world from first principles and

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,160
give intellectual permission and social permission to people who want to try to reimagine how the

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,560
world might be, not just next year, but in 10 years or in 100 years, and that kind of work often

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,280
takes quite a philosophical dimension, but a lot of our work is also applied, we do a lot of

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,840
sort of social innovation of various kinds, and of course a publisher, so there's more to say,

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,400
but if you'd like to understand perspective a better, someone can put in the chat our website

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,200
and do have a look around. Although tonight's event is free, you are very welcome to make a

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,000
donation, if you're interested in the work we do already, or if you're becoming interested,

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
and later after this event, we'll be asking if you want to sign up to our

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
work and get to know us better, so first of all welcome, and I'm very grateful to Ian for making

32
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:22,880
it possible to have so many of you here. So this series is called Attention as a Moral Act,

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,680
and I want to just draw your attention to a line in the first book here, The Big Tomes,

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,200
so it just takes a second to come to it, but Ian, for those of you who don't know Ian's work,

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:46,240
and I'm assuming we're working on the assumption that you mostly do, and he says here, we'll just

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,360
find it, yeah, it's not a small claim, Ian says this right at the beginning of the introduction,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,360
I believe we have systematically misunderstood the nature of reality, I believe we have systematically

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,760
misunderstood the nature of reality and chosen to ignore or silence the minority of voices

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,880
that have ensured it as much and consistently maintained that this is the case.

40
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Now we have reached the point where there is an urgent need to transform

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,240
both how we think of the world and what we make of ourselves, attempting to convey such a richer

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,160
insight is the ambition of this book, so he sets himself a very high bar that we're systematically

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,280
misunderstood, misrepresented reality, and what's interesting for me as a civil society,

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
leader of a civil society organization is, many people ask how to make Ian's work relevant,

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,920
and this is a non-trivial task, as someone who's been alongside it in some way for 12 years,

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
it's not as simple as because Ian says X, the policy should be Y, it's never that simple,

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,360
but Ian's comment there does point to this quality of kind of the need to reconceive

48
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,800
who we are and what we're living for at a very fundamental level, to have a chance of surviving

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,600
and thriving in the 21st century and beyond, so the stakes are kind of high, so the combination

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,120
of the really high stakes, but often the quite deeply philosophical content makes it a particular

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,000
kind of discussion, it's important for me, our job here in this series, is to try to move the

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,240
conversation towards people beginning to perceive it and experience it and understand

53
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,840
the view of the world presented in these books in a way that allows them to act differently,

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,200
not as kind of premise to conclusion, but as a shift to perception, a kind of metanoia,

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,320
sort of completely new frame of mind that allows them to live differently, to prioritize

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,720
differently, and so on, so that's what this series is about, and we call it attention as a moral act

57
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,800
to get to that feeling of it matters how you attend to the world, and these books help to explain

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,360
both what that means and why, and we're going to have, we already have scheduled for two weeks

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,960
time Zach Stein, and then laterally, soon after that, we have Phoebe, Zach Stein will be speaking

60
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
about value, value-ception, the notion of value as being something that you can actually perceive,

61
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,600
a very profound notion in Ian's work, Phoebe Tekel will be grappling with imagination,

62
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,440
she's an imagination activist she calls herself, so she'll be interested in the kind of theoretical

63
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,240
basis of her work, Bonito Roy will be speaking about the notion of what it means for a society to be

64
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,200
insane, whether we are in some meaningful sense insane, the book's subtitle, as you may know,

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,800
is our brains, our delusions, delusions, sorry, delusions, and the unmaking of the world, so

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,840
this notion of what it means to be deluded at scale will be that focus, and then we also have a

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,680
discussion on the physics in Ian's book with a physicist, Philip, can you remind me of his second

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,600
name? Philip Goyle. Philip Goyle, sorry, Philip Goyle, who will get into the sort of the depth

69
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,720
of the physics that underlies some of Ian's theorizing, so that's ahead, and then we have

70
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,520
another six or so after that, and we want this conversation to go on to try and really tease

71
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,160
out from unusual places what to make of Ian's work, like how does it help us reorient to the

72
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,920
situation of the world at the moment, so that's all going on, and I think I've mentioned everything

73
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,080
essential, so the first question really, I want to speak to Ian tonight about something I call

74
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,800
the McGillchrist manoeuvre, half and jet, totally an earnest, but we're going to come to that a

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,560
little bit later, the first thing I want to do really is most people here know Ian as a talking

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,160
head, perhaps from Channel McGillchrist, perhaps from a lecture, and they'll know his writings

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,560
from his books, but there is an intellectual formation story, you know, Ian sometimes gives

78
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,920
the impression of being a polymath, but it wasn't always thus, and so I'm interested in if you could

79
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:08,400
please, slowly but surely, yet somewhat quickly, talk us through the key turns of your intellectual

80
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,600
formation, because you appear to have this sort of polymathic erudition, and I suppose I mentioned

81
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:24,240
doesn't know where it came from. Well, as with all polymathic erudition, it's probably not as

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:32,720
exciting as it looks, but it started in childhood, I was a very, I was kind of a curious child,

83
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,080
and that's probably true as well, and I was interested in many things, my father was a doctor,

84
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,560
but it was mainly my mother's father, my grandfather's interest in science that fired my

85
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,560
imagination as a child, he used to love going to stay with him and being, he showed me many

86
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,920
fascinating things in science, in the workshop, in the garden, and so on, and that made me think,

87
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
wow, this is something I really need to know more about, and I suppose that was the general drift

88
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,800
of my intellectual life, until I, at the age of 12, which is of course a very important turning

89
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:23,760
point for everybody, I got to be at a school where I could explore many things, and I've really

90
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,760
always been philosophically minded, there were a number of things that occurred to me and seemed

91
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,680
terribly important that were different from what everyone taught me, or what everyone seemed to imply

92
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,080
at any rate, and these were things like, that the whole is never the same as the sum of the part,

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,240
you know, when I used to say this to people, they'd say, well what is this magical something extra

94
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,080
that goes in there, and at the time I felt, you know, well, that's all very well, but it's not

95
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,720
quite right, but I couldn't articulate it at the time, I can't now I think, and I thought that the

96
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:16,160
world was not a sort of unresponsive lump of matter, it was a deeply responsive, vibrant,

97
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:25,600
living, reverberative experience in that whatever it was was a two-way process between

98
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,160
the world around me, particularly the natural world and me, I thought that opposites were not

99
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,400
necessarily as far apart as people seem to think, in fact I started to think that opposites often

100
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,920
seem to coincide and that the further you push something, the more you approach the very thing

101
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,320
you're fleeing from, I thought that history generally seemed to move in spirals, not in a

102
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,960
sort of linear trajectory, and I thought that the general tendency of the analytic mind that

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,480
was very much prized in my education, was to take things, abstract them,

104
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,120
decontextualize them, and render them no longer unique and alive, and this was an odd thing,

105
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,280
because doing this was important, it was definitely what we did, and I seem to be good at it,

106
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,680
but I also thought this is not enough, and then, I ultimately-

107
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,440
Your thoughts are arising when you're 12, or is that rather when they began to?

108
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,920
No, I would say probably about 13 or 14, and what happened at the school I was at,

109
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Winchester College, was that you did your own levels in the first term, or at least by the end

110
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,000
of the third term, the end of the first year, so at age 12, when I got one's own levels out of the

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,440
way, and the rest of the time was free to really explore many things, and there were three strands

112
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,640
to it, one was a science ladder, one was a humanities, i.e. the history and languages,

113
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,440
and the other was the classics, and everybody had to, whatever they chose as their special area,

114
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,560
they all had to do a hard core that never drops things like mathematics, history,

115
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,320
English, and so forth, and I started off, in short, by jumping onto the science ladder,

116
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,960
because that seemed to me the thing that was most interesting, and I very quickly found as my

117
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,440
mind unfolded in this, and as I became slightly more of a mature person than I was at 12,

118
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,800
that things like history and literature were vastly important, so I hopped at that one,

119
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,800
and then finally I hopped to the classics, so that rather unusually, I managed to straddle

120
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,200
all three of these things, I've never been able to seem to make up my mind about what it is I

121
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,920
particularly want to specialize in, and then I wanted to go to Oxford to study philosophy,

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,880
and particularly the kind of philosophy that was not the terrifically dry splitting of hairs,

123
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,840
but the kind of philosophy that saw into the depths of things and had a place in it for the

124
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,440
idea of a god, because I came from a god, I can put it this way, from a godless household,

125
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,880
I mean one in which we never went to church, my parents didn't talk about that kind of thing,

126
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,560
to being in my teens struck by the force of what one can only call the sacred in nature,

127
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:45,040
in music, in art, and in the fellowship and community in which I lived, so I was changing

128
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,960
at that point, but I'd always wanted to do philosophy, and as I say I was excited because

129
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,520
in Oxford there was a course called philosophy and theology, which was just what I wanted to do,

130
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,280
so I did the exam and I went up for interviews, and I had to do the exam in some school subject

131
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,080
which just happened to be English literature, and the people who interviewed me said, oh you can't

132
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,400
do philosophy and theology, it's not an honours degree, so in 1971 philosophy and theology was

133
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,760
not even an honours degree at Oxford, there's a simple reason it had only just been founded,

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,160
and I don't think it had had time to acquire that status, but they said instead you must do PPE,

135
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
philosophy, politics, and economics, and I'm sorry to say this to somebody like Hugh Jonathan

136
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,280
who's learned and excited by both philosophy and by both politics and economics, I'm not

137
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,880
particularly, and I wanted the other thing, and they said well look, I don't want to do that,

138
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,640
so they said well come and do literature because it's quite philosophical if you want it to be,

139
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,080
and so I did, I read English literature, after I got my degree I was then

140
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,440
encouraged to sit the exam for Old Souls College which is an odd college, it doesn't have any

141
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,160
students, not graduates, not any kind of students, it's really just a kind of an intellectual

142
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,440
hot house for people who can be assumed to be somewhere near the head of their game,

143
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
and it was a very exciting seven years I had there, when I arrived there.

144
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,760
I was thinking before the seven, before you got admission, I want to pause there because I happen

145
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,040
to know something that's of interest to the audience maybe, I took the exam myself I believe

146
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:34,240
in 2001 and did not pass, but I do remember the, at that time had one of the five papers being a

147
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,760
single word essay question, and the one was diversity which is quite curious given the

148
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,440
current world, but what's also curious is I believe yours was on evil, and do you remember

149
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,760
what you said about evil that got you admission to Old Souls?

150
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,600
Well I wouldn't have remembered, but a philosopher Derek Parfit was a colleague who was so

151
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,320
taken with that essay that I wrote that he photocopied it, and when I became a fellow he gave

152
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,840
it to me, so somewhere in a box in the attic if I could ever find it, there is that essay.

153
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,240
I was alarmed because I sat in this room with I suppose 20 people,

154
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,840
we were competing for at maximum two fellowships, and very often one or none were appointed,

155
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,200
and in the room people started to write after five or ten minutes, and I sat there and I was sort of

156
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,600
thinking half an hour went by, I could see everyone scribbling, I still wasn't writing,

157
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,720
three quarters of an hour went by, and finally at two hours I was just so, if you like wired,

158
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:51,040
I just thought I've got to write, and I just did in that hot fire of the pressure of time.

159
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,640
Anyway that was that, it's an extraordinary exam, I hope it's not too different these days,

160
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,800
it seems to me to be able to try and take in people who are not just very good at their

161
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,400
special thing, but actually can think broadly about many topics, say there were general papers.

162
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,640
It was you who told me and that they did away with the one word question in the exam.

163
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
I think they have done, I think they have.

164
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,960
The quality had decreased so much that they weren't sure it was worthwhile.

165
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,760
I don't know if that's the case, I think that was the case with the language, there was a language

166
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,320
where you just had to translate as many pieces as you could in three hours from Greek, Latin,

167
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,440
German, Spanish, French, Russian, and Italian, I think it was. Anyway, I think they stopped doing

168
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,680
that, I'm sorry about the essay because I think it was a real test of something,

169
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,880
a kind of ability to think broadly and differently. But they do still have, I think,

170
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,720
the special subject papers alongside general papers, so you could, it doesn't matter what

171
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
subjects you're taking the exam in, you have to answer some general questions. Anyway,

172
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,880
there it was. And when I got to all servers, I had planned to do a thesis on 18th century

173
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,480
literature and ideas, the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism.

174
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:24,800
But a number of people, but most vocally, again, Derek Parfit, a very, very considerable

175
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,120
philosopher, I think by most people considered the greatest philosopher of his generation,

176
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,440
had started as a historian. And he said to me, you don't know where you may want to go,

177
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,120
don't do that, you've been given something very special, you can do a doctorate at any college,

178
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,080
but you've been given seven years in which you can do anything and there'll be no questions asked,

179
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,920
you can read what you like. So I did, I spent that time doing a lot of things, I read a lot of

180
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,840
science, of course, but I also read philosophy, went to philosophy seminars and other things,

181
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,040
I found myself a Russian teacher and so on. So that just generally broadened my horizons.

182
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,680
But I began to think at the end of this, what am I going to do next? I don't want to just

183
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,960
to go into some sort of normal academic rut. There's something wrong with the way we studied

184
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,120
literature. And I wrote a book called Against Criticism, published by Faber in 1982, in which

185
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,840
I laid out the philosophical basis for why the academic study of literature is somehow

186
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,200
vitiated, it destroys the very thing it's trying to get hold of. Anyway, I won't go into that,

187
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,480
except to say that in brief, I thought there were three important things about, say, a poem,

188
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
was that somebody in the past wrote something that they thought was very meaningful and

189
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,840
important, so important that they poured some very, you know, they suffered in order to produce

190
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,040
this thing. And along we came with our clever, sneering attitudes from the 20th century and sort

191
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,560
of encouraged to deconstruct it in a certain way. But more importantly, what happened was that we

192
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:11,200
abstracted something that was deeply contextual and embodied. We generalized something that was

193
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:21,200
unique. And we lost the sense of the living thing that we were looking at that is unique,

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,440
embodied, and implicit. And in the process of analyzing it, we'd taken this importantly implicit

195
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,440
material out and made it explicit. And that's as deadly as explaining a joke, explaining a poem

196
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,480
is, you know, death to the poem. So I wanted to move on and I got very interested in this

197
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,600
issue, what was wrong, and it struck me that it was to do with the mind body problem that we

198
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,840
neglected the body. And I was familiar with the philosophers, I went to their seminars and

199
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
heard what they had to say about the mind body problem. But it seemed to me they were just too

200
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,560
disembodied in their approach. And so I thought I not to do something more embodied about this.

201
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,560
And at that time, Oliver Sacks had just published Awakenings, which was one of the many sort of

202
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:20,880
real milestones in my intellectual development. Because here was somebody who related illness to

203
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,600
an analysis of what we are when we are well and healthy, who related what was going on for an

204
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,920
individual person, beautifully realized in his text. And he was able to see in it,

205
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,640
general truth, general philosophical truths through that highly individual vignette.

206
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,680
And that most of what he was saying was actually in the footnotes, it was as implicit as it could

207
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,880
be. So anyway, I thought, well, I want to be somebody like Oliver Sacks. And that meant going

208
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,200
to medical school and learning neurology and going into psychology in the overlap area between

209
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,520
neurology and psychology. So I did that. I became a doctor.

210
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,120
So still down to some words for a second, just because you seem to be saying two things there.

211
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,840
One is, in a very real sense, your first book on literary criticism prefigured the master

212
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,320
in his emissary that came much later. There was a sort of very clear overlap and the kind of

213
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,400
concerns you had. Yes. Which even went back to my my adolescence at school. Yes.

214
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,920
Right. And the second thing is that there's a very clear figure of admiration that sort of

215
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,040
propelled you forward into a way of looking at the person scientifically and philosophically.

216
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,480
I want to make sure we've been a number of days. Yes. Now, I'm worried about just taking up too

217
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,920
much time. It's worthwhile because people don't know these my senses. They don't know these things.

218
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,040
And it's good to work in the land. So then you go to medical school and later become a psychiatrist

219
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,160
and particularly Baltimore, right? And their brain scan things happen.

220
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,840
That's right. But perhaps just before that, I should say that I was at the Maudsley Hospital

221
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,480
in London, the Bethelman Maudsley Hospital, which is a great British teaching hospital.

222
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
They would like to think the greatest British teaching hospital in that area.

223
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,040
And I heard a lecture there one day by a man called John Cutting, who became another

224
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,760
influential figure for me. He'd just published a book called The Right Hemisphere and Psychiatric

225
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:34,160
Disorders with O.P. Oxford. And anyway, I almost didn't go to this lecture, but thank God I did.

226
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Because in it, he talked about the differences between the hemispheres, which are nothing like

227
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,040
what I'd heard in the pop psychology stuff that is all too widely or used to be all too widely

228
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,160
believed. I think I've done something to erode that now. But what he was saying was that the

229
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,320
left hemisphere doesn't seem to be able to understand what is implicit. It understands what is explicit.

230
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:07,600
So it doesn't get tone of voice, humor, metaphor, irony, sarcasm, facial expression, bodily posture,

231
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,240
all the ways in which we communicate meaning. Secondly, it tends to categorize. So it takes

232
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,840
the unique thing and it categorizes it so that the uniqueness is lost. It becomes a representative

233
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,200
of a type. And the third thing that I remember, but so relevant, was of saying the right hemisphere

234
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,640
is literally more in touch with our embodied being for a number of reasons. I don't need to

235
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,280
mention, but to do with its more rich connections to the limbic system and its relationships to the

236
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,200
hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. Anyway, that fascinated me. I went to talk to John afterwards,

237
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,600
and I then began some research on hemisphere differences. And then I went to Baltimore,

238
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,720
and I was able to join a research group in which people were looking at hemisphere differences.

239
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,320
This was very exciting for me. And I became involved in researching into the abnormal

240
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,200
symmetry or asymmetry in the brains of people with schizophrenia. So in the normal brain,

241
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,480
there is a reliable finding that the left hemisphere is broader and bigger towards

242
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,000
the back and the right hemisphere broader and bigger towards the front. But in schizophrenia,

243
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
this is often either absent or actually reversed. And interestingly, the very parts that get

244
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:40,000
affected by this are the parts that underwrite some of our most important capacities for making

245
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,120
sense of the world. They're what's called hetermodal association cortex, particularly the

246
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,920
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and parts of the cingulate.

247
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,880
So these things are very important, and they are abnormal in this condition. And that was

248
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,120
terribly exciting. I was able to map these things and take part in research into it.

249
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,360
But I also, at the same time, received an excited message from John Cutting saying,

250
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,760
you must read a certain book. It's absolutely essential to everything you and I are concerned

251
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,680
about. And it was Louis Sass's book Madness and Modernism. And its subtitle is Insanity in the

252
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,920
Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought. And this extraordinary book, extraordinarily clearly

253
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,080
and beautifully written, is the product of a mind that was able to range over many things,

254
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,440
over literature, over philosophy, obviously, over psychology, and over the visual arts.

255
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,040
And what he seemed to show was about 20 to 25 aspects of modernism, if you like, the culture

256
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:58,800
of the 20th century, mainly, and postmodernism that overlapped with elements in the experience

257
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,600
of subjects with schizophrenia. And I kind of knew this, as soon as I read, of course, of course,

258
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,960
it was really the most beautiful moment at which something happened to me that people say happens

259
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,480
when they tell me now, when they read my work, which is kind of, of course, I've sort of realized

260
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
this, but had no way of articulating it. Anyway, I mean, obviously, it couldn't be that we'd all

261
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,400
suddenly got schizophrenia, we haven't. But what seems to have happened is that we have ignored

262
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,960
the input of the left hemisphere, people with left hemisphere overdrive or right hemisphere

263
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,800
deficits, look at the world very much in the way that people with schizophrenia do, they become

264
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,240
frankly deluded. And that's why the word delusions is important in the subtitle of the book, The

265
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,520
Matterway Things, because I really believe that we are now in a world in which we have lost touch

266
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,360
with what the right hemisphere could have told us, and we are becoming deluded about what we are,

267
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,200
what the world is like, and so on. So that is some of my intellectual evolution. All these

268
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,080
influences were very important. And I spent the next, I suppose, 20 years writing The Master and

269
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,320
His Emistry. So that really takes you up to the beginning of that one.

270
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,160
So okay, great. Thank you. Well, I hope that was useful for people. It certainly is for me.

271
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,080
And like you said, that takes you up to the publication of The Master and His Emistry,

272
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,200
which I believe it took about 20 years to write, although you were working at the same time, I

273
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,120
suppose. I was working about 55, 60 hours a week at the time. And it only took me 10 years

274
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,080
to write the longer book The Matterway Things, but I was writing full time.

275
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,640
You also, yeah, okay. And so then The Master and His Emistry came out to mostly

276
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,040
critical acclaim, although some critical, some critical aspects of that too, but mostly acclaim.

277
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,360
And then a documentary was made about your work by Vanessa Dillon. And you've been on shows with,

278
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,720
I don't know, John Cleese and, you know, various other people that are very well known household

279
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:22,160
names. How do you, you feel fulfilled in? Do you feel like you're like at a personal level,

280
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,600
you've done your work in this world?

281
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:32,560
That's an interesting thing. I think the answer is I can't help being

282
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:43,120
delighted, touched, and filled with a sense of, yes, of something having gone right. When people

283
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,840
tell me what my work means to them, that is the important thing. And it's not,

284
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,640
yes, I've been on all the chat shows and I've met the various people, but it's,

285
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,800
it's actually when people, individual people that I didn't know, write to me

286
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,280
in the loveliest terms, saying what a difference it has made to their life, not just to their

287
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,200
intellectual life, their thinking, but also to their, to their relationships, to their work,

288
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
to everything. And that is, I think is the thing that fulfills me. That is the moment,

289
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,200
that is when I say, okay, it's, it's all worthwhile.

290
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,640
Okay. So I can tell you why, what it means to me. Now, it's a good segue to get to what I felt

291
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,080
recently. So as you know, Ian, I read the entire manuscript of the matter with things,

292
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,040
including all of the appendices and notes, which all inclusive, I believe, comes to,

293
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,360
quite close to a million words, if not actually there, when you factor in absolutely everything.

294
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,720
And I read quite a lot of it on train journeys. I think I said in the launch party of the event that

295
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,200
it was a time when I knew I had to interview you about the book. And I was struggling to read with

296
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,800
my job and family, just finding the time to, to read it. So I actually created excuses to go up

297
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,200
and down to Scotland a few times to meet extended family and made it sound like it was all about

298
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,600
them. And it was, I was also getting myself chunks of five hours each way to read the book.

299
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,720
Anyway, while, while reading it, I noticed something that kept recurring. And it was as if

300
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:23,440
it was a musical note that you hear come into a song every so often. And at the time, I couldn't

301
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,360
quite place it, but we spoke a bit about it when I was on Sky. And it had a certain kind of pattern

302
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,720
to it that I've laterally called the McGillchrist maneuver. And since then, I've been reading the

303
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,520
book more closely. And I think the heart of the McGillchrist maneuver in so far as it means something

304
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,840
is, is the primary hypothesis of the, what you call the hemispheric hypothesis,

305
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:56,080
which is broadly the, the brain functioning well, presencing, allowing the world to presence

306
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:04,880
itself to our own kind of appraisal and perception, then a kind of imperceptible shift towards left

307
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,000
to sort of make sense, categorize, and understand, then I sort of shift back to the right, no longer

308
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,520
quite the same for having received the input of the left. So the first McGillchrist maneuver is a

309
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,160
kind of right, left, right of that form. But then there's a more subtle one, which is a little bit

310
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:31,440
more analytical sounding, but it's very useful for public conversations, because you hear a lot of

311
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,560
people saying, you know, you're thinking in a two binary manner, it's not either or it's both and,

312
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,800
right? There's a very common refrain, you hear it a lot in sort of popular culture even. And,

313
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,680
what your argument suggests, and you're not probably the first to say this, but you say it

314
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,360
particularly well, and it falls out of the hypothesis as well, is that it's not so much that it's

315
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,640
either or or both and it's in some meaningful sense, either or and both and, but not to the same

316
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,640
extent, right? And that's the kind of like it's many layers of subtlety on that. But you begin to

317
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,120
see this in several different parts of the book. And where the heartland of that maneuver lies,

318
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,080
the kind of source code of it is in chapter 20. Chapter 20 of the book, I can say to people

319
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,080
watching this is the business. If you want to read one chapter of your fundamental work,

320
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,480
honestly, and you think if you've got a glimpse of the argument in general terms already is most

321
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,440
of you have, either from the prior book or just watching a video or whatever, I think you can

322
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,320
understand chapter 20 by itself without much other information. You need to know something

323
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,280
about the hypothesis, but not that much. Chapter 20 for me is like the hinges on the door between

324
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,920
the sort of scientific and philosophical appraisal and the sort of cultural implications.

325
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:58,160
And for those who don't know, chapter 20 is rendered into simple English as the coincidence

326
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,960
of opposites. But the word coincidence, as Ian points out in the book, has somewhat been tainted.

327
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,280
But nonetheless, so you use the Latin, I guess, coincidence. How do you say it? Coincidence

328
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:21,760
here? That's the one, right? Thank you. And this is really a beautiful, beautiful chapter.

329
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,920
Because I think that if people who are on a slightly more applied side of things, working in

330
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,320
stable society organizations concerned about climate change, interested in how the arts can

331
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,400
influence culture and thereby influence behavior or whatever. In chapter 20, I think we see

332
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,560
a shift in perception that is really generative of a different way of viewing the world and acting

333
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:54,640
in it. And I say this, knowing that earlier in the book, in the first volume, you begin the

334
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,320
book by targeting reductionism. Reductionism is kind of the public enemy number one in the first

335
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,880
part of the book. And I think more precisely, reductive materialism. And you make a very strong

336
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,680
case on that, and that stands on its own terms, and it has its own validity and so on. But I think

337
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,200
actually for people in the public realm, trying to fight against reductionism with something more

338
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,920
holistic of the kind you offer, is not necessarily as powerful as

339
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,960
recognising this McGilchrist maneuver in chapter 20. Because what happens there is, the enemy there is

340
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,680
not so much reductionism. It's actually the law of non-contradiction. And the law of non-contradiction

341
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,920
basically says, you know, it can't be night and day, that you can't be right and wrong, it can't

342
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,440
be black and white. And this chapter basically says, actually it can. And in many, many meaningful

343
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,160
senses, not only can it be this, but this is the beating heart of reality. These opposites that

344
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,000
are in some kind of meaningful relationship with each other actually are closer to the heart of

345
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,600
things than the law of non-contradiction would ever be. And if I could just read a few of the

346
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,880
statements you make, for example, you speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality.

347
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,960
I'll just get my notebook which fell under the table, one second. You speak about, yeah, you

348
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,960
speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality. You speak about the

349
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,120
unity of unity and multiplicity. And you also speak somewhere very profoundly, this is the

350
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,840
thing I want to ask you about now, because it relates back to your also's essay on evil indirectly,

351
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,800
is you speak about the equal necessity but unequal status of spiritual opposites.

352
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,760
And this is where you're getting at, it comes from the myth that you begin the second volume with,

353
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,680
but it also speaks to the perennial battle between good and evil. And again, the McGillchrist maneuver

354
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,040
here is very valuable, because what you seem to be saying is it's not that it's the world's either

355
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,280
good or bad, it's not either or, it's not that it's simply that it's good and bad, that's not

356
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,320
quite right either, it's that it's good and bad and it's somewhat more good than bad for particular

357
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,040
reasons. That's how I, at least that's how I read it, so please stop. How do you see it?

358
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,040
Well, I suppose the first thing to say is to anybody who hasn't read the book, I'm not sure,

359
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,760
apart from really in that opening myth, which is just absolutely staggering, which is

360
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,840
something I learned about, comes from an Iroquois people called the Onondaga.

361
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,800
And it's unfortunately too long to go into now, but it is the most stunning introspective

362
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,120
understanding of how the right and left hemispheres work together, that's the way I would look at it.

363
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,120
I don't really talk about the spiritual much. I address that in the last chapter,

364
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:10,240
28, because I don't want to lose my audience along the way, and I know how all the misconceptions

365
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,720
that surround the idea of the spiritual, the divine and the sacred will lose people,

366
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,600
but I want very strongly to show them that if they follow where I've been and you see the world in

367
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,640
a different way, there's nothing that's irrational or unintelligent about embracing

368
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,800
this idea. There's something very important about it. And I do, yes, I do in that chapter,

369
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,360
chapter 28, at the end of the book, I do briefly talk about the nature of evil, but it's just a

370
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,000
very personal thing. I can't believe the idea that evil is simply a kind of

371
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,440
lessening or falling away of good. I think it has its own dynamism. I think it's real and to be

372
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,880
reckoned with. And I think that this is part of the whole picture of the cosmos, which is that

373
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,760
there are different drives, if you like, that are both needed. And the intellect may try and get rid

374
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,040
of one or diminish one, but actually, that's just cheating. And so when I talk about the

375
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,840
coincidence of opposites, and I use the Latin term coincidentiopositorum simply because it was

376
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,680
the way in which it was first talked about by Nicholas of Cusa, a very interesting philosophical,

377
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:35,280
scientific-minded cardinal in the 15th century, and by Jung, who I think is enormously important here.

378
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,400
And as a psychiatrist, I can vouch that, you know, however good you think you are,

379
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
there is a dark side. And that dark side is very important and recognizing it is enormously

380
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,600
important. The failure to recognize it and understand it leads to damage, destruction,

381
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,400
and disease. And so it's a hugely important thing for each of us individually, but also

382
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,720
for a society as a whole, to realize that in pursuing headlongs, a very simple goal that

383
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,000
looks you perfectly good, you're destroying all kinds of other things that may be very important.

384
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
And if you push it too far, you may actually achieve the very opposite of what you intend.

385
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:27,040
I mean, a very obvious case of this is that anarchy leads to tyranny. So we need, what I'm

386
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,760
definitely not saying is, and people might say, oh, well, if he's saying something about the

387
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,520
coincidence of opposites, doesn't that leave us unable to say anything about anything? Because

388
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,160
really, anything and its opposites are true. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that context

389
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,720
greatly matters. And that these things share in some important way, their qualities.

390
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,760
So we need not, in fact, to reach, we must essentially never reach the position where we've

391
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,000
abolished both of these and just substituted some warm mediocre soup somewhere in the middle.

392
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,800
My point is, we need to hold both of these realities maximally, and yet hold them together.

393
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,120
And this is beautifully imaged in a whole range of ways in the philosophy of Heraclitus,

394
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,280
pre-Socratic philosopher, for me, most important philosopher in the West anyway,

395
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,120
that ever lived. And he has this image of a loop string or a lyre string,

396
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,600
and also the string of a bow that shoots an arrow. And his point is that it needs to be

397
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,200
pulled in opposite directions. And it's very nature, it's very power to do anything at all,

398
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,920
to give a note, to let the arrow fly comes from that tension being held. Now, that is what we,

399
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:54,000
that is one of the many things we don't perceive. We also don't perceive that reality has this

400
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,560
circular spiral like me, I prefer spiral light, because in fact, it doesn't circle back to where

401
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,520
it was. It circles back to somewhere that seems rather like it, but is now higher up the spiral

402
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,000
because things have happened, time has moved on. But that is an ancient image too, you know,

403
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,280
empedically, it's thought that love and strife are the two elements that cause the world.

404
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,160
And it's there in many philosophies around the world. We can't do away with one and just have

405
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,120
the other as Alan Watts said, we can't just have the peaks and not have the valleys.

406
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,400
Right. So we don't get that right. We don't understand that progress is never linear,

407
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
that you're curving back towards the very thing that you fear. And unless you watch out for it,

408
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,000
you will go to the place you really don't want to go to, that everything needs to be seen in

409
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,520
context. And the way in which we talk now is to take things out of context. So all that could in

410
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,760
a way, if you like, be implicit in that chapter on the current sense of opposites and you found it.

411
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Yeah, but also the other thing that I was struck by when I read this by you earlier,

412
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:08,560
you say very amusingly, but very perturently here, that in your many talks, and you've got

413
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,160
lots of audience feedback and lots of questions, and you say there is a way you put it to me was

414
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,800
there are two things people want, and they can't have either of them. And as I understand it,

415
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:26,400
you can correct me on this. But the first is that they want one thing to be better than the other,

416
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,240
first of all, so they want the left hemisphere to be bad and the right hemisphere to be good.

417
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,000
And that's not right. We really want the goodie and the baddie. They want the kind of manikin,

418
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,240
right hemisphere, let's all create a right hemisphere world and forget about the left

419
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,560
hemisphere. I'm kind of bitch. It's not that at all. But they also struggle with the idea that

420
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,920
if there's two things that matter, that they necessarily matter equally.

421
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,120
Right. And these things like these two points, I know that for you, they're self evident now.

422
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,440
But I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I read this thinking, how can how can this book

423
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,600
be translated into some form of praxis in the community that I feel as though this kind of

424
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,000
this kind of capacity to see that you can have two things that are both really important.

425
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,160
But one is more important than the other. And yet the other, they need each other.

426
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,240
It's actually counter cultural. It's not actually there as one of our sort of memes of operation.

427
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
All the things I'm saying are counter cultural because I believe our culture is founded on

428
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,080
simplistic falsehoods. We've mistaken the nature of reality. That's what I'm saying. And in the

429
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,440
first seven pages or so of the matter of things, I lay out all kinds of things that must strike

430
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,640
people as very improbable. That for example, relations are prior to the things that are related.

431
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,560
Get that. But I stand by that throughout the book. So and just for one, but it's in the

432
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,200
master, it's in the image of the master and his emissary. The master needs the emissary and

433
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,840
knows it. The emissary needs the master but doesn't know it. There's an imbalance in this

434
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,880
relationship. And the emissary is good as long as it remains the emissary. The master is good

435
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,280
as long as the master remains the master. But when the emissary tries to be the master,

436
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,480
it falls apart. Now that image, I didn't know that. I only found out about it afterwards and in the

437
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,520
writing of the matter with things is central to many cultures. There are examples in Chinese

438
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,880
mythology, in Indian mythology, in North American native people's mythologies and so on.

439
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:37,280
Of this usurping force. And it's actually the subject of what is arguably

440
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,440
the greatest epic poem in the English language, Paradise Lost. It's precisely the story. So

441
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,240
this is a very important one. There's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere as long as it

442
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,480
knows its limitations. But unfortunately, one of the features of being limited is that you are

443
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,840
limited in your knowledge of your limitations. I mean, it's not just that it's limited and

444
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,520
it has to find its proper place in relationship. It's wonderful. It's glorious. It's an extraordinary

445
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,400
capacity, right? And with all due respect, I mean, people have said of your two volumes and

446
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,160
almost million words, it looks like the left hemisphere has won. But I think you would counter,

447
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,200
I think, that this is in the service of the right, which is also quite a valid contention.

448
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,960
Absolutely. I've spent my life struggling to bring the left hemisphere into service to what

449
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:36,400
the right hemisphere knows. So it is quite true. The book is absolutely stuffed with real science,

450
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,640
with hard science. So 5,600 references in the new book, it goes much further than the master in

451
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,040
his hemisphere and exploring this difference between the hemispheres and nobody can say I

452
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,760
haven't researched this properly. I don't think there are very few people alive in the world who

453
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,480
would be in a position to have read more about it than I have. So there it is. And I use reason.

454
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,520
Reason is my friend, not an enemy. It's just that not everything can be encompassed by reason.

455
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,000
Reason can't explain why a wonderful piece of music is as wonderful as it is.

456
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,160
There are, intuition and reason are both important. And again, when I chose the master

457
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,920
in his hemisphere as the metaphor, I didn't know that quote that is attributed to Einstein, that,

458
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,960
you know, the rational mind is a faithful servant, and the intuitive mind is a precious gift.

459
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,000
We live in a world which honors the servant but has forgotten the gift. Well, in the second part,

460
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,800
the middle part, as you know, of the matter of things, I look at reason, science, intuition,

461
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,280
and imagination and basically suggest that all of these are very important in their different

462
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,640
ways and we need to be able to make use of them appropriately. Okay, all well taken. And as always

463
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,320
with your book, there's a kind of hermeneutic kind of process going on in which you have to go over

464
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,240
many different aspects of your argument again and again until the full picture becomes clearer.

465
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,480
And one of the things I was struck by, again, just focusing on chapter 20 for a second,

466
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,360
it is the case, and sorry, not if, it clearly is the case. You argue it well, it's very compelling,

467
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,360
I believe it, that we live in a world of the coincidence of opposites, a world in which resistance

468
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:21,920
is a critical feature of life, opposition is necessary, movement or primary and all of the

469
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,640
things that you argue in the second volume. If that's the case, it's natural that we'll

470
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,040
struggle to perceive that without the language forms to perceive it. So on the one hand, what

471
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,040
you're getting is a lot of people broadly of the right hemisphere perspective, insuiting that you're

472
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,640
right. Of course Ian's right, this is why your book's so successful. Have you read Ian's book?

473
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And yet when it comes to trying to put it to work, without the language forms to

474
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,840
actually render this back to the right hemisphere in a way that gives a fuller picture of context,

475
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,160
we'll struggle. In that respect, I was very struck that there are at least three words

476
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:04,000
in chapter 20, big words, and there's no lack of them in the books, that I feel people don't

477
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,120
really know, I know they do not know them, but the fact that they don't know them means they

478
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,960
can't really perceive what they're pointing towards as well. So the first is hormesis,

479
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,840
the second is syllapsis, tell me about the finesse there, and the other, and I always struggle to

480
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:29,280
say this, but the enantiodromia is another. Can you talk us through what these three words mean

481
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,680
and why they matter? Because I think we sort of need to know to get a sense of what we're talking about.

482
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:44,560
Hormesis is a term from physical chemistry, originally, and it refers to the fact that

483
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:51,360
something that is toxic in substantial doses may actually be helpful and health-promoting

484
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:59,040
in small doses. There are certain very obvious examples of this, one is digitalist derived

485
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,960
from the Fox Club, which is extraordinarily poisonous, but has been used since the 18th century and is

486
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:13,200
still the basis of the most effective treatments for heart failure. Arsenic, which has also been

487
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,200
used for 2,000 years, in very small doses can be extremely helpful, they're obviously large doses

488
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:27,040
and atropine, which is derived from deadly nightshade, can restore function to people with

489
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:36,400
certain neurological diseases. But it really was first described and probably is still most used

490
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,160
in describing the effects of radiation, where large doses of radiation can obviously be damaging

491
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,800
and cause cancers, but small doses of radiation can in fact be health-promoting and can in fact

492
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,000
prevent the development of cancers in laboratory animals. It's all to do with the scale. Now that

493
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is so important, because what was I saying earlier, if you push and push something, you lose it.

494
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,880
And actually it says this in the book of changes, in the Yi Qing, he who doesn't know when he has

495
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,640
achieved enough, but pushes further, loses it. So that is very important. And there's an interesting

496
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,240
observation that makes it vivid here. When people were looking at the biosphere 2, which is an

497
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:27,360
enormous protected environment, which was erected to see how plants and even animals would respond

498
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,320
to being in this protected environment, they were puzzled by the fact that healthy trees

499
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,240
tended to fall over before reaching maturity. And what they discovered in brief was for a tree

500
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,320
to grow, it needs wind, it needs the stress of the wind to develop what is in fact called stress

501
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:49,600
wood, which is the core strength of that tree. And this is something that, funnily enough, although

502
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,280
not presumably known in that form to Nietzsche, Nietzsche actually says this in 1870, something

503
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,520
that in relation to human beings, that we need adversity. In a very simple way, we need adversity

504
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,800
because, as you know, I think that everything is in motion. And contrary to the Newtonian image

505
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,600
that rest is the normal state and that motion is an aberration, motion is the normal state and

506
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,000
rest would be an aberration if it could ever be achieved. But to achieve that, we need friction.

507
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,480
Friction is the thing that stops motion, that's how you would describe it. But it is also the thing

508
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,880
that enables something to get started in moving. So that is Hormesis. One more thought on Hormesis

509
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,800
here before you get to syllapses. For those of you who remember, there's a film called Dances

510
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,520
with Rules with Kevin Costner, just to bring it to popular culture for a second. And the premise

511
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,520
of this movie is basically a sort of white frontier pioneer person getting lost within a sort

512
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,400
of Native American tribe and at some point he's captured and there's a kind of meeting around

513
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,920
the fire to discuss what to do with him, what to kill him, what to send him back and so on.

514
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,880
And I'll never forget watching this because one of the Native Americans is particularly aggressive

515
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,960
and being for blood. He says, we must kill him, we must kill him. And I remember thinking all

516
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,720
the others are like passing the peace pipes and kind of, you know, looking very quintessentially

517
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,960
wise indigenous knowledge kind of picture. And yet this one guy is like a warrior saying we need

518
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,520
to take him out now. And I remember feeling at the time, it's really important that he's there.

519
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,280
It's not that he's right, but there was something about that energy being in the room as a kind of

520
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,480
counterweight to the, it's not exactly Hormesis, don't get me wrong, but it's a similar spirit

521
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,800
of this thing that's in a small dose valuable. If they were all like that, you'd have a different

522
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,600
problem. And similarly, Ian, just to nail this point, you said that you prefer your dark chocolate

523
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,560
at 70%, is that right? Yes, correct. Yes, I do. Can you please tell me why is it because

524
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:03,440
because as you increase the percentage to 85 or 90, it becomes less pleasing. It's simply,

525
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,560
this is why all the really best dark chocolate is 70% or 70 something percent.

526
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,080
The others are used for cooking because they're a pure chocolate essence, if you like.

527
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,360
There are many things that are like this. For example, in Scotland,

528
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:31,520
you know, putting a lot of water in whiskey is considered a sacrilege. But a very tiny bit of

529
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:38,640
water in the whiskey is necessary to enable it actually to unfurl, unfold. It's in a richness.

530
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,720
And there's a joke I like, perhaps I may be indulged in it, in Scotland. In Scotland,

531
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,160
if you ask somebody, will you have water in the whiskey? The reply is, will there be room?

532
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,200
Anyway, perhaps I could talk about. In credulity, there will be space for the water.

533
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,200
For the water. So let's move on to

534
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:13,360
salapsis. Salapsis is, in fact, the Ionian or Ionic form of the word salipsis in Attic Greek,

535
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,760
which is the one that's best known to philosophers. But it's the one that Heraclitus used. And he has

536
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,800
a fragment, which is extraordinarily dense in my view. And it goes like this.

537
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Salapsis, and the word is grasping in English, grasping, holds and not holds convergent,

538
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:44,080
divergent, consonant, dissonant from all things one and from one thing all. And I think that is

539
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,880
just extraordinarily rich. I mean, first of all, this idea of the word salapsis or salipsis is

540
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,520
something to do with a sudden comprehension, grasping in that sense, it brings things together,

541
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,400
the other idea of, you know, coincidence. And it also signifies fertility, which comes about

542
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:12,800
through the coming together of the gametes of the two sexes. So it says many things at once about

543
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,360
this deep nature of reality, that it comes in glimpses or grasping moments of insight,

544
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:25,280
and that in that insight, it's neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply hold

545
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,360
or simply not hold, neither simply like nor simply unlike. Each thing, as I say, working with and

546
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,560
by the same token working against the others, the one and the many may bring things into reality,

547
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,080
they bring one another forth into being generating a reality that has this structure of its core.

548
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,680
And that despite or in the light of all this, perhaps because of the nature of this multiplicity,

549
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:56,000
all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here that's not paired with an antithesis.

550
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:07,200
So I think that that idea is very rich. And I know what you're saying is so how do we get that into

551
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,840
into dialogues in places where people are making decisions? I think the first thing

552
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,640
is that we need to, we need to emphasize that while we are busily pursuing a single goal,

553
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,680
we're neglecting all kinds of other things that are disappearing as fast as we're achieving that

554
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:32,960
goal, that we need therefore to be very measured and see how far we should go and not go further

555
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,920
unless we destroy that we need to respect the fact that when we bring things together,

556
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:47,040
they remain unique and individual. This is not an abolition so that when a society is cohesive,

557
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,200
it doesn't somehow destroy the individual, but actually enhances the individual. The individual

558
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,840
can only be fully an individual with the background of an integrated society. That for example,

559
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,160
when we move towards the future, we need to remember where we've come from in the past.

560
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,600
We need not to jettison the knowledge that was painfully acquired by thousands of years across

561
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,480
the world. People now, without even knowing what they're rejecting are too quick to say,

562
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,600
well, we can make something new. Yes, we can. Things are always new. A river is always new.

563
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,080
A plant is always growing. Everything is growing and changing. Everything flows,

564
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,920
as Eric Leiter said, but you don't just cut it off from its roots.

565
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,760
All of these things are things that are worth saying. I think rehabilitating intuition is

566
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,960
important. We haven't got time to go into all of that, but I have three whole chapters on intuition.

567
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:48,160
But this constant dismissing of intuition is a mistake, I believe. Sorry, you were going to say

568
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,320
something. I wanted to hear also before making sense of what these things mean together,

569
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,840
but a little bit on an anti-odromia. Why is it important for us to use this concept as well?

570
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,840
Well, an anti-odromia is the easiest one to deal with. It's a term invented by Yong,

571
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:13,120
and it really refers to the fact that roads go in two directions. And this was first again

572
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,680
commented on, at least in the West, by Heraclitus, when he said the road up is the road down.

573
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,040
And so this is really the essence of an anti-odromia. We don't need to spend much time on it,

574
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:35,200
but I think that it is very beautifully, deeply, and with great imagination, and I mean that in

575
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:42,480
the best sense, unfolded by Yong in his looking at what a human being is. It's a very important

576
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:51,120
element, as I say, in the practice of anyone trying to help a human being with their suffering,

577
00:59:51,120 --> 01:00:00,640
their mental suffering. And I'm just struck by these three terms when I was reading, because

578
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,240
they're not the kinds of things we bring to bear, right? We use language of systems change,

579
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,800
and we speak about regenerative economics, and we speak about a new narrative and all this kind

580
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:21,280
of stuff. But these things cut much more deeply into the need to perceive reality. We live in

581
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,600
arguably a reality avoidant culture, much of reality we don't want to attend to in a certain way,

582
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,480
and some would say it's also a kind of post-truth culture. But in order to sort of reach towards

583
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,600
the truth and reach towards reality, it feels like our conceptual maps are not fit for purpose.

584
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,800
There's a kind of, there's a linguistic drought of some kind that prevents us from seeing. I'm not

585
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,560
seeing that we should resuscitate these fairly scholastic terms as the only way. But it does

586
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:56,080
feel to me a little bit like part of the public education is to bring such terminology to bear

587
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,520
so that people can actually make sense again of what's actually real and true, rather than

588
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,800
believing they can't actually articulate their intuitions.

589
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,520
Well, yes, I mean, whether or not these particular terms are the right ones, I wouldn't

590
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,320
like to say, although there's nothing wrong with them, I suppose. But I think that the perception

591
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:23,600
from which they stem is, is explicable in terms that are not so strange. And I suppose that's what

592
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,400
I've tried to do in my writing, which is why one of the communist things people say is,

593
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,760
you gave me the words for things that I knew to be the case, but I had no language. I had no way

594
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,520
of saying these things. And I felt I'd be dismissed if I said them, but I've given

595
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,680
good groundings, reasons, and science behind why these things are important. And we need to

596
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,320
make this shift. We need to change our perspective on what we're doing here and who we are and what

597
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,720
the business of being alive is about before it's too late. Anyway, there we are.

598
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,960
Well, just a related example is, if you watch the news and the clamour on social media and the

599
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:10,960
main forms of debates in public life, there's ubiquitous partial truth, right? People say things,

600
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,720
and then there's a kind of watchable tree that's partially true, and there's a watchable tree

601
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,280
response that's also partially true. But there's very little sort of shared endeavor to get to the

602
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,000
kind of fuller vision of the truth. Now, there's a whitehead quotation somewhere in your book

603
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,480
about there are no whole truths or only partial truths. But I feel this is quite fundamental.

604
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,720
Again, it's something to do with realizing that to actually have a partial truth is,

605
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,560
in some sense, the truth. There is a meaningful way in which not to know everything is to know

606
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:51,120
everything. And you're getting towards that in your book, but in a way that is maddeningly elusive

607
01:02:51,120 --> 01:03:00,000
at a cultural level. Well, I mean, I do, I do talk about the importance of not knowing,

608
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,640
which of course is not the same as ignorance. Ignorance is what you have before you know,

609
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,080
not knowing is what you have after you've gone through the process of knowledge.

610
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:17,440
So all that is very true. And what Chinese call Wu Wei, non-action, is as important.

611
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,520
And that is really in a very practical sense, people always saying, what do we do? And one of

612
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:26,480
the things that comes out of experience as a psychiatrist is the first thing is to see what

613
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,760
it is that you're doing that's wrong and stop doing it. So before you can actually have room to

614
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,640
do something new, you've got to get out of the picture, the thing you're doing, which is wrong.

615
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,560
So, you know, all this has very practical meaning in my view. It's not just some strange

616
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:50,320
insight into the structure of being. But if we are to survive, and if we're to understand

617
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,400
what we're doing, we do need to have some insight into the structure of being. And at the moment,

618
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:03,840
our image of a reductionist materialist mechanism is wrong on so many counts. And I give a lot

619
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,400
of them in the book. I mean, you've quoted Wu Wei, you mentioned Wu Wei there, the principle. In

620
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:15,280
the book you quote the Tauti Qing a few times, you mentioned the Yi Qing. I mean, many things,

621
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:21,520
but you're also a kind of Taoist, right? One way to understand. I am a Taoist. I'm precisely a

622
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:28,640
Taoist, yes. That's good to know. And I could be a Christian. And if I was, I'm probably a very

623
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:37,440
bad one. But I find the Christian mythos and the Christian tradition phenomenally rich. And it's

624
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:43,280
very, you know, I couldn't say whether, whether I am a Christian or not, but it's not incompatible

625
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,200
with being a Taoist at all. Or a Buddhist for that matter. And Thomas Murphy famously was

626
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,800
Catholic. I wanted to end by just briefly, for those who are curious, today I wrote a little

627
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,400
piece trying to get my head around what I meant by the McGillchrist maneuver a bit more clearly.

628
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,120
And I just, I've said here just a short definition for those who are interested.

629
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,440
I say the McGillchrist maneuver entails the combined perceptual and conceptual capacity

630
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:17,120
that transcends contradictions, disclosing the coincidence of opposites as generative of reality,

631
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:25,920
thereby re-enchanting aspects of lifelong, of, of, of life, re-enchanting aspects of life,

632
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,840
long considered problematic, including tension and paradox. So there's a kind of, you know,

633
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:38,240
I think there's a real thing going on here in the structure, the underlying structure that

634
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:47,600
is principally in chapter 20, but pervades to the entire work. And we will go now to something

635
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:53,680
else. But I suppose I want to say the whole series is called attention as a moral act. Now,

636
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,880
as a whole point of discussion, but just to end, please, why is attention a moral act?

637
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,400
What, if it's not obvious already, how would you describe it?

638
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,560
Well, I don't think it is entirely obvious. And when I discovered that

639
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:16,080
almost the foundational difference, probably the foundational difference between the two hemispheres

640
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,280
is the very well-known fact that they pay attention in different ways to the world,

641
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:27,120
it didn't altogether immediately strike me that I'd struck gold. You know,

642
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:32,320
this was an incredibly important thing, because part of my training was, you know,

643
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:38,000
attention is a cognitive function, you know, with memory and, you know, other things. And it

644
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:46,240
therefore gets reduced to a sort of mechanism of a kind. And I didn't realize how fundamental

645
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:55,920
this is to being the world that we know is the product of our attention. We cannot know a world

646
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,800
that is not part of our attention. I must say, first of all, that I don't mean by attention,

647
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,160
the scrutinizing self-conscious attention. But if it hasn't come to our attention at even an

648
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,280
unconscious level, if we haven't imbibed it, then it can't be part of our experiential world.

649
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:24,080
So I steer an important course, I think, which is, I say important because at the moment, yet again,

650
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,760
there is a polarization going on in which either people believe the world is simply

651
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,520
something that's made up in the individual mind. So this is post-modernism at its worst,

652
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:47,280
it's certain kinds of philosophy, a kind of naive idealism. And the other is a naive realism,

653
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:54,000
that the world is just stuff out there and our knowing it makes no difference to what it is.

654
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,760
Well, again, we don't have time for this, but how we attend something, whether we attend to it,

655
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,800
even within the world of physics, never mind in the world of philosophy and psychology,

656
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:13,840
makes a difference to what we are experiencing. And it's a moral act because it means that we

657
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:23,120
are not simply observers in this universe, we are creators in this universe. We co-create along with

658
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:32,880
the universe and along with that divine logos or Lee or Tao or whatever it is, that is the ground of

659
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:39,920
being. We are not just passive consumers. Once again, it is always a reverberative relationship.

660
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:46,720
I realize in my very early teens that everything has this structure and that therefore we have an

661
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:52,400
impact on the world, making it what it is, really literally making it what it is, the ways in which

662
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:01,840
we see it, alter what will be there. We know that from quantum mechanics as it's laughably called,

663
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:11,440
or quantum field theory as I prefer, but it is also part of our experience of the world.

664
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:20,240
So how we see the world creates is a duty laid on us to pay the right kind of attention,

665
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:25,680
a kind of nourishing attention that brings things into being, not the kind of attention

666
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:31,760
that alienates and that cuts us off from that reality and therefore changes it and changes us.

667
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,600
So it has an effect on the world, it has an effect on us, those who are doing the attending,

668
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:44,400
a moral effect. You can make yourself a very dubious person by always adopting a stance of

669
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:53,360
extreme remoteness. You can also get things wrong by engulfing yourself in things. So as

670
01:09:53,360 --> 01:10:00,320
always, it is a matter of finessing a harmony of positions that look opposed to one another,

671
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:06,560
but are equally necessary or at least both necessary. So that's what I mean by it. And I

672
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:14,560
also mean that if we don't pay the right kind of attention to what we're doing in this world,

673
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,800
and the moment our attention is up for grabs from every kind of electronic device around us,

674
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,920
and I don't think that we are taught any longer how to be quiet and still and concentrate on a

675
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,400
piece of work, on reading or listening to a piece of music for an hour or two at a time,

676
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,480
if we don't reconnect with this kind of attention, we will lose the world. Literally,

677
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,280
you know, I'm not speaking in metaphors, we will lose this world, the world may carry on without

678
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:50,720
us. But that would be very sad for certainly us and possibly for the world because I, you know,

679
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:56,800
I don't hate humanity. I think we've got things very, very badly wrong. But what humanity is,

680
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:03,600
is something very, very special. Well, thank you. And

681
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,360
all of humanity is indeed special. And the work you've done is certainly very special. And

682
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,680
I suppose on behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank you for your decades of, you know,

683
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:25,280
scholarship and the fire that has propelled that is something that I think we all admire.

684
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,400
And you've done, I feel as though when I asked you earlier, you feel fulfilled about your work,

685
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:39,360
there's a sense in which you've clearly done with your talents what you alone could do in some

686
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,400
meaningful sense. And that's also why I wanted to share the biography. And I think it's up to us

687
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:51,040
as a broader population of people interested in your work, concerned about the world in various

688
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:58,080
ways to consider what it means to us and how we bring it into being. And with that in mind,

689
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:04,880
we're going to move in that direction now. Beginning with, I'll pass over to my colleague,

690
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:11,120
Michael Breddy, in a second. And we'll do a very short practice before we move into groups,

691
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,800
and then we'll come back together where we'll have a chance to ask you questions and I'll

692
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:24,000
help to field them as well. Okay, so this is a pretty fundamental question from Paul. Paul,

693
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,080
do you want to ask it? If you're there, can we see you and, or is that too much, too difficult,

694
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,800
Michael, to do that? I can actually, it might be a bit of a challenge, but I can. All right,

695
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,000
let me just ask it. If you don't mind, Paul, sorry, we better if we ask you. I hope you understand.

696
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,280
I think that's me. Okay, great. Let's hear from you then, Paul.

697
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,360
Thanks very much. So my question relates to how would you say that we could slow down and

698
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:54,880
nurture the sort of attention that grows out of that slowing down in a world that seems to be

699
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,720
speeding up and with less and less time to sit for three hours with a piece of literature or enjoy

700
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:07,040
how do we reconcile the speed of the world as we perceive it with the necessity of slowing down

701
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,160
with that? Thank you relatively quickly and just so we can get plenty of questions in.

702
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:22,640
Yes, I mean, the question is a very good question. And I think it is difficult.

703
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:29,840
There have never been more pressures on people to do more things in less time.

704
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:36,320
So the only thing I can suggest is that you stand out against that culture as much as you can.

705
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,520
And it's built into many of the assumptions of the culture that it's better for everyone to be

706
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,800
doing lots and lots of things. It might be better if we did fewer things but did them

707
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:57,840
with greater thought and depth. So I think one has to make some decisions. I mean, I'm not

708
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,600
holding myself out as any kind of example of what to do. I'm not a good example of doing anything,

709
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:14,160
but I have no television. I've found myself listening less and less to the radio. I hardly

710
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:22,480
ever do actually listen to the radio, to be honest. And I have switched off alerts when emails come.

711
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:29,520
I try to limit the times of day in which I will look at them. And I'm not on any of the social

712
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:36,880
networks, but I have the luxury of a PA who does and who therefore picks up messages for me.

713
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,080
But if you haven't got such a person, on the other hand, you might not have quite as many

714
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:54,800
requests or questions. But I think it is difficult. I think it's rather like asking

715
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,480
any kind of spiritual practitioner, how do you do this? And the answer is not some simple thing,

716
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,120
but it's about embracing a certain relation to the world. And that's really what I'm talking

717
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:12,320
about. So I think it's a start from day one of thinking, you know, what matters is my relationship

718
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:17,280
to the world, to people and so on, and all the things that interrupt and make more shallow,

719
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:23,040
my connections with them, my experiences also, are to be resisted. Sorry, it's not a very

720
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,560
satisfactory answer, but that's the best I can say. Thank you, Ian. And I'm looking at these,

721
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,080
sorry, Paul, thank you for your question. And I'm looking at these questions, all of which are

722
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:41,600
kind of explosive in their own way. One about AI, one about war and peace is one about God.

723
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:51,600
I want to be honest, I want to ask this because it seems to me something that Perspectiva recently

724
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,680
did an anti-debate about as a whole conversation. But if you're interested, look at the anti-debate.

725
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,920
In what is the question from Christine Miskelly, and it says, in what sense might war be needed

726
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:14,960
for the development of peace? What sense, if any, perhaps? Well, well, gosh, it's just a very good

727
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:23,280
question. I don't think it is, it is absolutely necessary, though some degree of difference,

728
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:31,600
competition, conflict is also part of the process of collaboration. So I mean, one of the things I

729
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:42,800
say about the history of evolution, which is constantly projected as a simple warfare of all

730
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,360
against all, is that it's not a bit like that. I mean, that it's far more distinguished by

731
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,600
collaboration and cooperation between species. But as a degree of competition is also extremely

732
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,600
helpful. And I suppose bringing it back to human war and peace, I would like to say I hope we can

733
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:06,880
certainly avoid a war, but that nonetheless some degree of independence of states, but working

734
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:22,640
together of states is important. That you know, the element of change that comes about when a

735
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:29,680
country is plunged into a crisis can be extremely helpful. I mean, it's not a bit of a cliche,

736
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:37,520
really, but it's true that the Second World War produced extraordinary advances in science and

737
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,080
technology, some of which may not be good in themselves, but some of which very clearly were

738
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:50,000
and have been used to great advantage. So once again, it's not all or nothing. But I hope that in

739
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,480
the case of actual human war, it will be as little as conceivably possible. Okay, thank you, Ian.

740
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,240
Gosh, there's so many. Do keep your questions coming just because we will keep a record of all

741
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,960
of these. So one way or the other, these will be attended to through a moral act, as it were.

742
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,240
And we probably won't manage to answer all of them now. However, there was one question that's

743
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:18,560
very much of the moment. There is a more challenging real world question from about AI from Pat Kain.

744
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,720
Pat, do you want to frame that in your own vernacular?

745
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:30,560
Sure. Hi, Ian, I love your work. But this is a pressing question, which is to say,

746
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:39,840
to what degree is computation a left brain phenomena? And what are the recent achievements

747
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:45,600
in computation, which are basically sort of modelling and building on the precedent of a

748
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,280
corpus? We all thought that machines, the one thing that machines wouldn't get anywhere near

749
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:59,280
would be creativity or responsivity. Maybe even that may be a more technical way to put it.

750
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,560
But it seems that's one of the first things that they've come for. We thought they would

751
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,240
be dealing with our routineized behaviours and liberating us from labour. What it seems to be

752
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,320
doing is coming in at the kind of formulaic nature of human creativity and intellect itself.

753
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,640
And that's what advanced AI has come to. Now, within the right brain, left brain, complicated

754
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:28,000
dynamic, which was Jonathan was at pains to say, is complex rather than manacheme. What's your

755
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:35,920
perspective on advancing computation and what it does to our sense of appreciation for valuing of

756
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:46,560
the human? Wow. Well, first of all, to start with the rather limited and more focused

757
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:54,240
computation is a very left hemisphere element. And it's different from understanding. So it's

758
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:02,080
clear that the left hemisphere can manipulate words and manipulate figures. But the right

759
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:07,200
hemisphere is better able to understand the overall import of the words and the overall

760
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,680
nature of what has been computed and what it means. So in other words, it doesn't have the

761
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:16,320
degree of understanding of the right hemisphere, but it's able to carry out procedures. It's the

762
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:23,360
difference between procedures and inhabited processes. So what we're seeing is an enormous,

763
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:32,960
it is striking and troubling, I agree. But if you can compute so that you can get all the possible

764
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,360
permutations and possibilities, this is not the way the human mind works intelligently.

765
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:49,360
But you can then single out certain elements. But I doubt that I may live to eat these words,

766
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:56,160
but I doubt very much that a machine can can produce something that is more than mediocre in

767
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:06,080
terms of creativity. The business of creativity comes out of the business of having a body,

768
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:15,280
having a mortal life that is limited in extent, and having emotions. And I think and being conscious.

769
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,160
And there's no evidence that, well, clearly they don't have bodies, they don't have

770
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:27,840
emotions, but they could have consciousness. But I think that's a doubtful but not excludable

771
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:35,600
possibility. But I don't think this is how great creative works are made. There was already a machine

772
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,640
created by putting all the works of Bach into it, and then asking the machine to sort of

773
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:49,440
out of this random literature, a new work of Bach. But the trouble is that, although it could pass

774
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:55,600
as, yeah, in the genre of Bach, it's not created by a genius. And it doesn't move one in the way

775
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,400
that the works of Bach do and speak to one in the way that the works of Bach do. Only a human

776
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,000
being a fellow sufferer can actually do that. Is that something to do in with, thanks, Pat,

777
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,680
for the questions? Is it something to do with reverberation? I mean, you mentioned that this

778
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,480
notion that we have a similar problem in the chess world about whether a computer can play a game.

779
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,880
And there's something about seeing, feeling the other human beings creative acts that is

780
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,160
sort of non negligible, difficult to reproduce. And just you're so fond of the word reverberation

781
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:34,240
that that came to mind in your response to the question. Well, there's no need whatever for a

782
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,440
computer that's very good at playing chess to have any form of consciousness. I mean,

783
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:44,000
that's just absolutely not required. All it has to do is do an immense amount of computing very

784
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,440
fast, which would be a very stupid thing to do, which is why I reject the term artificial

785
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,880
intelligence. It's not artificial intelligence. It's artificial information processing that

786
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,800
could be done incredibly fast, much faster than humans can process information. But my God,

787
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,440
knowledge is more than processing information. Understanding is more than knowledge, and

788
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,520
wisdom is more than understanding. Okay, thank you. And you heard it here first,

789
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,480
there's no such thing as AI. I'm just kidding. So, Emma, you had your photo,

790
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,280
you had your hand up quite early, so you can go next, please. Emma Morrissey? Yeah.

791
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,920
Hi, yeah, it's Emer, but don't worry, it happens all the time. First, I just want to say a big

792
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,320
thank you. Your work has had a really profound impact on my life. So, just to get that other

793
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:40,000
way first. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the role of creativity,

794
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,680
because obviously, a creative act, for example, writing requires both hemispheres of the brain,

795
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:51,040
you know, so the right would be kind of free flow of ideas and the left involved in the editing

796
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:57,040
process, for example. So, I wanted to ask what you think the role of creativity could be as an

797
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:03,680
antidote to the imbalance that we see in the world? I think it's terribly important. I mean,

798
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:10,320
I think we are almost definable as creative beings. And as you know, my philosophy is that

799
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,360
we are here to help create reality, that we are, you know, we're not just

800
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:24,880
passive passers-through of a slideshow, we are actually interacting with something.

801
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,560
So, we are creating all the time. And emphasising that element is important, but it doesn't mean

802
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,640
letting go of what the left hemisphere provides, which are the tools. So, for example, in order

803
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:41,040
to be a good poet, you have to know your language, you have to understand how it works, and you have

804
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,960
to read a lot. In order to be a good composer, you have to know the rules. Well, I think you do. I

805
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,360
mean, nowadays, all the rules have been thrown out, but it doesn't necessarily produce wonderful

806
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,120
works for art. But I think that a composer is at an advantage. Let me put it that way.

807
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,800
If he or she understands the structures of music, the nature of music, and the history of music.

808
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:10,240
So, I think, I believe we create out of a living tradition of which we are the new members who

809
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:16,080
will take it in another way or take it further. That is all brilliant. But what I reject is just

810
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:21,520
cutting off the ways in which we might learn a skill. Learning a skill, learning an art,

811
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,640
learning a craft, is very important for creativity. It doesn't just happen by sticking people in a

812
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:33,360
room and going bluer whatever comes out. That is not needless to say how anything beautiful or

813
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:39,360
gracious created. But I do think it is very important. I absolutely agree with you. And I

814
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:47,040
think that the way children are educated nowadays is adversarial to that impulse.

815
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,920
But again, I want to caution. I don't mean that they should just be allowed to not learn things and

816
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:59,040
let it all quote hang out. They really do need to get to grips with things, understand them,

817
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:05,520
but then allowed to have their own thoughts, their own, you know, that is what my education

818
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:12,160
was like all those millions of years ago in the dark ages when I was educated by wonderful people

819
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,520
who were excited about what they were talking about, didn't have to follow a procedure that was

820
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,920
sent to them from Whitehall. So, you know, we need to get back to a business of, you know, openness

821
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,680
and that the mind of the young person needs to be trained to think differently, not just to

822
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:34,160
be indoctrinated. This is what you must say. And if you don't say these things, you won't get full

823
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,960
marks. But no, think for yourself. Turn things on their head. See what happens. It's great.

824
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:46,880
Okay. Thank you so much. And listen, we're going to have a question from Four Arrows,

825
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:54,560
which you've raised a few interesting comments throughout the evening and a chance to ask Ian

826
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,560
directly. Ian, I'll let Four Arrows answer the question, but just so you know, what my interest

827
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,840
here is something about the nature of hierarchy that's implicit both in or actually quite explicit

828
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:09,760
in the master and his emissary, but also to some extent in the myth with which you begin the second

829
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,240
volume of the new book. And I think this is a question that's sort of challenging that to some

830
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:19,680
extent. Can we hear Four Arrows if he's there? Yeah, I'm just asking. I'm wondering if Four Arrows

831
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:25,680
could raise their hand, then it's much easier for me to find Four Arrows because we have so many

832
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:32,320
people here. It's also known as Don Trent Jacobs, PhD. Ah, here I see you now, Four Arrows.

833
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,680
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

834
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:52,000
There we go. You found me. I'm a big fan of Ian on many levels. As an indigenous scholar, I appreciate

835
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:58,880
your references to the Uroquois Confederacy as a model also. I have a question that is,

836
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:05,440
you're in that metaphor that Jonathan just described. I just want to be clear

837
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,440
that you didn't intend for that relationship of hierarchy to the need to be permanent in order

838
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,920
to recognize that each person has limitations. And in the indigenous approach, of course,

839
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,920
hierarchy is contextual. For the buffalo hunt, we'll have a leader, but otherwise it's matriarchal

840
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,600
and non. So can you clarify what you meant by that using that particular analogy? Because it

841
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:38,160
was a little bothersome. Okay. Well, have you come across the myth that I use? Have you read it?

842
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,720
Yes, I have come across it. Oh, you have? Yes. I disagree with it in a way.

843
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:54,240
Explicit in it is that there are these two unequal powers, and one is able to be creative

844
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:01,680
and is able to look after the other one that can do good as long as it's under the supervision

845
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,440
of the greater power. They have two unequal twin brothers.

846
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,240
Just to be clear about the question, as I understand it, that's not in doubt. And I think

847
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:17,120
that's even accepted. It's just about the permanence of that relationship and whether the

848
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,440
hierarchy is a fluid notion that comes and goes according to context, or whether it's...

849
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:26,080
Well, in that myth, it isn't. No, in that myth, it is a permanent fact about the relationship.

850
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,720
It's never hinted that the other brother can somehow be the leader because he just doesn't

851
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:36,640
have what it takes. He on his own would be dangerous and his attempts to create a negative.

852
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:44,720
And he's jealous of, envious of his brother's position. He's a rival that is an upstart,

853
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:50,720
basically. This is the same as the story of Lucifer, the brightest of the angels, who became

854
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:56,480
Satan. And the whole story of Paradise Lost is caused by the resentment of the one that can't

855
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,880
do what the other one can do. Now, it's a very dangerous human reality, and I wouldn't wish to

856
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:09,360
gloss over it at all. I think the interpretation is incorrect. It's a Western lens through which

857
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:17,520
that myth is taught. And so Joseph Campbell actually talks about that myth in a different

858
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,080
way. I take it from Joseph Campbell. I take it direct from Joseph Campbell.

859
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:28,400
Well, then we should have a conversation about that disagree with them, right?

860
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,600
Yeah, because the twin heroes, the twin heroes is the key. And the twin heroes, which can be,

861
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,560
yeah, that mythology is, is that these twins work in complementarity with different strengths

862
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:46,960
and recognize the different patients in different contexts. And so that's why I like what Jonathan

863
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:54,480
is trying to clarify in terms of the fluidity. But a brief other one. I use the left and right

864
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:00,320
brain here also. I use it all the time. That's the problem with our world, exactly what you're

865
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:07,760
saying. But science really calls our metaphor a myth. And indeed, it is more complex. Can you tell

866
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,480
how you are still using that idea of left brain hemisphere without getting too shot down by

867
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:22,960
neuroscience? And then I'll close. I think Ian, briefly on that, because we have several questions.

868
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:31,200
Yeah, okay. Well, gosh, how can I be brief? I think, first of all, that a myth is not

869
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:40,160
an untrue, but it is a way in which the greatest truths can be expressed. And they can only be

870
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,320
expressed through metaphors, poetry, myth, and ritual. And therefore, these things are very

871
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,440
important elements in language. They're not the stuff of science. That's not a criticism of science.

872
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:59,040
Science starts out by excluding them. So that's fine. And what I've said is robust in neuroscience

873
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,800
terms. And nobody has really said that it isn't. Nobody with any authority has ever explained to

874
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,400
me that there's anything wrong with it. So thank you, Ian. And we're almost at the end. But there's

875
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,160
one final question. I just want to let people know that your questions have been seen. Some of them

876
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,600
are wonderful that we can't answer. So do know that they're appreciated. We'll keep a record

877
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,200
of them. We may even use them in some other contexts. But there is a very direct question to

878
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:29,040
end with Ian. And I hope you don't mind. It's from Malband. And it simply says, how do you understand

879
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:40,240
God? Oh, that's, we have minus 15 seconds for me to answer. And I wrote a whole about the resistance

880
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:48,480
and all that. So I wrote a 106 page chapter, which is woefully short on it. I can't answer that. In

881
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:54,160
fact, the only decent thing to say is it can't be put into words, certainly not into the sort of

882
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,800
expression you would like. So sorry to disappoint you. But actually, that is the best expression

883
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:06,160
of what I can say about it. Okay. And the bell, the bell is the answer also. Wonderful. The bells,

884
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:14,000
the bells. So listen, there are more questions. I see your hands up. I know there are. But there's

885
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,960
also good to leave. Once again, more and there is more to come. This is the first of several

886
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:24,400
in this series. I'll be kind of anchoring most of these conversations. But there will be other

887
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,280
people speaking to Ian at more length, from different vantage points, exploring different

888
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:34,480
aspects of both the books, getting a clearer sense of what we mean by attention being a moral act.

889
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,920
So I do hope many of you will come back. A reminder to will be in touch tomorrow and to

890
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,160
encourage you to sign up to Perspectiva's mailing list so you can hear about this series and the

891
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:53,360
other work that we do. And also, again, that we are a charity we rely on philanthropic donations.

892
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:58,000
If any of you feel so inclined, you're very welcome to follow the link that we gave earlier

893
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,880
in the chat or that you can find on our website to make us a donation or sign up for a subscription.

894
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:10,640
It's much appreciated. And the next event in two weeks' time is with Zach Stein, a sort of

895
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:17,200
philosopher of education, a really brilliant guy who I've known for several years now. He's the

896
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:22,640
author of a book called Education in a Time Between Worlds. And he is going to be asking Ian

897
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,440
about many things, but principally this notion of the direct perception of value in the world,

898
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,000
what's sometimes called value-ception. And they'll be going, getting deep into what that means

899
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,280
and why it matters today especially. And there'll be other subsequent talks, but that's the next

900
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:44,400
one. So I think unless I've forgotten something, we're good to go as it were.

901
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:49,520
Yeah, if I could just give a reminder, Jonathan, but next week we have a Connection to Priory

902
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:58,320
session, which Ian won't be present at sadly, but it's more focused on connecting with the

903
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:03,600
people that have been here tonight and others in kind of structured breakout rooms and different

904
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,160
practices to explore these ideas in greater depth. So to really kind of find the others

905
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:14,000
and to create a space for that. And it will be directly related to what's been discussed tonight.

906
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:23,120
So yeah, if you can make that, I put the link in the chat to register for that, but I'll just stick

907
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:28,800
it in again. And also what I'll do is just put in the link for the main kind of webpage where we're

908
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:36,320
going to host, make announcements for all of the sessions as they come up. So if you're, you know,

909
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,080
when you want to check back in, you can just go to that link and you'll see what the next

910
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:45,600
sessions that come up and register for all the upcoming events. Great. Well listen, Ian, as always

911
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,800
a huge thank you. I hope this is the first of many of these, well I know I hope it will be

912
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:58,960
first of many of these conversations. And thanks for everyone for coming and staying

913
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,520
and your questions and sorry we couldn't get to them all. And I hope now that those who want to

914
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:09,120
copy the chat have done so. And we'll see you, most of you hopefully in a couple of weeks,

915
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,600
maybe even in one week if you're joining Michael and Lee for the connection and inquiry session,

916
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,840
which I encourage you to do because like it's good to talk, right? I mean, this is heavy, heavy,

917
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:25,440
heady, heady chat, this stuff. So good to be with others who are wrestling with it too and share

918
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:31,520
your life experience and how this work comes into your world to be a little bit less alone and maybe

919
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,880
a bit more creative and productive through that. So pleasure to see you all and we'll see you very

920
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:45,680
soon. Bye for now. Bye. Thank you. Thanks Ian. Be in touch soon. Thank you everyone.

921
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Thank you. Thanks Jonathan. Pleasure.
