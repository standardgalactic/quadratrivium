00:00.000 --> 00:17.160
So music metacrisis and metanoia. So what I want to talk about today, it really kind

00:17.160 --> 00:26.920
of comes down to these two ideas. Acrasia and metanoia, two ancient Greek words. And

00:26.920 --> 00:33.280
you see the statue that's related to Acrasia is someone kind of bound in chains and unable

00:33.280 --> 00:40.080
to break free. And then this sculpture, which I discovered online when I was looking for

00:40.080 --> 00:50.280
a counterpart to the sculpture of the man bound in chains, has this kind of quality

00:50.280 --> 00:56.360
of an inner light bursting forth, which I think speaks to metanoia. So I want to look

00:56.400 --> 01:03.920
a little bit more deeply at these terms. So Acrasia is from the Greek meaning without

01:03.920 --> 01:10.280
and kratos meaning power or strength. So it's a lack of power, it's a lack of strength.

01:10.280 --> 01:19.240
And the term Acrasia really means a kind of lack of command of oneself. So this, we see

01:19.240 --> 01:25.280
this when individually when we know what is the right thing to do. Intellectually, we

01:25.280 --> 01:30.920
might think, okay, you know, what's a really important value to me is to be healthy. And

01:30.920 --> 01:39.720
so I don't want to eat too much chocolate. But then we have a weakness of will. And we

01:39.720 --> 01:43.960
go for the cookie or we eat the chocolate anyway, you know, so that's a kind of banal

01:43.960 --> 01:49.240
form of Acrasia, maybe a more painful form of Acrasia might be when we know that we don't

01:49.240 --> 01:54.240
want to lose a temper with people that we love. But in the midst of strong emotions,

01:54.280 --> 02:01.120
we say things that hurt people, you know. And so it's having some understanding, some

02:01.120 --> 02:05.720
intellectual knowledge of what is the right way, what is the wise way, what is the good

02:05.720 --> 02:11.720
way to go. But then for whatever reason, we're not able to adhere to that, we're not able

02:11.720 --> 02:18.440
to be in alignment with that. And so I mean, my sense is that this is a very, when you

02:18.440 --> 02:22.200
understand, you hear this term, there's a kind of familiarity, we think, oh, yeah, I

02:22.240 --> 02:29.200
can see that in my own life, I can see that myself. I feel, I believe at the moment, we're

02:29.200 --> 02:37.760
experiencing a kind of civilization on Acrasia, where our kind of young, nascent global

02:37.920 --> 02:45.720
civilization is collectively going in a direction, acting in ways that I think many of

02:45.800 --> 02:53.040
us sense is not wise. Many of us sense is taking us in an unwise, a wrong direction. And yet we

02:53.040 --> 02:58.920
seem unable to change that, to change course, to do something different. And there's almost

02:58.920 --> 03:07.320
a kind of an inevitability of this unfolding of the Metacrisis. So this is our kind of

03:07.320 --> 03:14.800
predicament that we're in. And the counterpart to that are the journey that we could maybe

03:15.000 --> 03:20.480
make to something different, I think is encapsulated in the term Metanoia. And so Metanoia

03:20.480 --> 03:29.760
comes from the Greek meaning Meta, the Greek term Meta, which means change after or beyond. And the

03:30.040 --> 03:35.960
word new, which means meaning, which means mind or consciousness. So it refers to a kind of

03:35.960 --> 03:43.120
profound change of heart. But it's not just a change of mind, like a kind of shallow kind of

03:43.120 --> 03:48.720
change in the way of thinking or change of opinion. In fact, in the synoptic Gospels, it's the

03:48.720 --> 03:55.440
first word that Jesus says. So the term Metanoia has a really deep history that speaks to a

03:55.440 --> 04:03.000
profound inner revolution and inner transformation. And it relates to one seeing the error of our

04:03.000 --> 04:10.600
ways, but also this kind of profound commitment to go in a completely different direction. And so

04:11.040 --> 04:21.440
if we are stuck in a kind of civilisation like crazy, then one possible solution, if I can use

04:21.440 --> 04:26.320
that word, although it's not the most appropriate word, the response needs to be some kind of

04:26.320 --> 04:34.520
collective Metanoia, some kind of profound transformation. And I want to share with you a

04:34.520 --> 04:41.400
depiction of Metanoia before I say a little bit more about Metanoia. And it actually comes, it's a

04:41.400 --> 04:47.760
somewhat humorous depiction, but it comes from the film Blues Brothers. If you haven't seen the

04:47.760 --> 04:54.080
film, Jake and Elwood Blues, I think Jake just gets out of prison, and then they go back to their

04:54.080 --> 04:59.000
orphanage and the orphanage is about to close and they're running out of money. So they need to kind

04:59.040 --> 05:03.720
of find, find them, they're given this task, you know, like the hero's journey, they have this task

05:03.720 --> 05:09.880
to complete. And they're told to go to church. And Jake's not happy, but he doesn't want to go to

05:09.880 --> 05:18.200
church. I think Jake is John Baluchian, Elwood is Dan Lackroyd. And then you see this kind of

05:18.440 --> 05:24.440
Metanoia transformation that happens as they're in the church listening to music. So I want to play

05:24.480 --> 05:29.400
this for you just now. One, because the music is so wonderful, but it also, it only came to me

05:29.400 --> 05:34.960
after I wrote the essay that we published in Substack, that this is an example of Metanoia

05:34.960 --> 05:37.240
through music. So I'm going to play this for you just now.

05:54.440 --> 06:24.440
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all

06:24.440 --> 06:37.300
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all

06:37.700 --> 06:46.420
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, we all, are like

06:46.420 --> 06:50.620
Jake a, are you all right

06:50.620 --> 06:52.480
ست Abb')

06:52.480 --> 06:54.480
All hail!

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
All hail!

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
All hail!

06:56.480 --> 06:58.480
All hail!

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
Hail!

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
Hail!

07:09.480 --> 07:11.480
Bear!

07:12.480 --> 07:14.480
The bear!

07:14.480 --> 07:16.480
Do you see the bear?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.480
The bear!

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
Do you see the bear?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.480
What light?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.480
Have you seen the light?

07:24.480 --> 07:26.480
Yes! Yes!

07:26.480 --> 07:29.480
Jesus hates God-dancing Christ!

07:29.480 --> 07:32.480
I have seen the light!

07:51.480 --> 07:55.480
The band! I want the band!

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
The band?

07:57.480 --> 07:59.480
The band?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.480
The band?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.480
The band?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
The band?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
The band!

08:07.480 --> 08:12.480
And God bless the United States of America!

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
The band!

08:20.480 --> 08:26.480
When I hear the term metanoia, it sounds like, oh, wouldn't that be lovely?

08:26.480 --> 08:29.480
Wouldn't a metanoia be a wonderful thing to have, you know?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
Some kind of spiritual awakening.

08:31.480 --> 08:36.480
And it seems to my mind, within kind of spiritual circles,

08:36.480 --> 08:40.480
if you like, a metanoia could be treated a little bit like

08:40.480 --> 08:44.480
how falling in love is treated in rom-coms.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.480
Bear with me here.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
What do you mean by this?

08:48.480 --> 08:51.480
And I think there is actually a deep connection between metanoia and falling in love.

08:51.480 --> 08:56.480
But in a romantic comedy, a couple fall in love,

08:56.480 --> 08:59.480
and then that's the end of the movie, when they get together.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.480
And it's like, happily ever after.

09:02.480 --> 09:07.480
But of course, you know, if you've been in a relationship that's lasted any amount of time,

09:07.480 --> 09:11.480
you know, the falling in love is not the end of the story, it's the beginning.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.480
And then there's the relationship, and maybe the many decades,

09:14.480 --> 09:18.480
and the work, and all that happens with that, you know?

09:18.480 --> 09:23.480
And so you could look at a metanoia, or if we talk about what the world needs,

09:23.480 --> 09:26.480
and we talk about it like it's a shift of consciousness,

09:26.480 --> 09:30.480
like if we had that, then everything would just be solved, everything would be fine.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.480
But I actually think a metanoia is simply the beginning,

09:35.480 --> 09:41.480
and then the painstaking work begins of actually bringing oneself

09:41.480 --> 09:45.480
and one's life into alignment with that revelation, with that understanding.

09:45.480 --> 09:50.480
And of course, in the Blues Brothers, I never thought I would turn to the Blues Brothers as a source of wisdom,

09:50.480 --> 09:55.480
but there you go, in the Blues Brothers, the metanoia experience happens at the beginning of the movie.

09:55.480 --> 10:00.480
It's the start, it's not the end, it's the start, it's then they go on their kind of journey.

10:00.480 --> 10:06.480
So, I just want to situate that in that way,

10:06.480 --> 10:17.480
that metanoia is not the kind of, once we achieve that, that's the work's done, that's just the first step.

10:17.480 --> 10:26.480
And so, to my mind, metanoia, and this is just the way that I understand it,

10:26.480 --> 10:32.480
as I say, it's a very deep term, and there could be many different ways of understanding and moving into this,

10:32.480 --> 10:39.480
but what occurred to me was that metanoia is a three-part transformation,

10:39.480 --> 10:46.480
and it's a transformation in loving, it's a transformation in knowing, and it's a transformation in action.

10:46.480 --> 10:56.480
And so, I'll start maybe by talking about loving, by saying metanoia is a transformation in what we love,

10:56.480 --> 11:02.480
and what I want to point to is it's a transformation in their structure of value, a hierarchy of value.

11:02.480 --> 11:09.480
This is something, there was a wonderful conversation between the philosopher and educator Zach Stein and Ian McGillchrist,

11:09.480 --> 11:17.480
that took place, you can find it on our YouTube channel, Tifa's YouTube channel, maybe eight or nine months ago,

11:17.480 --> 11:23.480
and they talked about the importance of value-ception, and with value-ception, what they're talking about is this,

11:23.480 --> 11:30.480
this capacity that we have as human beings to perceive value directly,

11:30.480 --> 11:38.480
and that value is not something that we just kind of, our consciousness paints on to the cosmos,

11:38.480 --> 11:45.480
but it's something inherent in the cosmos, and that we actually perceive it, we can come into a relationship with it.

11:45.480 --> 11:52.480
And one of the points, and I can't remember whether it was Zach or Ian, but I think there was very much an agreement with this,

11:52.480 --> 12:00.480
was that there is a problem with our society's collective capacity for value-ception.

12:00.480 --> 12:06.480
Like as a society, we, our value-ception is not working very well.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.480
We are valuing the wrong things and not valuing the higher goods that we should be valuing.

12:12.480 --> 12:19.480
And so, in an individual metanoic transformation, what happens is, before the metanoia,

12:19.480 --> 12:29.480
the individual might be concerned with narrow egoic concerns, status, reputation, comfort, pleasure.

12:29.480 --> 12:38.480
And then, with the metanoia, their concerns, what they value, what they deeply care about, starts to transcend beyond themselves.

12:38.480 --> 12:44.480
An example of this, of course, is a Christmas carol, Charles Dickens' Christmas carol,

12:44.480 --> 12:52.480
where Scrooge, all he cares about is money, but through those kind of, the dreams and the encounters with the ghost of Christmas past, present and future,

12:52.480 --> 12:57.480
he becomes transformed and he cares about things beyond himself.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.480
So there's this transformation, and this is why I call it transformation and loving,

13:01.480 --> 13:07.480
because it's about what we deeply value, what we deeply care for, and about what we love.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.480
And therefore, what we want to serve.

13:10.480 --> 13:23.480
And then also, I see it as a transformation in knowing, because along with this comes a kind of reordering of our understanding of reality and our place within it.

13:23.480 --> 13:32.480
So, for a Buddhist, it might be an awakening into the profound interconnectedness of all of life.

13:32.480 --> 13:41.480
And then the kind of myopic, narrow concerns of the self might seem silly, you know, and there's kind of an overflowing of compassion and love outwards.

13:41.480 --> 13:52.480
And in the Christian tradition, it might be seeing oneself as a kind of a child of God or Christ.

13:52.480 --> 13:57.480
And then, once placed within the cosmos, it's shifted somehow.

13:57.480 --> 14:04.480
So there's a kind of transformation or understanding of reality and what matters in reality and our place within it.

14:04.480 --> 14:12.480
And again, I think this is, this connection to falling in love, I think is quite deep.

14:12.480 --> 14:25.480
Because if you think about when you fall in love with someone, the loving them, the coming to value them, comes along with the learning more about them, the insight into them.

14:25.480 --> 14:34.480
So the learning about them, the discovery of the person and the loving them are kind of like one in the same thing, they kind of happen together.

14:34.480 --> 14:40.480
And so, I think there's this profound transformation in loving, there's this profound transformation in understanding, knowing insight.

14:40.480 --> 14:45.480
And then these two things bring a kind of call to a new kind of action.

14:45.480 --> 14:53.480
And I think this transformed action has, we can think of as having an interior aspect and an exterior aspect.

14:53.480 --> 15:05.480
And the interior aspect, I believe, is the kind of orientation to the spiritual practice, to transform oneself.

15:05.480 --> 15:10.480
As I say, you have a kind of metanoia experience.

15:10.480 --> 15:18.480
And then, I'll give you an example, you go on a retreat.

15:18.480 --> 15:27.480
You have this wonderful experience, you feel maybe deep sense of peace, you feel you're in touch with the wondrous life, the miraculousness of life.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.480
And there's this sense, now everything is going to be different.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.480
Now I'm going to be a completely different person, I'm going to change how I live all the rest of it.

15:34.480 --> 15:39.480
And then three weeks later, you're back at home in the same job with the same partner.

15:39.480 --> 15:45.480
And you find yourself being the same old grumpy son, so you've always been, you know, this miraculous experience.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.480
And then back to the way you were.

15:48.480 --> 15:55.480
And, you know, the first time you're going to retreat and then come off it, that can be a bit disillusioning.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.480
It can be a bit disappointing, you know, it can be kind of crushing actually.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.480
But after you go on more retreats, you see, oh, this is what happens.

16:02.480 --> 16:17.480
And so then the practice becomes nurturing that nurturing the soul really nurturing one's spiritual transformation so that oneself can go in the direction of what the metanoia is calling.

16:17.480 --> 16:21.480
And then also in the external world, living that.

16:21.480 --> 16:31.480
So this is the, and while I'm talking principally about the individual, I think this can apply to us collectively.

16:32.480 --> 16:48.480
And a kind of collective metanoia would be a kind of profound transformation in what society what we collectively value profound transformation or understanding of reality, which I think is taking place in many, many respects.

16:48.480 --> 16:53.480
And I think this field is really important to that.

16:53.480 --> 17:03.480
And then, and then a profound transformation in actually what we do how we live that is informed by that deep care and that deep understanding of reality.

17:03.480 --> 17:14.480
Okay, and the contention I want to make in this kind of workshop is that music has a particular power to enable a collective metanoia.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.480
And I just want to just refer back to the term a crazier from earlier.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.480
If you remember that term, it means a lacking command over oneself.

17:22.480 --> 17:36.480
It means an absence without power, particularly I think the absence of the kind of spiritual power to the existential power to do what one feels is right to do what one feels called to do.

17:36.480 --> 17:44.480
And I think music actually has within it a spiritual power to enable a collective metanoia.

17:44.480 --> 17:52.480
And I think this is just a very brief aside one thing that as many of you will know Ian McGill's Chris work and the difference between the left and right hemispheres.

17:52.480 --> 17:59.480
And he talks about how the left hemispheres principle concern is power and acquiring power.

18:00.480 --> 18:06.480
But I would, I would argue that the right hemisphere has a power as well, but it's a different kind of power.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.480
It's not a power to control a power over another.

18:10.480 --> 18:21.480
It's more a power to enchant more a power to in soul and more a power to move the heart if you like.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.480
And this is what music can tap into.

18:23.480 --> 18:29.480
Okay, so we better have some evidence for this.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.480
And music has this power.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.480
So I want to explore this now.

18:34.480 --> 18:43.480
And just before I get into this, I should say, I'm not saying that music by itself can address or resolve the metacrisis or solve all the world's problems.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.480
That would be completely idiotic, you know, totally foolish.

18:48.480 --> 19:05.480
And because the metacrisis is so multi multidimensional, our response will need to be multimodal will need lots of different and a variety of responses, maybe countless responses in many, many different ways.

19:05.480 --> 19:16.480
But I do believe music in the arts more generally will be necessary because the kind of they can speak at the level of consciousness in a profound way.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.480
And I want to talk a little bit about that just now.

19:18.480 --> 19:24.480
So music has deep roots in our nature, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.480
So let me explain what those words mean.

19:26.480 --> 19:34.480
So phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary history and relations among or within groups of organisms.

19:34.480 --> 19:45.480
So when I say music has deep is deep in our nature phylogenetically, I mean, it's deep in our evolutionary history.

19:45.480 --> 19:51.480
For many researchers, they believe it predates the emergence of language.

19:51.480 --> 19:58.480
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a clip of a dog actually dancing to music.

19:58.480 --> 20:08.480
And you can see that the dog really is grooving to music, which suggests this deep common ancestry that goes way back predating ourselves as humans.

20:08.480 --> 20:19.480
And then also what's interesting is ontogenesis is the development of an individual organism or anatomical or behavioral feature from the early stage to maturity.

20:19.480 --> 20:32.480
So this talks about the kind of development of like the human being from the embryo and all the way up to, you know, the baby to the infant and so on and so on and so forth.

20:32.480 --> 20:41.480
And what's interesting is that there is a appears to be a parallel between ontogenesis and phylogenesis.

20:41.480 --> 20:49.480
So what is ancient in our evolutionary history, you can often find it in the early stages of the organisms development.

20:49.480 --> 20:56.480
And so this is an example, this is really, I'm just going to move this little zoom box here.

20:56.480 --> 21:01.480
So you can see this is a fish, salamander, tortoise, chicken, pig, cow, rabbit, human.

21:01.480 --> 21:07.480
And you can see the embryos of all of these creatures are very, very similar.

21:07.480 --> 21:16.480
And of course, interestingly, the human embryo, when it's really, really young has a tail, because that's part of our evolutionary history.

21:16.480 --> 21:26.480
We evolved from mammals that had tails, even even prior to mammals, fish, reptiles.

21:26.480 --> 21:36.480
And then you can see as the embryo develops, it starts to take its own path and goes its own trajectory.

21:37.480 --> 21:45.480
Okay, so music, I want to argue is is deep, deep ancient part of ourselves.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.480
And I want to share with you some videos that reveal this now.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.480
Now I'm going to play this clip and you'll watch.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.480
You'll actually see if you watch closely, you'll see the dog moves actually in time to the music.

21:58.480 --> 22:06.480
And then of course, you can also see the expression of the dog, which shows his or her pleasure as well.

22:28.480 --> 22:45.480
Okay, pretty clear that dog likes his kind of funky blues.

22:45.480 --> 22:50.480
Okay, next video, I want to show you of a mother with her baby.

22:50.480 --> 22:54.480
I can find the video.

22:54.480 --> 23:01.480
And what's interesting here, you'll see the mother sing a few songs, the baby and the baby's quite happy and then she'll she'll sing opera.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.480
And I just want you to notice the strength of the baby's emotional response.

23:05.480 --> 23:12.480
Like the baby responds to this music more strongly than many adults would.

23:13.480 --> 23:31.480
Okay, so my son who is super happy all the time and loves when I sing every song like everybody clap, clap, clap, clap.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.480
Everybody sing la la la la la.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.480
Okay, so he loves that song.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.480
He loves heavy metal.

23:52.480 --> 23:57.480
Okay, that should like terrify a baby, but not George.

23:57.480 --> 24:03.480
But when it comes to opera, he gets super emotional and upset.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.480
George?

24:33.480 --> 25:00.480
Okay, so I think it's very interesting just how profound the baby's response is.

25:00.480 --> 25:20.480
Like the pathos in that opera music, the baby picks it up and his response, I think is just revealing how quick we are to kind of resonate with music.

25:20.480 --> 25:33.480
And what's interesting is this, the deep kind of, the fact that music is deep, deep in our nature means that it's really cross cultural.

25:33.480 --> 25:37.480
And so I want to show you another couple of clips.

25:37.480 --> 25:42.480
One is of Bobby McFerrin.

25:42.480 --> 25:49.480
And I'll just let this clip kind of speak for itself if I can find it.

25:49.480 --> 25:56.480
Give me one second. Okay, here it is.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.480
Expectations? Expectations.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.480
Much.

26:30.480 --> 26:58.480
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

27:27.480 --> 27:57.480

28:11.780 --> 28:26.820
Now, what's interesting to me about that is, regardless of where I am, anywhere, every

28:26.820 --> 28:32.020
audience gets that, but it doesn't matter, you know, it's just, you know, the pentatonic

28:32.020 --> 28:33.620
scale for some reason.

28:33.620 --> 28:49.460
Okay, now, in that little video clip, Bobby McFerrin used the audience for singing what's

28:49.460 --> 28:55.100
called the pentatonic scale in music, and I might be able to play this. Let me see, can

28:55.100 --> 29:01.380
you guys hear this if I play this? Can you hear that note there? Yeah? So the pentatonic

29:01.380 --> 29:11.700
is just, that's it, those five notes. And that's the scale that he was using. And I

29:11.700 --> 29:16.940
want to show you one more video now. And I might flick through this video a little bit

29:16.940 --> 29:23.620
because I don't want to spend too long on it, but it just shows you the various, from various

29:23.620 --> 29:30.780
cultures all over the world, using the pentatonic scale. And in the Western musical scale, there

29:30.780 --> 29:35.620
are 12 different notes that, of course, can be arranged in all kinds of different forms

29:35.620 --> 29:41.380
and there's all types of different scales. But the pentatonic, for some reason, these

29:41.380 --> 29:51.620
five notes are used by cultures all over the world, much more than any other scale. So

29:51.620 --> 29:54.780
let me just find this and bring this up. Okay, I've got it now.

31:21.620 --> 31:51.340
Okay, and it goes on. You get the idea.

31:52.300 --> 32:02.220
For some reason, these five notes touch the human being, activate our emotions, speak to

32:02.220 --> 32:06.220
love, speak to pain, speak to all of these different aspects of what it means to be human.

32:06.220 --> 32:13.340
And all different cultures all over the world create music around these five notes. Now, of

32:13.340 --> 32:17.500
course, there's a lot of music that's created out with these five notes, but there's something

32:17.500 --> 32:24.700
quite universal about this. And so what I wanted to kind of point to is the fact that music has an

32:25.500 --> 32:34.060
impact to touches in a kind of deep way and move consciousness away. And so to return now to

32:34.780 --> 32:44.860
the little slideshow, I want to, I want to now explore the three pathways that I think music

32:44.860 --> 32:53.900
can offer to, to enabling this collective metanoia. So one, and this relates to, of course,

32:53.900 --> 33:00.540
the knowing is music as a metaphor, as offering insight into the nature of reality and ourselves.

33:01.580 --> 33:09.340
And so the first thing I want to touch on is I want to share with you three different

33:10.300 --> 33:15.260
metaphors that music can offer. The first one is a little bit playful, but it just, I just want to

33:15.260 --> 33:22.220
show you how music reveals truths about who we are as human beings, mirrors our nature,

33:22.220 --> 33:27.500
and then mirrors also the deep nature of reality. So the first has to do with something called the

33:27.500 --> 33:36.300
12 bar blues. And the 12 bar blues is this structure that you see here. And if I can,

33:36.300 --> 33:43.500
I can maybe play it for you. Can you hear that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So the 12 bar blues

33:43.500 --> 33:54.620
is one of the most widely used famous song forms in Western music, Western music. And it was the,

33:55.260 --> 34:00.220
the absolute foundation of rock and roll. Okay. And the devil's music. And that's important

34:00.220 --> 34:03.900
because we're going to come back to that in a minute. So I'm going to play. So if I was to play

34:03.900 --> 34:07.260
the 12 bar blues, it would be a bit like this. Okay. So it'd be like, um,

34:08.540 --> 34:11.580
so I'll play in a kind of rock and roll kind of rhythm. So like,

34:14.140 --> 34:19.660
so this would be the one chord. That's the third bar, fourth bar. And then I move to the fourth

34:19.660 --> 34:37.580
chord. And then back to the one. And what's interesting about this, and I don't know,

34:37.580 --> 34:42.380
I'm sure other people have said this. I think I stumbled across this revelation myself. I don't

34:42.380 --> 34:47.660
know what it says about me. But if you look at the structure of the 12 bar blues, it's actually

34:47.660 --> 34:55.580
pretty similar to the classical pattern of an orgasm. Now, why would it be the case that the

34:55.580 --> 35:00.380
music of rock and roll, which is kind of the music of sex, you know, that's what rock and roll was

35:00.380 --> 35:08.220
all about. Um, and which people, you know, derided as the devil's music, if you look at the structures

35:08.220 --> 35:13.340
of them, it stays on the one for a while. And then it gets to this, the four chord, which is that

35:13.340 --> 35:21.740
middle part where it kind of gets to the plateau, right? And then the excitement's building. And then

35:21.740 --> 35:34.620
you get to the climax. And then the resolution. And then back to the one. So this is just a

35:34.620 --> 35:39.980
slightly humorous example, but it just, it just shows you how music has this capacity to speak

35:39.980 --> 35:48.620
to deep aspects of who we are, ourselves as embodied beings. Now, another aspect of another

35:48.620 --> 35:56.300
kind of music, a kind of metaphor that, that can be the music can offer, I think, and maybe

35:56.300 --> 36:01.260
teach us something a little bit more profound. So this is something that we use actually at the

36:01.260 --> 36:09.820
beginning now of the anti debate that perspectiva has developed. And the anti debate is seeks to

36:09.820 --> 36:19.100
be an antidote to debate, a way of having public conversations, a kind of democratic discourse

36:19.740 --> 36:26.700
that is that moves beyond polarization and moves into a deeper appreciation of diversity of you.

36:27.900 --> 36:33.420
Um, and there's, there's, there's many aspects to it. And I, I, I, I, um, there's a lot to the

36:33.420 --> 36:39.580
anti debate. Um, and watch this space because we have a video on it coming out soon. But I just

36:39.580 --> 36:46.140
want to share with you one metaphor that we use that draws on music that, that's helpful to, to

36:46.140 --> 36:49.900
understanding what we're trying to do with it. And I think it's helpful to understanding the

36:49.900 --> 36:59.020
nature of truth actually. So when we think of consonants in music, we usually think of

36:59.820 --> 37:05.580
intervals that fit well together. So you can see there, if the, if I was to play the note middle C,

37:06.220 --> 37:13.340
okay, or I play, if I play this note here actually, so this is C. And then if I play the note above,

37:14.940 --> 37:21.660
that's an octave above. And you can see in those first two waveforms, the second waveform,

37:23.340 --> 37:32.300
this one here is double the length. Um, or, or it's, um, the ratio of the two wave waveforms is

37:32.300 --> 37:38.380
two to one. So the second there's, there's for, for the same length of time, there's two waveforms

37:38.380 --> 37:45.900
for the length of time it takes for one in the first. And this is why these two notes fit together

37:45.900 --> 37:51.020
because the wavelength of one is double the length of the other. And so they sync up very

37:51.020 --> 38:01.900
frequently. Now, if I go to the next note, G, which is the fifth, that has a ratio with the note C

38:01.900 --> 38:07.980
of three to two, two, three to two. So they're very, um, they're very consonant intervals.

38:07.980 --> 38:12.300
These intervals fit well because the wavelengths fit together. So when we think of

38:13.100 --> 38:19.020
consonants or harmony, we usually think that harmony is about consonants. It's about notes

38:19.020 --> 38:25.260
that fit well together. And in some sense, this is true. But if you only play notes that fit well

38:25.260 --> 38:30.860
together, then what you'll actually get is quite boring music. You don't get anything interesting.

38:30.860 --> 38:36.140
Okay, it sounds a little bit deranged. There's too much order, you know, actually, when you

38:36.140 --> 38:44.620
play music like that, it's almost, you know, it has kind of the kind of quality of a totalitarian

38:44.620 --> 38:51.820
state comes to mind. Now, if you take an interval that has a lot of dissonance, so rather than

38:51.820 --> 38:59.500
these two notes together, an octave, rather than playing C and C, I play C and B, the ratio of

38:59.500 --> 39:04.140
those two notes is something like, I can't remember exactly, something like eight to 19 or

39:04.140 --> 39:10.620
something. It's very dissonant. And you can hear to the ear those two notes clash. Okay.

39:12.780 --> 39:21.020
But if I play two other notes along with them, so these two notes clash, but when I add in E and

39:21.020 --> 39:27.180
G, so I play C, E, G, and B, then they form a chord called the major seventh.

39:29.740 --> 39:35.020
And actually, that dissonance is unfolded within our larger relationships that actually

39:35.020 --> 39:38.620
produces a more beautiful harmony. And all of music

39:42.460 --> 39:46.460
is all about the interplay of dissonance. It's actually the interplay of dissonance

39:46.460 --> 39:50.140
that creates beauty that creates richness that creates soulfulness in music.

39:50.140 --> 39:55.420
It's not consonance. Consonance by itself, constant intervals don't do much at all.

39:57.100 --> 40:03.980
It's actually the interplay of dissonance. And to my mind, this is also true of the nature of

40:03.980 --> 40:13.740
ecosystems. If you think about the relationship between a lion and a gazelle, it doesn't look

40:13.740 --> 40:19.020
very consonant, certainly not from the gazelle's point of view. Okay. There's a lot of tension,

40:19.020 --> 40:24.220
a lot of antipathy, animosity, but when you take the step back to the ecosystem as a whole,

40:25.180 --> 40:31.580
that is unfolded within a larger harmony. And so what can this teach us? Well, what happens if

40:31.580 --> 40:38.940
we apply this to the notion of truth rather than the being one truth? What if we understand the

40:38.940 --> 40:44.940
ontology of truth to be like an ecosystem? And actually, there are a diversity of truths that

40:44.940 --> 40:55.740
come in together that kind of form a larger whole. So this is, to my mind about the direction we

40:55.740 --> 41:02.380
need to go in, these kinds of metaphors might offer us insight about the nature of reality.

41:03.740 --> 41:11.020
Okay, I want to go to one more now. So I'm just going to grab a guitar.

41:15.100 --> 41:27.100
Okay. So unfortunately, I probably need a very, very close microphone for you guys to see this,

41:27.100 --> 41:30.140
and you won't be able to hear it either, but you'll just have to take my word for it.

41:31.100 --> 41:39.660
If I play this string here, it resonates and vibrates. Okay. Now the other five strings in

41:39.660 --> 41:51.580
the guitar don't do anything. They don't move. But if I play this note here, if I put my finger in

41:51.580 --> 42:01.660
this fret, that's the same tone, same pitch as this note. And what's interesting is when two strings

42:01.660 --> 42:07.260
are at the same pitch and you play one of them, the other starts to resonate as well.

42:07.980 --> 42:12.540
They start to sync up, and the other one actually starts to resonate and vibrate.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.460
If it's not the same pitch, it'll just be completely static.

42:19.420 --> 42:24.140
So how does this offer us an insight? What is the metaphor that we can draw here?

42:24.940 --> 42:31.900
Well, I want to argue that this is actually a metaphor for music itself, because I believe that

42:32.860 --> 42:41.100
music has the capacity to allow different consciousnesses. So the consciousness, for

42:41.100 --> 42:46.140
instance, my consciousness, the consciousness of Anna, the consciousness of Haley, of Kylan, Rob,

42:46.140 --> 42:52.780
we can actually come into a resonance together through music. And this is what music does.

42:52.780 --> 42:59.020
And I want to share with you an example of this. A quite powerful recent example of this,

42:59.740 --> 43:05.980
which is from the singer Oliver Antony. And he has a song, I'll see if I can bring this up now.

43:05.980 --> 43:12.060
You might have heard this, you might recognize this. I think this video now has over 110 million

43:12.060 --> 43:22.060
views online. And there's something about the pain of his song, about the authenticity of his

43:22.060 --> 43:29.100
singing, the melody and the words that resonated with people all over the world.

43:31.740 --> 43:34.380
So I'd like to play just a little bit for you.

43:52.540 --> 44:00.780
It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to for people like me, people like you wish I could

44:00.780 --> 44:13.660
just wake up and not be true, but it is. Oh, it is living in the new world with an old soul.

44:14.380 --> 44:21.580
These rich men, old for rich men, Lord knows it all, just want to have total control.

44:21.580 --> 44:27.580
Want to know what you think, want to know what you do, and they don't think you know.

44:27.580 --> 44:33.260
But I know that you do, because your daughter hates shit, and it's tax to no hand.

44:33.260 --> 44:38.060
Tax to no hand, old for rich men, old for rich men.

44:47.260 --> 44:52.060
Okay, I feel really bad for having to cut these songs off.

44:55.420 --> 44:57.740
So I hope you can be with me in that.

44:58.300 --> 45:06.940
What was interesting about this was if you look at the comments on YouTube,

45:08.060 --> 45:12.220
you see people from all over the world saying how they resonate with this.

45:12.220 --> 45:19.500
People living in Iran, South Africa, Finland, Zimbabwe, the UK, Turkish, Netherlands,

45:20.060 --> 45:25.820
Germany, Australia, it goes on and on. And there's one comment that I wanted to just highlight

45:26.380 --> 45:30.060
that somebody said, I'm from the UK, and this song isn't just an American anthem,

45:30.060 --> 45:36.540
it's a world anthem. And so there's something about music, and I think it's because it goes

45:36.540 --> 45:47.980
into the depth of who we are as human beings, that it can kind of, to use a kind of musical

45:47.980 --> 45:57.340
cliche, strike a chord. It can somehow, consciousness is all over the world, and

45:58.460 --> 46:05.020
different people can resonate in the same understanding. It's much more profound,

46:05.020 --> 46:10.060
I think, and much more powerful than just words, just saying, yeah, to just say,

46:11.180 --> 46:15.660
working people, working class people are having a hard time at the moment. Doesn't do it like his

46:15.660 --> 46:24.540
song does it, no? And so one of the ways that music can enlighten, can reveal

46:25.420 --> 46:29.500
deep aspects of the nature of reality, aspects of nature ourselves, is through metaphor,

46:29.500 --> 46:34.300
and I've talked a lot about metaphor, but the other way is actually through direct experience.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.900
And I want to share with you a couple more songs.

46:37.900 --> 46:46.620
One is from a band called the Swan Silver Tones, a group of singers, a group of gospel singers.

46:47.420 --> 46:52.620
I was fortunate enough to stumble across this group of singers when I was about 15,

46:52.620 --> 46:59.100
and I just happened into a CD store and bought some kind of compilation of great gospel singers

46:59.100 --> 47:04.700
for about, I think it was probably about £1.50 at the time. And these are some of,

47:04.700 --> 47:08.860
to my mind, some of the best singers I've ever heard. And you might notice that I have a particular

47:08.860 --> 47:14.780
affection for the African American musical heritage. So I'm going to play with you for

47:14.780 --> 47:22.300
you a song called Mary Don't You Weep. And for me, there's something amazing about this music

47:22.300 --> 47:28.700
that comes from a time and from a people who suffered extremely, like suffered terribly.

47:29.420 --> 47:36.780
And the music has within it that suffering, has within it the pathos, the struggle of life,

47:37.660 --> 47:45.020
and yet it has joy, and yet it has ecstasy, and yet it actually tilts into moments of transcendence

47:45.020 --> 47:51.500
and hopefulness. And to me, that says something profound about the word it means to be human

47:51.500 --> 47:58.060
and what's possible for human beings. I'll play this just now, and it's just about just short

47:58.060 --> 48:05.020
of three minutes, I think this song. We're hopefully not being too indulgent, but I think it's just

48:05.020 --> 48:16.780
so good it's worth listening to the whole thing. And just to notice, just noticing the warmth,

48:16.780 --> 48:22.140
the softness in it, but then the kind of movement to the climax of ecstasy and joy at the end.

48:28.060 --> 48:40.940
And Mary, Martha don't have tomorrow. Listen to me, Mary, Martha don't have tomorrow.

48:43.500 --> 48:52.140
Pharaoh's army, they got drowned in the sea one day, but Jesus said Mary,

48:52.860 --> 49:00.220
your little sister don't have tomorrow. Now can I get a witness, he said Mary,

49:02.460 --> 49:08.540
Martha don't have tomorrow. It may be somebody sick today,

49:09.500 --> 49:15.740
if somebody here ain't got no home. But listen, Pharaoh's army,

49:16.220 --> 49:23.100
they got drowned in the sea one day, but I believe in man said Mary,

49:24.860 --> 49:31.420
your little sister don't have tomorrow. Now listen, if I could write your name,

49:32.540 --> 49:38.780
I won't tell you that I surely would not. Put your foot on the rock,

49:38.780 --> 49:42.940
put your hand on the rock, stand on the rock where Moses stood one day,

49:44.060 --> 49:51.180
because of the Pharaoh's army. That's what the Bible said, you got drowned in the sea one day,

49:51.740 --> 49:55.580
but I believe in man said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.

49:56.460 --> 50:00.220
He said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.

50:00.220 --> 50:02.940
He said Mary, your little sister don't have tomorrow.

50:03.100 --> 50:08.860
Trouble in the land will be all over after war. You won't have to give up night for long for

50:08.860 --> 50:15.660
more, and maybe it could have been a little hard to hear. And I believe Jesus said I better call a

50:15.660 --> 50:25.100
little bit louder. I wish I had somebody to help me call Mary.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.100
Over deep water I've been trusting my name.

50:45.100 --> 50:55.100
I don't believe she heard you, you better call her again.

51:03.820 --> 51:14.860
Okay, this one's Silver Tones. So,

51:18.940 --> 51:28.300
this is the annoying aspect of metanoia, but there's another aspect which is the

51:28.860 --> 51:34.700
music of spiritual practice, and this is the kind of the action part of inner transformation.

51:35.820 --> 51:44.860
And there are many ways in which music as is either enhances spiritual practice or is a direct

51:45.660 --> 51:49.420
directly implicated or the direct path of spiritual practice.

51:51.180 --> 51:55.500
I'll come back to the writer and the elephant. We see this in the indigenous traditions,

51:56.300 --> 52:03.740
in plant ceremonies, in Christian choral, even song, and Buddhist chanting,

52:03.740 --> 52:11.260
and the Sufi mystics, the whirling dervishes, and breath work. And then, of course, more recently

52:11.260 --> 52:17.260
is an existential and spiritual practice psychedelics. Music is often really, really central to that.

52:17.500 --> 52:26.220
And one of the reasons I think music is particularly powerful, and it relates to

52:26.220 --> 52:32.460
this notion that Jonathan High developed this metaphor of the writer and the elephant,

52:32.460 --> 52:42.220
which is a description, a way to describe the human psyche. And so, he sees the human psyche

52:42.220 --> 52:48.620
as being composed of these two parts. The writer represents the rational mind, the intellect,

52:48.620 --> 53:01.180
their capacity for planning, their capacity to plan, make decisions, see into the future,

53:01.180 --> 53:07.660
and the elephant is our kind of deeper, more evolutionary, ancient, instinctual, emotional,

53:07.660 --> 53:14.860
impulsive self. And what's key is the way these two aspects of ourselves relate to each other.

53:14.860 --> 53:19.660
So, on the surface, it might look like the writer is in control. The writer's deciding,

53:19.660 --> 53:24.940
right, go this way, go that way. But really, if the elephant wants to go in a different direction,

53:24.940 --> 53:32.540
what hope has the writer got? And so, this speaks to the problem of acracia,

53:32.780 --> 53:39.020
that we might see what the right thing to do is we might desire to go in a certain direction,

53:39.660 --> 53:43.900
but due to our emotional selves, our instinctual selves, our impulsive selves, our desire for

53:44.700 --> 53:50.860
pleasure, or the force of fear of whatever it might be, the elephant goes its own direction.

53:51.500 --> 53:57.180
And the reason spiritual practice is so powerful is because we can then, it's a way for us to train

53:57.180 --> 54:02.620
the elephant. It's a way for the writers to say to the elephant, okay, we're going to learn how to

54:02.620 --> 54:08.620
go in the right direction. And I think music is a particularly powerful aspect, particularly

54:08.620 --> 54:14.220
powerful method in spiritual practice, because music actually speaks to the deeper aspects of us.

54:14.860 --> 54:21.660
It doesn't just operate at the kind of upper intellectual level, the more recently evolved

54:22.540 --> 54:29.180
aspects of human cognition, but it speaks to the depth of our being. And which is why it's used

54:29.180 --> 54:34.780
in all of these different traditions. It can be used devotionally, so then it can kind of draw

54:34.780 --> 54:39.660
us towards the good draws towards the beautiful draws towards the transcendent. It can also be

54:39.660 --> 54:46.140
used as a kind of an alchemical process, like in breathwork practices or psychedelics, where the

54:46.140 --> 54:52.220
music itself seems to be a kind of a catalytic agent that can actually bring about kind of

54:52.220 --> 54:59.020
inner transformation. So I thought it would be nice actually for us to engage in just a little bit

54:59.020 --> 55:09.980
of practice right now together and use music as part of that. So what I want to do is just do a

55:09.980 --> 55:15.500
very short meditation. I'd like to guide us for a few minutes, and then I'd like to play

55:15.500 --> 55:21.020
a very well-known song, you've probably heard it many times, Debussy's Clair de Lune, which is a

55:21.020 --> 55:28.540
beautiful, evocative, very deep song, piece of piano music. But what I'd like to do is guide us

55:28.540 --> 55:35.580
into contemplation on the interconnectedness of the cosmos. And then as we listen to the music,

55:35.580 --> 55:43.500
just rest in the kind of remembering. In Buddhism, the word for mindfulness is sati,

55:43.500 --> 55:47.740
which means remembering. And another way of saying remembering, which I really like,

55:47.740 --> 55:55.500
I learned from the trauma specialist, Peter Levine, is remembering being the opposite of

55:55.500 --> 56:01.580
dismembering. So when something is dismembered, it's pulled apart, but remembering is to sew

56:01.580 --> 56:07.740
back together. So the invitation is to kind of rest on the remembering of our interconnectedness

56:07.740 --> 56:15.420
with everything, or coming back together with the whole. And I think this short quote from

56:15.420 --> 56:21.500
Einstein, which is also well known, is appropriate for this. And this is something Einstein, I think

56:21.500 --> 56:27.420
he wrote this to a friend when they recently experienced the bereavement, and he wrote this

56:27.420 --> 56:32.940
to them to console them. This was in a letter he sent to them. A human being is a part of the whole

56:32.940 --> 56:39.900
called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and

56:39.900 --> 56:45.340
feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

56:46.140 --> 56:51.180
The delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires,

56:51.180 --> 56:57.180
and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this

56:57.180 --> 57:03.500
prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of

57:03.500 --> 57:11.260
nature and its beauty. Okay, so if you want to find a way of sitting that feels comfortable

57:11.900 --> 57:19.980
and stable, and I'll guide us in a short meditation just for a few minutes, and then I'll play the

57:19.980 --> 57:24.860
piece of music and my invitation is just to listen to the music and let yourself rest into it and

57:24.860 --> 57:34.140
just let your attention really be fully with the music and where it wants to go. Okay, so

57:40.380 --> 57:46.300
get me nice too. Let me close the eyes that feels comfortable for you.

57:49.660 --> 57:52.460
It can also be good to take a few slightly deeper breaths.

57:54.860 --> 58:04.060
And with each in breath and out breath,

58:06.380 --> 58:10.060
allowing the mind, allowing the mind to kind of rest down into the body,

58:10.940 --> 58:19.340
and feeling also the body supported

58:22.620 --> 58:25.020
by the chair whenever you're sitting on,

58:29.180 --> 58:36.060
feeling the gentle force of gravity operating on the body.

58:40.060 --> 59:00.060
And then allowing the breath to find its own rhythm, allowing the body to just breathe naturally.

59:03.500 --> 59:07.020
Almost everything that is alive breathes in some way.

59:10.780 --> 59:19.900
So sometimes it can be a sense that life is breathing us.

59:27.980 --> 59:35.420
The breath, it's a rhythm in nature like so many rhythms, the rhythm of day and night,

59:35.740 --> 59:40.700
the rhythm of the seasons,

59:44.380 --> 59:45.900
the rhythms of the tides,

59:50.380 --> 59:53.420
the heartbeats of countless creatures,

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:16.060
and of course the body is warmed by the sun in this moment.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.420
Without the sun there would be no heat.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.660
And also the body is full of water,

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.260
because dependent on the rivers, the oceans, the clouds,

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:19.260
so simply resting here in a kind of remembrance, the interconnectedness with everything else.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:52.060
Hey, we need some time to come back,

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.300
back to the screen.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.180
Back from the cosmos, back to the screen.

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:22.140
So I'd like to just finish by speaking briefly about music as realisation.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:31.020
And so if the music's capacity to enlighten is about bringing us into deeper understanding

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:38.700
of reality and offering insights to reality, and in souling is about practice,

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:44.460
then if we come back to that kind of those original three aspects of metanoia,

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:49.820
to my mind music as realisation is maybe the most important and most profound,

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:55.100
which is transforming what we love, transformation of loving,

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.580
very much in that respect value section.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:06.060
And so to this end, I want to draw in the words of Thich Nhat Hanh.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:16.220
And yeah, I'll read, I'll just read this out, this is from I think the fifth of 10

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.100
love letters to Mother Earth. Thich Nhat Hanh writes, Dear Mother Earth,

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.940
There are those of us who walk the earth searching for a promised land,

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.740
not realising that you are the wondrous place who've been looking for our whole life.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:38.220
You already are a wonderful and beautiful kingdom of heaven, the most beautiful planet in the solar

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:44.140
system, the most beautiful place in the heavens. You are the pure land where countless buddhas and

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:50.140
bodhisattvas of the past manifested, realised enlightenment and taught the Dharma. I do not

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:55.340
need to imagine a pure land of the Buddha to the west or a kingdom of God above where I will go

01:08:55.340 --> 01:09:02.060
when I die. Heaven is here on earth, the kingdom of God is here and now. I don't need to die to be

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:08.540
in the kingdom of God. In fact, I need to be very much alive. I can touch the kingdom of God with

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:22.940
every step. So for me, this is quite a profound view on the nature of life and the nature of

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.900
the nature of our relationship to what could be called divine or sacred.

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:41.020
One way that this is spoken on, the pithiest way this is spoken of, this is it, which is to say that

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:49.900
music doesn't just point towards the true, the good and the beautiful, it doesn't just point

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:56.380
towards the possibility of a sacred relationship with reality or the realisation of sacredness.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:06.540
Music is itself a beautiful manifestation of truth, goodness and beauty. It is reality manifesting

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:13.820
as joy, as beauty, as sacredness and we can participate in that directly through music.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:22.380
In this Zen tradition, they teach that this is available to us all the time and a similar

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:32.140
sentiment is depicted in this painting by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.460
where you have Adam and God reaching to each other and if you look closely, you'll see that

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:44.940
Adam's finger, where God's finger and arm is fully outstretched, Adam's finger is,

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.740
for them to make contact, is up to Adam to just extend his finger that little bit further.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:57.660
And the meaning of this is that what we can infer is that God is all of what's available to us,

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:03.180
the ultimate, the divine, the sacred nature of reality, beauty, truth, goodness, the wondrousness

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:09.340
that is reality is available to us, but it's just up to us to kind of wake up to it, to realise that,

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:21.100
to make that movement towards it. And I like to think that music is, to add one more dimension

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:28.140
to this picture, music is kind of God calling to us, singing to us, urging us to come into

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:39.180
contact with this sacred nature of reality. And there was a conversation recently between

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:46.940
Ima Gilchrist, Daniel Schmutterberger and John Verveke, and they talked about the need for really,

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:54.780
for a transformation or value-ception, for collectively, as to come, to reorientate towards

01:11:54.780 --> 01:12:00.460
deeper, true or higher values. And the term the sacred actually came up 52 times in the space of

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:05.900
the conversation. And it wasn't just in one part, it came up throughout the entire conversation.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:14.140
And this is three very accomplished thinkers putting their minds to the question of how do

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:19.420
we address the metacrisis and how do we chart a new path. And there was this constant coming back

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:25.660
to this need to orient towards the sacred. And my sense is that music offers us a way to,

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.260
not just to point towards it, but actually to participate in it, to realise it, to experience

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:40.540
it in the here and now. And this is, I think, what music offers us is realisation.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:48.060
And it can help us fall in love with reality. If somebody can have an appreciation of the

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:55.180
sacredness of the beauty of reality through music, then my sense is that that can open up

01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.300
into an appreciation and the sacredness of reality as a whole beyond music as well.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:07.420
I'd like to share for you one final, final clip. Okay, just before I get to that clip,

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:16.780
I just want to share this briefly. This notion that the fruit contains the seed.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.860
So far, I've been talking about music as metaphor as a way to understand reality, music as spiritual

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:30.220
practice. And all of these things would point to the notion that music is a way to get to some

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:37.500
better goal. And you could think of all of our attempts to address the various crises we're in,

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:44.140
the predicament we're in, as means to some kind of end, maybe in the future, maybe 700, 150 years,

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.220
where human beings finally learn how to live in harmony with each other on the planet.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:58.140
But I think we also need to understand what we can learn from this notion that the fruit and the

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:05.580
seed can be the same thing. And what I mean by that is, if we are seeking a more beautiful world,

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:15.740
if we are seeking a more beautiful world, one way to explain the way to that is that there is no

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:24.220
way to a more beautiful world. The more beautiful world is the way. So if we seek to bring into

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:29.100
being a more beautiful world, we have to realize it in the here and now. We have to make it come

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:34.700
alive in the here and now. And when I think about what a beautiful, more beautiful world might entail

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:41.020
it definitely has people singing and dancing in it. It's people somehow coming together in community,

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.980
maybe sharing food, and maybe they're celebrating the joy and the miracle of life,

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.780
maybe they're having a live experience of the beauty and the wondrousness of existence.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:57.020
There's something of that there. And if we can do that in the here and now and move into that more

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.980
and more, I think it sows the seed for more in that it sows the seed for a more beautiful world.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:08.140
Whereas if we think, well, that's kind of a luxury. We need to just figure out how we're going to

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.780
transition off of fossil fuels, or we just need to figure out how we're going to deal with our

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:20.140
the kind of scourge of misinformation, or we need to just focus on the problems.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:26.140
My concern is that we'll actually forget to be in love with the world. We'll get to be in love

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:34.220
with reality. And that is really surely going to bring our demise. So there's a need to bring to life

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.860
the more beautiful world in the here and now. And if we do that, that has its own causal power,

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:49.500
that has its own causal agency. And the final thing I want to point towards is that we need to find

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:56.060
new ways. We need to give birth to new forms of communitas that generate the right set and

01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:02.220
setting to fully harness the spiritual power of music. And so what I mean by this is in psychedelic

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.980
therapy and psychedelic practice, they talk about the importance of the set and setting.

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.700
If you're the set is the kind of mindset you bring to it, the intention you bring to it.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.420
And the setting is the environment, the people you're around. And if these things are

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:22.780
not right, the likelihood of a good trip or a valuable trip is goes down. And the likelihood

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:28.780
of a bad or very traumatic trip goes can go up quite a lot. But if you get the set and setting

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.500
right, you can have a much more helpful experience. And I think just now what happens with music,

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:40.300
sadly in our kind of spiritually hollowed out culture, and are the way kind of capitalism

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:46.380
has infiltrated every aspect of life, music is reduced to mere entertainment,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:53.900
something we merely consume. And we don't really engage with it in profound spiritual

01:16:53.900 --> 01:17:00.540
context or with a profound spiritual intention, kind of related to the this historical moment,

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:07.340
to the challenges of our times. And if I feel like it's something we need to experiment,

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.740
we need to explore how we can do that. And I don't know how to do that. Quite honestly,

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:19.900
I'm not sure. I also think there's a necessity to do this in ways that are not bound within the

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:26.940
old religious traditions, which to many people, the kind of dogmatic metaphysical and cosmological

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.900
claims turn them off. And we need to do this in a way that can be more pluralistic, more open,

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:40.140
but none the less, affirms the deep maturing of life. And so I want to just share one final video

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:49.420
now, which is of, which I had the chance to record when I was in Argentina last year. And

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:57.420
in Argentina, Buenos Aires, my wife, Kylan, who's on this call, we were there for, I think,

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:04.460
just over two months. And one of the things that we saw a lot, which was quite, in some sense,

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:10.380
kind of amusing, but also wondrous, is that the Argentinians, they protest a lot. They seem

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:16.380
to be always on the streets protesting, right? But whenever they protest, they're out playing

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:25.980
drums and they're dancing. Okay, so I want to show you just a quick video that I took of just this

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:06.540
video. Okay, so there you go. So this is just an example that was, that doesn't happen, at least

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:12.460
in my country in Scotland, we don't see this, you know, very much at all. But it's kind of woven

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:19.180
into communal cultural practice that has a kind of socio-political end to it goal in mind. And

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:28.300
it becomes a form of communitas, but also is devoted to some wider aim. And I'm really curious

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:36.380
about how could we form, how can we kind of give rise, give birth to new forms of communal activity,

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:42.620
new cultural practices that really harness music, and the address that speak to the challenges of

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:48.140
our time. And so that's the one of the things that, in this project that we're, we're kind of in the,

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:53.580
in the very early stages of a perspectiva, I'm giving my mind to, to think about how that might happen.

01:19:55.260 --> 01:20:04.780
So that's me. I'm finished with that workshop. I hope you guys are not totally exhausted by that.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.980
And I very, very much appreciate your presence and attention. What I'd like to do now
