0	9360	Thank you so much, Lee. I hope you can all hear me okay. You might be wondering why it
9360	16480	looks like a horror movie here. I'm currently in Kerala, India, with my family, and there's
16480	23320	been a power cut just a few minutes before coming online, which means weirdly the system
23320	28320	preserves certain things like Wi-Fi but allows other things to die like lights. So I currently
28400	32880	have my phone light beaming in on me, which is why you have this effect. So don't be scared.
33680	39040	Do imagine the best and not the worst for me in this context. We are speaking about imagination
39040	45360	today after all. And it's a great pleasure to invite, well, to welcome you all here first of all,
46640	51920	and this is now the fourth in our series of talks with Ian about the
52640	59920	the matter with things. I get confused with that because I wrote a book once
59920	65040	myself called The Moves that Matter, and every so often the two books kind of flip in my head.
65040	70640	This is about the matter with things, and it's the fourth in our series. And we are particularly
70640	76480	interested tonight to speak about imagination. Our prior event was more about sanity, prior to that
76480	83680	about value, and prior to that matters of Ian's work more generally. Tonight we've arranged the
83680	90400	conversation with Phoebe Tekel, whom I'm very pleased to introduce to you all. Many of you will
90400	96000	know her already. Phoebe is, I'll give the formal definition before the informal one, a biologist,
96000	101840	systems thinker, and founder of moral imaginations. It's an organization driving a movement of
101840	108000	imagination-powered activism, placing life back at the center of the economy, politics, and systems
108000	113360	of governance. Phoebe works across multiple societal contexts, and has advised government,
113360	118480	the education sector, and the food and farming sector. More recently she has worked with Camden
118480	123920	Council to train council officers in the skills of collective imagination and horizontal leadership.
125040	129120	Phoebe will speak a bit more about what all of that means, but I can say that I know her
129120	135120	personally. I was also part of a sort of imagination practice that she did with a large
135120	140560	group of people in Berlin a few years ago. So I have firsthand experience of how she evokes and
140560	146800	elicits sort of imagination in large groups of people for the greater good, and it's a practice
146800	152400	that's continuing to develop and be refined as we go. Phoebe is a scientist by background,
152400	159600	like Ian, they have in common this kind of deep spirit of scientific inquiry leading you
159600	164160	beyond science, which I think all the best scientists somehow on the one hand remain loyal
164160	169520	to science and yet somehow move themselves beyond it as well, and I think they share that at the
169520	176640	very least. I think the way I've seen this conversation in outline is that this is a chance for
177200	182320	Ian who's fascinated by imagination and makes it one of his main pathways to truth
182880	189680	in the matter of things, to speak with someone who's working very seriously and in a very dedicated
189680	195600	way to bring imagination, to walk the talk of imagination in practice in civil society context,
196160	200480	where we say we need greater imagination but don't always know how to go about doing it.
200480	205680	Phoebe's actually taking it very seriously and trying to do that, and for Phoebe it's a chance
205680	212560	to get a richer, more full theoretical take on what exactly imagination is and why,
212560	216000	and I believe they're going to explore many things including moral imagination.
217920	223200	So it's a great pleasure to let them speak to each other, and I can release you from the
223200	229440	terror of this image of me with the light and the darkness. I hope to be back for the Q&A
229440	235520	looking slightly more respectable, but until then I welcome the chance to introduce you to
235520	239920	Phoebe Tekel and Ian McGilchrist, and I hope they'll have a great 50 or so minutes talking
239920	244960	between them, and then we'll speak about how to do the Q&A once it starts then.
245760	248160	Thank you all very much, and I'll see you a bit later. Bye.
251920	256960	Ian, is it just me who thinks Jonathan should probably stick to that kind of
256960	263520	intro in the dark with the light? I think it's a marvellous improvement.
265840	269600	So often a negation proves to be extremely positive.
270560	275280	I agree. What better introduction to a session on imagination?
276160	283280	Indeed, indeed. So yeah, you carry on. No, no, I'd like you to fire away.
284000	290240	Okay, so I mean, I wanted to just start by saying that it's not an exaggeration to say that it's a
290240	296480	huge honour to have this conversation, and just to say a big thank you for your work
297840	304640	on reading the master and his emissary, and also the two huge tones which I've got here on my desk,
304640	309920	the two latest books. Massive. I've been using it as a laptop stand, but also really amazing,
310800	317840	really incredible, but really grateful because as I have been reading your work,
317840	324160	what I have been finding is that there is a resonance to the work that goes beyond just the
324160	330560	content. There's a sort of grammar of meaning, and it kind of reminded me of the conversation
330560	335760	you and Zach were having about how meaning and value are so inherent in the universe,
335760	343040	and I really had this sense as I read your book that there is something resonating in your work
343040	350000	that is much deeper than the left hemispheric kind of, oh, that's an interesting fact, and
350000	355120	oh, that's a great quote, and that's a fantastic bit of research. There is something going on
356240	363200	at a deeper level, which perhaps also has something to do with identity,
363760	368640	because actually as a scientist, as somebody who started life in the sciences and felt
369280	378880	profoundly dissatisfied by the scientific route to truth, and really felt that the
378880	385680	sciences as a whole were just quite impoverished as a way to understand reality. As I'm reading
385760	394000	your books, I'm feeling like you've done me and probably many others a huge favour to give us
394000	404160	a stack of research and backing for what that feeling is, the feeling of this can't be all
404160	411360	there is, there must be more, and I found my way from science, how long ago was it, about
411920	416080	seven years ago I left the lab at Imperial College London, finally said, okay,
416880	421600	I love science, but there's something more, and actually if we want to try and address what's
421600	426560	wrong with the world, clearly science and technology don't have the answers, because we've been trying
426560	433840	that route for the last 200 plus years, so there's something else, and I found my way to
433840	438480	imagination, which is obviously the topic of what we're going to focus on today, and I found it
438560	446080	profoundly encouraging that the final chapter of the first volume of the matter of things is
446080	453120	imagination, it feels like you went on a similar path from questioning science as the only
453120	459440	route, science and reason as the only route to truth, to questioning how are we unmaking the
459440	466320	world through perception, through some kind of divorce from reality, because clearly there's
466320	471520	something going on if we're so out of touch with reality, that we're creating the kind of
471520	477600	destruction that we see today, and I'll stop in a second, but one of the other things I found
477600	483920	profoundly satisfying was that you also came to the same conclusion, that imagination is not
484560	490320	a faculty and a capacity that takes us away from the world, it's actually one that brings us
490320	495200	closer to reality, and I feel like this is what I've been trying to say for the last kind of four
495280	500720	or five years when I started the work with moral imagination, I was saying I think imagination
500720	507600	can get us closer to what really matters and what is real, but I felt like I was sounding like a
507600	515680	crazy person, so that's where I want to start, it's just a big thank you really, and I'm curious
515680	522560	to hear any thoughts you've got in response to that. Oh that's a very kind introduction,
522640	527600	and there were so many things in what you said that I would love to pick up on,
529200	536080	I mean one that just comes to mind is the difficulty of articulating the really important
536080	543760	things, and these are the things that don't therefore get adequate treatment into science
543760	551840	and in the discourse of reason, both of which I honor hugely, as I believe you do too, but I don't
551840	558160	accept that they are the only ways of reaching reality or even necessarily the most profound ones,
559120	564080	but they make a very very valuable contribution, and I worry about the way in which sometimes
564080	572800	nowadays people are too ready to disparage either science or reason, so yes, but essentially
573440	580640	it's going to defeat language, because what we're talking about when we're thinking about
580720	592000	imagination is a resonance between ourselves and another, and that other isn't necessarily
592000	601120	well specified, but it's absolutely real, it may be the existence of a phenomenological world
601120	608080	around us, it may be a realm in which the better ways to talk about ourselves are as
608080	617360	embodied souls, but there is here something that language will always bring to the ground
617360	625280	with a great flood, which is in no way does justice to what it is that we're talking about,
625280	630720	so I do think that imagination is central, and that's why in a way I did work towards that at the
630720	637440	end of part one and that section on epistemology, and you'll notice at the end of part two which is
637520	642640	the metaphysics, I have a chapter on the sense of the sacred, which is also another thing you
643840	648560	know from the very word go, it's going to defeat language, but we mustn't be put off by that,
648560	653440	we must stick to our perceptions, and you can have perceptions and you can have insights
654240	658800	without them necessarily having to be explicit in language, in fact all the best ones are not,
658800	666400	which is why we have poetry, why we have music, why we have ritual, why we have narrative myths,
666400	673280	all these things are able to put us in touch with things that importantly need to remain
673280	680480	implicit unless they're going to be degraded by this the common coin of everyday language,
680480	685680	which makes everything similar to something else that we already know, so what are we going to
685680	689520	do about the realm where we're going to find things that we don't already know, because language
689520	694320	only deals with the stuff that we do, unless it works against itself, and you may know that my
694320	704000	first book was called Against Criticism, I wrote it in my 20s, and well anyway yes, I think it was,
704720	711120	it sold about 400 copies and after that was unceremoniously remained, and Faber made a big
711120	722480	loss on it, but the idea there was to argue there was something wrong with the way in which we
722480	729760	conceived academic criticism, which was to take an entity that was living entirely imaginative,
730720	737520	implicit, embodied, and utterly unique, and turn it into something every day that was
737520	743440	general in nature, decontextualized, disembodied, and from which the the magic of imagination
743440	749520	had disappeared, but there was another meaning to the title, which was that criticism could work
749520	755920	if it worked against criticism, in other words, there is a kind of discourse which is aware of
755920	761440	its own limitations and can incorporate them, there is a kind of science that can be aware
761440	767760	of the limitations and therefore not become hubristic about what it can definitely state,
767760	773440	and it's getting into that area where you've neither rubbish something nor said this is our
773440	778160	saviour, this will give us all the story, there will never be the whole story, because I believe
778160	783040	that whatever it is we're trying to contact is essentially infinite, and also of infinite
783040	788880	importance, which gives us a bit of a thing to think about during our lifetime, because we
788880	796640	have a short period in which to make use of this amazing gift, so that's what I'd say in the outset
796640	801760	anyway, how would you, what would you think about that?
801840	810880	Not there, so a metaphor, a couple of things, so the metaphor that I can't remember where it
810880	816480	is in the book, but where you talk about the flat, maybe it's in a quote, the flashlight
816480	822080	and the the fertile dark, biochemist who is talking about how, you know,
822080	828320	Irwin Charakoff, yes, yes, and I loved that, so he was saying, you know, I think people think
828320	835040	that science is about illuminating the darkness, but actually science needs this fertile darkness,
835040	840560	and if you think that you're illuminating it, it's the kind of flashlight in the void, you know,
840560	848800	in the dark, starry skies and, you know, kind of incredible, mystical, ineffable universe,
848800	852880	and you've got this flashlight and you're saying, well, we found it, it's this room here that we
852880	859360	can see, and I thought that was such a good, such a great metaphor for what we, you know,
859360	864640	what the situation we're in, and then it also made me think about, obviously as an imagination,
865520	874320	activist, you know, person, you know, obsessive, I've read quite a lot of Blake, William Blake.
874400	883120	Ah, wonderful, yes. You know, his work is huge, hugely, not just inspirational, but like your
883120	889360	work, the kind of work where I read his work and I think, ah, like, yes, this is, this is resonating
889360	894000	with what I'm finding in my practice and, you know, in the kind of lab of imagination where
894000	898800	we're trying out practices and working with people and actually seeing some of, you know,
898800	906560	what he's talking about in kind of 1700s, feeling like, yes. And he, I think there's a work of his
906560	912960	art where he paints Newton, and, you know, he's painted Isaac Newton with this, and he's like
912960	918160	staring at this, at this piece of paper, which has got like a beautiful graph on it, and then
918160	923600	there's like the big chaotic, mystical universe around him, but he's just, you know, he's focusing
923680	929840	on this kind of perfect, you know, perfect equations or, you know, some sort of representation of the
929840	936160	world. And so that, that's what comes up for me is that, you know, science is beautiful and elegant,
936160	941200	and that the reason why I chose to study science and I loved it, like I'm sure you did as well.
942640	948960	But we think that we are discovering everything, you know, it's quite often that I hear people
949040	952400	say like, oh, what if we run out of things to discover of the unit, you know,
953440	962000	covered so much. And actually, what if we run out? Wow, what an impoverished reality.
962880	968480	You need imagination to see how little you know. If you don't have any, you think we know it all.
968480	976640	But yes, I'm so glad you brought up Blake, who by the way, you know, we both know that Blake was
977360	983760	a wonderful man, also quite frustrating in some ways. And he did tend to, for his own purposes,
983760	992640	demonize Newton, who, you know, interestingly, was was more fascinated by spiritual inklings
992640	998000	of his than he was in his physics. But it just goes to show that a great mind can,
998720	1004640	I believe, encompass both. And many of the great physicists of the last 100 years show that exactly
1004720	1012000	that they are able to see into the heart of things matter and see in there something
1012640	1018720	beyond and more profound. And that that brings me back to Blake. And I hope this is a fruitful
1018720	1027360	connection. I think the quote is, to the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.
1028000	1033920	I think I use that at the beginning of the chapter. And what's really interesting about
1033920	1040000	that, you can puzzle over it. What does he mean, the man of imagination, nature is imagination
1040000	1047360	itself. But just before it, I quote, Richard Feynman, who says that nature has a far, far
1047360	1053200	greater imagination than a human being, which is really a way of saying, our puny imagination can
1053200	1059040	only get so far in investigating what there is. But I think that Blake is making a more profound
1059120	1064320	point. I mean, it's a very good point, which I entirely agree. But I think what Blake is saying
1064960	1073120	is that the imagination, you are not inspecting or something over there. But in imagination,
1073120	1079040	you are already in whatever it is. So that the subject object divide is actually transcended.
1079680	1086640	So that if you really look into nature, you are already in nature. And this is what
1086640	1094960	imagination is about. It's about healing the divide, not in some terribly weird and new edgy way,
1094960	1100880	which means we can stop thinking. But there is something desperately profound in this idea
1101680	1109280	that in the realm of imagination, we are actually contacting not a representation,
1109280	1117120	which is what the left hemisphere offers us, not a drawing, a picture, a graph, a theory,
1117120	1124800	but the actual experience of what it is in which we finally see sort of through it, but not in the
1124800	1130080	sense of seeing through it to something that's separate from it beyond, but seeing through
1130080	1138160	the veil of familiarity to its real core. So I think that that's one thing I'd like to say
1138160	1144160	about imagination is that it brings us to this place. We're not sort of just making stuff up or
1144800	1148560	we're definitely not making stuff up. In fact, that's the exact opposite of what we're doing.
1148560	1157120	We're respectfully, honorably, humbly, with awe, approaching whatever it is, and thereby
1157120	1161360	allowing ourselves for once to get close to it and into it.
1162160	1172720	I'm so glad you said that. During the work of finding the thread of imagination and kind of
1172720	1179680	pulling on it and starting to unravel a huge amount, what I've been uncovering in my research
1179680	1185760	and thinking and writing and practice is that imagination, I think, is one of the most deeply
1186000	1191680	misunderstood things, not non-things, actually, because I think one of the reasons it's been
1192960	1197920	is because it's been so thingified. It's been so, you know, it's like, oh, the imagination,
1197920	1203920	the thing that is over there that we do sometimes on the weekend and we have it when we are
1203920	1208720	children, but we don't have it when we're out, you know, and it's this ridiculous kind of,
1208720	1214720	even the language we use around imagination is completely, it's not just inaccurate, but it
1214720	1221440	leads us into completely confused realms and creates quite an odd relationship between
1222480	1226800	ourselves and imagination. And this has been a lot of the work of the last few years is like,
1226800	1232080	actually, before I even get to do the work of actually, you know, testing and experimenting
1232080	1237600	with how can we increase, you know, increase imagination capacity, which is also a bit of a
1238480	1243840	an odd term. Because actually, what I've been finding is that there's no need to,
1243840	1249120	there's nothing to increase, because it's not a volume or a thing, there is just unblocking
1249120	1254320	to be done from the relationship to it. Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.
1255440	1255920	We'll do.
1258240	1265200	I mean, I wish this was like a four hour conversation, because it's so good to unpack some of this.
1266000	1272960	What I just wanted to comment about it there, since we've had a little hiatus is the idea that
1274080	1286000	imagination is not something that has somehow to be drummed up. It's something that is there
1286000	1293600	all the time, if a certain way of thinking doesn't get between us and it. So we use and have to use
1293600	1298640	the left hemisphere as mode of apprehension in order to be able to function properly. But as I'm
1298640	1302560	always saying, there's nothing wrong with that. There's something good about that. As long as we
1302560	1309600	can then remember to go beyond it, to have finished that process of unpacking explicitly,
1309600	1315280	and then say, right, it's none of that, although that has actually helped us on the way. So it's
1315280	1326160	as people say in so many religious traditions, that the seeking of God is not that God is hiding
1326160	1335280	somewhere, but God is there if only you don't stop yourself from seeing. And that could be said,
1335280	1341760	I think, about the imagination that it is there. And it's by not doing things and by not
1342400	1348080	espousing certain views and not acting and so on, but allowing, permitting something that it will
1348080	1354800	come into being for us. Exactly. And one of the things that the participants of, you know, the
1354800	1359280	programs that we're running with moral imagination say is that one of the most valuable things that
1359280	1366560	we're doing when we go into local councils is giving them planned unplanned time. And to start
1366560	1375280	with, the kind of managers were like, what do you need unplanned time? But that's actually what
1375280	1384480	it takes is to just, you know, how can we expect exercise imagination when there's no space or
1384480	1390560	time and we're completely flooded by the need to deliver, to produce, to perform
1391440	1398560	worst conditions for imagination. Modern day. And those are all expressions of the left
1398560	1404720	hemispheric mentality that we must have something we can measure. There must always be a utility,
1404720	1409840	there must be a product to this. Otherwise, this has been completely wasted, even if the time that
1409840	1414400	you spent was profoundly useful, but didn't actually turn up anything measurable at the time.
1415120	1424720	So it's all this administration managerial thinking that, in my view, is mushrooming in the
1424720	1431280	world. I mean, so fast that I think there's a very palpable difference between now and five years
1431280	1436320	ago. I mean, it was bad all the time I was growing up. I complained about it in the 70s and the 80s,
1436320	1443280	but I hadn't seen anything till you get to 2023. And I think this is partly to do with machines,
1443280	1449520	which of course, have no imagination, have no understanding of context, individuality,
1449520	1455440	embodiedness, feeling, the spiritual, anything. But our following simple left hemisphere rules say
1455440	1460880	it's much worse. It's much worse than talking to an administrator is having to deal with a machine.
1460880	1464800	And now most of the time when you want to do anything, you have to interface with the machine.
1464800	1470160	So that is the death of imagination. And I'm sure you know, Paul Kingsmorth uses the term
1470160	1475360	the machine as I think it's a perfectly good way of talking about what I mean by the left
1475360	1482000	hemisphere. All I'd say is that it's bigger than the machine in the machine is an expression of
1482000	1488400	this left hemisphere mentality. But the left hemisphere mentality is behind the machine and
1488400	1495120	behind many other things. So for example, we we look at various predicaments, the obviously the
1495120	1502560	destruction of the planet, the the catastrophic changes in climate, all of these things. And we
1502560	1509760	see them as something either bad luck or bad planning or something we did wrong. And we look
1509760	1516560	at other things like the growing disparity, not the diminishing disparity between the
1517440	1522880	unimaginably rich and the poor. And we think we must have got a problem here. And what did we do?
1522880	1526240	And there's all these different problems. What was the solution? And the answer is,
1526240	1532080	they're not problems, but in dual hinds terms, their predicaments that we have brought about
1532080	1538560	by a certain way of thinking, which leads inexorably to each of these, and to a de spiritualized,
1538560	1542240	desacralized sense of the world in which we live.
1545360	1550400	Yes. So, so I'm just holding in mind, you know, there's a couple of things I'd
1550480	1554720	like to cover in this conversation. So I'm just following the thread of where it's going. But
1554720	1560880	I will pull us into a couple of things. I'd really like to say, I'd love to spend some time on the
1560880	1564880	brain and imagination neuroscience, because that's something that, you know, I've done a lot of
1564880	1568720	thinking and research around. And and would love to talk to you about, you know, linking it with
1568720	1574320	the right, right and left hemisphere, and also talking about moral imagination, which was my
1574320	1580080	way into imagination. We must talk about both of those. Yes. Yes. I didn't just want to have,
1580160	1584800	you know, hat tip to chat GPT, because you mentioned, you know, machines don't have imagination,
1584800	1590560	and I'm sure that it's on everybody's mind is, you know, right now, there is a lot of talk about
1590560	1596720	how chat GPT seems to have imagination, you know, it's, it's kind of churning out poems and
1597600	1604640	rap battles and, you know, it seems to be creative, even though it's, you know, through a mimicry of
1604640	1608720	all the information, you know, kind of emergent property of all the information it's gathering
1608720	1615200	and kind of faring off. But, you know, do you want to say anything about? Oh, gosh, I do. Yes.
1615200	1622560	Because, I mean, I want to say that I can't intellectually completely rule out that at some
1622560	1631600	point, some creation of ours might might achieve a kind of consciousness. I just can't rule that
1631760	1639360	out, partly because I believe the consciousness is the original primary stuff of the cosmos,
1639360	1645680	in any case. But what you mean there, and what I mean by imagination is not what this is doing,
1645680	1650960	what it is doing is exactly what an imaginary person doesn't do, which is do a very quick,
1650960	1654560	which of course the human being couldn't do in this speed, what machines do is just do things
1654560	1662720	very fast, is to sort of do a trolley dash around Wikipedia and come up with an answer.
1662720	1668000	And it will even make stuff up and be quite sure that it's right because it sees a pattern and jumps
1668000	1674080	to conclusions, which is what the left hemisphere does. And really, this is no different from
1674080	1681040	something that existed decades ago. I can't remember the name of the man, but basically what he did was
1681120	1687440	he fed all of Bach's works into a computer, and then set some sort of, you know, let the
1687440	1693760	computer look at these things and then imitate a work of Bach. But none of these works has anything
1693760	1700160	like the power of Bach, and Bach's very first composition when he was 19 years old is already
1700160	1704960	one of the most staggering pieces of musical writing in history, and it wasn't derived from
1704960	1711600	anywhere. So we're looking at things that we must be careful, you know, because a machine
1711600	1717040	can be made by human ingenuity to simulate almost anything. I mean, there's no limit to how far you
1717040	1722880	can help it simulate. The question is, is it simulating something, or is it actually achieving
1722880	1730880	it? And so far, there's no evidence that it's achieving it. Is there also something about,
1731840	1739600	you know, it's almost like a left hemisphere response to art or to the sacred. It's like,
1739600	1744160	oh, but, you know, we could just churn out, you know, does the sacredness of art
1745200	1752400	become affected if it's something that's being churned out through random, you know, re-organization
1752400	1758720	of, you know, fact and existing art? I mean, that, I think we could talk for the whole hour
1758720	1765040	just about this, but I did just, you know, to touch on it. It's relevant. Well, really, it's
1765040	1774080	really the logical conclusion of the Industrial Revolution, which was to take things that took
1774080	1778960	a lot of craftsmanship and were, you know, occurred in nature, and try and imitate them,
1778960	1784640	and then produce thousands of them very, very fast. It's exactly what was going on already in the
1784640	1791680	early part of the 19th century. It's just been heightened to another level of technological
1791680	1801360	sophistication. But it's not going to produce, it's never going to produce works that have profound
1801360	1809440	human meaning, because you have to have a body, emotions, the sense of relationship, the knowledge
1809520	1816640	that you're going to die, to have suffered, and to be aware of the limitations to what it is that
1816640	1823520	you can experience. And I just think this is, this can be fed by a clever IT expert into a
1823520	1827440	computer. It seems to say those things, but it can't actually do them.
1827840	1841280	So back to, imagine it, the organic. I said at the beginning that I felt it was one of the most
1841280	1847760	deeply misunderstood, and we, without the signifying of imagination, you know, I also,
1847760	1854800	in your chapter 19 of your book, you talk about how, I guess the parallel is that
1855520	1861440	many people, when they think of imagination, think of fantasy, think of daydreaming. And this
1861440	1866800	is often what I get when I talk to people about what I do. It's like, oh yeah, you know, we need
1866800	1873040	more imagination, we need more fiction, you know, we need more creativity. Another big misconception
1873040	1878560	I've been fighting is that people think that my work is all about the future. It's not about
1879280	1885600	the future. It's about, it's not about time. In fact, I actually think in the imaginative,
1885600	1893600	imaginal realm, there is no time. It's not a time bound place. And so that's been quite an
1893600	1898320	interesting thing to unpack is that people immediately think that what I'm doing is helping
1898320	1905360	people imagine the future. When actually, the work of moral imaginations is really about shifting
1905360	1912880	perspective and unblocking and seeing what is there. So it's not, we're not trying to get people
1912880	1917920	to think about the future. You're about, were you about to come in there? It's very interesting,
1917920	1923440	because I mean, you know that you sent me some things to look at about an hour before this,
1923440	1928800	and I therefore didn't have time to look at them in any depth. But I was interested by your three
1928800	1933360	pillars, which would seem on the face of it, to suggest that you are interested in the past
1933360	1938720	and the future, as well as our relationships with the natural world. I like that actually,
1938720	1944960	because I think that one thing we've lost is the sense that we are, it's part of our atomistic way
1944960	1953360	of thinking. We are part of a flow which includes the past and includes the future. And our ancestors
1953360	1960240	and any of our offspring are already present in our lives in some way. And we owe them each
1960240	1967920	a moral obligation. We have a moral obligation to those who worked hard, sacrificed, died to
1967920	1973440	produce the things that we take for granted, and all the wisdom that they stored up, which is now
1973440	1980960	just being trashed and thrown out of the window. And we have a moral obligation, a very big one,
1980960	1989600	to those that come after us, not to carry on defiling and destroying what is their birthright.
1989680	1995360	So I like that. But maybe what you're saying is that in the realm of imagination,
1997200	2001280	there is no time. I wouldn't know really whether that was or not. But I think that
2002080	2006320	when you're really in the realm of imagination, you're not aware of time. You're not aware of
2006320	2011040	time passing. So that when you make contact after all, imagination is not only not a thing.
2012240	2018720	It's a relationship. And that relationship is reverberative. So something is going on that
2018720	2025200	is bringing something into being. And this is why you have to do the kind of one foot in
2025200	2030640	either camp of saying, it's not just something I make up, but it's not something just out there
2030640	2036560	given. It's something that comes into being that is utterly real. An aspect of what it is is revealed
2036560	2044080	in the relationship with my imagination. And so we're dealing there with something that it is
2044080	2049440	the only hope we have of getting into reality. Because if you just look at Wordsworth and
2049440	2055360	Coleridge, I have the greatest philosophical writers on imagination in any language, I believe.
2056240	2061680	But I mean, what they were saying is that when we think we see something, we look at the mountain
2061680	2066640	and we just see a lump of rock and so on. But it's only when we use our imagination that we
2066640	2070960	see into it. And in doing so, we don't see something that's other than a lump of rock.
2070960	2076080	We see what a lump of rock is that lump of rock is by the way, not any that lump of rock is for
2076080	2083680	the first time. And this reminds me of the Zen master Dogen in the 12th century, who said,
2084320	2091360	when I sought enlightenment, the mountains were just mountains and the rivers were just rivers.
2091360	2096080	When I was in the process of seeking enlightenment, the mountains were no longer mountains, the rivers
2096080	2102080	were no longer rivers. When I achieved enlightenment, the mountains were mountains and the rivers were
2102080	2107520	rivers. And I think that's the point is we're not putting something in place of something.
2107520	2114240	We're allowing the real entity for the first time to become real in this world. And we each
2114240	2121680	to blink to moral imagination. The reason I believe that attention is moral is because the way we
2121680	2127760	attend changes of what it is we find. And what we find is part of the imaginative world that is the
2127760	2132960	only thing that is real. And so we are actually creating something, either something terrible
2132960	2140240	or something good by what we do. And that means that we each bear the burden of a certain kind of
2140240	2149280	responsibility for what we do. Lake talks about twofold vision, which I think is very relevant
2149280	2157280	here. And I love the, you know, his couplets of, Oh, God, may, may us keep from single vision,
2157280	2164880	Newton's sleep. And, you know, I love what he talked about was actually the view of the world
2164880	2171680	is just material. That's Newton's sleep, you know, falling you into a sleep away from reality,
2171680	2177440	which you actually feel through twofold vision, meaning one eye and, you know,
2177520	2182960	looking and seeing what is, but the other eye, having this internal mind's eye of
2182960	2189520	imagination, and that is the twofold vision of what is real. And we've been lulled into a sleep,
2189520	2194320	you know, by, I, he clearly has an issue in Newton, but he also depicts Newton as like a
2194320	2200160	beautiful, healthy guy. So I don't think it was only that, but for Newton, it's not only him.
2200160	2203680	And as you say, he also had a great interest in the mystical and the mysterious.
2204560	2211040	Yes. I loved that, that kind of, you know, this is lulling us into a dangerous sleep,
2211040	2217920	which we might not wake up from before it's too late. And that's why this work is so urgent and so
2218560	2224160	existential, actually, because actually we're asleep at the wheel, and we're heading towards a
2224160	2231280	cliff. And I completely agree. Yeah. And I did, but imagination can, can wake us up.
2231360	2239920	It needs to, because as I, as I say in one of the books, I don't know, that we're like
2239920	2244480	some nambulist wandering towards the abyss, humming a happy tune as we go. And that's the
2244480	2249920	left hemisphere. It doesn't see what's happening. And yet it thinks all is fine, because I know,
2249920	2256320	and I'm in control. So we need to see, I think Blake also said that, you know,
2257280	2262960	that the man of imagination sees not with the eye, but through the eye. And again,
2262960	2268560	it gives this idea of a depth to what one's seeing. But that what one shouldn't think is that what
2268560	2276240	one sees through the eye is some hidden reality behind what it is. One sees into the depths of
2276240	2282960	things, as Wordsworth said. This is a very, very important idea that he, in fact, he talks about
2283040	2286800	lulling our intellectual, Wordsworth talks about in the Tentanabula, about
2286800	2294480	lulling our intellectual faculties asleep, so that the, that we can see into the depths of things.
2295200	2303600	So there's a kind of sleep of reason, which is either what Goya thought was terrible,
2303600	2307680	and I know what he was talking about, because it's happening in our own time, when people
2308320	2312000	just decide that they're going to dispense with reason, because it doesn't accord with what they
2312000	2316400	want to believe. So they'll just believe it anyway. And so there is a sleep of reason,
2316400	2323680	but there's sometimes a need to silence the hemisphere that does all the processing of
2323680	2328800	language, so that the other hemisphere, the right hemisphere, can for once see the whole.
2330240	2335760	Which is actually what happens during sleep, you know, and which gives rise to dreams,
2335760	2340720	isn't it, that the kind of dominant, I've been, you know, my research has led me to the default
2340800	2346240	mode network, which I don't know if that is left hemispheric, you know, dominant network,
2346240	2351840	because it's, it seems to be the seat of rationality, reason, also the sense of self,
2351840	2356000	we don't, you know, when we're born, we don't have a default mode network. So as babies,
2356000	2361040	we don't have memories, because the default mode network is what gives us that autobiographical
2361040	2367040	sense of self. But it's also, it's also what constrains the imagination. So as children,
2367040	2372960	we have imaginary friends, and those imaginary friends are not close our eyes and somewhere
2372960	2378160	over there, they're here with us, that, you know, people see children talking to their imaginary
2378160	2385360	friend, because it's there. And so, you know, interesting that the default mode network becomes
2385360	2391360	stronger and stronger, you know, into adulthood. And I think it was either Blake or somebody writing
2391360	2396960	about Blake talked about how compared adulthood to the falling out of Eden, you know, the kind
2396960	2404320	of innocent childlike wonder and awe and imagination that we have. And then as we're older, there's a
2404320	2411120	kind of divorce from that and the strengthening of these networks and also our culture and society
2411120	2416960	that is constantly strengthening the neural pathways, you know, of reason of rationality,
2416960	2422720	of modeling, predicting, controlling. And it's interesting that often when people go through
2422720	2429680	our workshops, they talk about rekindling or reconnecting with a kind of inner sense of childlike
2429680	2434160	wonder, or you know, someone's even said like, I feel like I've discovered the five year old,
2434160	2440640	you know, that was kind of inside me, which sounds a bit contrived or, you know, a bit silly, but
2440640	2447120	there's something interesting going on, that people are finding a reconnection to a childlike
2447120	2453360	that which which has a huge pain, you know, that they feel a great sense of grief that that's been
2453360	2460560	lost. And this is all connected, you know, that your work of the kind of dominant rationality
2460560	2469760	reason. Anyway, that's a jumble of thoughts. No, no. Yes. As that. Well, no. Of course, there are
2469760	2477760	different kinds of imagination. There's the imagination of a Michelangelo or Bach, and there's
2477760	2486800	the imagination of a thoughtful, lively five year old. And there's a, in a way, there's a sort of
2487360	2497280	parallel to the way in which there is a kind of knowing, which gets in the way of unknowing.
2497520	2501440	It's not the same as the unknowing you have when you're ignorant and still have to learn.
2501440	2506320	It's the unknowing that, in fact, goes beyond knowing when you know enough to know that you have
2506320	2513120	to practice unknowing. Similarly, there's a kind of innocence a child has, which is, as it were,
2513120	2518240	a gift that they have. But there is a kind of innocence that a saint has that comes the other
2518240	2523600	side of experience and is greater than either the innocence or experience. And so I would say that
2523600	2530160	there is a kind of sense of imagination. The imagination can grow. It doesn't have to be
2530160	2536960	stunted by life. But the processes whereby we educate people can certainly contribute to a
2536960	2543760	process of, you know, making them feel small and making them feel silly if they confess to
2544480	2548640	imaginative ideas, such as, you know, an imaginative friend and then somebody says,
2548640	2554080	now, don't be so silly. There isn't really anyone there. And of course, this links to bigger
2554080	2561600	topics like amongst other people, poor old Dawkins, he's become like Newton for Blake,
2561600	2566080	but he just keeps on saying these things. He sort of believes it's terrible.
2567840	2574560	He's his own worst foe. How dare people indoctrinate children into these ideas of a spiritual realm
2574640	2579680	with a divine realm as well. They never think of this if they weren't indoctrinated into it.
2579680	2583360	But actually, there's a lot of research, some of which I quote in that book,
2583360	2588880	which shows that children naturally are aware of things beyond what we call the realm of the
2588880	2596080	five senses. But this is kind of drummed out of them by being told it's wrong and humiliating them.
2596080	2602880	And then they go, oh, well, and they're lucky if they can then reconnect with it. And of course,
2603440	2610080	in my experience, certainly helps to reconnect one with that is the greatness of art in all its
2610080	2616240	various forms and the experience of what everyone likes to call it religious or spiritual life.
2617200	2623360	And nature. And nature is core to all of this. Yes, absolutely. Yes.
2624080	2628880	So into moral imagination, because I did this is really,
2630160	2636400	you know, I find imagination is absolutely fascinating. And it's, to me, it's, you know,
2636400	2641920	the most convincing route towards getting us out of this mess, you know,
2643760	2648560	existential crisis as many people do in their 20s and really felt like, you know,
2648560	2653520	what are we doing to the world? And that crisis has essentially led me to imagination. But
2654080	2658560	through that crisis, you know, the question I was really asking was like,
2659440	2665680	how is it that we're making such immoral decisions? How is it that we are making decisions that
2666240	2673440	are so self-serving, so greedy? You know, what is that about? How does that come about? So I became
2673520	2680160	really fascinated by morality and ethics, you know, and thinking probably with a hangover of my
2680160	2686080	scientific, you know, brain thinking like, okay, so the problem is a lack of morality or, you know,
2686080	2692160	a lack of the sacred or some sort of death of what is good, beautiful and true. So how,
2692160	2699920	what can we do about that? Started reading about morality and didn't find a lot of it very interesting.
2700560	2705600	And then came across, you know, came across, you know, the thing I was thinking about was that
2705600	2712880	actually, the way that we've approached morality in the West has a lot of parallels to the way
2712880	2719360	that we approached, you know, science, that it's very much tangled up in reason, in rationality and,
2719360	2725040	you know, the kind of enlightenment breeds of morality like utilitarianism or Kantianism
2725680	2732640	feel like they're very much left brain schools of morality and thought and, you know, Kantianism
2732640	2739040	suffers from extreme abstract, you know, abstraction, utilitarianism suffers from extreme reductionism.
2740000	2746720	And so I started wondering what would morality with a kind of upswell of imagination, like,
2747520	2754080	where could those two things come together? And I think it's interesting that a lot of Western
2755040	2761440	morality is based on, you know, this is a very simple model that Mark Johnson talks about,
2761440	2770720	the kind of moral, moral folklore. So a very basic model of the mind having, you know, four
2772080	2778080	components, you could think of it as perception, will, you know, the mental realm, it's got,
2778080	2783280	let's say it's got for these four members, perception, reason, passion and will. And the way
2783280	2789280	this works is, you know, perception receives sense impressions from the body, passes them to reason
2789280	2796000	or passion. And these two things affect our will. And passions become active through bodily experience,
2796960	2802160	you know, either directly through perception or through memory. Reason receives this information
2802160	2808720	and calculates and analyzes sense data and passes it to the will. And, you know, basically it's up
2808720	2815760	to the will to decide how to act based on these two influences. And so, you know, as I said,
2815760	2822160	reason calculates, passion exerts force on the will. And we think of passion as kind of unpredictable,
2822160	2828880	difficult to control. Reason, you know, exerts force on the will, but the will can sometimes
2828880	2835120	resist reason. It can't resist, you know, it can sometimes resist the force of passion. So
2835120	2841600	there's something here about, you know, that the model of morality being the ability to use reason
2842160	2848880	to make the right decision and to resist the force of passion. And we also think of animals as
2848880	2856720	lacking reason. And so humans being these, you know, like a reason, a rational animal or a reasonable
2856720	2865040	animal. But the role of imagination doesn't play any role here at all. And to be a moral
2866000	2876480	to be moral in this folk model of morality is to exert reason and is to resist the force of
2876480	2881200	passion. Are you, are you with me on this? Or, you know, is there anything to
2882480	2890720	No, I am. I am broadly with you. What I'm thinking, though, here is that, as you're well aware,
2891280	2898720	there are different schools of thought about morality and very different approaches to religion
2898720	2905120	and the religious life. And like everything else, the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere have
2905120	2911360	different takes on them. And what you're pointing to is what joins together all these various things,
2911360	2916240	the excesses of capitalism, of rationalism, of mechanism and so on, is that these are
2916240	2923120	expressions of the will for power, which is essentially the only value, as I've said before
2923120	2930400	on previous occasions, the only value that really drives the left hemisphere, it's evolved to be
2930400	2937200	the one that manipulates. And that leaves all the other values that are to you and me and I think
2937200	2944400	to all human beings, so important and so neglected, it leaves them out of the picture and out of the
2944400	2954240	calculation. And I would say that, you know, for all that was a bit autistic and hyper-rationalistic
2954240	2960560	in some ways, and he did say, you know, the two things that film you with awe, the starry vault
2960560	2966640	above me and the moral law within me. So, I mean, he was in awe of the fact that there was a morality
2966640	2971200	at all. And indeed, he thought that there must be a God because there was morality. He didn't
2971200	2975920	think there must be morality because there was a God. So, he thought that this moral thing was
2975920	2980880	actually very important and intuitive, although his particular approach to it I slightly differ
2980880	2986960	from. But one of the things that one now sees in the way we talk about morality is exactly what
2986960	2994560	you were getting at, that it seems to be about a logical process that will result in the utility
2994560	2999440	and maximise utility. And I don't want to recap on this because I think I talked about it probably
2999520	3002160	did. Yeah, I think you covered it with that conversation.
3002720	3009120	Exactly. But there is a huge problem with this approach and that what it rules out as you also
3009120	3017680	were hinting is the depth and importance of our intuitive imagination, which helps us to be human.
3017680	3022960	And I think we're just becoming less than human because of the assault on all sides,
3022960	3029440	on intuition and imagination and the substitution of an incredibly mediocre thing,
3029440	3035200	which is a rationalising system. And I'm not saying that there is no virtue in having such a
3035200	3041680	way of thinking at certain stages in any kind of process. You need it. I keep reiterating that
3041680	3045840	because I don't want to fall into this thing. People think, oh yeah, the right hemisphere is
3045840	3050480	all creative and wonderful and the left hemisphere is this bogeyman. The left hemisphere is very,
3050560	3056160	very useful, but it doesn't know its own limitations. And that is the problem we now find ourselves in.
3056160	3060800	So in a way, I feel rather like I've just read actually in very much admire
3062400	3067200	Dougalde Hein's latest book. He just came and visited on the day that it came out a week or two ago.
3067200	3076560	And we were in conversation the week after, Dougalde and I. Wonderful. And I don't have much time
3076560	3080240	these days for reading, but I started reading and thought I think I'm going to have to finish
3080960	3087840	and I thought it was brilliant. But really what he's saying is very much this thing that it's just
3087840	3094480	aren't a wicked network of this problem and that problem and the other problem,
3094480	3099360	but there is a whole way of thinking that underlies very clearly the whole package.
3099360	3104720	And it's no good just addressing it at the top level. That would be like putting a sticking
3104720	3110160	plaster on a cancer. You've covered it, but it's going to keep growing. What we have to do
3110800	3117760	is to emphasize that the only way out of this is to rethink our moral stance. And what I mean by
3117760	3127920	that is to embrace above all a degree of humility about what it is that we as humans can do to
3127920	3136080	therefore listen to the wisdom that comes through silence and through traditions and through art
3136080	3143280	and through nature, if you attend to it, and to express compassion and moderation in the way in
3143280	3149920	which we try to deal with these. I don't mean moderation in the sense of averaging everything
3149920	3155040	out, but I mean not supposing that this one thing, if we just do this, we'll answer everything and
3155040	3161120	being extreme about it. We have to know that there are people who have differing angles on this and
3161120	3166240	they can contribute something. And so what the work you're doing, which is to liberate people's
3166240	3170880	imaginations from whatever it is that they're constantly being told they have to believe,
3170880	3174400	is wonderful because it will bring different facets of truth to life.
3175440	3183200	Thank you. I mean a really important part of the work is also the connection to what matters,
3183440	3190080	this moral imagination. The way I see that is that rather than following moral laws and rules that
3190080	3198320	can actually be massively manipulated, religion can be wonderful. It can also be very harmful.
3198320	3203840	Absolutely. Looking to kind of top down morality and morality has become a really dirty word,
3203840	3210320	but a lot of people have raised their eyebrows at the name of moral imaginations and what we're
3210320	3215520	doing. And yet we're trying to reclaim that and say actually what we need, what everybody needs is
3216080	3222480	to kind of build a muscle of moral imagination and metaphor and the ability to really connect with
3222480	3230560	what you know matters and is beautiful and good and true and not wait to be told that or to follow
3230560	3236160	rules or to try and work out what the right law or rule or principle is, but to get this kind of
3236160	3244160	coming alive through the imagination, through the kind of faculties that we're talking about,
3244160	3253600	the kind of right hemispheric, intuitive, imaginative capacities to develop that compass
3253600	3258240	of what is right and wrong and what are we not going to let happen. Does that make sense?
3258240	3263360	There's a kind of what I'm trying to do is knit them together. I love that. I love that. And I
3263360	3270080	think you ought to wear the superciliousness of these people who raise an eyebrow and you
3270080	3275440	talk about morality as a badge of pride. It shows that you're really onto something important
3275440	3281280	because nowadays everything that's really important is being attacked and destroyed because it
3281280	3287040	demands of some degree of self-restraint. It demands that we are aware of the limitations
3287120	3294400	and boundaries in things. We can't just have everything we want and have it now. We need,
3294400	3305120	actually, to exercise some virtuous restraint on how we behave and how we think. And without it,
3305120	3311520	we're utterly lost. And it comes from an intuitive level. What really interests me is that there's
3311600	3318320	a couple of cases I refer to in the book in which scientists who are completely convinced, of course,
3318320	3326320	that human beings are naturally... Competitive, self-interested... Competitive and self-interested,
3326320	3332160	egotistical and so on. It's set up experiments to show this and, we're honest enough, report
3332160	3337760	that the answer showed the exact opposite. That people aren't normally naturally... And you see
3337840	3342720	this in children. We didn't have to be tortured unless there's something very wrong with them,
3342720	3349520	I know. But generally speaking, you see this, that they love to help one another. They love to be
3349520	3356720	cooperative. We are naturally generous and it's further thinking and ratiosination that leads us
3356720	3362080	to be greedy and self-seeking and speak for our own interests rather than others. So,
3362400	3367840	you know, once again, it's a case of there not being a predicament. How on earth do we reverse
3367840	3373120	the way we are? However, do we... It's actually there. It's all there ready. If you can just tear
3373120	3376560	down the edifice that's been built in front of it, if you see what I mean.
3377120	3382240	Completely. And the systemic, you know, we haven't really talked much about, you know, the systemic
3383600	3388320	forces that keep us and, you know, that really encouraged the kind of qualities you're talking
3388480	3397280	about. Let's do so. Capitalism. Capitalism. You know, what do you... I didn't see capitalism
3398080	3403920	mentioned so much explicitly in your book, but I'd be really curious to hear, you know, where
3404720	3409520	the place for the kind of systemic critique of where we find ourselves is.
3410000	3418480	Well, I suppose the thing about capitalism is that, in a word, it's a product of the left
3418480	3425520	hemisphere. It's... However, people will say, well, what would you like to put in its place?
3425520	3431360	And I certainly wouldn't want to put communism in its place. But there are other alternatives
3431600	3439280	we could talk about based on... It would take that to reach a kind of more
3439280	3448240	communitarian way of living would require probably some disaster, I hope doesn't occur,
3448240	3454160	but which would sufficiently disrupt the structures we have now and people would be
3454160	3459040	thrown back on having to help one another, trust one another, work together and so on.
3459120	3466480	Because at the moment, we've become lazy. So go back to capitalism. I think that
3466480	3471760	there are ways of thinking of capitalism in which it's tempered by other things. And so
3472480	3480480	anything that is dogmatic is going to be inhuman and damaging. And so whatever system you come
3480480	3484560	up with, it needs to be tempered. It needs to be qualified. Whatever it is, it's going to have to
3484560	3488560	have those... That's not wrong. That's just showing that you're taking into account
3488560	3493280	various different things. I don't talk about it largely because I'm not myself, particularly
3494960	3503120	involved in political thinking. And I don't want to... I'm more interested in the things
3503120	3507760	behind politics than in the politics themselves. So I didn't want to start a big conversation
3507760	3511920	about that, which would have been a whole other book, one which I'm absolutely not equipped to
3511920	3522720	write. So yeah. It is an interesting question. What could imagining to imagine what is a right
3522720	3530160	hemispheric system? If capitalism is created by the left hemisphere, what... And I thought
3530160	3536720	this quite often as I've read your work is we live in a society dominated by the left hemisphere
3536720	3543360	in doctrine. And it's too far and it needs to swing back. But what would a society look like
3543360	3549200	if it had... If it was kind of swung too far the other way, just to...
3550560	3554800	Yes. I mean, if it swung too far the other way, I'm often asked, so what would a right
3554800	3560480	hemisphere society look like? And I say, well, very moderate, because the thing about the right
3560480	3565840	hemisphere is that it understands the need for the left hemisphere's contribution. And in the
3565840	3569840	story of the master and the emissary, the master pointed the emissary. It's just the emissary now
3569840	3577680	thinks it's the master. That's the problem. So there isn't really... Sorry, what are we talking
3577680	3583680	about there? The right hemispheric system. What would that look like? Oh, yes, what would it look
3583680	3590960	like? Yes, yes. And we have had periods in history, I think, where they're not what we would probably
3591920	3599760	suggest to ourselves now, but we're obviously massively creative periods in which society flourished
3599760	3605760	in the West. But they were fairly short lived. And the thing is that every civilization is fairly
3605760	3617520	short lived. And I can't remember the name of the guy now, but early 20th century writer who looked
3618000	3622640	30 past civilizations and reckoned that, I mean, of course, it's not scientific to say when does
3622640	3629840	it begin and when does it end. But a reasonable gestalt was that they tended to come up and then
3629840	3636880	fade over about three to 400 years, that seems to be the normal pattern. And one way of thinking
3636880	3646320	about that is in the terms of William Orffles. I can never remember whether he's William or Patrick.
3646320	3653440	One, this is real name, the other is pseudonym. Not a good pseudonym. Orffles, O-P-H-U-L-S, who wrote
3653440	3659440	Immodern Greatness, which is a quote from Gibbon. But effectively, it's a very short book, only 80
3659440	3667040	pages long. All of you go out and buy it after this, it doesn't cost anything, or much. And he gives
3667040	3674160	the six reasons why civilizations always undermine themselves by overreaching themselves in various
3674160	3680160	ways. And one way of thinking of that is that this self-satisfying thing of the left hemisphere
3680160	3688480	takes over. But one fairly, I think we would all resonate with this, one image he has, is that
3688480	3695440	civilizations tend to go through phases. In the first phase, they require enormous levels of
3695440	3703920	mutual trust, valor, self-sacrifice, courage, hard work, you know, honor, then building something
3703920	3709680	valuable. And then when that's been built, I think where the next wave comes along, and they can build
3709680	3716080	on top of that, and they produce works of science, they produce great works of art, they elaborate
3716080	3722880	on top of this. And then the next wave, which is the final wave comes along, where they are basically
3722960	3730240	now soft, weak, selfish, lack self-discipline, think that they're entitled to everything
3730240	3736880	on a plate because they're born. And I believe this is the one we're ridden now. We believe that
3736880	3742160	somehow it's our right to carry on living in a totally absurd way, which is destroying
3742160	3747600	everything we value. Thank you for answering that. And I know it seems as if we diverged
3747600	3753040	from imagination, but I think a lot of what really brings people's imaginations alive at the
3753040	3761200	moment is the question of what could an alternative look like, and also the unimaginable. That brings
3761200	3770880	me a lot of hope, actually. The idea that all big social change, all societal change was always
3770880	3776720	unimaginable before it happened, and the 50 years of the world we're living in now was completely
3776720	3782960	unimaginable. And so when people say there is an air of hopelessness and despair and
3784800	3790960	a darkness around what's coming next, there is a cliff edge. There is, there is. I find it very
3792000	3801520	encouraging to hear you gesture at the unimaginable alternative. One of the points that maybe we need
3801520	3809520	to start winding up our bit and hand over, but one of the things in in Dougal's book
3811840	3821920	is this idea that the reason we're so despairing about what's coming is that we think too narrowly
3821920	3830320	about ourselves. And we and the life that we are living now probably won't exist in the future.
3830320	3838000	And it didn't exist in the past either. But some creatures will live with any luck. I imagine
3838560	3846160	substantial numbers of human beings will live and the world will begin to heal and regenerate.
3846160	3854240	And what I hope is that those human beings will be, will have their eyes opened to things that
3854240	3860160	we're now blinded to by being too comfortable and too convinced that we know it all. And that
3860160	3873600	that will lead them to a kind, humane, courageous working together in which people are bound together
3873600	3880080	by the ties that really make life worth living. And it will be in smaller communities than the
3880080	3886240	ones we have now. And it's not a human faculty to be able to understand very large numbers,
3886240	3890480	and especially not very large numbers of people. Is it three million or is it three billion or
3890480	3895840	three trillion? We just don't know. But you know, we're, we're, we're famously fitted to
3895840	3901680	knowing about 150 people. That makes sense. And so I think one of the problems is we've simply
3901680	3907520	agglomerated everything. And that's been partly due to technology and partly due to capitalism.
3908160	3913520	Anyway, maybe that's where we, is that where we begin to, we'd like to have another one of these.
3914400	3917120	Great. I hope it's just the first. Thank you.
3918080	3919680	So thank you very much Phoebe.
3921760	3929200	Thank you. Thank you both Phoebe and Ian. That was really, really interesting. And I thoroughly
3929200	3934880	enjoyed the whole arc of the conversation. So I'm looking forward to hearing the various
3934880	3940880	questions that will be coming through shortly. And I should say that Jonathan has encountered
3940880	3947600	further difficulties with the power where he is. So I'll be conveying the questions and,
3947600	3953760	and moderating this next part. So I'm actually going to start by asking the question that
3953760	3960240	Jonathan had hoped to ask if he were able to do it out loud. So I'm just going to read that out
3960240	3965760	for you. And you have to imagine Jonathan's Scottish accent, which I unfortunately am not
3965760	3972080	capable of reproducing. And nor would you want me to. So Jonathan wrote, and he put this in the
3972080	3977840	chat as well. You'll have to scroll up a bit to see it. Ian often suggests that the left
3977840	3983280	atmosphere is power seeking in some sense. And both Phoebe and Ian suggest imagination may be
3983280	3989760	critical to wake ourselves up to our predicament and be some part of the solution. And yet power,
3989760	3994720	in some shape or form, will always be part of reality. So what then can we say about the
3994800	4000240	relationship between imagination and power? And in particular, what might it mean to imagine
4000240	4007200	power as something wisely wielded in a way that does not sound naive or wishful thinking? So I
4007200	4012560	think it's actually quite good as a follow up to the kind of systemic discussion that you were just
4012560	4021200	having at the end. Yes. So either of you would like to. Do you want to go first, Ian?
4022160	4028400	Okay. Before saying anything, I see a number of people want to know about Duke Gould Hein's book.
4028400	4034880	It's called At Work in the Ruins. And it has a very long subtitle, which is so long, it's almost
4034880	4044960	comical, and I can't remember it. Power. You see, there's a paradox that the more we seek power,
4045280	4052480	the less we really have any control or influence over what happens. Things control us.
4053520	4062640	The power-seeking mentality is always frustrated, always unhappy, always unfulfilled. And one sees
4062640	4068720	this, I have seen it as a psychiatrist very often, but one sees it if one looks around. There is,
4068720	4076080	and this is often said by people in particularly Eastern traditions, that what we're talking about
4076080	4085600	is not a kind of helplessness, but a kind of affirming acknowledgement of one's vulnerability,
4086560	4093600	of the fact that there are limitations, and that in all humility, and honesty, and with
4093600	4100320	awe, one puts oneself open to something bigger than oneself. And that in doing that,
4100320	4107680	one finds a new direction, one finds that one is no longer frustrating oneself,
4107680	4113520	one finds a freedom and autonomy, that by seeking freedom and autonomy in that aggressive left
4113520	4122480	hemisphere way, we just destroy it. I mean, there never has been a period in the West when freedom
4122480	4128880	has been more in jeopardy than it is now. And this one says, well, what about the Soviet era
4128880	4134400	and the Nazi era? But we're going back into one of these areas right now because of a strident,
4135680	4145600	un-nuanced, naive view about freedom and those sort of things. So that's what I'd say is that I
4145600	4151840	don't think power is this simple thing about controlling others. It's about letting go of
4151840	4157520	control in order to be filled with a spiritual sense of things, to be one with the world, and
4157520	4164800	therefore to be empowered by it. I mean, it is an empowering experience, I can say from my own
4164800	4173280	poor experience that I find it such. Yeah, thank you for that, Ian. I think what I was struck by
4173280	4182560	is that I worry that we thingify power, like we thingify imagination. And power is not a thing
4182560	4190880	that we're trying to get and grab and achieve. There's no end to it. As you say, Ian, it's a
4190880	4200000	kind of bottomless pit that you can never really reach the end of it. I also, another thing that
4200640	4206560	comes to mind is that I think the systems thinking, which I think is very right hemisphere,
4207760	4214720	the kind of systems thinking view on power is not like the physics kind of cause and effect,
4214720	4221840	like I push the world, I push someone and they fall, that kind of mechanistic view on the world
4221840	4229200	of power. So that kind of model would mean if the way power is exerted is through kind of pushing
4229200	4234320	on the world and things happening, then the way to kind of get power is to barricade yourself from
4234320	4240320	being pushed and to kind of get more and more powerful. But actually, we know through systems
4240320	4245920	thinking through looking at how nature works, that it doesn't work like that. It's not the
4245920	4252400	only way it works. Power can also be not zero sum, there can be win-win, there can be different
4252400	4258960	kinds of power where you win and I win. And everything there's a kind of mutual flourishing
4258960	4264960	or a different kind of power that doesn't need to mean that other people get pushed down. We could
4264960	4274800	all be powerful. So I wonder if that's a different kind of power. I love that and I can't resist coming
4274800	4283680	back to it. Thank you very much because the thing about a complex system and all living things
4283760	4291200	and all living communities and environments are complex is that they don't have this
4291920	4297200	efficient causation at the back of them that pushes things forward. Instead, there is
4298320	4302880	as much bottom down as top up causation, if you'd like to think of it in those ways,
4302880	4308800	but there are also different kinds of causes. We've selected one of Aristotle's four causes,
4308800	4314640	the efficient cause, and think that is what causation is. But in fact, people's behavior
4314640	4321680	is caused also by aspirations towards certain things, by being drawn effortlessly towards
4321680	4327680	something that is good, beautiful and true, what he called a final cause. And there are also formal
4327680	4333520	causes which are becoming important in both biology and physics. Where is the information about form
4334480	4339360	in that DNA code? Actually, there must be form fields, as physics suggests,
4339360	4345120	so in biology. And this is now entering into the mainstream. It was a bit fringe, but it's now
4345120	4350080	entering into the mainstream. So there are other ways of thinking about how things are caused,
4350080	4354400	which are in the round and are beautiful and attractive, not being pushed from behind.
4355360	4361280	Yeah, yeah, yeah, beautiful. Botanical power. Botanical power, I like it.
4365840	4372640	All right, well, let's ask Stuart Campbell to ask the next question. So Stuart, if you can,
4372640	4378800	I will ask you, unmute you here, and if you can ask your question out loud, please.
4379040	4387200	Yeah, thanks, Lee. So I have a bit of a concern with the term imagination or idea of imagination,
4387200	4395440	as it's kind of commonly conceived, and that is that human beings can imagine quite wildly and
4395440	4403200	quite disconnectedly from reality. So my interest is in getting a clear sense of how you discern
4403200	4413920	imagination and maybe as differentiated from what. In other words, how do we temper imagination or
4414640	4420720	have imagination relate fittingly to reality? I mean, we could say that the left hemisphere
4421360	4426880	imagines itself the master. So if you get the tension that I'm trying to speak to here,
4426880	4432320	I'd love to hear what you have to say. I certainly do see what Stuart's talking about.
4433200	4442480	And of course, imagination is not just some kind of faulty thinking. And I'm tempted to refer to
4443520	4451120	the saying by their fruits, you shall know them, that in a way, you know imagination when you
4451120	4457360	experience it, and you know when you find it in others, that it is not a fantasy of theirs.
4458320	4469280	Imagination can include dark things, but its general trend is towards life and vivification,
4469280	4476960	whereas the appropriation of masterhood by the left hemisphere is a kind of blow for death,
4476960	4481840	if you like, for mechanism. So there isn't, of course, unfortunately, a way we can
4482400	4487360	measure in any sense imagination. And of course, we can't image it on a on a on a
4487360	4492080	wretched PET scan or anything like that. We're talking about something which is profoundly
4492080	4501840	and only experiential. And so imagination can lead people astray. This is right. But I think
4501840	4507360	it's rather like being in the groove that you know when your imagination is taking you somewhere
4507360	4513120	good. If you have ever had, which I only very occasionally have had the experience of really
4513120	4517600	writing a poem rather than just versifying, you kind of know when something is happening through
4517600	4522400	you. And I think that imagination is like that. It's rather like playing music while singing,
4522400	4526720	while dancing. Well, that's the best I can say it's completely won't stand up in a court of law,
4526720	4532000	but it's the best I can do. Help me out, Phoebe. I'm sure you've got something better to say.
4532320	4537760	Well, I've got an easy out, which is moral imagination, obviously, because it, you know,
4537760	4543520	what I like to say is that, you know, imagination gave rise to nuclear weapons, you know,
4543520	4549440	imagination is not, it's not, but it's not necessarily positive. But I resonate with what
4549440	4554160	you're saying, Ian, which is that there is, you know, we're talking about a kind of
4554880	4560960	opening the doors of perception and allowing the sacred to flow through.
4560960	4566560	Exactly. Imagination being the kind of seeing through and allowing, you know,
4567200	4573280	that real sense of connection to the world or experience of reality. Whereas what I think,
4573280	4578640	Stuart, you were talking about is more kind of almost like active imagination, actively imagining
4579200	4584960	things and can obviously lead to bad things and good things and a kind of directed
4586400	4592720	imagination. I don't think that stands up in a court of law either. But I think it's a good
4592720	4599440	question. I think there's also something about not being just a head, you know, head based thing.
4599440	4605280	It's also heart. It's also embodied and it's throughout. And how do we bring alive that
4605280	4611200	imagination that, you know, that is not just using the neurons of the head, but the neurons of the
4611200	4618400	gut and the heart and there's so much more there. I hope that. Yeah, I love that. Yeah.
4619200	4624160	And I think also, well, maybe we've had enough on this question, but, you know,
4626240	4631280	when people want to be imaginative, and I'm sure this is nothing to do with anything you do,
4631280	4636240	but, you know, they say, come on, let's have a brainstorming session, you know, and my
4636240	4640800	bet noir is the brainstorming session. Doesn't matter how crazy it is, we put it on the board and
4640800	4646960	so on and let it all hang out. This is not actually how creativity works. And I make a big
4646960	4652160	distinction. I have a whole chapter separate to the imagination of creativity, because I'm talking
4652160	4657280	really about how the brain can be helped in this. And it is nothing to do with this
4658240	4664560	and simply letting it all hang out. That is not likely to end up with anything very useful.
4664560	4670480	And when you look at people who are truly creative, they operate in a completely different way from
4670480	4675280	the person who is trying to be creative. If you're not creative, then don't worry,
4675280	4679760	you're not a creative person for now. Maybe later, you will be. But right now, you're not a creative
4679760	4686080	person, but don't try to be creative because it's counterproductive. Do not try. I feel like that's
4686080	4690000	a kind of yoda. There's a yoda quote there. Don't try, just do.
4691280	4697520	Oh right, okay. My life has been yoda poor, I'm afraid, but there we are.
4700000	4703280	Sorry for the introduction there. I was just going to say it actually is quite a good
4704240	4709360	segue into the next question, which is from Rosalind Murray. So I've just
4710080	4716160	unmuted you, Rosalind, if you'd like to ask your question live, please go ahead.
4717120	4724160	Thank you. Yeah, I was just interested in, well, William Blake is great,
4724720	4731520	but he passed away in 1827. So I'm just kind of wondering if you can speak to
4732080	4737760	contemporary art ideas and imagination. I mean, there's a whole world in contemporary art
4738320	4745200	that touches on all the things you're speaking about. It's a huge area at a lot of talks
4745920	4751920	like this. And many others maybe that come from a literature side, often you're getting conversation
4752720	4759200	that relates to artists that are very long ago and not about what's going on now. And this is a
4759200	4764960	huge area which already is exploring what you're talking about. So I'm just all of the things
4764960	4769440	you're talking about, but kind of gets left out of the conversation. So I'm just wondering,
4769440	4775200	is there any space within that that influences your work, but from a much more contemporary
4775200	4784400	perspective? Who is that aimed at both of us? Yeah, that would be great.
4785040	4790400	You're still there. I would also love to hear the artists. I feel like there are some artists
4790400	4798640	that perhaps you're holding dear to imagination, if there's any that you'd like to name before we
4798640	4807440	speak about our own. I wouldn't because there's so many artists from so many cultures that if I
4807440	4815520	started to even dig into specific artists, specific approaches, and even that brings me back to this
4815520	4822800	question, another aspect of the question, which tonight and often this idea of we, like there is
4822800	4830400	no one single we, we is a conglomerate. So I'm kind of interested in the positioning of us,
4830400	4836880	we, because we are not. And so even when we say we as a group of people
4838080	4843280	act in this way with imagination, that's not true, because there's a whole group of people
4843280	4848880	who are maybe artists or naturally creative or have invested a huge amount of time
4848880	4855200	in a particular practice of art and art understanding and learning creativity and imagination,
4855200	4861200	you know, developing that, that are not operating in that way. And then there are people in other
4861200	4867360	cultures that don't operate in that way. So I think I wouldn't like to pick specific people
4867360	4873440	because there's so much rising and so many people. I'd just be interested in if you had anything from
4873440	4879280	a more contemporary place that you were coming with yourselves. So however, you don't want to
4879280	4883520	answer the question, but you're asking us to answer it. That's absolutely fine. And the reason
4883520	4890640	that Blake came up, I think it's fair. I don't think that's fair. No, no, I'm not. That's not a
4890640	4900080	fair response. Okay, because well, it sounds like I'm just asking those contemporary art influence
4900080	4906240	your thought and practice in this area. Maybe there. That's a better way. The reason the reason that
4906240	4913680	Blake came up, I think was twofold. One is that he's a he's very unusual in that he writes about
4913680	4920240	imagination all the time. He not only uses imagination, but he rather unusually writes about
4920320	4923360	it. Most great poets don't. Wordsworth perhaps was another.
4926640	4931840	And possibly Coleridge, but it's not very common. I mean, the other is that he is a towering genius.
4931840	4939760	I mean, he doesn't nobody like him in the history of literature. He's utterly unique and incredibly
4939760	4946560	important. And the fact that he died in 1827 has no nothing whatever to do with it. If he died in
4946560	4954000	1827 BC, he would be worth exactly as much as if you were alive now, because as Phoebe says,
4954000	4961440	there is no time in the realm of true imagination. These are timeless words, timeless truth. But if
4961440	4968560	you ask me to say, what poets do I like? What painters do I like? And so on. I can say that.
4968560	4973680	I mean, one of the things that often happens when I'm giving a talk is that I have a painting behind
4973680	4979440	me by Ross Love Day, which I think is a perfect expression of the modern imagination and that
4980320	4986640	it is a kind of absolutely non-pindownable landscape. And it's also a fantastic abstract
4986640	4991440	that seems to mean something beyond whatever landscape is being hinted at. So that would be
4991440	4998800	an example of modern work, which is deeply imaginative. And it's not trying to give me a message.
4998800	5002880	I mean, it's death to a work of art when it's got a message. And there's a little plot beside
5002960	5006560	what the artist was trying to do with, you know, or what the composer really meant.
5006560	5012160	Well, no, great art speaks to itself and is not trying to persuade you of anything. That's what
5012160	5019440	I'd say. But apologies if I offended the question. I was being a bit frivolous. I mean, you have to
5019440	5030240	take that as part of the game. Anyway, over to you, Phoebe. So rather than naming specific artists
5030240	5037440	or musicians, but I might end up doing that. But I think what the question, what it brought up for
5037440	5043440	me, which I think is a very relevant and interesting one, is the kind of movement ecology around
5043440	5050240	imagination. You know, who's there? And I speak about something called imagination justice,
5050240	5055280	which is actually who gets to imagine, you know, where is the imagination capital in the world?
5055280	5061920	Like, at the moment, it's being hoarded by usually kind of tech CEOs in Silicon Valley who
5061920	5067840	will look and sound a certain way and also have a lot of money. You know, and there's a thing around
5067840	5074800	who gets to imagine, which is also not just who gets to imagine, but who's imaginations get to
5074800	5081280	then translate into, you know, affecting and creating and worlding, you know, this concept of
5081280	5088480	worlding from, I think, from feminist critical theory is about how some people get, you know,
5088480	5095200	get to create the world. You know, and as I'm thinking, I'm going to forget who said this,
5095200	5103200	but it matters who, world's worlds. It's a very famous quote by a writer who does influence me
5103200	5108640	a lot in imagination. I'm having a blank now. You know, it matters what words, words and world's
5108720	5116000	worlds. It's not just me. It's staying with the trouble is her book.
5118400	5122960	Anyway, but something we didn't, sorry, Ian, just to add, something we didn't
5122960	5128640	go far away. Thank you so much, Madalina. Something we didn't come onto, which I think is really
5128640	5137520	relevant, is that there is a living, you know, living group of people who, Indigenous people,
5137920	5143840	whose whole culture, you know, who have been keeping alive a culture of imagination and, you
5143840	5149840	know, resisting, not all, again, it's very easy to generalizations and labels like not all Indigenous
5149840	5154640	people, but Indigenous cultures, I think, really deserve a mention here because there is a living
5154640	5161280	breathing continuum of a way of being in the world and principles, you know, principles, ways of
5161280	5167120	living relationship to the natural world. So there is a stewarded culture that is keeping
5167120	5172080	imagination alive in the ways that we've just been talking about, Ian. I'd love to hear, you
5172080	5176400	know, if you have anything to say about that, because I think it's very relevant to the question.
5176400	5181040	I'd just say a hundred percent agree. I mean, I resonated with everything you said,
5181760	5188800	and we're interestingly driving to extinction the little pockets of wisdom that we could be
5188800	5196160	learning from. And unfortunately, one very great pocket, namely China, has chosen, instead of
5196160	5204640	offering wisdom that it once had, has chosen to become a delinquent Western state. But I love
5204640	5208800	what you say about the Indigenous people and the wisdom that is there, and it's very, very important.
5208800	5220160	Thank you. I'd like to invite Mark, Reid, to ask your question, please. And this might be the last
5220160	5226720	one, depending on the response time, just because we'd like to end it 40 minutes after, as we've
5226720	5232800	promised, the 100 minute event. But let's see. Thanks. Thanks very much. Thanks, Phoebe and
5232800	5238800	Ian McGillicrice. Ian, I love your books. You're an incredible writer. And Phoebe, this is great to
5238800	5242720	hear about you and the moral imagination. My question is about the moral imagination.
5243600	5248560	First of all, the first time I heard about moral imagination was in a book by Rudolf Steiner,
5248640	5252800	who I've talked to Ian about before. It's the philosophy of freedom. And there's
5252800	5258640	more than imagination, you can see. But anyway, my question is, and we talked about, like you
5258640	5264480	talked about developing the imagination, you know, do you either of you advocate any spiritual
5264480	5270880	practices, or do you do any spiritual practice yourself to develop the imagination? And
5271920	5276320	while I ask that question, because you talk about moral development, Steiner talks about
5276320	5282640	developing imagination, inspiration and intuition. But he said, in every step in
5282640	5288160	spiritual development should be three steps in moral development. That's really important.
5288160	5294000	And I think that's often what happens, that people do develop these, and actually, you know,
5294000	5300800	this might sound crazy, but something like Trump, who is a big fan of Norman Vincent Peel and the
5300800	5306320	power of positive thinking, I think has developed a great powers of imagination, believe it or not.
5307120	5311840	And that is really to power. I like with that, but no moral development whatsoever.
5311840	5317120	So I'm just curious about yourselves. Do you have spiritual practices to develop imagination?
5320640	5325440	If it's you Phoebe, go ahead. You're the moral imagination person here.
5325440	5333840	Yeah. It's interesting. I avoid the word spiritual, usually. I think there's a lot of
5333840	5337920	baggage. And I also think there's a huge amount of spiritual bypassing that goes on, you know,
5337920	5343040	the things that use the word spiritual and are incredibly harmful and incredibly
5343680	5349680	lacking in any kind of sense of the sacred or morality. So I stay away from that word.
5350640	5355920	I think the work that we're doing in moral imaginations, the work that Ian talked about,
5355920	5361840	the three pillars of future generations, ancestors, and the more than human world is
5361840	5370160	profoundly spiritual. Like I think part of why, I mean, I feel incredibly grateful and kind of
5370160	5375120	honored to do this work every day is because it, I wouldn't call it that, you know, we're going
5375120	5381600	into local councils, we're working with, you know, large institutions. But what we are trying to do
5381600	5388800	is create a space and practice that is profoundly connecting to the sacred. When you imagine having
5388800	5394720	a conversation with a person, seven generations in the future, you know, to touch on Iroquois
5395280	5401680	indigenous thinking, that is profoundly spiritual and sacred. So to me, this imagination work that
5401680	5406640	I'm doing, it's not frivolous. It's not about the future. It's not about innovation and technology.
5406640	5413520	It is deeply sacred and spiritual. And, you know, personally, you know, I meditate, I try and spend
5413520	5419040	a lot of time in nature. I think meditation, you know, that Rob Bebea is a really interesting
5419040	5424400	Buddhist teacher who actually works a lot with imagination within the kind of Buddhist practice.
5424400	5429280	So if anybody is interested, I'd recommend looking at his work. But I think right now,
5430240	5436000	that I guess I only have so much capacity for spiritual work. And basically, my job is
5437520	5442160	doing that kind of spiritual work and bringing people together and creating spaces where people
5442160	5447600	can connect with the, with the imaginal with their sense of what's important, what matters.
5448400	5450320	And so that's my, that's my answer.
5451120	5452960	And Ian, do you meditate? I'm just curious.
5453280	5461280	Yes, I do. At least it's what I call meditation, which is my understanding of mindfulness.
5463120	5467440	Which I think is an important practice that should be taught in schools,
5467440	5472960	so that everyone knows how to do this. It's not, it's not like there's some complicated
5472960	5477920	technique. It's just remembering to stop certain things happening. And as I keep saying,
5478640	5484240	the first step in creativity sounds negative to the Western mind, because we think in these
5484240	5489600	polar ways that you must be push, push, push. But sometimes actually you get, if you're pushing
5489600	5496000	at a dormant pull, then you're doing the wrong thing. And a lot of the time it's about stopping,
5496000	5502960	stopping doing the things that are going on in my head. And remembering with gratitude the things
5502960	5514560	that I do love and learn from and feel connected to in my day, in my days. I'm lucky that I live,
5514560	5519920	well, by choice in a rather remote place where I'm surrounded by nature, which is a constant
5520480	5528640	companion and reminder. Like Phoebe, I dislike the word spiritual, which can be anything from
5528640	5535840	having a scented bath with candles to, you know, I just don't, I think the term is terribly
5535840	5540800	reduced. But on the other hand, people react very badly if you talk about religion for reasons I
5540800	5546720	completely understand, although in the end I would, I would caution people not to dismiss by any means,
5546720	5553920	cry, the incredible traditions of the great religions of the world, including Buddhism,
5553920	5558480	if you call it a religion, which I think a lot of Buddhists do, and quite rightly, because it's
5558560	5565680	in touch with the divine. So I, what am I saying? I'm saying I don't, I don't, I don't actually
5565680	5572080	sign up for anything. This is bad, I believe, I don't go to a church, partly because any of the
5572080	5576000	churches that are within striking distance for me would not be of the kind that I particularly
5576000	5584880	want to go to. And I would find it very difficult, I think, but I don't approve of that point of
5584880	5591600	view. I approve of the point of view where you go and you, you form part of a community. So I'm
5591600	5598240	putting my hands up here as, you know, I'm not, not, not any expert on any of this. I'm just
5599520	5605360	like, I guess a lot of people listening to this muddling my way through life as best I can,
5605360	5608720	you know. And when I last checked, I was still alive and that's good.
5609040	5616400	Thanks. The word spiritual, it's funny, I think I'm trying to reclaim that word because I know
5616400	5623280	it has a dirty, you know, association, like the religion. And very much I was brought up, you know,
5624640	5631120	hating religion as a Catholic, because it was very moralistic, in a bad way, in an exterior way,
5631120	5636480	but yeah, meditation, mindfulness. And that's what I meant, really, you know, I
5636480	5643120	spoke, yeah. Look, thank you very much for your... Can I loop back around? Just to say that I think
5643120	5649040	there, you know, I said, I do meditate, but I think just really in parallel to the conversation we
5649040	5655600	just had about imagination, I think there's something about bringing, you know, to me being alive in
5655600	5659680	the, you know, the Anthropocene, whether we use that word or not, but being alive in this time and
5659680	5665680	being really awake and sensitive to what is going on is a spiritual, you know, it is spiritual.
5665680	5669280	Like, I think that's kind of what you ended on, Ian, is like, I'm alive. I'm, you know,
5669280	5673040	that is a spiritual experience. And going and sitting and closing my eyes and meditating,
5673040	5679600	I don't actually think of as more spiritual than the kind of constantly waking up, being like,
5679600	5683920	this is what's happening, who am I? What am I choosing to do? How do I see it as sensitive
5684880	5690720	to the pain of the world, to what is happening? I'm just saying that we are reaching to 100
5690720	5696480	minutes. I don't want to upset Jonathan, even though he's not here, by taking us over. But
5696480	5699760	it's a really good question. It really got me thinking that there's, you know, the answer I gave
5699760	5706880	first, and then there was a sort of emergency. Yes. And what the hell about the timing? Sorry,
5706880	5714080	I'm just going to say something. The, you know, the idea that one should push towards a spiritual
5714080	5722880	goal is also something that requires awareness of its negative side. So, you know, to be extremely
5722880	5728960	zen, you know, the answer to being spiritual is to not try and be spiritual at all. You know,
5729520	5737520	however, it's very good putting on my western hat to have a routine of sitting down and perhaps
5737520	5741680	reading a certain text or being quiet and meditative. There we are.
5744560	5748800	And somebody put a paradox mindset, but we haven't got time to talk about that, I suppose.
5748800	5756240	I saw that. I saw many good questions. Ian and Phoebe will send you the questions
5757200	5764320	so that you have a chance to look at them. And for everyone, thank you so much for being here
5764320	5768080	and for those of you that were asking questions and who wanted to ask that didn't have the time,
5768640	5774880	please bring them to the Connection Session next Tuesday. And I also wanted to mention
5774880	5780720	that in two weeks' time, there's Isabella Granich, who's going to be in conversation with Ian.
5781680	5788080	She is a researcher and facilitator. She works in, kind of, from a developmental science
5788080	5793920	background, works with adolescents. We'll have more information about who she is and the
5794720	5799760	topic of the conversation very shortly. Michael has put it in the chat, so if you want to
5799760	5806320	register already for that next session. And this will also go in a sort of modified form
5806320	5812320	on YouTube once we make the edits. So if you want to replay this, you'll be able to do that.
5812320	5818160	And you'll see that link come out in a few days. But I think just for now, I wanted to really thank
5818160	5823200	Phoebe and Ian for taking the time to speak together. I personally found it incredibly
5823200	5829200	interesting to listen to the two of you in conversation. So thank you very much and good
5829200	5839200	evening and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
