1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
Listen, it's wonderful to see you all, all 334 and rising. I'm Jonathan Rison. I'm chief

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,600
executive and co-founder of Perspectiva, who are putting on tonight's event. We're also

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,900
very proud publishers of Ian's most recent book, The Matter With Things. I'm going to

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,740
work on the assumption that you know Ian pretty well, but he is as well as a now quite famous

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,740
author and I use quite there more in the North American sense of very rather than the sort

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:42,720
of British sense of not so much. Really, you know, very much famous and celebrated writer

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,420
and thinker with an increasingly international reputation. So it's no wonder that so many

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,900
of you are here to see him.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:59,540
Tonight we're going to carry on our series called Attention as a Moral Act. And we've

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,140
spoken already in the first session about what we meant by that. We might sort of reiterate

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,980
it a little bit tonight. Some of you may know the first session was between Ian and I. We

12
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,940
were sort of trying to reassert, reaffirm, reestablish the nature of Ian's most fundamental

13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,580
argument. We spoke a little bit about my own take on it, calling it the McGilchrist manoeuvre.

14
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,220
And we tried to establish what that was. And we just more generally sort of updated ourselves

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,700
prior to the plunge into the more specific aspects of the book. In the second session,

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,460
we spoke with Zachary Stein, who had an amazing conversation with Ian about value as a fundamental

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:47,380
feature of the cosmos. It was a very richly metaphysical, somewhat spiritual, fundamental

18
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,220
conversation about the nature of reality. And we've had a great deal of positive feedback

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:58,940
about it since. As some of you may know, in between our sessions, we also have bi-weekly

20
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,020
connection and inquiry sessions, which are run by Michael and Lee, my colleagues. And

21
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,300
so if you have questions or you want to have further conversations, you're welcome to just

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,300
go to those events. And they're quite informal and you have a chance to reflect and do some

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,700
practices and get to know the work a bit more deeply. Tonight we have an unusual situation,

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
which is that earlier today, I was in touch with Benita Roy, whom I've known for quite

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,300
some time. And she gave me chapter and verse on how she's prepared for this evening's event.

26
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,580
And she will be joining us very shortly. For some reason, we can't currently contact her.

27
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,900
And we're waiting for her to arrive. So I'm going to briefly introduce her. I hope that

28
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,740
she shows up. And if she doesn't show up, I'm going to begin speaking to Ian myself, partly

29
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,780
based on Benita's notes. But it's just a matter of time until she shows up, because we have

30
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,460
now reminded her. And my only assumption is that she may have got the time zone conversion

31
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,020
mixed up because of some daylight saving time change, which we thought we were on top of,

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,500
but evidently not. So give us a few minutes as she manifests herself. Benita, many of you

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,180
will know already, but many of you may not. And she's really a rather extraordinary human

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:25,260
being with a multitude of different character traits, skills, assets, interests. It's quite rare

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,420
for someone to get deeply into metaphysical philosophy. And by that, I don't mean so much

36
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,020
the metaphysical and the sort of new age sort of irrational kind of philosophy. I mean, more

37
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,540
profoundly in engagement with metaphysics as it's studied in classical philosophy and in

38
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,340
analytic philosophy. And she's written papers on why metaphysics matters. She wrote one of the

39
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,140
one of the most profound chapters in a book released by Perspectiva Press called Dispatches

40
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,100
from a Time Between Worlds. And it was about the idea of metamorphosis. And a lot of Benita's work

41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,780
is about emphasizing not just the kind of how we have to improve things, but also a little bit

42
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,100
of how we have to allow things to end. Michael, are you showing me signs of life there? Or am I

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:19,620
imagining it? I'm imagining it. Okay. So Benita is also a horse trainer, a farmer. And like Ian,

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,940
she describes herself as a Taoist. One of my favorite conversations with her was when she

45
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,740
spoke about the enormous tomatoes that she had in her farm after using some new unsuspecting

46
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,220
variety of manures to make them grow. But she'll switch from that to speaking about

47
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,420
whitehead and heart short and so on. So Benita is a rather extraordinary person and I'm very

48
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:53,940
much hoping she'll join us in just a second. I'm just noticing I have a problem with my battery.

49
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,020
So if I disappear too, Michael, you'll have to take it up. I think I've got it covered,

50
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,220
but just a second. So I want to start Ian with a question that Bonnie was going to ask you.

51
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,060
She had something else to say first, but I'll let her say that because it's very personal to her.

52
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,380
She was very interested in your subtitle. She wants to understand a little bit more about

53
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,860
after the matter with things, which you might want to remind us why you chose that title.

54
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,780
More precisely the subtitle, our brains, our delusions, and the unmaking of the world. And I

55
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,420
know it took you quite a while to come up with that. But if you can share anything about why exactly

56
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,780
those words and what you're getting at, I know that's one thing Bonnie wanted to ask you.

57
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,420
Well, of course, in choosing the title in the matter with things, I was addressing myself

58
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,580
to the idea that we often have problems understanding elements of our experience because

59
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:01,620
we thingify them. We see them as things and in essence, many of the things that we think of in

60
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,900
this way, I think a better thought of as adverbs probably, in other words, they are not elements

61
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,300
that we have to pin down or we can find in certain places, but they are ways in which we relate

62
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:29,540
to everything else that exists. And so the idea would be that you don't look for an entity,

63
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,900
but a web of relationships that allows what this entity is thought to refer to to become real.

64
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,940
It's always a reverberative relationship. And why I chose the subtitle is, of course, it has a

65
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,980
kind of glancing nod towards the subtitle of the master and his emissary. But what I'm talking

66
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,780
about there is that I believe that we've started to use our brains in a particularly limited way.

67
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,060
When I say started, I think we've been doing it now for a couple of hundred years at least,

68
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,780
in which we disattend to whatever it is the right hemisphere is able to tell us and instead

69
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:17,700
focus on what the left hemisphere would have us believe. And the delusions comes from, as I

70
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,100
demonstrate in the first nine chapters of the book, which are all dedicated to neuroscience.

71
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,140
And it's more fascinating, I hope, than that makes it sound. It's not abstract. It's looking

72
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,460
at what actually happens to people and their lives and their world and their whole way of being

73
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,100
when part of their brain is not functioning correctly. And this may be because of an injury

74
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,940
to the right hemisphere or a stroke in the right hemisphere. But it may also be because of

75
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:54,980
developing a disease such as schizophrenia, which has many, many, many parallels with a

76
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:03,620
right hemisphere deficit state. And I go into all of that in that chapter. And the left hemisphere

77
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,500
is literally deluded. And that's not just me who says that. I mean, I'm very happy to quote

78
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,700
other, and I do other neuroscientists who say, yes, the left hemisphere is on its own deluded.

79
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Sorry, Jonathan, are you just just for a point of clarification, because the word delusion is

80
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,540
used a lot. And I know you're very precise with your words. It's one of the reasons people love

81
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,260
your words much. And what exactly is a delusion? I mean, as opposed to an unreality and illusion

82
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,780
and lots of other concepts around it, what makes a delusion a delusion as such?

83
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:43,380
Well, I think that the standard definition is something like an incorrigible false belief

84
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:52,820
that is not explained by the person's culture or other context. So, you know, there are things

85
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,180
that we would call unexplained false beliefs, but they're part of somebody's religion. And

86
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,220
it doesn't mean that they've become crazy. It means that because of belonging to that religion,

87
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:12,180
that's the way they think, for example. And so it's got to be something, and it's not just

88
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:21,940
false, but it is in this sense incorrigible. Because there are false beliefs, which can be

89
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,540
corrected. But in the case of a delusion, it is pointless arguing with somebody about it, because

90
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,780
you're relying on a shared way of seeing the world, that is, as it were yours and mine,

91
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,700
and the patient's in order to explain to the patient that this cannot be the case.

92
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,980
But you've got to remember that for the patient, the whole world that they are experiencing is

93
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,860
based on this certain way of, that certain disposition towards it, this way of experiencing it.

94
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,340
And so it's a very obvious and common observation that however bizarre a delusion is,

95
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,540
it is absolutely fruitless trying to argue with the patient about whether this is evidentially

96
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:12,900
likely. And also, there's a sort of gray area where, for example, you may believe that your

97
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:21,940
spouse is unfaithful to you, and your spouse may be being unfaithful to you. But there is

98
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,820
still a delusional way of believing it, because you believe it not in the way that somebody would

99
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:35,140
normally frame this, but you believe it with a sort of determination and on the basis of evidence

100
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,540
that other people would not consider a reasonable basis for making decisions. So there's no very,

101
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,140
very clear way of putting it. But when you meet somebody who's deluded, you sure know what you're

102
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:56,500
encountering. And I believe that we as a society have started to believe obviously false things

103
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,900
about ourselves that experience, intuition, the business of living, would tell us must be false

104
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,500
and have always been seen by people as false, but we now believe them to be the case. So that's

105
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,340
that bit about the delusions and the unmaking. Joe, before you get to the unmaking, I just want to

106
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:20,260
get the delusions very clear, because again, as with last week, or two weeks ago, when we had the

107
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,780
necessary, but sometimes confusing, a lesion between value and values.

108
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,580
With delusion and delusions, I'm just curious, you're speaking in the subtitle about

109
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,020
particular delusions that you outline in those chapters that you mentioned. But there's also

110
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,860
something you say about shared reality here. So I'm just wondering the relationship between

111
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,540
particular delusions, which might make it difficult for people to interact in a shared

112
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,860
reality, and the idea that the whole perception that shared is somehow deluded. And what it's

113
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,180
like, are we living in both of those kinds of delusion? Or, and if so, what's the relationship

114
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,700
between them? And if you don't mind while you answer that, I have to go and get another charger

115
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,780
for my computer or they will disappear. So I'm still with you and I'm turning off my video,

116
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,420
and I'll be back. So make it a long, good answer. I'll be back in two minutes.

117
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:20,900
Okay, I'll do my best. Yes, I see the distinction that Jonathan's making there.

118
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,700
And, you know, for example, if we are as a whole society seeing things in a certain way,

119
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,860
is this still delusional since part of the idea of delusion is believing something that cannot be

120
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:44,340
explained by your societal beliefs? And I suppose this is a very new situation. I don't think there's

121
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:52,500
been an example in the past, where a whole society has been in the grip of ways of thinking that are

122
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,900
frankly delusional, and like those that are held by patients with major psychoses who are

123
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:06,580
out of touch with reality. And so this, this is a new era that we've entered where,

124
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:14,660
as it were, there is a mass psychosis. And I don't think I'm the only person actually who's used

125
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:25,860
that conception of a mass psychosis. But what we see is that, for example, people with delusions

126
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,220
based on the fact that they have got a psychotic illness will find many things

127
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,820
apparent that we would not think apparent and make things that we do see apparent as completely

128
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:49,300
probable or impossible. And I could go back to chapter nine, which is the chapter in which I do

129
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,420
look at schizophrenia, but just illuminate the, I don't know, possibly I would say about 30 different

130
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:04,340
ways in which people with schizophrenia demonstrate the same sorts of aberrational thinking that we do.

131
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,820
And one thing that's interesting about this is that it, I mean, a lot of it, one might think

132
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,940
is because we're interacting with machines. People with schizophrenia see themselves as machines

133
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,340
often and call themselves machines and have been known to do things like cut open their

134
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:29,460
wrists to see whether there's blood or engine oil in their veins. So they can often have this very

135
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:36,660
disturbing feeling that nothing is right. It's all mechanical. It's all abstracted engineering

136
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,660
rather than anything embodied. Sorry. I put my hand up because I've got an email notification

137
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,940
from our esteemed guest that she's waiting to be let in. Yeah. Oh, good. Yeah, I just want to say

138
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,420
Hey, so here we go. You've managed to bring fabulous. Yeah. And I'm just gonna bring it up

139
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,740
to speed then and let you take over from there. Hi, Bonnie. Nice to see you. Are you with us?

140
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,940
I am. Sorry. I'm so sorry about my tardiness. No, that's okay. That's okay.

141
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,900
Good to have you with us. You may not, I know you've been in touch with Ian by email, but

142
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:23,140
nice to introduce you. I'll be in front of 300 odd people. So, you know, I've spoken with many

143
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,780
times and I think you'll know, Bonnie, I've already introduced you to some extent to the audience.

144
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,420
What I didn't mention is that over the last year or so, you've maybe more than a year now, you've

145
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,500
created something with a lovely fetching straightforward title, a pop-up school. And

146
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,300
just briefly tell us what a pop-up, what your pop-up school is so that before we get into the

147
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:53,060
discussion, people get a better sense of where you're coming from. Well, hi, Ian. Nice to see you.

148
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:02,500
Hello, Bonnie. So, for almost 15 years, I taught a master's course in consciousness studies and

149
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,980
transpersonal psychology or transformational psychology, which we called it at the end.

150
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,620
And COVID pretty much was the straw that broke the back for that program, which was always kind

151
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:31,780
of an off-broadway struggling private program. And so, I graduated my last cohort in August of 2022

152
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:41,140
and in August of 2021, kind of anticipating the end of that, I wanted to offer something similar

153
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,940
that was equally robust that could speak to what people were starving for, but had a much lower

154
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:58,820
onboarding threshold. So, instead of paying $17,000 a year, you could pay like $40 a month. And I

155
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,540
kind of modified sub-stack so people could enroll on and off or enroll on a yearly basis. And I

156
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,740
called it the pop-up school because in Zach Stein, whom you met a couple of weeks ago, Ian, in his

157
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,740
book, he predicted that schools might be these little pop-up initiatives. And I wanted to give

158
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:27,860
it this sense of like serial learning, like you could pop in and pop out. And yeah, so it's been

159
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,980
almost two years now and it's quite a growing, growing community. And I suspect there's several

160
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,260
of the students or our community on this call today. Okay, great. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

161
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,700
And, Bonnie, while you're getting settled, just as far as I understand it, where we were in the

162
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,180
conversation was, I didn't say anything about your observations about the book, but I did use your

163
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,540
email from this morning to ask Ian about the subtitle. And so, we spoke a little bit about

164
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,460
why the matter with things. We spoke a little bit about brains, which could be somewhat self-evident.

165
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,940
We spoke a little bit about delusions and the difference between delusion sort of

166
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,580
singular and delusions plural and individual and collective delusions, but only really

167
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,900
scratched the surface of that. And Ian was just about to come on to the unmaking of the world

168
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,900
when various things kicked off, including my computer running out of battery. So, Ian, if you

169
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,180
want to finish that thought on why the unmaking of the world allowed me to get settled and once

170
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,700
you finish that, I'm happy to disappear until the Q&A. So, if you can go on the unmaking of the

171
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,180
world, Michael, you can allow me to disappear. Yes. And then you carry on talking together

172
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,420
and I'll be back with the Q&A in about 50 minutes.

173
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:49,380
Yes, what I wanted to indicate by the phrase the unmaking of the world is that the various habits

174
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:58,900
of mind that I believe are toxic, which we've adopted more in the last few decades, but certainly

175
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:07,460
going back further than that, the last century or two, lead to us no longer having a world. And

176
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,900
a world is a very special thing. If you like to put it that way, it's an experience really,

177
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,980
like all the things I talk about, that it's not really a thing. But it's a place in which we

178
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:30,020
dwell. It's a home. It's a living thing. And therefore, in schematizing, mechanizing, abstracting,

179
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:38,340
decontextualizing, ignoring the uniqueness of individual cases, in ordering, ignoring the

180
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:45,780
individual uniqueness of people, we have come to inhabit an enormously impoverished version

181
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:53,380
of what that world should be. We're in a sort of lost place, which has none of the

182
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:03,540
feel of a living, vibrant world in which we are committed, orientated, and find a place of being.

183
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:12,660
That's really what I was getting at. Yeah, so thank you. When I read that, I was struck by,

184
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,900
I just had this impression, you put a lot of thought into the subtitle, and that it was very,

185
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:30,980
it was a more poignant message, maybe, than a lot of people might think about at first. And

186
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,340
something that strikes me as being of grave concern, I think there's a lot at stake. I think you

187
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,620
would agree that there's a lot at stake. And I think sometimes people think, they take you

188
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,260
seriously, but they think it's like a metaphor. And I think that it's more than a metaphor. It's

189
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:59,380
more than a passing concern. It's more than almost a sci-fi movie, let's say. Some people with all

190
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,500
these crises go into their consciousness like it's almost a sci-fi movie. It makes us nervous, but

191
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I think that, like for me, a lot of what you're talking about, I see every day. I've seen the

192
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:20,100
erosion of the adult mind through the 15 years that I've been doing teaching. And, you know, of

193
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:28,660
course, my course selects some people who have maybe a little bit of spiritual emergencies and

194
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:37,940
stuff, but the nature of the question of whether reality is real is extraordinary now. And these

195
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,900
programs that people go to, that question whether we share the same world or we all have different

196
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,060
worlds, you know? There's this, and I know the sense in which we all live in our own perspective,

197
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,580
but the emphasis is always on that the world is a simulation, that we share different worlds,

198
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,540
like the sense that the humanities and the science are teaching this extraordinary

199
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:10,420
fragmentation, I call it locked-in syndrome, that we can't perceive the world really.

200
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:25,300
And my question for you is where is the fever? Why are we so feverishly trying to convince ourselves

201
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:35,060
that we live in a simulation? I mean, where is that pain coming from? That we don't want to live in,

202
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,700
let's say, the natural world?

203
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,540
Gosh, there's so many things to say about that. Well, one is that the natural world imposes limits

204
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:54,980
on us, like we die and we have bodies that have certain inclinations and so on. We're busy trying

205
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,100
to pretend that none of this is true and we can remake everything according to our whim,

206
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:10,180
but that is not the case. And in fact, the limits that are imposed by life are extremely healthful

207
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,900
and important. It's a mistake to think that we ought to be railing against them and trying to

208
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:25,860
get rid of them in my view. But of course, like everything, it's a matter of degree. Nature is

209
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:35,700
something that medicine has always interfered with. Nature tries to overcome some of the

210
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,540
unnecessarily adverse effects of disease and so forth. So we are always juggling these things.

211
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:50,420
I think another reason why we're addicted to this idea of a representation is because

212
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,620
the left hemisphere is a representation of the world. The right hemisphere has

213
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,940
a presencing of the world. It allows the world to presence to us. That is a vibrant two-way

214
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,940
experience. But once it is taken up by the left hemisphere, it is dislocated, dismembered,

215
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,100
analyzed, categorized, and turned into something abstract, a map of the world. And you cannot

216
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,500
live in a map. You've unmade the world once you do that. But the left hemisphere can only trust

217
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:32,020
the things that itself has made. Heidegger actually said that he was, of course, not talking about

218
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,580
hemispheres at all. But he did say that modern man needs to be able to tell himself that he is the

219
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,060
giver to himself of everything that he has. And that is part of this problem that we have,

220
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:54,180
that we must be the all-powerful and we must be the one that can do anything. This is extraordinary

221
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:03,300
in a way because, you know, for decades I've been puzzled by the kind of paradox that at the same

222
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:09,700
time we believe ourselves to be capable of doing almost anything we want to,

223
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:18,740
and believe ourselves to be basically pointless, worthless. So the dignity of humanity has hugely

224
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,140
plummeted, and so is its happiness and its sense of longing and everything else, at the same time

225
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:32,980
that our hubris about humanity has gone through the roof. So adopting a certain degree of

226
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:41,860
modesty and a sense of proper limits to what we can do and what we can know would actually

227
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,420
perhaps help us to regain a sense of respect for what we in fact are and what we can do. But

228
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,420
those would be some of the thoughts I'd have about why that is so promoted. And I'm afraid it

229
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,740
is very much promoted, and I just like to say that there are a number of philosophers quite

230
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,380
amongst the foremost at the moment is Donald Hoffman, who says that what we see is a readout

231
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:15,060
of an instrument panel. This is an idea that has been offered many times in the past and was really

232
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,740
in Damasio's early work as well, for which I criticised him and for which he hasn't forgiven me.

233
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,340
But this idea that actually what we're doing is reading out something,

234
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,660
which is what the left hemisphere does, but in fact we're experiencing something real. There are

235
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,500
things in the cosmos that correspond to all those things that we perceive and value.

236
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,420
Now I'm not saying that there's only one way of seeing them, but once again in our culture what

237
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,620
we've done is we've taken a partial truth and made it the whole story. So it is true that everyone

238
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,940
to some extent sees the world differently and that's an important and beautiful fact. But

239
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:05,460
it is also a very important and beautiful fact that generally speaking we see things in a common

240
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,940
world. We don't all live in so vastly different worlds that we have no common ground. And at

241
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:19,860
the moment there's a general tendency to say that if something is the case up to a degree,

242
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,420
which wasn't thought to be so perhaps recently, then it's true to the max across the board. We go

243
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,940
to extremes. We have black and white positions and I'd like to present myself as a photo of

244
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,060
black and white positions. It's very important that there are masses of degree and things that are

245
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,420
implicit and not fully made explicit.

246
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:50,580
You know so you said that you know we kind of have this hubris that we imagine ourselves

247
00:27:50,580 --> 00:28:00,100
are all powerful, that all the gifts we have we've made ourselves. And it seems to me that

248
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,100
there's a pickle in this because somehow deep down inside we do know that we haven't made the

249
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,740
earth and we haven't made the trees and we haven't made ourselves and everything that we actually are

250
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:21,700
has been given to us freely by nature through no account of our own. I mean this is more it's

251
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,020
you know people will when I say that they say oh that's very spiritual and I say no it's just a

252
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:34,180
strong naturalism. It's just actually the case it's rather mundane and for me there's something that

253
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:46,020
if I thought I was responsible for booting up my enthusiasm every morning I would be overwhelmed

254
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:54,420
you know. It's like so much of who we are that gives us the possibility to pretend we're all

255
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:03,300
powerful comes to us through this intelligence that we don't we we don't maybe you know we don't have

256
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:15,620
you know it's not it's not been it's all given to us and and so it seems to me like the thing I

257
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:23,300
can't understand is that and I don't know this is seem off topic to you or is this kind of interesting

258
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:31,140
to talk about. Yeah so I went to a conference the other day and this young man was presenting an

259
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:38,100
argument that that the world is intelligible and that communication between people is possible

260
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,580
and to do that he took this huge journey through theoretical cognitive science and

261
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:54,580
opponent processing and and free energy principle and I thought something very odd he's a very nice

262
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:03,620
man and I thought something very odd is happening here like if if people had to understand all that

263
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,220
to understand that the world is intelligible it's a possibility of communication then most people

264
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:16,980
would be lost and I thought like I told my dog you have absolutely no no chance at all for being

265
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:25,940
in the world you know and so this question this crisis of how so this is an example of something

266
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:34,180
that looked like a well presented presentation but it really was to me a sense of collective madness

267
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:44,980
and and yeah no well this kind of thing goes on all the time it's just that we've completely lost

268
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:54,900
any kind of contact with the the live intuitive reverberative business of experiencing the world

269
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:02,020
in which the world approaches us becomes available to us and we to it and it's in this encounter

270
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:13,300
that whatever it is that we we we know comes about so what you're describing is this unnecessarily

271
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,140
complex way of approaching it and there's a lot of this in science in which frankly the

272
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:26,500
extraordinarily opposite is sorry obvious I meant to say extraordinary obvious is is demonstrated

273
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,820
at costly and great length where at the same time oddly there are things that are completely

274
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,100
obvious that are wholly denied and people go around believing them because they think oh well

275
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:45,140
people say this so I better believe it but I want a bit of the touch of the the little boy who

276
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,860
said the emperor's wearing no clothes yeah I mean I'm sorry guys he's nude

277
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:59,460
and there's just so much rubbish talk these days and it's very confusing disorientating

278
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,980
to agreeable and leads them to a sense of desperation they don't know what to believe who

279
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,020
to believe what to believe in the intuitive spirituality has been dead and by the way

280
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,580
they've been brought up and by everything they experience in the world their capacity to pay

281
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,860
um continuous sustained vigilant attention open attention respectful attention the sort

282
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:32,660
of attention that leads to real sense of meaning and or is has been undermined and they've been

283
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:41,060
told they have thousands of choices that in reality are not helpful and it it's a well-known

284
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:49,380
fact in in psychological research that beyond a few choices too many choices make people less happy

285
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:56,820
more stressed than they would have been content with fewer choices so it's not as I'm always saying

286
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,140
it's not an argument for having no choice but it's an argument for saying that choice doesn't

287
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,660
get better and better if you try and say well you can be anything you want you can't I mean

288
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:15,780
get real it's a horrible fantasy that creates enormous stress and the fear of missing out

289
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,060
and the fear of having failed and the need to do all kinds of incompatible things at once

290
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:27,940
in order to prove that you're okay it's a horrible world to bring up young people in I mean I I just

291
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,180
feel for young people whose rates of mental illness I was just zooming through the roof

292
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:45,060
yeah so we do live live in a mad world my master's when you think of young people it's really very

293
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:56,580
sad and and I've read a statistics that one out of very 16 kids in the United States is diagnosed

294
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,500
with a severe mental illness and whether it's because the DSM has gone mad or the children

295
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:12,420
gone mad it doesn't really matter it's an alarming alarming fact and you know I talked to sometimes

296
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:22,420
I coach some young parents and we we we try to teach parents how to have unstructured time with

297
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:32,420
their children and and I often get the response you know I I blocked out time she she was playing

298
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,540
I was there nothing was happening but I got bored I don't know what to do with my body I don't know

299
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:46,420
how to put my body in a in play I don't I'm just stiff and I pretend and and and this is all by

300
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,100
way of trying to say to the listeners like it's not a joke and it's not science fiction

301
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:59,380
and something really disturbing is happening right in front of our eyes

302
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:07,220
but I thought you know I have this this note here and there's this beautiful word that you use

303
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:18,420
if I don't know how to say it city if city if say it if say it and you have a quote from sass

304
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:26,340
in his book about this crucial self sense of self sameness a fundamental and therefore nearly

305
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,780
indescribable experience of existing as a vital and self identity identical subject of experience

306
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:44,820
and action and and I thought um this is one of these experiences that we can no longer take

307
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:54,980
for granted that people have any intuition of and so I thought maybe you could if you were talking

308
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:06,500
to aliens who had had had not this experience what what what is what is that experience

309
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,460
the trouble is that it's not something that's improved by being put into words it's something

310
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:21,940
that has to be experienced and I take the word it say it largely from louis sass um a very great

311
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:33,220
mind I think um and what he's talking about there is the natural um unselfconscious awareness of a

312
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:40,100
continuous functioning self we've so eroded our intuition and we've been encouraged to attack

313
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:47,540
our intuitions to reject our intuitions that we can no longer act unselfconsciously and this happens

314
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,660
in schizophrenia people say I don't know how to walk I have to think put one foot in front of the

315
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,380
other and so on I don't know how to sit down um or whatever it may be so they've become paralyzed

316
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:07,940
by a kind of gorgon stare of the intellect on everything they're doing and the beauty of life

317
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,660
is that things work well only when it's not like that imagine um how bad the performance

318
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,100
of a piece of music would be if the pianist was thinking all the time consciously about what he

319
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:27,460
was doing with his fingers imagine how um how diminished an act of sexual love would be if it

320
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:34,500
was entirely contrived according to a plan an algorithm or a worked out schema it's this way

321
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:44,420
of thinking that is absolutely crazy and a huge affliction and makes life impossibly difficult

322
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:51,780
for us the trouble is that if we adopt a legalistic frame of mind I mean a lot of this comes back to

323
00:37:51,780 --> 00:38:04,660
a sort of legalistic um incorporation of um the redress in the the redress for any kind of

324
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:11,140
wrong that happens to you is to accuse somebody so nowadays we we we have this sort of idea or

325
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,780
some people seem to have this idea that we're owed a pain-free life and if there's pain there's

326
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,180
suffering things are not good in it there's somebody to blame for that and they must be

327
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:30,980
brought to account preferably through the law this has a deleterious effect on whole sways

328
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:38,660
of life where in fact we need to trust and to accept that there will be ups and downs and

329
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,020
things but not to become um you know reaching for our handy attorney at every turn in events

330
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:54,340
this is the problem and this is why schools find teachers harder to recruit hospitals are finding

331
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,260
doctors harder to recruit because first of all they've been told that unless they follow certain

332
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,540
written procedures they will be vulnerable to being sued and that will completely destroy their

333
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:11,700
career and and that's you know nothing any longer can be done according to the wonderful way in which

334
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:19,220
I was taught and it was taught medicine too which was from experience from people who'd had you

335
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:25,780
know 40 years of experience of whatever it was talking to me from that base of what goes well

336
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:32,260
and what doesn't and and you know the teachers at school were people who had had an enormous

337
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,100
enthusiasm for things that they had learned to love and they communicated that to me and that's

338
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,580
in itself worth a thousand hours of just following rules and procedures it's this

339
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:53,700
awful business of rules procedures theories that have overtaken our ability to be naturally responsive

340
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:01,860
creatures and when we can try to recover that we may be able to get back some of our moral self

341
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:07,220
because that's also a very important thing isn't it I mean since we have rules about absolutely

342
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:14,660
everything now I think back to when I was was young and one I mean it's a it's a cliche but one

343
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,180
didn't need to have the same numbers of locks and the cameras watching everything and so on

344
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:26,500
but on the whole although certainly crime existed it didn't seem to exist on the level that it would

345
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,660
if we now took away all the the locks and the and the cameras that we've since instituted and

346
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,220
there's a sort of belief that if you can get away with it then you're entitled to do so there's no

347
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:45,620
kind of strong innocence of I would never do this because I'm not that kind of person and I don't

348
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,540
want to live in a world where human beings do this kind of thing that seems to me one of the most

349
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,100
important moral act um stimuli to action I don't want to do this because I don't want to be in a

350
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:04,100
world where we can assume that people will do this unless some law restrains them from doing it

351
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:12,180
so we've moved such a terrifically long way from anything intrinsic and spontaneous and intuitive

352
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,780
um to the world of somebody who is unable to stand unless they've got

353
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:24,820
scaffolding all around them a support and of course such a person is a feeble version of a

354
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,860
healthy living individual yeah and of course that's what you think about that yeah and of

355
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:36,260
course that scaffolding is actually fragmented right just like this so I was thinking of the

356
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:43,860
other day we were talking about wisdom like what is it to cultivate wisdom and I was saying that

357
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:52,820
years ago both of us will use that phrase quite a bit I think um doctor for example could grow

358
00:41:52,820 --> 00:42:00,180
wise in his career right so he would give birth to children he'd watch them grow he put their

359
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:07,700
help their parents in the dying process he'd be in the community and this kind of embedded

360
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:16,100
in the community in the local with his expertise um having what I call a voluntary obligation to

361
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:26,180
his practice um through the thick and thin and the difficulties this is a formula for having wise

362
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:36,180
people embedded in relationships but a doctor's career is not a formula for wisdom today not at

363
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,380
all it's completely fragmented and they're systematically standardizing things so all the

364
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,300
doctor does is go on the computer and tell you some things are pretty soon you don't need the doctor

365
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:53,780
and we feel we we've we've slowly redefined intelligence as something machines are good

366
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,300
at and so you see the standardizing of teaching the standards of this is what machines are good at

367
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,860
and now we have you know chat gpt is going to be our teachers because it's better at that than we

368
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:14,500
are but we've been we've redefined intelligence is what people are good at well we need to redefine

369
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:23,060
intelligence I mean yeah yes I I mean I I always say AI is not artificial intelligence

370
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:29,060
it's artificial information processing and that's what it does but intelligence involves

371
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:37,140
a full understanding and that can only come if you if you are embodied if you have emotions if you

372
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:42,580
form um relations on the basis of that and if you're aware that you were only here for a while

373
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:49,060
and are going to die the all these things are very important to making us what we are we need all

374
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,500
these elements including the element of death which is not our foe but in many ways our friend

375
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,220
that's a whole other topic but but I what I'm really saying is that

376
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:08,260
intelligence isn't is is at risk and I think you're saying this as well um have been replaced

377
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:15,220
by just very rapidly and mechanically following every kind of pathway that a computer can find

378
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:22,100
but having no sense of a context in which to properly evaluate these things and and will

379
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:28,340
fill in things which are absolutely not true on the basis that it looks like in this pattern

380
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,260
this ought to be happening so it actually states that certain things have happened in a person's

381
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,860
life for example based on a probability but they didn't and that person rather specifically

382
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:46,500
didn't do those things so I mean not only have you got the problem of telling true from false in

383
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,380
educating children and and students who may waste their time and their teacher's time by

384
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:01,780
using chat gpt to write their essays um but it will also make the the sphere of the law very

385
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:09,220
difficult our is the evidence fabricated what do we really believe here um can we believe

386
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:15,300
something we see our politicians saying when you can't believe and you can't trust the civilization

387
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:25,220
collapses and you know that's this wonderful saying uh Chinese third century is saying um

388
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:34,980
one of the emperors that for a society for a civilization to thrive you need guns food and

389
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,820
trust and if you have to do away with one of them do away with guns and if you have to do

390
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:47,620
another one do away with food but the one you cannot do away with this trust and we've done away with it

391
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,300
sorry I hope I haven't depressed you too badly don't you think of something

392
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:08,900
no no no I I see something good for the end um um and no I think that I what I'm trying to

393
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:20,340
collaborate with you on is it's really to open people's eyes we know we get so habituated to

394
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:30,820
the way things are and open people's eyes to see how extraordinarily unmade the world is

395
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:40,820
I mean we we think we think we have to encounter people who are paranoid schizophrenics to

396
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,340
understand what you're talking about and yet this kind of unmaking of the world

397
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:53,460
is the world that is being unmade right right in front of our right in front of our very eyes

398
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:02,740
and um it's the world is an organism it's not a machine and the trouble with the way we think

399
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:08,260
is that we think it's just a machine and can therefore be reduced to parts and all we find

400
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:15,220
after you've done this is a lot of of material elements that have been broken out of a hole

401
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:21,860
and the hole cannot conceivably be reconstructed from these bits these inanimate bits and what I

402
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:27,620
mean by the unmaking of the world is all that structure all these relationships that enable

403
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:35,060
things or people and the feelings that they have experiences they have to interrelate with one

404
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:40,900
another are being shorn away the world view is becoming simpler and simpler and simpler

405
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,900
not because it's approaching truth but because it's moving away from truth it's it's running away to

406
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,780
a blatant falsehood which it feels it can't escape because of a certain way of thinking

407
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,140
which is that the only thing that matters is that we should be able to be in control

408
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:06,820
and amass material goods those are the values of the left hemisphere and all the other important

409
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,220
values are better served by the right and it's anyway that was what I talked about last week so

410
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:19,300
we won't go there now I think that another thing that the way to another way to look at it and of

411
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:28,340
course you've done incredible detail on this is people a lot of times people are let's say their

412
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:36,900
teachers or educators or their psychiatrists or their spiritual teachers they assume that the

413
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:46,980
kinds of minds we have is the nature of mind and then they try to work with that or or you know

414
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,900
people will say because our minds are constructing reality and and I always say no that's the kind

415
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:59,300
of mind we have thinks it's a simulation but what I hear you saying is that this integrated mind

416
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:06,340
and of course we have to we're off balance so we're going to emphasize what the what we've lost

417
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:15,700
with the right brain a contribution this kind of mind looks at nature and sees home and and and

418
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:25,620
moves around the world and sees that every act of life is a gift from nature from my home from

419
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:36,900
where I've become this kind of mind trusts that there's such a larger intelligence that an envelopes

420
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:44,500
envelopes all of us and that's like a tissue from which we dialogue is possible you know the left

421
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:50,180
hemisphere like the difference between concepts as you know you hold your baby like this and it's

422
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:57,300
right hemisphere to right hemisphere and yet we're talking at odds like we think that if we can come

423
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:04,580
to some conceptually agreed upon solution then there's a possibility of a communication and I'm

424
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:12,420
saying that like because we our bodies are inhabit the tissue of the living world then this is why

425
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:20,260
this communication is possible not because it's an effort in this direction it should be a joy in

426
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:28,900
this direction and and yeah I I totally agree with that and I think you know the phrase constructing

427
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:35,060
the world is very important because it's a fashionable conception has been since the 60s

428
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:43,220
that effectively we make up the world according to you know who we are then what we what we want

429
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:51,700
but I reject this idea that we fabricate it because that is dependent on this idea that

430
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:58,100
we are cut off from any kind of reality and that all we have are the bits that come to us in our

431
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:03,860
in our mind and we put together a world out of those but that is not in my view the case because

432
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:10,820
we do have contact with something beyond ourselves and unless you tell yourself that that cannot be

433
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,140
and cut yourself off from it in which case of course you won't find that there is anything

434
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:22,180
beyond yourself if you don't do that but cultivate a kind of humble awareness of things that are far

435
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:30,820
beyond what we know right now you start to feel experience those things they start to to give

436
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,660
something with which to build the world and so it's not a fabrication or a construction of the

437
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:42,580
world it's a helping to bring into being something that is there to bring it more into being and

438
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:48,420
we play a part in that and so the world comes about for each of us in a slightly different way

439
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,460
because if each of us brings something different to it but this is wonderful it's not a negation

440
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,540
of the idea that there is a common core to the world it's the idea that each person's contribution

441
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:04,660
brings a slightly different uniqueness to an aspect of the world we still have something

442
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:12,180
that is vibrant living evolving it's not a finished product it's a thing that is in process

443
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:18,020
as we ourselves are in process and that process is a resonant thing between our consciousness

444
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,860
and whatever the rest of the conscious cosmos gives that's my my view of it so instead of

445
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:29,380
saying that we construct the world we make it up in some mechanistic engineering way which

446
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,500
is exactly how the left hemisphere we would think was the only possible way we are in fact

447
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,820
if you like midwifing into existence helping to burst something that is natural something

448
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:49,060
that is nature which is that which is always about to be yeah so i want to move on a little bit and

449
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:59,140
um there's this notion this philosophical notion which i think is is true and that is that

450
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:06,740
reason i'm going to use the word reason because rationality is is associated with just like left

451
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:14,580
brain typically that reason is isomorphic to reality in the sense that there's something about

452
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:22,580
human reasoning and i'm not just talking about the brain but you can unpack this that is

453
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:31,700
isomorphic to reality such that there is the possibility for a direct attunement let's say

454
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,300
yes and um

455
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,660
and so that's the first question and if you can speak to that then there's a question just to

456
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:50,900
build after after that to kind of yes i think that's a wonderful observation and i certainly

457
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:56,180
believe this and i think i've made it myself and in a way it was what einstein was saying when he

458
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:05,620
said what is so wonderful and so unexpected is that the world is understandable why should the

459
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:12,340
world be understandable by our minds and the idea that our minds um

460
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:21,140
would evolve naturally to understand the world is not necessarily correct it might have adopted

461
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:30,260
various kind of um entirely false positions for a while um in order to deal with a certain situation

462
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:37,460
but over time our understanding of the world has increased i mean we i'm not saying that we

463
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,340
most of us in in the modern world are making the best of that fact but there is something heroic

464
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:50,820
about the degree to which over thousands of years we have come to understand more and more of the world

465
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:58,340
and the world is um as david deutch says speaking to us in english i mean he means if english is your

466
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:03,780
natural language why is it that when you approach the world the world speaks to in your own language

467
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,940
which is another way of putting einstein's remark about extraordinary fact and i think what this

468
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:18,660
gives us is the opportunity to trust what reason tells us not as you say i make this distinction

469
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,540
between it's not really one that's a core english distinction but we have to have two different

470
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:27,780
words for it one is for simply the following of rules and procedures in the way that computer

471
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,900
would and the other is tempering all that with the wisdom that comes from experience

472
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,860
the understanding of context and so on and so forth in fact what a wise judge would do you know

473
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:42,340
you're talking about wisdom and wisdom and interestingly judges are being more and more

474
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:47,380
constrained by mechanical sets of rules and procedures so that they're no longer free

475
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:54,900
to use um wisdom that they've acquired over an arduous training and and decades of experience

476
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,460
so that's what i say is that these things are naturally resonant and i do also believe the

477
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:06,900
imagination is like this and unfortunately we haven't got time to go into that enormous topic

478
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:13,060
of what is imagination but with courage and with shelling and so forth i take the imagination to

479
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:19,300
be a faculty which enables us to be in touch with reality beyond the things that we can reason about

480
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,300
it's not fantasy which takes us away from reality he makes a very strong distinction

481
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:30,820
between fantasy and imagination and imagination on the other hand is our one chance of actually

482
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:38,260
feeling our way into the inside of the world and experiencing it yeah that's that's beautiful

483
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:46,740
so my last question actually somebody asked me to tag on and that is so we have this notion that

484
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:53,700
reason is isomorphic with the world so there's a possibility for not only attunement but

485
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:01,460
yeah for deep mutuality um so the question and then is what is the relationship between

486
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:08,980
goodness and reason because it's a little hard tricky to say they're isomorphic

487
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:19,780
um well we're talking in a different way than we were about whether reason is isomorphic with

488
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:26,820
reality or perhaps even with truth i i distinguish between different kinds of meaning of truth

489
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:33,620
one being something abstract that we have an analytic past towards and we get closer and

490
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:39,540
finally we get it and a different one which is a form of attunement of coming together of meeting

491
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:46,340
of resonating a completely different kind of sense of truth and of course the word truth has

492
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:52,740
as a core this idea of being true to something of surfaces being true to one another as a carpenter

493
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:58,820
says or a couple being true to one another if they love one another so it is about a relationship

494
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:07,860
that is that is truthful and real and goodness um well all i would say is that reason is obviously

495
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:16,100
another tool that we can use in helping work out what is good but it shouldn't be the only

496
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:23,220
or the limiting tool because there is very much more to goodness than calculation and one of the

497
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:30,900
things that um i i write about in chapter 26 i think is the way in which in academe in the west

498
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,700
the philosophy of utilitarianism has more or less ousted every other kind of way of thinking about

499
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:45,220
what is naturally good and the odd thing is that what is being praised is a way of thinking which

500
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:52,900
is archetypally not good in moral to always calculate about things is is immoral and often

501
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:59,700
leads you to um horrible conclusions that it's okay to kill one person in order to um harvest

502
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:06,180
their organs and give them to five other people awaiting transplants for example so um reason

503
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:13,220
has a dual aspect as it's there often that it can be extremely helpful but if used in a rigid

504
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,420
fashion it approximates what people who are mentally ill do with it people who have frontal

505
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:24,020
they've damaged right hemisphere damage who are psychopaths and who have schizophrenia all have

506
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:31,620
in common that their idea of morality is based on rationalizing calculations whereas i hope that most

507
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:38,900
of the rest of us see it in a broader sense yeah that was the trick i think now that i now i

508
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:46,500
understand it thank you very much because what what what was the tension in his question was

509
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,740
in the assumption that goodness is utility right so that he it was like well when i'm

510
00:59:52,740 --> 01:00:00,820
reason when i reason i don't always get the good but i but that was more like he yeah so now i

511
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:09,700
understand what that tension was but when i reason and i don't get what i want it may be

512
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:16,900
the good and so then you start to see that there is the potential for more attunement between reason

513
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:23,380
and the good versus reason and then thinking of the good as a utility especially an ego

514
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:28,820
referential utility so that was that was very helpful thank you very much i knew there was a

515
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:34,420
thank you that kind of tension where there's an assumption that is yeah yeah creating the

516
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:41,780
tension in the question so yeah thank you very much thank you bonnie and um i hope you mind

517
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:47,060
if i come in yes you could you can uh i'm aware of bonnie that another question might come to you

518
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:54,420
as you're um you know watching the questions that follow um but i want to give a chance for

519
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,780
the audience to come in now um before that i just want to i want to ask you one question

520
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,900
um about something bonnie alluded to earlier vis-a-vis what's at stake here

521
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:13,700
um because we don't often flesh this out you know the source of the sense of mattering

522
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:22,260
um because you know there's a certain intuition about moral acts and our proximity about good

523
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:27,220
behavior with our peers and then our society and then you get into the health of the planet

524
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,980
you might think about the cosmos you might think about the ultimate nature of reality

525
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,940
you might even wonder about life on other planets and other forms of intelligent life as many do

526
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,020
and i say all of that because i've noticed between the two of you a sort of difference in tenor

527
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:51,220
um if i can if it's i think it's reasonable to say that in you um although there's you you

528
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:56,100
offer a great deal of uh emphasis on beauty and love and goodness and there's a great deal of

529
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:01,460
positivity in your work it's also true that you lament a great deal about the world and there's a

530
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:10,340
a certain um spirit of let's say melancholy about about how things are turning out and a sort of

531
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:16,100
urgency to to redirect things and we perceive them as the premise of your work bonnie with us

532
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,900
sense something altogether more chipper at something altogether more kind of lively and

533
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:25,620
playful and i don't know i don't want to sort of make this too personal but i am just trying to

534
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:31,780
get at this idea of you know when we what's at stake are we talking about the end of human

535
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:37,300
habitation on planet earth are we talking about um the capacity to destroy ourselves with

536
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:44,020
exponential technology are we talking about the intrinsic value of things that will be destroyed

537
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:50,500
pointlessly can you give me some sense when you this question of what's at stake both of you please

538
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,420
like what's your sense of um why we should care about any of this if i can ask such a

539
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:03,540
big context question like ultimately at the end of these searches what are we trying to protect

540
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,420
what are we trying to safeguard what is it that actually matters to you both and i think even

541
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,340
years will be more more familiar to people so i'm going to come to bonnie first

542
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:22,980
it's a great question um so for me i'm trying to say i'm trying to

543
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:33,380
say don't think what's at stake in the future don't worry about what's coming don't take what

544
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:41,220
we're saying and and draw it out in a narrative arc and figure out what's going to be left right

545
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:51,060
we just be with reality right now every single person alive is going to die is that a crisis

546
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:57,220
it's just just you know what i'm saying if i put it within all the middle crisis and everybody

547
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:04,660
will die you have a different reality to it if we put it in right here now what's at stake

548
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:15,140
is every person in this call could be deeply wedded with reality deeply feel belonging to the earth

549
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:24,980
feel the generosity of having been given a life experience the beauty of the perceptual world

550
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:32,100
um when you listen to read ian's writing on music

551
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:42,740
that people don't have those experiences anymore they completely robbed of who people are

552
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:51,620
the fantastic joy and voyage of being a human being is not present in people's lives

553
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,660
they don't know how to get to it this is what's at stake and in young people

554
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:08,660
there's a struggle because they haven't yet forgotten something

555
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:19,380
and um you know used to be when i worked with young adults going through the individuation

556
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:26,260
stage let's say their problems were like problems with the intergenerational change

557
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:32,420
between their families different how societies conventions like change now they say things like

558
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:39,380
when i was seven i felt like i was hooked up to a machine that was sucking out my blood

559
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:46,740
this is like the the metaphors that seven year olds use like it's so bad now that young people

560
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:52,900
who are still kind of like organisms and then they don't blame their parents because they're like

561
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:58,580
their parents are sucked into the machine you know they use these metaphors it's extraordinary how

562
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:08,180
poignant the lack of world living world is for them and so for me what i think what's at stake is

563
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:18,820
you know trying to connect with young people make a world for them but right here and now

564
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:28,420
all the things that you may imagine were possible are possible

565
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:37,460
as long as you're still a living breathing organism and people don't believe that anymore

566
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:46,980
thank you bonnie and um it's lovely to hear you say that i've heard you say similar things but

567
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:52,420
great to hear it again um you know makes me think of the unmaking of the world again are we to

568
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:58,100
understand that the world is inevitably being unmade that it has to be unmade for it to be

569
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,860
remade or that we're called in some sense to protect what is already made

570
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:10,420
well i think what i'm saying is is that we are in the process of unmaking the world not

571
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:16,740
that it has to and not that it can't be reversed or but that we are we're simply unmaking it

572
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:22,820
and and that's the the predicament we find ourselves in and that's not i can't just to

573
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:27,780
be clear there's some people who the reason i asked that question in that way is there are

574
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:34,500
some people who want to tear it all down you know i have met people of persuasion and are they

575
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:41,300
entirely wrong i mean how how do you see this quite simply anybody who wants to just tear down

576
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:50,180
a civilization or tear down a world is is crazy foolish arrogant and what we need to do is to

577
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:57,540
work with what is in fact as i say not a machine but an organism to change the parts that we feel

578
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:04,980
need to be changed and to respect the wholeness of it and i find myself um after your um perfectly

579
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:13,620
accurate portrayal of me as a miserable old git i find myself i find myself curiously more um

580
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:21,700
optimistic perhaps than um bonita in that uh i don't think that people lack all these things

581
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:28,580
i mean i'm i'm sure she's right that the world is a much less hospitable place than it was for

582
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:35,060
finding these things for being encouraged to to to nourish oneself on them and we're offering

583
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:42,180
children a diet of gruel and which is a great shame but but there'll always be people who

584
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:47,940
will gravitate towards the magnificence of what the you know what there is and who will see life

585
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:55,780
as you and i i think both see it as an awe-inspiring gift and and that this is a very important

586
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:02,260
way to be i i often think you know if you say what do we do and this is a famously difficult

587
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:08,820
question to answer but i was thinking that there would be some value in saying pray

588
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:16,100
and what i wouldn't mean by that is well the only thing that's left open to us now is to pray

589
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,740
and hope that there's some divine being that will change it all that's not at all what i mean

590
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:30,980
what i mean is by adopting a devout and awe-filled compassionate vision of the world not striving

591
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:38,580
to know alter take and all the rest but actually so first of all to understand is in all its awe

592
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:45,140
inspiring complexity and that if we did that a lot of things would start happening differently

593
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:51,620
because so much of what's wrong is due to simple hubris the pronouncements of people who

594
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,100
think we can do it all and only a few more tweaks and we'll be able to achieve this that and the

595
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:02,260
other well this is this is how things get destroyed it's in all the old mythologies

596
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:09,860
the the arrogant know-it-all upstart who doesn't realize what he's destroying and becomes that

597
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:17,300
demi-edge that that brings the cosmos to ruin so that that's that's my thinking about that

598
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:24,980
i'm not surprised though that you ask jonathan so what is it that is worth saving or what is it

599
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:30,260
that we're trying to save because surely the answer to that is everything that inspires in us love

600
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:38,420
and beauty and and it speaks to us of all these things that are so life-enhancing i mean you can

601
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:44,020
live in a world in which everything is is is bleak meaningless pointless i mean you can create

602
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:49,860
that for yourself but don't kid yourself that that's necessarily the reality you can also live in a

603
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:59,220
world where you are maximally responsive to what is what is good beautiful and true and and worthy

604
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:04,900
of our love and respect and and that don't get me wrong good beautiful and true there's a reason

605
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,300
we have three different words they're not interchangeable with one another they sometimes

606
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:15,140
conflict with one another but nonetheless they have this family relationship with one another

607
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,980
in which all these positives come together they don't have to be mechanically related they don't

608
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:26,580
they hasn't doesn't have to be an algorithm saying go to beauty then if this then go to good or it

609
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:33,300
just doesn't work like that i got a lot out of that answer because um you know to be maximally

610
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:38,820
responsive to the possibility of love or those weren't your words but but but paraphrasing the

611
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:46,260
idea of being maximally responsive to what is good beautiful and true um is what's at stake in some

612
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:52,020
sense and also reminds me in one back in the day at one at some seminar or event you were at

613
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,460
i once remember writing something down quickly because the turn of phrase was so beautiful when

614
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:02,100
you put it you said that life is life is a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness

615
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:07,220
and you said it off the bat as if it was one of many lines but i'd love that particular formulation

616
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:12,500
a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and tenderness with that thought i want to bring in

617
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:18,420
the others now the the technicalities of what's about to follow are not altogether trivial so

618
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:25,860
please pay attention and if you have a question you'd like to answer ask and please type it in the

619
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:31,700
chat while also putting your hand up it's a double whammy we're asking you to do both because it

620
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:37,140
helps us to find you you might think it's just self-evident but we are we do have a 380 participants

621
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,580
and we can only see them on a relatively small screen a certain number at a time so if you raise

622
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:49,300
your hand through the reactions icon i believe um or at least one of the icons down below while

623
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,100
simultaneously typing your question um in some cases we'll ask you to speak it in some cases we'll

624
01:12:54,100 --> 01:13:02,020
read it out um also let me say this quite important point um we're very keen to hear from all kinds of

625
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:10,340
people um that i mean men and women i mean young and old um and so if if you're in any doubt about

626
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:16,740
answering asking a question um can i particularly encourage you to do so if you're feeling that

627
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:21,780
you're somewhat uncomfortable or not too sure if you should um we're very keen to get from here from

628
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:28,260
a wider variety of people as possible and we'll do everything we can to make that happen okay with

629
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:34,100
that thought in mind i'm going to look at the google doc that michael has helpfully prepared for me

630
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:42,180
um and i'll take a take one and while you're asked while you're answering i'll look for others

631
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,420
okay um

632
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:58,580
um the questions so far are very technical um but actually there's one here from jane's van

633
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:04,340
leuwen which i think is a good one it's a direct message he says um and this comes to the premise

634
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:12,340
of tonight's talk is there a root mass delusion um is there something is there some i think that

635
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:17,780
it's i understand the question he's trying to get a um is there something inherent like a premise

636
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:26,500
or an axiom or a fundamental part of the delusion that we need to take stock of collectively

637
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,380
and if so what is it and that's initially a question for ian while i look through the other questions

638
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:42,820
well i i suppose that um i would say inevitably that the there is a core

639
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:52,340
mass delusion which is indoctrination into the vision of the world which is delivered to us by

640
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:59,060
the left hemisphere untempered or relatively untempered by the right and so which is one

641
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:08,260
orientated towards um greed gain power i mean effectively it's about power and control

642
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:16,180
and it's lost intellectual subtlety because the left hemisphere doesn't have much intellectual

643
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:23,300
subtlety and is literally less intelligent than the right it also has no nowhere near

644
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:31,700
the understanding of social and emotional matters of intelligence and so inevitably once this

645
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:39,300
this way of thinking becomes the standard way in which all discourses is carried on in the public

646
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:47,300
sphere and children are brought up no longer to believe in or take pleasure in all the the beautiful

647
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:53,380
things that are now associated with the past because we've now moved into this brave new world

648
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:59,220
where we we have technical machines we don't need to read literature and look at painting and listen

649
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:08,260
to music and do drama and all the other things or for goodness sake develop some kind of spiritual

650
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:17,380
sense of something beyond you know that's if we're like that then that is it is a mass delusion

651
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:26,660
which will lead to great unhappiness conflict and and destruction the destruction of the valuable

652
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:34,180
that's what i see around me people at loggerheads much more than they were um 30 years ago interestingly

653
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:40,660
the relationships between all the societal groups that are now so strictly policed and and and

654
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:47,060
boundaryed and so on have become worse rather than better through this process so anyway there we are

655
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,420
okay thank you bonnie do you have a direct answer to that question or should we take some more

656
01:16:52,420 --> 01:17:03,620
questions i think that um if you want to think of root um causes or or the root problem i think

657
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:11,460
it's one of fragmentation in alienation at all scales so um the the left hemisphere wants to

658
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:18,420
analytical analytically reduce something to study it and so it feels fragmented and separated

659
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:27,300
we feel that matter is different than life and in a kind of alienated way we feel that humans

660
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,700
are separate from nature we feel individualistic we feel our countries are separate and sovereign

661
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:40,420
so this whole notion i guess the left brain thinks it's separate from the right brain i would say

662
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:47,540
that the lack and loss of any kind of sense of understanding a deep continuity at all levels

663
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:55,780
vertical and um vertical dimensions and horizontal dimensions uh could characterize the

664
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:01,540
the sum total of the problem okay thank you bonnie i'd like to see a question from lisa

665
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:07,460
maros maroski if i said that correctly lisa you're welcome to ask it yourself but yeah there you go

666
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:16,020
hi uh thank you for hosting these wonderful talks i've really enjoyed them um the context

667
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:25,140
for my question um to to both of you is imagine is the imagination so i'm not really looking for

668
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:34,180
a factual response um but given uh as you've said that the world is an organism

669
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:45,860
and yet is being unmade uh are there models such as uh the caterpillar becoming butterfly that

670
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:59,380
uh barbremark's hubbert refers to um that uh you know show us um or could help us understand what is

671
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:10,660
what is happening to us um help us get through this process of unmaking and remaking um and

672
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:24,100
and then second to that what might be we what might we be remade into like as the next phase

673
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:33,620
of evolution um my my own hunch is that endosymbiosis might give us a clue um but not the answer

674
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:42,580
so so this is an imaginative question thank you very much and bonnie i know you might have an

675
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:48,340
angle on the butterfly uh caterpillar metaphor from a piece of writing that i'm familiar with

676
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,140
um ian if you have any thoughts initially

677
01:19:54,740 --> 01:20:04,340
well um the the caterpillar butterfly flightings is is extraordinary in in nature and as we know

678
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:09,700
the butterfly actually has a completely different genome from the caterpillar so what one's seeing

679
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:17,540
there is a transmogrification what um what i think i'm being asked to do is to say what this

680
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:25,140
butterfly is going to be like and um how we can bring about its release and and i first of all

681
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:32,500
what it what it is like i will be extremely cautious in predicting because i do believe

682
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:40,420
that one of the glories of existence is that things are not determined fully and that we when

683
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:48,100
we predict the future we are very often wrong so i i i would resist being asked to make any

684
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:53,860
prediction about that i mean although i have my own hunches which are limited by my imagination

685
01:20:53,860 --> 01:21:02,500
which are that probably some people will survive and will survive by leading much more simple

686
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:08,820
modest lives closer to nature and closer to one another than our human lives have become

687
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:16,020
um so i i i don't know quite how to exercise the imagination that you are asking me to exercise

688
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:22,180
except that i guess that my books are i hope works of an imagination and that i appeal

689
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:29,060
to many great works of art and literature to illustrate my my drift but i i think i'm not

690
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:34,900
entirely in tune with the the drift behind that there's a little thrust behind that question

691
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,300
thank you ian and bonnie i want you to answer this because i know you've got a great take on

692
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:43,460
this but while i'm doing that if celeste flavan could put her hand up please because i want to

693
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:48,820
take your question but we can't find you um after this but bonnie first of all on uh

694
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:56,260
caterpillar butterfly and what lies between yeah i'll start with that but i wanted to answer

695
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:04,660
the question also in a larger context so um we and i think this is a little bit

696
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:10,580
building on what ian said is that we can't we we shouldn't imagine that the caterpillar

697
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:16,580
imagines itself to be a butterfly it's much more scary than that right like if we if we

698
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:24,900
had to voluntarily go through the metamorphosis process without understanding it um that would

699
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:35,220
truly be an act of imagination um to be to be open and welcome and inviting surprise um but you

700
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:40,900
said something beautiful you talked about endo i think endo symbiosis and what i wanted to say

701
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:48,740
is there's many places where people are using their imaginations to thread a different story

702
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:58,260
through the scientific facts so ian uses scientific facts any any threads a beautiful

703
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:05,940
story and other people can use the same facts and they'll thread a different story um and so we need

704
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:13,060
all all science is based on what are called interaction metaphors they're deep metaphorical

705
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:21,700
um assumptions about the way things are and what we need are people who are uh understand the science

706
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:29,860
and using it to thread a different story um and so that actually separates i think imagination

707
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:36,180
from fantasy so that's that's one thing and the work on counterfactuals is very important so

708
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:44,340
you might say but what if what if the Darwinian attitude of the survival of the fittest

709
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:52,260
and complex adaptive systems is not true is there a story that threads the same evidence

710
01:23:53,540 --> 01:24:01,780
that is more aligned with goodness truth and beauty so i've done that in writing speculative

711
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:08,260
philosophy on complex potential states it takes into account everything that the Darwinian attitude

712
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:15,460
takes into account but it tells a different story so endosymbiosis is one of those great

713
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:22,340
imaginative things that are emerging in our culture that want to be true to the science

714
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:28,500
but understand that there's a different story that can thread it and that's a power the

715
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:34,660
imagination and the other thing i'm going to say that is something that i think is

716
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:42,260
we should do i see there's a question of education um there's something called empathic projection

717
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:48,740
and kids do it really well when they're young and that is they imagine what it might be like

718
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:55,780
to be a pencil and they imagine what it might be like to be an ant and they imagine and in this

719
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:03,540
experience it's not like fantasy where you go away from the world you enter the spaces in

720
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:15,860
between the world that you don't understand and this is a valuable exercise in um in becoming

721
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:24,180
attuned to the reality of things and nature and animals so it's the process of the imagination

722
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:29,860
it's called empathic projection thank you bonnie i'm just going to get other questions in um

723
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:34,020
celeste you're welcome to ask it yourself if you're happy to do that i think we find you now

724
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:47,460
can we hear you i'm not sure we can hear you i can see you but maybe your volume's not on or

725
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:54,420
what's the shall i just ask it for you are you ready to go yeah okay thumbs up okay i can ask

726
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,540
it for you well thank you celeste it was really a question about poetry i'll i'll it's to do with

727
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:05,540
precision of language being a kind of antidote i'm going to get the exact wording here um

728
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:13,140
what celeste asked here we go can language especially that which is used with extraordinary

729
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:20,260
deliberation and care i.e poetry be an antidote to this wide-scale delusion can we use the tool

730
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:27,140
that makes us feel tethered to our humaneness to combat feelings of robotic or uninsuitive

731
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:33,860
existence so you can already see the poet in the question um i'm assuming the answer might be yes

732
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:41,060
but what's the what's the sort of bigger answer it's very much yes i i would say um

733
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:48,980
and it's interesting this idea of the carefully considered uh or precise because of course

734
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:57,460
both here and in science there is this interplay between the the precise and the imaginative which

735
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:04,900
which means that although in science you're working with something that seems very strict

736
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:10,820
in its structure in fact the discoveries come through the exercise of intuition and imagination

737
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:16,980
there's just so many examples of this in the history of mathematics and science and something similar

738
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:23,780
um could be said of course about poetry but what i was alerted to by your question was the idea

739
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,460
there's a certain sort of precision involved as well and that we need to be precise

740
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:35,380
as the situation will allow us to be but not a wit more than that

741
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:43,620
otherwise there is a word that is precisely right because it opens itself to a number of

742
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:50,100
possibilities being experienced or felt at the same time so the great thing about poetic language

743
01:27:50,100 --> 01:28:00,740
is its ability to be single and multiple at once this is really a theme that should be throughout

744
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:09,300
everything we've talked about this evening that i feel at some points there was a tendency to say

745
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:16,580
that you know it's bad that there are individuals um but i'm sure that wasn't what was was was meant

746
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:23,220
by bonita um but but individuals are terrifically important what's important is that the distinction

747
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:33,780
and the um um the differences don't imply a severance in fact they imply a something bigger

748
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:39,860
out of which they come and to which they contribute in turn so it's always this alliance of division

749
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:48,180
with union of the individuation with togetherness and integration and so i would say that poetry is

750
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:54,580
an example of this because in poetry we are trying to bring together or not trying but

751
01:28:54,580 --> 01:29:00,420
allowing things that are multiple to come together in our minds in a very clear and

752
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:06,020
precise way that if you've changed a little bit of it would ruin it so it has a very individual

753
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:12,820
existence but it arises from a process which is unconscious and which is about the coming together

754
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:19,700
of the many into the one thank you ian bonita don't have to add to that if you don't want to

755
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:26,340
but you're welcome to okay i am i know it's a beautiful answer but there's a lot of questions

756
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:33,860
thank you bonita i'm madalina machado a great question you're welcome to ask it yourself

757
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:38,980
or give me a thumbs up if you're happy for me to ask it but you're welcome to you i'd rather you

758
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,740
asked it much rather you asked it you can do it yeah so you're unmuted now you're welcome to go ahead

759
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:55,780
well um i'm i'm actually quoting gregory baitson he says this question what have we here um 400

760
01:29:55,780 --> 01:30:03,300
plus people on a zoom call is this not radically new what sense does it make to speak of what we've

761
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:11,940
lost does this mostly apply to accidentals and a cosmo vision of domination which is now

762
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:20,420
eroding is it not about time we learn planetary interdependency for the first time together

763
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:27,460
as online ancestors because we're all online ancestors this is basically 10 years old

764
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:35,460
this duality of technology versus life is manachistic nothing on this planet is not natural

765
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:44,660
there's nothing not natural as spinoza said the 24 years old 400 years ago with the printing press

766
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:51,380
we began propaganda propaganda pd that was the Vatican now we are in a participatory age for

767
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:57,780
the first time ever can we give ourselves permission not to know and honestly this is what

768
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:07,700
i feel bonita is teaching at the pop-up school which i've joined and it has for me for example

769
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:15,220
i'll just add one little footnote in the two p language in the amazon there's no word for sin

770
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:23,700
there's no word for temptation there's no word for kingdom i mean what would our language

771
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:35,540
be languaging had those concepts not you know abducted our capacity to think differently

772
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:43,460
thank you wow well i would love to ask you some questions medelina another time maybe

773
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:45,380
but for now ian do you want to respond to that

774
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,100
bonnie you ian if you want to pause for some thought bonnie do you have a more immediate

775
01:31:54,100 --> 01:32:01,700
response yeah because i i think it ties into the previous question on poesis so she so medelina

776
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:10,020
is saying what would our language be like and i think um you know there's poetic language

777
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:21,380
is a contemplation on ideas or things that language seems to contradict right so how can

778
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:29,140
everything already be nature and is nature then destroying itself is nature unmaking the world

779
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:35,140
is like the question if everything's nature then isn't this just make nature unmaking the world

780
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:42,100
and i think this kind of tension if you sit with it in a certain way so you so you have

781
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:51,860
both trust and doubt and belief and skepticism and confidence in the in the intellect the

782
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:59,060
intelligence of the world and humility then something like poetry comes out and we might

783
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:05,780
imagine that that's something that shares with earlier languages so i would say that

784
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:11,220
that's that's how it seemed to me that as the question came up right after the last question

785
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:22,340
ian i wasn't really quite sure what the question was i i heard that we that we were in a more

786
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:27,860
positive way we could communicate with one another and so on then there was a sudden remark about

787
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:33,060
the word sin which by the way not only in the toupee language but also across many parts of

788
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:42,180
the world there isn't such a word um but what am i supposed to okay if i if i dare give my own

789
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:46,980
interpretation the reason i chose medellina's question it it actually was it was it reminded

790
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:52,580
me of a colleague and friend idra adnan who was on a zoom call a bit like this one with several

791
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,900
hundred people from across the world and one of the speakers was lamenting how disconnected we

792
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:00,660
all are all were how how we've lost connection with each other and she's saying what the hell

793
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:04,900
are you talking about look at this extraordinary process that we're part of who knows where this

794
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,700
might lead this is the beginning of something amazing and we should all get over ourselves and

795
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:15,140
stop complaining and start using the technology we have to you know reckon with the no doubt

796
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:21,300
profound problems we have um but also to trust that something is emerging that's of great value

797
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,940
and promise um and as i understand medellina's question i think she's just using that as a

798
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:31,220
counterweight to the sense that the things are inevitably collapsing something is also arising

799
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:39,860
that that is right and if we could find a way of using the interconnecting capacity sparingly

800
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:46,820
when it is really important and not allowing all the dross that comes with it to drown out the good

801
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:53,700
then that would be a marvelous thing but i remember when i went to johns hopkins in in 1922

802
01:34:55,860 --> 01:35:05,780
1922 1992 i'm not that in 1992 um we were i was in a in a in a lab um looking at scans

803
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:13,940
of brains and the head of the department came in and said you guys are great you know work you're

804
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:20,580
doing is great but you know what we need is more communication and i was already aware that in

805
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:28,980
england had started this sort of over communicative style and in america it was already a huge problem

806
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:35,300
people spent so much time um recording communicating and so on that the actual business of what they

807
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:41,220
were doing got somehow left behind and i said actually what we need is to communicate less

808
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:47,140
but to communicate when it's really important so i do think this is a i'm not saying this just to be

809
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:55,220
sort of a bit flippant um there is a huge problem with what technology is doing to our attention

810
01:35:55,220 --> 01:36:01,140
it is it is fighting for our attention which has been monetized and destroying our attention

811
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:07,220
is destroying our intelligence destroying our capacity to imagine it is degrading at the level

812
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:13,700
of our experience and the being so this is a worry to me i i love the fact that we're all

813
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:21,620
here on this call and so it's best to focus on the good bits and um but but there are mighty

814
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:28,260
problems as well and and and also i'd just like to say in the way that the coincidence of opposites

815
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:34,580
works is that if there is too much cacophony and too much actually people fall out with one another

816
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:40,660
and don't actually become closer to one another it's a really difficult one to to call that life

817
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:46,980
is complex it's not just a simple question of there being more or less communication what is

818
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:53,220
the quality of that communication is a very important question can i just follow up i think

819
01:36:53,220 --> 01:37:00,820
i think to put it short i think um i think communication like this is neither necessary

820
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:10,740
nor sufficient for to to stop the unmaking of the world and so when but it can be helpful or it

821
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:17,860
can be harmful but to think that it's either necessary or sufficient i think is is both of

822
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:26,500
those are a mistake um and i agree with you and the the the the cost in general is currently

823
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:34,420
out outweighing the benefit the new the new chipper non-hyperaclitian ian says um well it's

824
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:41,140
it's not um uh sufficient but it might might be necessary to have these sorts of conversations

825
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:49,140
but i mean technology technology yeah okay well i i do like the i do like the chipper ian as you

826
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:55,300
know um listen um there were i can i encourage everyone here to please take a look at the chat

827
01:37:56,020 --> 01:38:00,100
um because there are some mind-blowingly good questions in there and i'm really very grateful

828
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:07,300
for all of them um back in the day when i worked at the rsa i um i chaired quite a lot of events

829
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:12,020
and before i started doing that matthew taylor who was the chief executive at the time taught me

830
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:17,140
that it's always better to end an event leaving people wanting more rather than drag on with

831
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:22,180
further questions even though there are great questions to come so i'm going to leave leave

832
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:26,580
you with that thought and end now um i'm very grateful for all the questions that haven't been

833
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:32,180
aired but they are there in the chat you can write them down we will take note of them they

834
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:37,540
may come up again i notice some about education about parenting about love great stuff there will

835
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:44,660
be more there will be another of these events um in two weeks and another two weeks after that and

836
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:50,180
another two weeks after that watch this space for more information um there's also a connection

837
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:55,060
and inquiry session as i say um those of those of you on this event will now be signed up the

838
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:59,700
perspective as mailing list so you will hear from us about all of those things very shortly

839
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:04,260
but i really want to just thank you all for being there it's been a great attendance

840
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:11,700
and some lovely questions um and i'm very well particularly grateful to bonita roy for beaming

841
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:17,620
in from kinetic it to in the go chris of course for beaming in from sky um and i just want to

842
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:23,540
thank you all for coming and i hope you'll come back and bring your friends so uh with that thought
