1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,560
Metacrisis is the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:46,480
persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriing of reality. It arises from the

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,800
material and spiritual exhaustion of modernity. It is a multifaceted delusion. It is the crisis

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,680
within, between, and beyond our existing conceptual crisis, and it manifests institutionally and

6
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:12,920
culturally to the detriment of life on earth. The Metacrisis is something about our relationship

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,040
to all of the crises in the world. So it's reflexive, it's inherently reflexive, it's about

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,840
talking through, thinking through, how does human nature relate to this thing. Now, that's quite

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,120
distinct from polycrisis, or permanent crisis, or all these other terms. What's different about

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,160
Metacrisis is it acknowledges human interiority and relationality as a fundamental part of the

11
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,960
problem, or the problematic, I should say. The other way of looking at Metacrisis, and there are

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,480
many actually, but you can see it as the sign that modernity is ending. And so this expression of

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,760
Zack Stein's time between worlds, that we're in a time between worlds captures that. And it's

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,000
because we're in a time between worlds that things don't make sense, things begin to break

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,280
down. And this is where, again, you can get into Jean Gebster's notion of the mental rational

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,400
function, breaking down, which in plain language is intellectually we're not up to it anymore. The

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,760
intellectual function is not succeeding in making sense of the world. The world is eclipsing or

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,120
going beyond our capacity to make sense of it. And these are all signs that our existing form of

19
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,640
consciousness is somehow in need of evolution, in need of growing in some way. But I also think

20
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Meta's kind of alive. I think there's a kind of participatory knowing of the Metacrisis. When

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,880
you put it as a proposition, and say define the Metacrisis, it becomes one more concept,

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,040
a million concepts. The Metacrisis is your daily experience of a world falling apart. It's your

23
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,000
incredulity towards how weird everything's becoming. Both the kind of rapid technological growth,

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,680
and the combination of synthetic biology and AI and virtual reality, changing the life world. And

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,840
then you have things like gene editing and so on that are actually changing life as such. And then

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,920
you have maybe a new phase of geological time. The academics are still arguing about it. But for

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
all intents and purposes, the whole of scene has ended. The stable geological period that has lasted

28
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,960
many thousands of years is now unstable. And we're entering uncharted territory. And you can see

29
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:27,640
that in the planetary boundary framework very clearly. But you can also feel it. The quick

30
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,240
definition would be something like the Metacrisis is all the crisis put together, right? And people

31
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,240
go, Oh, I see, I see. But they don't see, right? Because it's not really the end of it. That's

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,520
just the beginning of the conversation. The Metacrisis is also in the way you make sense of the

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,720
world, the way you feel it and in a mode in relation to it. The Metacrisis is in your incapacitated,

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:59,920
fully articulate and narrate the self in this context. And the Metacrisis is also, you know,

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,920
co extensive with co arising with this particular historical epoch. So it's not as though there

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,240
haven't been Metacrisis before. I mean, arguably, the time of Christ was a kind of Metacrisis. If

37
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,080
you think about an occupying Roman Empire, a kind of religious fervor people waiting for, you know,

38
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,320
Messiah, and then this person appears apparently doing miracles. Everyone's totally confused, right?

39
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Just as we are kind of now. So one of many examples where it's not like we haven't had historical

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,800
turbulence before. Is there something distinct about today? Yes, that we're actually destroying our

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,640
only home. Our one precious planet in the infinite regions of space is under threat, not of annihilation

42
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,120
necessarily, but of being in a habitat for human life. That's in question now. The forms of

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,800
technology developing so rapidly that you can get into a world of autonomous weapons that really

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,160
can cause massive destruction. So what's different today is the degree of risk to the planet as a

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:13,240
whole. That's one distinct feature of the Metacrisis. But arguably we had this with nuclear weapons as

46
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,320
well. So it's different. But at the same time, I like to speak of the Metacrisis in a way that

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,120
doesn't just leave you dazed and confused, and looking as a passive subject at a kind of unfamiliar

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,560
object saying, that there is the Metacrisis. What do I do? That's not the way to go. The Metacrisis is

49
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,040
our historical inheritance. We're born into this. It's this generation that perceives it and feels

50
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,240
it. It's the set of cards we have to play. It's not something we can fix. The problem with the

51
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,240
crisis framing is that it's still a kind of tacit problem solution mentality. That would be

52
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,400
misunderstanding the nature of the Metacrisis. What's going on is a very slow historical process

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,080
that's culminating in a certain way and beginning to transform into something else. The nature of

54
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,600
what it transforms into will depend whether we survive and thrive or collapse. I believe about 90%

55
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,040
of what I just said. But there's another part of me that says, are we sure this is the time between

56
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,480
worlds? Is modernity really ending? If I told Elon Musk or Sam Altman that modernity is ending,

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,640
they'd just laugh at me, right? So I'm thinking of the other side saying, modernity is not ending.

58
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,880
What are you talking about? It's just taking off. If anything, technology is going to radically

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,040
change the world and solve a lot of these problems. Now, I don't feel that. It's not how I'm politically,

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,360
socially, culturally, intellectually oriented, but it's possible. It's possible that you solve

61
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,360
something like nuclear fusion and have abundant energy. It's conceivable that a lot of the

62
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,800
illnesses that lead us to suffer and die will be dealt with. It's conceivable that the powers that

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,120
be that somehow at the moment seems so cut off from the rest of the world will be in some sense

64
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,920
democratized and brought back into the fold such that the great benefits that are currently accruing

65
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,920
in a very small number of people are shared more widely and people might insist on that. So I'm

66
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:32,280
not sort of predisposed to feel that collapse is sort of absolutely necessary. On the other hand,

67
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,800
I do feel a kind of collapse is underway. And the challenge for us is collapse is underway. What

68
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,560
does a transformative response to collapse look like? But look, I say this in a kitchen in a

69
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,320
suburb of Landa, living quite a full, healthy life in a safe, democratic, more or less country.

70
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,800
So there's a lot of incredulity here. There's a lot of dissonance, confusion that we live as if

71
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,040
living a normal life while watching the news in our pocket, the kind of planet in our pocket that

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,000
says everything's falling apart. And yet we go to the shop and we buy our milk and we walk back home

73
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,680
as if things are normal. So that's kind of the Metacrisis too. It's the experience of

74
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,240
confusion that's now baked into our lives as we hear about a world collapsing on the news and on

75
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:40,120
our phones, but often live as if life could carry on forever. I was formed as many, many millions

76
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,440
of people were with a notion of what normal looks like. And a lot of what's going on is a kind of

77
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,240
clamouring to get normal back, like solve these problems, you know, like make them make democracy

78
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,680
stronger, make the market work, but just get rid of the environmental externalities. You know,

79
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,320
yes, there's problems with, you know, mass immigration, but surely we can just build more

80
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,280
houses and, you know, there's a kind of notion that make do and mend is enough, right? But many

81
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,920
don't feel that in their hearts, right? Many feel this is something altogether different.

82
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,600
Now, I think what's going on in our kind of community in our world is that most people are

83
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,200
reading the position and seeing that the make do and mend story doesn't doesn't sound like it's

84
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:36,280
true. It seems very unlikely. It seems more likely that they'll either be in the next years,

85
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:43,040
decades, hard to say exactly how quickly, but forms of dissolution and collapse in various

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,480
parts of the world, you know, you're already seeing people dying of heat deaths and people

87
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,520
losing their homes to floods and forest fires. And we don't, we haven't really seen AI biting

88
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,920
properly yet on the labor market, but that will begin to happen. And we see deep fakes

89
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,480
affecting democratic elections. And that will happen more like the Nobel Prize winner Maria

90
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,160
Ressa feels that 2024 will be the last year of proper democratic elections, because she sees the

91
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,520
problem of these technologies basically, you can't trust public opinion that the notion of

92
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,640
universal suffrage is compromised by the fact that the information stream is polluted with

93
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,720
falsehoods. And so the legitimacy that underpins democracy is in question, right? And so you get

94
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,360
problems with authoritarianism and so on. If that seems confusing, it's because it is. It's

95
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,080
because all these things are happening at once. Most people in our sector of the internet and our

96
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:48,200
sort of world feel intuitively that something deeper is going on. And we look to history sometimes

97
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,400
to see what is this like? What kind of transition is this like? And there are many ways of doing it,

98
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,000
but one would be the Axial Age. One would just say there was a moment in time about give or

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,640
take 500 years before Christ, where there was the early signs of systematic thought,

100
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,520
that we sort of moved out of a kind of mythos into a kind of logos, where we began to actually have

101
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:24,680
sort of reason and writing. And we would turn from a barter economy to money and there was a

102
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,520
move towards the cities away from the country. And in our consciousness, the sort of notion of the

103
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,200
individual was kind of born. And then at this time, Buddha appeared and Lao Tzu and so on,

104
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,760
and many of the Greek philosophers. And around that time, it was as if the whole world, although

105
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,360
it wasn't evenly spread, developed a new kind of consciousness. And I think a lot of people in my

106
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,160
world feel something else like that as happening. And it's a very audacious, somewhat absurd thing

107
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:04,040
to think. But it roughly is what I think. It feels more true than that we can muddle through with

108
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,560
the existing framework. So when people ask me what I'm doing sometimes, because I did a lot of work

109
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,480
on climate change, I have a lot of contacts in that world. And they're working on, you know,

110
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,040
getting the government to sign up to net zero by 2030 or whatever the latest thing is. And I'm like,

111
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,960
well, you can do that if you like. But I think something altogether deeper is happening. And

112
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,800
you're not likely to succeed that way. I place more hope in a fundamental transformation of

113
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,560
consciousness than I do in dealing with things with the institutional and cultural structure we

114
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,960
have now. It's worth saying a bit more about Time Between Worlds, because it's, like I say,

115
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:50,680
the expression was first mooted in a book titled by Zachary Stein called Education in a Time

116
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Between Worlds. And the term is very charming. And so people use it as a shorthand for this

117
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,960
period of time. But it's important to understand that it has precursors. So in sociology, particularly

118
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,120
in Gramsci, there's this notion of the interregnum, where one thing has ended, but the next thing

119
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:18,240
hasn't yet been born. In anthropology, there's the notion of the liminal, which is really

120
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
fascinating for our community. Because what it is to be in the liminal is for an ethnographer,

121
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,440
who is from one culture, let's say a regular Western culture, goes into a tribal context or

122
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,240
an indigenous context. And he's trying to do deep ethnographic work. So he's trying to sort of

123
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,760
live like them with them, observe them, participate or observation. But there's a period of time

124
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,040
when they're neither, they're so ensconced in that world that they almost forget what it was like

125
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,160
to be in the prior world. But they're not yet one of them. And that's what they mean by liminal

126
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,720
anthropology. And in some ways, that's how a lot of our community is. It's like we don't

127
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,680
entirely belong to the world as it is now, although we're still part of it. And yet there

128
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,760
isn't really another thing that we're fully belonging in. So we're in this in between phase.

129
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,840
The other thing to say about time between worlds is it's not just a poetic soundbite. There's

130
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,880
quite a lot of empirical work underpinning it. So Immanuel Wallerstein's world system dynamics

131
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,400
is one of these sources. And that's to do with understanding the world system as trade flows.

132
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,720
And it's actually a very political analysis. It's to do with the exploitation of the poor world

133
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,680
by the rich world. And following the pattern of that over time, and seeing that it lacks durability,

134
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,120
that it will inevitably collapse. And then you have work by people like Peter Turchin to do a

135
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
secular psycho theory. It's some similar theory of history. He sometimes calls it cleodynamics,

136
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
which is the sort of quantitative history of looking at past patterns and seeing how they repeat

137
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,200
today, and measuring things like income inequality, and autocratic governance, and so on. And

138
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,480
beginning to sort of do a quantitative measure when this number of things happen, things fall

139
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,680
apart. So the time between worlds is not just a feeling. There's also a kind of empirical

140
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,360
underpinning to it. And at its heart, there's an analysis of modernity. And what the hell is

141
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,760
that, right? I'm not sure I can adequately describe modernity, but Habermas speaks of it as an

142
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,480
orientation towards the future. And a big part of what's happening in our world is, people are not

143
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,280
so sure about the future. It's not clear where the ship is sailing, where we're going, right? So

144
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,760
to be in a time between worlds in that sense, and the reason some people call it meta-modern,

145
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,640
is that if the orientation to the future and the progress narrative is a big part of what

146
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,080
modernity is about, first of all, we can't see the future very clearly. And if anything,

147
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,120
we're a bit wary of it. And secondly, it's not at all clear its progress. It might well be regress.

148
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,880
And that's why it's between worlds. And then you also have, though, rather than just the world is

149
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
me, everything's falling apart. There are these wellsprings of renewal. You know, there are these

150
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,800
people doing different things, like I'm thinking here of maybe Joe Brewer, who's currently trying to

151
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,680
get a river back to life in Bari-Chara, Colombia. And that's exciting because he's kind of given up

152
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,240
on the nation state. He's like, we need to start building the biorhegional hubs. And then there

153
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,040
are many biorhegions around the world. If more people start to work around biorhegions, you might

154
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,120
find a new form of governance emerging. Then you have this notion of like cosmolocalism, which

155
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,400
is something to do with being wise about your production patterns, so that if something is very

156
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,800
heavy to transport, you don't transport it. You use it locally. But also, it's more philosophically,

157
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,280
it's kind of like you focus locally on your niche and your immediate needs in your community. But

158
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,440
you're connected to this much bigger cosmological framework because of the internet. And you have

159
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,960
other ideas, you know, there's ontological mutiny. It's a term of biocomalaphism, that we somehow

160
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,160
have to just break out of this kind of collective illusion that we're part of. My colleague,

161
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,520
Evo Mensch also speaks about this. He jokes that we're collectively living a life that no longer

162
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,640
exists. And a lot of us feel that way. When Bonita has work on complex potential states, something to

163
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,680
do with inshooting potentials, quite a Taoist go with the energy kind of notion. So it's not as

164
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,840
though there's no ideas. It's not as though no one has any idea what happens next. But if you look

165
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,240
at scale, in terms of where the power is, who has power now, particularly technological power, it

166
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,520
is daunting. And it takes quite a lot of courage and resilience, not to just give in to despair.

167
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,080
I came across it through my friend Zachary Stein, and I think he worked on it with Mark

168
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,800
Gaffney. And it's to do with what they call the stations of the self. And it's not really a

169
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,080
developmental theory, but it's more a way of describing a sort of existential interiority of

170
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,480
the human being as it goes through life. And the stages are roughly pre-tragic, tragic, and

171
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,920
post-tragic. Pre-tragic is something like we can fix every problem. Everything's going to be okay.

172
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,520
Don't don't fixate on your worries. Everything will work out in the end. We can do it kind of

173
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,200
in our mentality. So arguably a lot of techno optimism is pre-tragic. It's sort of like not

174
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,960
really contending with just how compromise everything already is. The tragic though is to be

175
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:44,360
lost and broken by despair. The tragic is to be unable to function because you're so thoroughly

176
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,560
depressed when everything seems to be going wrong. But the problem is tragic as you get stuck in

177
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,000
them, completely stuck in them. And the claim here is that it's not that it's better to be

178
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,880
post-tragic as such, but just there is also a state of sort of sensibility available to us that

179
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,440
doesn't have the pre-tragic. Nothing's wrong. Everything will be fine. But nor is it lost forever

180
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:19,440
in the kind of the implosion of the tragic. It reclaims the agency of the pre-tragic informed by

181
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,840
the understanding of the tragic to live in a way that recognizes that suffering and pain is an

182
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:35,080
endemic feature of life. Humans screw things up all the time. We can't help it almost. I believe

183
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,920
one of the better definitions of sin for what it's worth is from Francis Spufford. He calls it

184
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,160
the human propensity to fuck things up. And it's a real feature of human life. So the post-tragic

185
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,040
recognizes that as something that we can't escape. There will be no Eden as such. There will still

186
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,760
be wars. There will still be sociopaths. There will still be narcissists. There'll still be corruption.

187
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,560
And yet you don't collapse and despair because of that, because it's not really your work to do to

188
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,760
solve that. That's baked into reality as the oppositional principles that gives rise to creative

189
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,080
possibilities and so on. What the post-tragic's about is rediscovering the beauty on the other side

190
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,320
of the suffering, to see that somehow the soul is formed through those contests, those battles.

191
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:39,840
At scale things are so bad we have to rethink. That's where it comes into structures of consciousness

192
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:49,520
because reason is powerful and good. Science, when it's working well, is important. And we shouldn't

193
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,400
wish these things away. But what is true, and I think Paul Marshall does a particularly good job

194
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,000
at this in his book, Complex Integral Realism, he speaks about the biases of the modern mind.

195
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,160
And what he's doing there is fleshing out Jean Gebster's notion of the evolution of consciousness

196
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,720
and the mind in its mental rational function breaking down and he's spelling it out. And he

197
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:22,080
speaks about the various kinds of biases, but the essence of it, the way he sums it up, is that the

198
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,520
modern mind got very good at standing back. Again, the term poly crisis, it's all standing back

199
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:36,880
and looking at it. But it lost its way in terms of looking within, which is more about the depth

200
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,960
of the psyche, the deep interior. And it lost its way in terms of let's say cosmo vision and

201
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:51,080
metaphysics. It stopped asking, what are our assumptions about the fabric of reality? And those

202
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,400
two moves, the looking within and looking beyond, are the other two meanings of meta, which is why

203
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,680
I think metacrisis is the term to use, because that's the work we have to do. It's like, what is

204
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,160
inside the imaginal realm? What is the psyche? How do we know it better? How do we live through it

205
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,840
so that we have less need of consumer durables to live well, that we don't need to meet our

206
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:22,720
emotional needs by buying something new necessarily. And at the same time, the sort of broadly liberal

207
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,680
imaginary that says, have your religion if you want, but keep it out of the public realm as far

208
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:36,360
as you can, doesn't seem to be working very well. It would appear that we need a view of the world

209
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:48,920
that is altogether more enchanted, more profoundly, I think, personal. It's not like anything goes.

210
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,440
It's not like you surrender your intellect or surrender your critical faculties. It's just

211
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,560
that you realize that the story you've been told about material reality, cause and consequence,

212
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,240
space and time, it's less than the full story. And because it's less than the full story, with

213
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,200
all due discernment, with all due care, with all due critical caution, be open to the possibility

214
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,160
that the world is radically different from the one you imagined. So when I have something like a

215
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,200
serendipity or a feeling that the universe is somehow talking to me, I can explain it away,

216
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:35,200
but I prefer not to. And I don't have to. The universe may well be enchanted and there may well

217
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,560
be a form of relationship between the cosmos and us that we need to reconnect with and at scale and

218
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:50,320
quickly so that the major collective action problems we face feel different and they feel

219
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,240
different not just to the niche people who are complaining, but to the powers that be as well.

220
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,560
You can't really know. So in the absence of not being able to know with certainty,

221
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,040
do you opt for a kind of conventional view of how things are

222
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:19,040
that is still culturally hegemonic? Or do you venture out into other ways of knowing that seem

223
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,040
less socially validated, but perhaps more emotionally rewarding and credible?

224
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,640
And personally, I do the latter. But I do think it's delicate because you could have psychosis,

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,840
the mental structure could just collapse and I have schizophrenia in my family.

226
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,360
I don't want to wish away the mental structures lightly. I'm very happy for sanity and reason.

227
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,600
It's just that I also feel that the world is much more than we've been led to believe.

228
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,040
I believe consciousness is an ontological primary, a fundamental feature of reality.

229
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,200
I think value and meaning are inherent to the fabric of reality and not just socially constructed.

230
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm at ease with using the word God, though I don't quite know what I mean by

231
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,520
that. But I do feel there's a kind of relationship between the whole and the parts that's constantly

232
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,200
happening. And sometimes you can feel yourself in the whole in a way that's quite personal and

233
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,160
livening. I would just hope that when we try and think about the future, people in the social

234
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,840
change world, they often don't go there. They stick within the narrow confines of what's politically

235
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,280
possible and culturally acceptable. But I think a lot of people in our network feel instinctively

236
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,520
that's not enough, that you have to actually widen the scope of the inquiry. Because only then do you

237
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,160
get the quality of idea and the kind of institutional and cultural innovation that might be more worthy

238
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:03,600
of the scale of the challenges we face. There's that old line by Charles Kettering that a problem

239
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,640
well stated is half solved, which I always thought was only about half true. I don't think it's the

240
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,600
whole truth. You need to do more than specify the problem. And we're a bit beyond problems,

241
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,560
we're in a kind of predicament now. But still, all very well, but what do we do, right?

242
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,360
So one thing I've suggested is that trying to get beyond a crisis mentality seems to me to be

243
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,560
quite important. This has come to me quite recently. But I've noticed that the people that I admire

244
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,320
are not fixated with crisis. People I'm drawn to these days are not those who are pointing out

245
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,200
just how dangerous it all is. They're people who are already underway doing something different.

246
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,080
People who are actually innovating in a way that prefigures the next world are the ones that I admire

247
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,800
the most. And very few of them are motivated by the language of crisis. And I find this very intriguing

248
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:07,120
because at a purely conceptual level, some would argue that the entire thrust of modernity, the

249
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,720
entire sort of engine that drives the progress narrative and the future orientation is the

250
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,400
perpetual construction and solving of crises. And this is through war. This is through sort of

251
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,040
capital investment. It happens in the institution building. It's like, this is a big crisis,

252
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,040
let's solve it by doing this. And that's how the whole thing keeps moving over many, many centuries.

253
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,240
But where we are now is we can't keep on talking of crisis and solving them. That's actually,

254
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,160
rather than being the solution, that's, you begin to see that's part of the problem,

255
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,960
that entire way of framing things. Instead, you've got to look for potential. You've got to look,

256
00:27:50,960 --> 00:28:01,040
where is the scope to do things fundamentally differently in a transformative way? And I

257
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,960
mean that in quite a specific way, not just as a kind of rhetorical flourish, but transformative

258
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,840
in the sense that the underlying form of it, the underlying reality of it, you go beyond in some

259
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:25,920
way. Going from the nation state to the bioregion is an example of that. Getting out of a university

260
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,280
department, speaking about sustainability and actually having your own farm where you actually

261
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,000
model how to grow crops is an example of that. Creating a pop-up school rather than

262
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,440
getting a job in a university department is part of that. It's creating new language, so

263
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:52,160
let's say Nora Bateson's a fanny poesis, for example, which is a kind of tending to what is

264
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,480
latent, seeing what's unseen, and moving with that in some way is another example.

265
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,040
These are the things to get behind, and at a more spiritual level is to do with calling, right?

266
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,040
I don't know how else to put this, other than to say that there's a place where Carl Jung's idea

267
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,240
of individuation meets Eleanor Ostrom's idea of the functional commons, the solving of collective

268
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,680
action problems, or collective action solutions. There's a place where individuation meets collective

269
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,640
action solutions, and you can think of it as a kind of collective individuation, and what I mean

270
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,360
by that is the distinction between the I and the we begins to break down, and not in a coercive,

271
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,560
there's no individual anymore, but rather the very notion of what an individual is, is that

272
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,560
they're part of a collective and responding to its needs, and the very notion of what a collective

273
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,160
is is something that gets rise to individuated beings. That's what we want to get to, but to get

274
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,000
there, I do believe you have to tune in to something more cosmic, which is something like your own

275
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,200
sense of what you're meant to be doing. Now not everyone is, let's say, spiritually musical,

276
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,840
not everyone hears that frequency, but for a lot of people I think they do sense it, and they may

277
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,440
even be in denial about it, but they feel there's something they're meant to be doing,

278
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,880
and I guess I feel the more that we tune into that, and of course listen for feedback from the

279
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,720
world, otherwise you get caught in narcissistic spirals of self-indulgence, but look at what the

280
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,200
world appears to need, think of what you have to offer it, and that's where we're speaking of

281
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,320
something like collective individuation, and it's also about potential, it's not just about solving

282
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,080
a problem to prop up the status quo, it's like what is actually transforming the world, changing

283
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,960
the underlying form, going beyond it, creatively, subversively, transgressively even, that's the

284
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:01,200
kind of work that excites me. Hope lies not so much in the massive armies and the big plans,

285
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,120
but in the people tending to everyday life. Now this is quite an uncomfortable, I find it

286
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,120
quite a difficult thought to bear, because there's a part of me that is more conventionally masculine

287
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:21,520
in the sense of like trying to disclose the problem and fix it, but I'm growing out of that,

288
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,600
I sort of feel that's actually not the right way to approach things, great to map things if you can

289
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,840
and see as clearly as you can, but the hope lies from something more like tending, digging where

290
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,800
you stand, tending to what's yours to deal with. Now that doesn't mean shutting off the rest of the

291
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:47,120
world, but it does mean asking deeply, given that context, what is my work in this context,

292
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,040
and that gets back to the cosmolocal idea, so it's something like this, it's not a big grand

293
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,800
action plan, it's trusting in the innovation of smaller groups, for those who are more theoretically

294
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:08,320
inclined in the world of hyper-objects, and by hyper-objects we mean these almost unintelligible

295
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,720
ideas like the climate crisis and the pandemic and the metacrisis, these things we can't quite get

296
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,920
our head around, but we still live every day. In the world of hyper-objects you need hyposubjects,

297
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,560
by hyposubjects it's not hyper-agents, it's not, you don't need more Elon Musk's, you need more

298
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:31,040
people who are turning away from the miasma, the drama of the global election problem, global

299
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:39,200
situation, towards the spiritual calling of the work they're meant to do in the context they have,

300
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,840
but not in a politically naive way, in a way that is deeply informed by the need to generate a new reality.

301
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,440
you
