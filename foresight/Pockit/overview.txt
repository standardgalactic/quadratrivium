Processing Overview for Pockit
============================
Checking Pockit/Pockitï¼š A tiny, powerful, modular computer (2022 demo).txt
1. **Processor Upgrade**: The Pocket project has upgraded its core processing capabilities with a Broadcom BCM2711 CPU, which is the same chip used in the Raspberry Pi 4B, providing a significant boost in performance for machine learning tasks and other compute-intensive applications.

2. **Performance Comparison**: With the new CPU, Pocket can run neural network computations twice as fast as with the previous CM4 processor under similar conditions.

3. **Machine Learning Accelerators**: There are plans to integrate specialized hardware accelerators for machine learning, such as a Kendrite K210 and a tiny version of Google's TPU, though these are not yet available in stock.

4. **Storage Expansion**: A new SSD block based on the PCIe interface has been developed, offering substantial storage capabilities for both portable and stationary Pocket applications.

5. **Home Automation Integration**: Pocket's core board can now run home assistant servers like Home Assistant and ESP Home, enabling it to monitor and control smart home devices over Wi-Fi or through additional hardware like the Texas Instruments CC2531 for SIGBI communication.

6. **Inter-block Communication**: Pocket blocks can communicate with each other wirelessly, allowing for a wide range of DIY projects and interactions, such as a button press triggering a light bulb to turn on via SIGBI.

7. **Creativity and Deployment**: The project emphasizes the user's creativity and aims to make deployable gadgets using Pocket's modular computing system. With the new touch display and screwless side block expansion, users can create custom interfaces and expand the functionality of their Pocket devices.

8. **Community Involvement**: The Pocket project is actively seeking early access sign-ups and feedback from the community to further develop its capabilities and features.

9. **Future Developments**: The team behind Pocket continues to work on improving the system, with plans to integrate even more advanced technologies as they become available.
