{"text": " start recording. Hello everybody and welcome to the Public Invention Inventors Gathering which happens the third Thursday of every month. This is July. My name is Robert L. Reed. I'm the president and founder of Public Invention and today I'm going to be speaking on the topic of the mind-blowing beauty of computer programming. Can everybody see my screen? Yes. Okay, thank you. We have a small audience today so y'all feel free to interrupt me. I kind of have mixed feelings about this talk because although it's really close to my heart, I know there's no way I can do justice to it. I could spend a year preparing this talk and I wouldn't do justice to it. What I'm going to try to explain to you is magic and then even deeper magic and it's actually very important to me. Computer science is a new art from really the 1930s. Lady Babbage did a little bit of work before that but it really wasn't until the 1930s that it became a mathematical art so to speak. That was before the majority of electronic computers. There were still mechanical computers at that time and although it wasn't entirely obvious at that time, we now know that computer science sits at the intersection of physics and math. It also touches upon philosophy and epistemology, the study of what can be known and in a sense computer science is an extension of what is knowable. Now the fact that computer science could be considered a branch of physics is really, really deep and relates to things like astrophysics and quantum mechanics and certain other important aspects of physics. For a while it was considered sort of an extension of math and it's also that but it has its own character so it's not really considered exactly math. Unfortunately I have no hope of doing this talk justice. This is something that's really, really beautiful and I doubt I'm going to be able to convey it to you in this talk. There are no pretty pictures in this talk except one maybe and there will be a lot of oversimplifications but I am going to be talking about what I consider to be magic even deeper magic and joy. So programming and theoretical computer science are different but the same. To use modern slang theoretical computer science is the god mode version of programming but programming humble simple programming is the basis of the theoretical computer science and it's the most general tool ever that's why it's important. Of all the things that humanity has invented computer programming is not necessarily the most important or the best but it is the most general. You can use it for almost everything. Today it's needed in all the sciences all engineering and many arts and therefore I think all young people need to understand at least a little computer programming in the same way that all people need to understand a little bit of algebra. So I'd like to ask the question what is a computer? So to me a computer is a mindless machine that can only do very simple mechanical things. Now technically the word machine to a mechanical engineer means the application of force I don't mean that. I use the term to emphasize it has no creativity no slop and each step is completely predictable from the last. Now it's it's quite an extraordinary fact that a computer can really only do five things and you could you could organize these a little differently but this is the way I organized it back when I was 16 years old and I still think it's correct. It can input a number, it can store a number, it can do arithmetic on numbers, it can output a number and it can make a decision based on a number. But those numbers can be used to represent a lot of things and on the basis of these very very simple actions by building them up into an edifice of structure of the way things are organized we can do extraordinary things. So we can ask what is a program? So a program is a set or sequence of instructions for a computer which is just a machine which are executed in a particular order that can change based on what's in storage. This is also sometimes called an algorithm because it doesn't actually require a computer humanity developed algorithms for mathematics which were step-by-step procedures before computers existed. Nonetheless the nature of a program is that it's a set of instructions that are executed in a certain order that tell a computer what to do in the next step. So the first magic that this produces is that complexity and really quite a lot of complexity emerges from simplicity with the basic five things that I said even a beginner programmer can compute the factorial of a number and we're going to see that later on in this talk. Do an extraordinary thing called Conway's game of life which I'm going to show you a demonstration of which is kind of the best example of complexity rising up out of simplicity and you can also simulate a role-playing game that feels real even though it isn't real. You can create a character you say my fighter takes out his sword and wax the wizard and it feels like the wizard's really there in your fighting even though you programmed it. You know the wizard in the end is just a set of numbers and the fighter is just a set of numbers so there's almost no creativity in it. Now I have never been an educator but when I teach beginning courses in computer programming to teenagers which I've done a few times these are the three programs that I teach first. The second aspect of magic that computers allow is that they allow you to simulate physics obviously via mathematics. Mathematics is the language of physics without mathematics we can only do a little bit of physics. Now what is it that we do when we talk about physics? Well Leonard Suskin has said Leonard Suskin has said the purpose of physics is to compute is to predict the future so for example you predict the future of where a ball is going to fall if you throw it up in the air you know it's going to come down and if you're a good physicist and you know exactly how fast you threw it up you know exactly where it's going to land. These sorts of simulations can be done by a computer and in very important circumstances they succeed when math fails that is there are situations which we as a human society do not know how to solve with math very well but we can still solve them with a computer by simulating things over time. Now there are limits to that so there are problems that a computer can solve that are hard to solve any other way so the famous three-body problem which is considered to be unsolvable in math recently there was a Netflix show about it can be solved by a computer in a limited way it can simulate the position of three stars or planets or meteors in space orbiting each other over time and it can do that one millisecond at a time and it can do that for billions of milliseconds and it will be fairly accurate let's say a hundred years from now. Now some people would say that's not a solution to the problem in the sense that it's not a formula that you can write down that tells you where the planets are nonetheless it's better than any other solution that we have in the same way we can't write down a formula that describes the flow of air around an airplane but we can simulate now there's a great philosophical debate as to whether an individual neuron can be described mathematically it's unclear if neurons are actually extraordinarily complex or extraordinarily simple you can find people who will tell you either either one um but it's possible that we can simulate the action of neurons and therefore we can simulate the action of brains we can also simulate the action of waves and biological tissues and that is the reason that we have MRIs CAT scans and PET scans without those we would not be able to address the diseases that we address that way so the third magic is something that we're all familiar with you're using it right now you're seeing a picture of me and you're hearing my voice but inside a computer those are represented as little bitty numbers which are transmitted through a network and come to your computer and then are translated back into little blips of light on your screen and voltage levels on your speakers this does not take a lot of theoretical computer science but most of us enjoy computers because they can store and transmit representations of light and sound in the form of sounds and movies now coincidentally they can store every word ever written by human beings which is the basis for large language models in modern artificial intelligence so we're going to talk a little bit about programming later but I want to talk about theoretical computer science which I consider to be deeper magic so the deeper magic number one is that you can prove there are things computers can't do and can't ever do this is the basis of cryptography we've now proved there are problems that can't be solved by computers some of the cryptographic problems are simply because we don't have fast enough computers but there are other problems which can never be solved by any computer they can never be solved by any sequence of instructions no matter how fast the computer is and and that's really a mind-boggling sort of concept in my opinion so this leads to a thing called church's thesis Alonzo church was an american logician who worked in the 30s um the computation done by modern computers are probably the only kind of computations that can ever be done now this is called church's thesis because it cannot really be proved um so it's a thesis rather than a a proof so we have several different models of computation one is the von Neumann machine which is um very similar to the electronic machines that we have so my macintosh computer would be closest to a von Neumann machine there's the Turing machine which has been made famous by movies which was invented a little earlier than the von Neumann machine our computers today are not shaped like Turing machines uh but they're uh similar and then there's a very unappreciated form of computation called the lambda calculus and the interesting thing is that you can simulate each of these computers with the other so the lambda calculus is powerful enough to simulate a Turing machine a Turing machine can simulate a von Neumann machine and a von Neumann machine can simulate the lambda calculus so you get uh what can be described as a trippy loop in that everything is powerful enough to simulate the other so none can be more powerful than the other now is that the only kind of computation that can exist in the world well we don't really know but that's very strong evidence that there is no other form of computation that there is no other way to do it now some people would argue that biological brains and analog computation are a little asterisk to this and that quantum computing kind of nibbles at the edges of this a little bit but fundamentally this is accepted by most people so the deeper magic of theoretical computer science is what i call the dismal deep magic so it may be that thought and computation are the same it may be that human brains cannot think anything that can't be thought by a computer and it may be that the sex success of artificial intelligence proves not that machines are intelligent but that humans are dumb right it may not be that artificial intelligence is somehow coming alive or getting a soul spark or having consciousness it may be that that we're learning that our own brains are actually not capable of very much now i hope that's not the case but uh it's it's certainly an interesting philosophical point so there's an even deeper magic and there's there's no way i can really explain it in this uh talk if you don't understand it but there's a problem in computer science called p is equal to np which is a question is p equal to np p is the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time np is the set of problems that can be solved in what's called nondeterministic polynomial time if you're a beginner there's no way i can explain this in this talk but uh i want what i want to point out is that p equal np is the most important problem known to humanity today in movies and so forth you sometimes hear about the remand hypothesis remand hypothesis is chump change compared to p equal np if humanity could show that p is equal to np which is not obvious that it is most people think it isn't then the world would change because in practice we could compute things efficiently which we could never compute before some things would still remain out of reach however and fundamentally this asks the question if you can verify something efficiently is there always a way to compute it efficiently and the answer is not obvious the greatest mathematician computer scientist and even physicist in the world have been working on this problem for 40 years and uh in fact i would argue they haven't actually made very much headway on it now the final really deep magic is information theory information theory is where theoretical computer science overlaps with physics and everything i say here has to be an oversimplification has to be taken with a grain of salt but nonetheless it's very important to understand information theory is closely related to the idea of entropy and that is the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of energy and the fact that the universe in a sense is running down that we're moving towards a less interesting less concentrated state of energy that everything is always smoothing out and becoming more boring so to speak information theory is independent of computers although we didn't know that 50 years ago and it applies to many physical processes for example the nyquist limit of the foyer transform but also really fundamental things like how black holes work are related to information theory in a way which i only partially understand i partially understand this so it's kind of true that energy is equal to information and it's kind of true that information is equal to entropy now obviously this is an oversimplification because entropy is not energy entropy is the opposite of energy nonetheless in very special circumstances information is similar to energy and in different circumstances information is similar to entropy so now we can ask the really fundamental question which which i want everyone especially if you're a beginner here to understand and be intrigued by it what does a programmer do i've believed for a long time that the job of a programmer is to create order out of chaos so from uh long before the birth of christ uh there was a famous hymn to Zeus by cliente's and it begins chaos to be his order and in the middle of it in one translation obviously it was written in greek you can say but you know how to make the crooked straight and to bring order to the disorderly even the unloved is loved by you the poet is speaking to Zeus for you have so joined all things into one the good and the bad that they all share in a single unified everlasting reason and of course the christian and judaic bible begins let there be light that's what a programmer does they bring light out of darkness in order out of chaos so fundamentally a program systemizes that which was not systemized previously so the main tool of computer programming is could be called abstraction it's not that easy to understand what it means in this this context programs have subroutines or functions which can be reused the reuse of a subroutine always cost a tiny amount of time and also a tiny amount of electricity but once a subroutine is written it can be used over and over again and it never wears out just like the number 37 never wears out in a sense subroutines and mathematics are stronger than steel and diamonds steel and diamonds and granite eventually wear out but math and subroutines don't abstraction is the main tool for making long programs short and is thus closely connected with bringing order out of chaos factorial the first program that programmers should learn teaches abstraction through recursion now there's a thing called lambda lifting that i recommend um an interested student read the wikipedia article on lambda lifting which is sort of the formal way in which abstraction enters computer programming but most programmers will will not understand lambda lifting they will instead think of when i create a subroutine i am creating abstraction which i can reuse again and again so my own personal style of programming is based on something that paul graham said he wrote an essay called concision is power and i view the act of programming as being almost their exceptions the same as trying to create the shortest most compact representation of something and thus in a way creating the most abstract version of a sequence of instructions to accomplish something now functional programming is a style in which subroutines are side effect free this helps to bring order out of chaos because of something technical called referential transparency and it's the most abstract way of working because it means that a function can be used in any context and always means the same thing now this is debatable we don't have time to go into it uh some people don't like functional programming as much as i do another way of expressing this is a principle called dry or do not repeat yourself in a computer program there should never really be two lines that are the same there should never be two subroutines that are the same if you find yourself writing the same code it should become a subroutine and this principle can be applied to enormous aspects of computer programming you should not have duplication in your data just as you should not have duplication in your instructions and in many many circumstances what people do is they copy and paste code from somewhere and in so doing they're violating the dry principle and after years programs become big fluffy disorderly things where things are almost the same but not quite in different places and so forth and that's very poor software engineering but it takes beginners years to fully understand this and to fully understand how to avoid it so now i'd like to talk about the very first program that i think everyone should write the first program is called factorial and it's written with an exclamation point when i was in in college there was a young man who didn't know was called factorial so when he saw in factorial he said called it in as if as if it's very emphatically the way you you say in in fact in bang sometimes pronounced bang or in factorial or in exclamation point is used in the famous formula from probability that's sometimes pronounced in choose k it gives you the ways to choose k element the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of in objects this is all important to poker players and all kinds of probability and all kinds of mathematics but the definition of factorial itself is really really simple and this is it right here this is actually in javascript we could take this and we could run it okay now um i learned this so long ago it no longer seems weird to me but some of you reading it may not have learned this and i remember how hard it was for me to understand when i was about 18 or 19 and i was first introduced to this this concept so what this code says is that the function that we call factorial which is in bang so to speak has a mathematical definition if n is equal to zero the answer is one if n is not equal to zero the answer is in times the factorial of n minus one now this is a trippy loop factorial is being defined in terms of itself how can the computer know what factorial means when we're telling it what factorial means right now it's not obvious now to many people in this audience it may be obvious but when i was a boy this was not obvious to me okay you you might ask the question well how on earth can the computer ever know how to do factorial of n minus one when we're defining it in terms of itself it looks like a trick okay and it takes a while to understand it and in fact the answer is this only works if you call factorial with a smaller number in the body of the function so that the problem is always somehow getting simpler and eventually it gets down to zero if that is not true you create an infinite loop infinite loops are much worse than trippy loops so in fact you could say that this function has a bug if you called this was minus one it would run forever because it would multiply minus one by the factorial of minus two which would be minus two times the factorial of minus three which would be minus three times the factorial of minus four and that number would never become equal to zero and it would never stop the second program is a program called conways game of life and it was specifically designed to show how complexity arises out of simplicity okay and it at one kind of artificial level it's a simulation of biological processes these four rules are the only rules it has and I believe this is the second computer program which every beginner should write okay it's played on a grid like a chessboard but the chessboard is considered not to be eight by eight but to extend as far as you want it to so it's played on a square grid and each grid is called grid cell square is called a cell okay and a cell is either live or dead and there's a clock that ticks and one generation leads to the next generation so you start with some pattern and then you start generations and the rule for each cell is simply these four rules in a live cell with fewer than two live neighbors that's the cells the eight cells around it that touch it dies as if by underpopulation I prefer to think of it as loneliness it dies of loneliness any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation it's happy any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies by overpopulation or crowding and then here is a bit of magic any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell as if by reproduction okay simple rules that produce almost unbounded complexity so now I'd like to show you an example of this is Conway's game of life you guys can do this I'm randomly putting this here I don't know what I'm doing I'm just clicking on some numbers so you see this consists of a grid of squares and each square is considered a cell yellow means it's alive gray means it's dead now when I click next it's going to do a generation so some cells will died and a few cells came into existence and the pattern changed and now the pattern is going to change again and again and again and again and now I can simply start running it and we'll see what happens not done yet it's not done yet it's not done yet it's not done yet now it's done so how could that complexity that you just saw arise out of those four rules that is the thing which is of sort of paramount importance to mathematicians and related to what I'm talking about the the Iraq the ability of simplicity to give birth to complexity okay and then finally an exercise that I think all beginning computer programmers should do is to write a very simple sort of fantasy role-playing game that has characters in it and you can have the characters fight like you do in Dungeons and Dragons so that a fighter can whip out a sword and say I attack the wizard and I strike the wizard with my sword and the wizard's health goes down and then the health the wizard cast a magic spell uh perhaps to catch the um fighter in a web which decreases their ability to strike in the future now um the thing about this is you play it it's simple it's fun and it feels alive but you programmed it you know very well the wizard is not alive the wizard is just a subroutine the wizard is literally 10 or 15 lines of code that you yourself programmed representing only with numbers now if you don't want to do that you can think of a complicated game uh an expensive game like Minecraft or something like that accomplishing the same thing it feels real even though we know in the end it is nothing more than a complicated series of the five operations I began this talk with so programming is almost reason but not quite it is almost human reason but it isn't exactly programming does not tell the poet what word to select or the musician how to play the note perfectly or the painter how the brush stroke should go but nonetheless the act of programming is very close to the act of human reasoning for 100 years coming up on 100 years now literally we've been making programming tools more powerful so for example john von Neumann did not believe in compilers he believed it was a sign of mental weakness if people had to use compiled computer languages he thought you should program them sort of only with the the most minimal set of instructions um he was weird each increase in the strength of the programming tools has not made programming obsolete it has not decreased the number of people making gainful living by being programmer it has made programming more important and given gainful employment to more people so I personally do not believe anyone should fear that AI will replace programming that it's the same as saying AI will replace human reasoning AI will become a tool used by programmers now I have not used it I don't use co-pilot or any AI tools for that but at some point I may have to learn how to do that on the other hand I do think we should fear killer robots I'm much more worried about killer robots than I am uh my ability to think being replaced by an artificial intelligence so there are a lot of joys associated with computer programming and um I got to experience these when I was a child almost I started programming when I was 13 not very well it took me a long time to learn a lot I didn't have anyone to learn from um I wish every child could experience this joy I wish everyone could it could do these now there are other ways to learn these joys but computer programming is a darn good way to to do it as Lee and Nardo Da Vinci said the joy of understanding is one of the greatest pleasures that humanity can have and computer programming is all about understanding often you begin in confusion and you move towards understanding because you bring order out of chaos you bring light out of darkness you start from a situation of not understanding a problem and then you understand it there's the joy of discovery which I think is quite different that's where you learn something surprising um sometimes you discover surprising problems sometimes you discover surprising solutions sometimes like in the case of Conway's game of life you discover surprising things which are neither problems nor solutions they're just surprising things about the mathematical world in which we live and then perhaps the greatest joy is the joy of creation you can write a program you can create something out of nothing which did not exist before and something important as well of course you can do that by knitting a sweater but one form of creation is writing a computer program and then you can experience the joy of mastery the joy of moving from a state of not being very good at something to being pretty good at it um I do not consider myself to have mastered computer programming uh I'm still learning I I wish I had time to learn more I I'm considering myself a journeyman programmer so to speak um my one of my heroes Kent Beck said that confusion should be cherished because it precedes enlightenment and computer program it is all about moving from a state of confusion to a state of enlightenment and then finally there's the joy of sharing um in a way there are not many programs in the world there is only one universal program it is splintered between my computer and Lawrence's computer and Christina's computer and Morena's computer but in a way there's really only one computer program in the whole world and we are all writing parts of it we are writing little bitty parts of it so we are all sharing in a given enterprise for many people a great joy that they get to experience in college and I and I wish everyone got to go to college I know some people don't is to um share their programs with other people sometimes in a classroom setting sometimes not I remember uh one time I was in a graphics class at the University of Texas when I was in graduate school and my friend Steve Benz uh put up on his screen a graphic programming and he programmed a little airplane to fly around the tower of a representation of a tower of an airport and it was it was an astonishing thing to to have accomplished quite quite beautiful uh I really enjoyed that when I was at Rice University uh there was there was a student there uh who was quite unusual and I would walk by his terminal and on it there was a weird glyph and I couldn't figure out what it was so you know I asked the guy and he said well it's elvish he had created an ascii art representation of the letter the elvish characters that Tolkien had created which are called tingwar um an example of nerdy stuff uh but it was more fun because it was shared and then finally and my talk is closing now um there's the joy of meaning and this is the deepest thing to me public convention gives everything it does to the whole world we don't keep anything secret everything we do is shared through open source licensing uh we've been trying to save people's lives for a while now through global medical stuff I doubt anyone's life has ever been saved by one of our inventions although it is our goal and we're working towards it things take time to ripen uh I I have faith that it will eventually happening programming is an important part of our work almost everything now requires computer programming programming is part of our work and our work is meaningful and therefore the programming of meaning so thank you for your support of public convention thank you for listening I've got a few references here which people can look up on google if they want and I will now open the floor to questions well I should have been here at 8 and for some reason I thought it started at 8 30 oh okay Victoria Christina's raised your hand go ahead Christina that was an excellent presentation um I've never actually kind of thought about that all laid out in such a way uh I feel like it's it's one of those programming in general is one of those things that I've I've been around for a long time and have a very very very tiny bit of experience with myself but if you're around it so much you often don't necessarily think of the origins of it um but I did have a question that came up and it's something that I never thought of much myself um and it's I love the slide on factorials by the way so in calculating um factorials you the two things that come to mind are recursive function versus iterative so I was wondering if um like from a programming standpoint like different characteristics or use cases specific to either using a recursive or iterative approach um in programming yeah it's a good it's a good question it's a really good question because um in fact you can prove in a sense that you you don't have to do this recursively so what Christina's saying is this self-reference the fact that factorial is defined in terms of factorial is called um recursion you could write um factorial as what's called a loop and you would count down and you would examine the value in and you you would count across in and and and do it that way um so you don't have to do it this way except there are things over time which become so complicated it would be almost impossible to do all of them um iteratively for example you could be working on a solving a differential equation you know or some very very big thing and you're in the middle of it and you're down in the middle of a computation and now you have to do another factorial right you you have to have subroutines and you have to have abstraction in um in doing those things and there there are some things which um in order to not define them recursively you would almost have to stand on your head like like you could do it there's a mathematical proof that you don't have to have this because after all this programming language is being compiled into something which is just a set of numbers which is doing the same thing but it would become unnatural it would become so complicated that you almost couldn't think about it and it would get in the way of your thinking about it and and a proof of that is the formula on the right hand side of this page right here we have n bang and it's expressed in terms of k bang and n minus k bang mathematicians are using this you know using this sort of thing uh referentially as a subroutine in the same way and if you go to the wikipedia page you will see it defined both iteratively and recursively i don't know if that answers your question or not yes it does um and kind of as a follow-up to that i don't want to i don't want to hog all the question time but um are there so from a computer programming standpoint are there more resource constraints with one versus the other so if so taking an iterative approach versus recursive like what does that what does it mean for the programmer when you're coming to choose between the two okay so there are people who will tell you that an iterative approach is more efficient because a um recursive approach appears on the surface to use more memory okay and so there are times when an iterative approach would be better and let me let me return to this and try to explain this in the in the deepest possible way okay so for example the way this is implemented in a computer in a in as the languages compile it's turned from this representation into a different representation and you almost can't discuss it without talking about what's called a stack frame and whenever you make a call you push onto the stack which is called because it's like a cafeteria tray uh in a cafeteria you know you have a spring-loaded stack of trays sometimes you you push things onto the stack and you and you build things up and then you take things off the stack okay you push the variables here onto this the stack well however many calls you make uh each one of those has to have a memory representation you can run out of memory okay now you can do it it appears on the surface that you can do it more efficiently iteratively because you wouldn't have that extra space however this program the way it's written is what's called tail recursive in the sense that the the use of factorial is the last thing in what's being done here so the compiler knows that and can automatically implement an efficient way of doing it so in practice it doesn't matter okay now another way that i if i wanted to i could attack what you're saying is i could say yes it might be more efficient in terms of computer instructions but computer instructions are cheap what's hard is the clarity of the program to make it in an ordered fashion and so i would be very low to write it in a more efficient way if it decreased the clarity of the program from a human understanding point of view there's another saying in computer science which is that premature optimization is the root of all evil that was that's famously said by Donald Knuth a very important computer scientist so let me let me just show you here what happens so over here on the right this is actually a the development tools which are built into the chrome browser and it runs javascript and so i can paste this pro oops i could paste this program in here but it's apparently please type allow posting in here so it's got a nice security feature won't let me post it in oh allow pasting okay that well i'll do it the old-fashioned way i'll type it so i already typed this in okay so this is javascript this is completely legal javascript okay and i can call factorial of zero and it's one and i can call factorial of 10 and it'll be a big number and i can call factorial of 20 and i can call factorial let's say 100 this may not work okay and it kind of works and it's a very very very very large number right um now eventually we'll run out there's a bug in this program in a sense factorial is not actually defined on negative numbers but if i run this on a negative number as i said before it will go into an infinite loop so we're going to see what happens when it does that so what it actually says is maximum call stacked size exceeded what it did is it kept going until it ran out of its own memory now it's smart so before it crashed my computer it caught it and it said oh i'm not going to let you make that call again that may be more than you wanted to know about that no no and then sorry so one last thing would be so would you say that recursion then is more suitable for problems that could be broken down into similar sub problems and the thing that first comes to mind for me is like some of the sorting algorithms whereas when i think of iteration i think of more suitable program uses for problems that would require repeated execution of a block code linear searches things like that yes okay so i would say yes and the best example of that if you want to google it right now is um google quicksort okay quicksort is a very simple um program here let me create a new slide um it's not necessarily the best the best sort in the world but it's it's extraordinarily simple and that's why it's done it was created by another famous computer scientist i had the pleasure of meeting uh Charles anthony robert pour who for some reason was called tony uh so more created quicksort and quicksort looks like this and i can't this is not going to be correct JavaScript quicksort of and i'll call it s is a sequence okay and what i do is i is i'll say let a be first half of s that is the first if s has 100 members to be the first 50 okay and exactly how i'd do that i would depend on the exact language i'm in but let you know let b be the second half of s okay um uh now i'm forgetting it okay and so then what you do is you do a quicksort of a and then you do a quicksort of b so that those two are sorted and that that gives you back two list of 50 numbers which are each sorted and then you you merge them very simply and i maybe i'm forgetting because that would be called a merge sort instead of instead of a quicksort i think maybe quicksort finds the median uh value and takes all the lower ones and then all the upper ones and it sorts those two and then merges it back but it's fundamentally recursive in the way that you just described because you're taking a list of 100 elements breaking it into two list of 50 sorting the two list of 50 and then doing something very simple to put it back together now it can be done iteratively as well but it is probably harder to understand it than by doing it recursively so why do it that makes sense that's really cool so i i don't know you know a lot of applications i you know because i don't don't do computer programming but i do know that a lot of what's behind some of these companies that are doing really extensive gene analysis so analyzing genetic combinations and permutations they're using programs with a lot of factorial calculations involved so that's how they're discovering like different gene combinations correlate with certain syndromes or you know genetic mutations that's that's like the the first real-world case that comes from my mind well right okay so so here's something mind-blowing even the act of so to us the act of multiplying two numbers is simple and in java script it's simple you just write a star b and that multiplies two numbers together okay but as a becomes gigantic and b becomes gigantic it starts to be inefficient to multiply it the way humans multiply numbers okay of course you would never think of worrying about this until it's more than like a thousand digits on each side but the numbers you deal with in genomic combinations can can get really big there's an entire science of computer science that deals with asymptotic complexity where you try to create the most efficient algorithms you can i do not fully understand this but the most efficient way to multiply numbers is actually with the Fourier transform okay so that algorithm for multiplying very very very very large numbers is quite unnatural compared to what we as school children learn to do in our multiplication and if you were trying to compute factorial you might do the same thing and you might use approximations and then there are all kinds of all kinds of tricks to make that go faster and there's an entire science behind that which is usually not done usually computer programmers don't worry about that until they're at least out of college oh do we have any other questions i'll let other people ask questions otherwise we will be here all night with me being like what about this what about that i am always at your service christina all right i'm sure others have have questions so i'll i will let others ask them another thing i learned in graduate school is that silence is golden and often if you just wait long enough people will ask a question even though they're shy i don't really have a question but i did you have a comment though in your description of one of the things i think that i think is kind of overlooked is the root word of analog computing is i think it's shared with analogy and i like thinking of computing as an analogy that is running on base level physics or basic level reality and that that level of and what we're basically doing is creating a story that is playing out in front of us in the world around us and the story is and we we are consistent with our story and the consistency of our story reinforces our understanding and in our logic in a way that gives us belief in understanding of the things that we're doing and the answers that we're getting it's a little poetic but the but it allows you to start thinking that like water can be used in computing gravity can be used in computing mechanical structures can be used in computing DNA can be used in computing like computing is all around us and it's it's really the the analogy the stories that we use to construct um and the mathematical themes and theories behind this those those properties that kind of really make it happen so yeah that's all true um you can make a computer out of pneumatic vows or water vows and people did before electronics were available but the computing that is all around us doesn't do what i would call general purpose computing in general physical properties tend to be smooth and continuous and in that sense they're a very limited form of computation for example a slide rule or a caliper you can be used to multiply numbers but only in it only in a very very limited way making a turing machine or a turing complete machine or von Neumann machine or land to calculate machine out of a slide rule would be very hard um and so the electronic computer and the the attempts to make mechanical computers which famously Lady Ada Babbage did um created a new era of uh computation i agree with that there's there's still a open question of can you build an a general purpose analog computer um and then the the corollary v can you build a general purpose uh neural network um with the drill with the neural fabric um and which is currently a very hot topic right now in AI research um i agree but that question is bigger than i can address in this talk one thing i think it's under appreciated i would also want to bring up is that um the advances in computing that we're currently seeing have allowed us to tackle problems that were previously on we were unable to really address um i think that's i think that's going to open up new areas in biology in physics and in uh and i'm just any of like the the big the bigger world out there and the small world out there so i think that's i think it's under appreciated because um ten years ago we couldn't model um with the fidelity that we had uh that we can today with a number of variables and the number of um factors yep that's correct does anyone else have a comment um i just i think it's really cool to think about and uh lauren says first comment made me think of this it's really cool to think about the fact that all of these well most of these equations or calculations that are you know given examples here they have been around since ancient times like these were you know the the end notation wasn't really developed until later but the the like core idea can be traced back to you know we're talking like you know bc yeah and it's how how we've kind of evolved the use cases of these equations to for computational purposes so instead of us using these equations ourselves we have machines now that do it for us um but a lot of the earlier uses of them were just you know obviously we think of like physics and astronomy um but even before then it was kind of just this almost like pondering of what if so what if i take these numbers and do this what happens um so these very very ancient ancient calculations that are very much a part of our modern life in a big way we wouldn't we wouldn't have modern life today without them yes i mean just just think of how humanity's power was expanded by the development of those mathematical algorithms before there were computers right i mean you know before that you had uh questions that that we would think well that's a computable answerable question and people might not know how to answer the question right they might not know how what's the area of a sphere right they might not know what's the area of a cone they might not know that if you have a right triangle the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the two sides although that's been known for a long time presumably there was some time in the past when it wasn't known right um and so that gets back to my point computer programming is a form of mathematics that brings order out of chaos and it it expands our power and to me the computer is an extension of the human brain it's not a replacement it's an exo brain if you will just the way tony stark's iron suit is a exoskeleton wikipedia is a part of my exo brain and i can use a computer to perform calculations which would be very awkward or impossible for me to perform in in other circumstances um so um in a very real sense it's in it both the act of systematizing things which weren't systematic before extends human power and the electronic computer which can do these things very rapidly also extends human power do we have any other questions or comments fast what's your favorite equation me yes favorite equation and why well um force equal mass times acceleration because it's a um it's a it's a second order differential equation which happens to be easily solvable and from which we can derive an extraordinary number of effects i have another question maybe more um kind of philosophical you started with a definition of what a computer is and kind of explaining it can only basically input and output numbers but with programming and now um AI or machine learning is there are we getting to the point where basically these programs or these computers can think much faster than we do i know they can solve equations but are is it getting to the point where they can quote unquote learn faster than us and how do we keep up the understanding of like you're saying a computer can only do something that's traceable um is there a point where maybe like in comparative to to our human reasoning um is there a point where we're too slow to kind of understand um these programs and machines well it's a really good question let me give you the answer that pro AI people give and then i'll tell you what i think okay pro AI people point out that although large language of models which is one aspect of artificial intelligence are relatively in their infancy they already beat human beings at standardized tests such as the graduate G the GRE and SAT and the ACT and they can do well on tests of biology and physics and so as my friend David Jesky has pointed out every time humanity has said well computers aren't really intelligent because they can't play chess or they can't play go or they can't um write poetry uh you know those have all fallen right like they didn't they do those things right and um curmudgeons like me keep saying oh well they aren't really intelligent even though they can answer a bunch of questions that i can't possibly answer okay but then i'll tell you what i think um just because it's i think the honesty is worthwhile i mean sure an AI could beat me at a biology test but an AI has had an infinite amount of time to learn and to it it's an open book test and AI can't compete with me at all in any real problem that it hasn't had a bajillion cycles of 50 gigawatts of power to study ahead of time yeah you know um so i don't accept artificial intelligence as thinking and being able to learn things at all now obviously you can build a classifier right like you could classify leaves and it'll tell you what kind of tree it came from better than i can personally remember the shape of leaves you know to do it it would beat me at that task right um it would beat me at translating french into english but it doesn't beat me at understanding even though it can translate french into english better than i can i think the question comes down to what is what does it mean to be humans creativity you know novel ideas i guess yeah i'm i'm you know i can't claim to be more creative than an AI but still i i feel that all human beings have something in them which i have not yet seen in an AI maybe five years from now the little child that is artificial intelligence will have grown into something um worthy of respect you know uh and then are we gonna say switching the machine off as murder you know did we kill an AI when you know the power failed i i don't know i but at the moment i remain skeptical of these these things you thanks for your perspective and the talk is very uh interesting and
