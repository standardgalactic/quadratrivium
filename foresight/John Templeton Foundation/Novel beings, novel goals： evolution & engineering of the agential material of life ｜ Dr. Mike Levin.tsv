0	12000	All right, I think I'm going to get us started. I want to welcome everyone that's there in the cafe and who's online to the second in our 2024 lecture series.
12000	18000	I'm very pleased to be able to do the introduction for Dr. Mike Levin.
18000	28000	He's a developmental or maybe synthetic biologist who has a distinguished professorship at Tufts University.
28000	42000	He's really began his career as a geneticist, received his doctorate at Harvard, looking at the genetic underpinnings of asymmetries and embryonic developmental trajectories.
42000	47000	And he's really been doing that vein of work for the last two and a half or more decades.
47000	61000	In that time, he's published hundreds of papers and has, by my count, something like 35,000 citations and counting and a number of different honors that you can see on his wiki page.
61000	65000	So I'll point you to if you want to learn more about that.
65000	71000	Mike, you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I think you first came into Templeton's orbit.
71000	82000	What I found in the system was that you applied for funding in 2014 for an OFI related to artificial mind and affecting will through quantum effects.
82000	93000	And that was part of the program with Al Mealy at FSU on free will that ultimately didn't lead to an invitation to full proposal.
93000	106000	What else I saw in the system was that it was another five years before you applied and that was to the life sciences when we ran an ideas challenge, which was a program trying to foment new ideas on the science of purpose.
106000	116000	And that was open to anyone in the US and we had offered $51,000 prizes for the best ideas as judged by an independent review panel.
116000	129000	And you could submit as many ideas as you want, but those were judged in a blinded fashion where we didn't know who the, the submitter was, and you ended up winning two of those awards.
129000	136000	And those were $1,000 each paid to the individual, not to the institution. So we got hundreds of submissions.
136000	145000	And that was really the beginning of us funding in this priority. So not only did you get that distinguished award, which may or may not actually feature on the wiki page.
145000	152000	But you did parlay that obviously through conversation into the grant that you're going to be speaking at least in part on today.
152000	164000	Maybe the one thing I want to say to those of you who don't know Mike never interacted with them is that I guess my conversation at this point my introduction has been very quantitative but qualitatively whenever you speak with Mike.
164000	177000	And if you have the privilege, the fun is, is talking to someone who has a very generative creative mind that feels a lot like popcorn popping when you talk to him. And so I'm really excited for the talk this morning.
177000	182000	Thank you for being with us Mike, and I yield the floor to you now.
182000	193000	That's a very kind introduction and yeah thank you for all the support over the years I'll talk more about that at the end. And it is my pleasure to share some ideas with you all.
193000	198000	What, what I would like to do is to cover three main points here.
198000	212000	The first is that I'm going to talk about the fact that we are all made of a kind of a gentle material, we are made of cells and actually sub cellular components that have an important kind of intelligence for the purposes of this talk will boil that down to problem
212000	213000	solving capacity.
213000	231000	I'm going to introduce you to an important concept called bio electricity which functions as a kind of cognitive glue. This is something that binds the tiny little goals of individual cells and components like that together into a larger emergent individual with the goals and
231000	240000	and so on that that none of their parts have. And I'm going to talk about how this actually these these philosophical ideas actually cash out as advances in biomedicine.
240000	257000	And for example I'll mention cancer as literally a dissociative identity disorder of the collective morphogenetic intelligence of your body. And then I want to talk a bit at the end about the implications that novel embodiments have for ethics, and beyond some really
257000	272000	what I think are quite untenable dichotomies that need to be dumped in our journey to to human flourishing into ethical relationships with other other beings, and a large part of this talk and be kind of summed up by saying that the
272000	286000	collection collective intelligence of groups of cells that navigate anatomical space so the space of possible shapes and functions that will lead us to develop a conceptual framework for diverse intelligence.
286000	292000	And I want to show how these deep philosophical ideas can actually become therapeutics they move on to empirical application.
292000	304000	So let's start. Let's start here. This is a very well known painting called Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden. And what this painting reflects is a couple of interesting things.
304000	310000	So one thing that I think is very deep and true and one thing that I think is a profound error that we're going to correct.
310000	321000	The thing that's an error is that what you see here is a very clear demarcation between all the different creatures. So there's a discrete set of specific static forms.
321000	330000	In fact, Adam is of course supposed to be different from all of these, and so on and so and so we're going to go beyond this idea of discrete natural kinds for these.
330000	342000	What I think is very, very correct here is that there's an old tradition in which Adam had to be the one to name the animals, not God, not the angels, Adam had to be the one to do it.
342000	354000	And that's for two reasons. One is that he was the one that was going to have to live with these things in perpetuity, and also this idea that by naming things you discover their true nature.
354000	365000	And so we're going to go beyond him to take the effort to discover the true nature of these beings and thus come up with appropriate names for them, because in the course of old traditions, knowing the name of something is very powerful.
365000	379000	And I think this is profoundly true because we are going to have to name in the sense of discover the true nature of a wide variety of novel beings with whom we will have to live well beyond anything that was imagined by the authors of these paintings.
379000	391000	The first thing we know in modern science is that around what's known as a typical modern human, this kind of special thing that has this agential glow that all the philosophy on papers are about, you know, the human mind and so on.
391000	404000	We know that we stand in the middle of a very smooth continuum if you ask well what kind of human you know this one or something back here or what there are properties that go all the way back to single cells on the evolutionary time scale.
404000	413000	We also know from developmental biology that even in our own lifetime, there is a slow, smooth continuous development from a single cell.
413000	419000	So, so we already are starting to see that actually we can't just talk about this we have to understand the continuum of it.
419000	429000	And in fact, it gets much more interesting because not only that but now with with advances in synthetic morphology bioengineering and so on.
429000	440000	But we now know that actually, we are also in the middle of a continuum of all kinds of slow and gradual changes that can and will be made to the standard default organism.
440000	452000	These can be biological changes these can be technological changes because at every level of organization, we can combine engineered substrates with the naturally evolved biological ones.
452000	456000	And biology is extremely interoperable and we'll get to that towards the end.
456000	464000	So, now understanding that that this is that there's a there's a very smooth continuum of highly diverse bodies and minds.
464000	475000	I'm interested in a framework that can help us think about all of these things. It can help us recognize them it can help us create them in Korea and it can help us ethically relate to them.
475000	488000	And we can think about, of course, not just the familiar creatures, such as apes and birds and maybe an octopus and things like that. But really, all kinds of things colonial organisms swarms engineered life forms artificial intelligence
488000	496000	whether software purely software or robotically embodied, and at some point maybe even exobiological agents.
496000	513000	So, how can we how can we begin to think about all of these things on the same continuum. Now, I'm not the first person to try for this of course that you know, far back as 1943 Rosenbluth, Wiener and Bigelow, try to come up with a kind of a ladder of different levels of cognition all the
513000	522000	passive matter, all the way up to the kind of second order complex metacognition that we have. And so, so this is the kind of framework that I that I want to develop.
522000	534000	I, my focus is on ones that move experiment forward. So I'm not just interested in philosophical ideas but actually with something that helps us facilitate new discovery that's essential.
534000	542000	So, equally or even more important, helps us to define better ethical frameworks that are more grounded in the reality of life.
542000	558000	So one of the things that we've been working on is this notion of a, of an axis of persuadability, taking an engineering perspective on the wide spectrum of systems around us we see that as we move up this ladder from simple mechanical systems to kind of cybernetic
558000	564000	to the kind of monogamy of stats to learning agents and all the way up to humans and whatever is beyond that.
564000	575000	What we see is that what happens here is that there is a different set of tools that you need to optimally relate to these things. You know, something down here, you're not going to convince that of anything you're not going to reward and punish it
575000	585000	efficiently all you're going to be able to do is rewire the hardware. But here you can start to think about the goals that it has in the simple set points and maybe rewriting the set point without rewiring the hardware.
585000	595000	Maybe you don't even need to know everything about how the system works because it offers an interface. You can train it. You can communicate with it. And then here you can really communicate in a very profound way.
595000	604000	You can actually share agency with it and be vulnerable to be cognitively open to it and exchange information back and forth.
604000	616000	So across this continuum of different tools, right? So as an engineer, the interesting thing that the engineering perspective gives you is that you can be very specific about asking, well, what tools do I need to bring to each of these systems?
616000	625000	What helps us to understand and to relate to it? We can ask a simple question. Where do cellular collectives fit here? And this is an empirical question.
625000	635000	It is not enough to have philosophical pre-commitments to where things go. So some people assume that while cells, they're just mechanical machines. They have to be back here.
635000	651000	But we can't just have armchair feelings about it. We have to do experiments. And so it's especially important because we were all once, quote unquote, just physics. We all started life as an unfertilized OSI, a little blob of chemistry.
651000	659000	And eventually we become something like this or even something like this, which is going to make statements about not being a machine and so on.
659000	674000	And we now owe a story about how did we get from here to here? What happened during this process? Because developmental biology does not offer any bright line at which point you go from being a blob of chemistry and physics to being an actual real mind.
674000	688000	Okay, so we know we somehow scale up from whatever's going on here to this kind of status. We know we do that slowly, but at least we're a true unified intelligence. We're not a metaphorical collective intelligence like an ant colony.
688000	705000	I mean, we feel like a single unified being. Well, and especially Renee Descartes thought that this was the case. And he was very interested in the pineal gland, which is singular in the brain. And he felt that that matches our experience as unified intelligences and as humans.
706000	717000	But if he had access to good microscopy, what he would have found was that inside that pineal gland are a huge number of cells. And inside of each of those cells, there's a huge number of these little little machines.
717000	729000	There isn't one of anything anywhere. All intelligence is collective intelligence. We are all made of parts. And the research program is to understand how those parts come together to form something more than the sum of its parts.
729000	736000	This is a single cell. This is the kind of, I mean, this is a free living organism, but this is the kind of thing that we are all made of.
736000	748000	It has no brain, it has no nervous system, it is a single cell, but it has incredible competencies at meeting its metabolic, it's anatomical, all the different goals that it has at the level of a single cell.
748000	761000	One of the things that is needed to become a more than the sum of those parts is a kind of cognitive glue. And what I mean by that is that if you train, let's say you train this rat to press a lever and get a reward.
761000	770000	Well, the cells at the bottom of the feet are interacting with the lever the cells in the gut are receiving the sugar of the reward. No individual cell has both of these experiences.
770000	785000	Who owns that associative memory? Who is this rat that now can bind the experience of its different parts into a piece of information that is only known by the collective and not by any of the individuals.
785000	802000	We're used to this from neuroscience that the electrical networks in our brain allow us to somehow cohere out of individual cells. But there are a number of scenarios in biology that show us that we really haven't yet understood what's actually going on here.
802000	813000	This is a caterpillar. So caterpillars live in a two dimensional world. They eat leaves and they have a little brain suitable for driving the sort of pneumatic kind of device.
813000	819000	It's a soft-bodied thing. There's nothing to push on in the caterpillar. You have to control it other ways.
819000	830000	The caterpillar has to become a butterfly. Butterflies fly. They live in a three dimensional world. They drink nectar and they have a completely different brain suitable for driving this kind of body.
830000	839000	During this process, what happens? The brain basically dissolves. All the connections are broken. Most of the cells are killed and you've got this and then you reconstitute a new brain.
839000	851000	Now, one amazing thing is that butterflies and moths remember information that the caterpillars were trained on. And you might think that the key question here is where is the information stored?
851000	859000	How is it possible that this individual, this collective being, is thoroughly refactored and still remembers the original information? Where is it?
859000	873000	But it's actually much more than that. The real question isn't just where is it? The idea here is that you cannot store static information because the information on, let's say you train the caterpillar to find leaves in a particular color disk.
873000	880000	That information in itself is irrelevant to the butterfly. The butterfly doesn't want leaves and it doesn't move around the way caterpillars do.
880000	891000	What happens here is that that information gets generalized and passed on. So when the butterfly has this new higher dimensional, literally a higher dimensional life than the caterpillar,
891000	903000	it's the deep lessons of its prior life, not the specific memories that it brings with it because it will also remember to go where the color disk is, but not because it wants leaves. There it will find nectar.
903000	913000	So we really need to understand the remapping of information across bodies that change. Another kind of drastic example is shown by these planaria.
913000	924000	These are flatworms and they regenerate. We'll talk more about them shortly. So you can train the planaria to look for food where these little bumpy disks are and then you cut off their brain.
924000	937000	In fact, the whole head, the tail sits there doing nothing for eight or nine days. It regenerates. It rebuilds a brand new brain. That information is again imprinted on the new brain and now once again, you can see that remembers where to go.
937000	960000	This sounds like this is some kind of special feature of butterflies and planaria, but actually we are all this to some extent because even just beyond the kind of brain remodeling of puberty and maturation and so on, none of us are molecularly the same at any point in time.
960000	974000	So we're constantly in flux and remapping memories actively onto our new context is critical. You might ask what happens to human patients in a few years that are going to receive stem cell implants into their brain for degenerative brain disease.
974000	983000	What's going to happen to them to that patient, their personality, you know, this is the butterfly caterpillar thing is closer to us than we think.
983000	995000	It also that ability to remap certain competencies and certain kinds of information onto new scenarios is really critical for evolution. We discovered some years ago that if you take a tadpole.
995000	1004000	So this is a tadpole of a frog. Here's the mouth here the nostrils. Here's the brain. You'll notice that we prevented the two primary eyes from forming, but we did grow an eye on its tail.
1004000	1012000	And when you do that you find out that these animals can actually see perfectly well. How do we know because we built a machine to train them on visual cues.
1012000	1024000	And we show that this animal in a new sensory motor architecture this this eye doesn't even connect to the brain it connects to the spinal cord here you can see the the optic nerve synapses right there on the spinal cord.
1025000	1039000	To remap all the behavioral repertoires of this of this system with no extra evolutionary generations you don't need cycles of selection to make this work in one generation, you radically change the sensory motor architecture, no problem
1039000	1055000	to remap vision learning everything works and and that that has huge implications for evolution the fact that evolution does not commit to kind of an over reliance on how things were before and try to persist with the exact same information.
1056000	1074000	And the reason this works is because we are we as living things we are composed of a multi scale competency architecture. Every layer in the in the body has certain capacities for solving problems in various spaces so all the way up it's not just
1075000	1094000	brains and behavior that does this, it's all of the different components. And this is, this is what we're going to talk about today. Now, something very I find very interesting Alan Turing, who was of course the forefather of computer science and really thought a lot of thought very deeply about what is intelligence, what are
1095000	1105000	minds, how can they be implemented and so on. And so he was interested in plot problem solving machines and intelligence through reprogrammability so reprogrammable machines.
1105000	1122000	He also wrote this paper, which was on the chemical basis of morphogenesis the generation of order out of a well mixed chemical system. Now, why would somebody who's interested in, in intelligence and minds and reprogrammability and so on, be worried about what's happening with the chemicals in early
1122000	1137000	embryos. I think that Turing saw a very profound symmetry between the problem of where minds come from and the problem of where bodies come from I actually think it's the same problem. And although he didn't write much about it at all as far as I know, I think he understood very
1137000	1149000	well, the, the, the fact that these are fundamentally the, in a deep sense the same problem. And so, so let's talk about where do bodies come from so so we start life like this.
1149000	1162000	A collection of cells of embryonic blastomers, and eventually you get this this is a cross section through a human torso. Look at the amazing complexity of all of these different components everything is the right shape the right size next to the right thing.
1162000	1181000	Where is this pattern stored. Now, a lot of people today would say well it's in the DNA of course it's in the genome, but we can read genomes now we know that this pattern isn't in the genome, any more than the structure of a of an insect colony or the precise shape of a spider web is in their genome genomes
1181000	1196000	we can talk about shapes genomes to specify proteins, little tiny hardware that every cell gets to have. And so now we need to understand. Okay, so given that hardware how does the, how does the system know what to build, how do they know when to stop.
1196000	1203000	How do we convince them to repair or recreate when something is missing. And as engineers we can ask one more thing.
1204000	1213000	How do we push them to do something else cells with exactly the same genome what else would they be willing to build if we convinced them that they should be building something different how might we do that.
1213000	1220000	Well as we think in towards the future of what what our field of regenerative medicine should look like.
1220000	1229000	What I'm talking about is something that I call the anatomical compiler. The idea is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a computer.
1229000	1243000	Draw the animal or plant that you want the shape of it. And what the system will do is compile down to a set of stimuli that need to be given to cells to get them to build exactly that in this case this nice three headed flatware.
1243000	1252000	We need this first there's a very practical reason is because birth defects traumatic injury cancer aging degenerative disease all of these things would go away.
1252000	1260000	If we knew how to convince groups of cells to build specific things. So all of the all of these are problems of information processing.
1260000	1267000	Also more more fundamentally, it would mean that we've solved the really deep questions of morphogenesis of evolution and so on.
1267000	1276000	The thing to keep in mind then is that this this anatomical compiler is not a 3D printer. It's not about micromanaging the position of cells you're not trying to build this from scratch.
1276000	1287000	It's a translation device it communicates your anatomical goals to the cellular collective so that it would be motivated to build them that that's the that that's the dream of the technology.
1287000	1298000	We are extremely far away from having this and you might wonder why, because molecular biology genetics has been going full tilt for decades why are we still so far away from it.
1298000	1305000	And it's basically the fact that we are very good at molecular information we're very good at moving around molecules and so on.
1305000	1311000	We really don't understand large scale shape change at all we don't have any of these capabilities yet.
1311000	1318000	And that's because we and in biology are still basically stuck where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.
1318000	1331000	All of our most exciting technologies today so CRISPR genomic editing, a pathway engineering, a protein design all of these things are about the hardware this is this is what it looked like to program a computer at that time.
1331000	1339000	But now, when we want to switch from Microsoft Word to Photoshop, you don't get out your soldering iron and start rewiring your computer.
1339000	1351000	Why not, because we have understood in computer technology, the incredible benefit of taking advantage of the reprogrammability and the competency of your medium it doesn't have to be all through the hardware.
1351000	1364000	So what biology is largely missing still and what what we're just scratching the surface of is how to take advantage of and cooperate with the intelligence with the competencies of the medium in which we are trying to engineer.
1364000	1372000	What do I mean by intelligence. What I don't mean is human level reflexive metacognition where you know how smart you are you know your goals and so on.
1372000	1377000	I don't mean that I mean a much more basic thing that defines the whole continuum of intelligence.
1377000	1385000	And I think William James said it best when he said that intelligence is a degree of the ability to reach the same goal by different means.
1385000	1396000	It's very much. It's a cybernetic definition, it's a teleological definition because it focuses on not what the system is made of or how it got here it focuses on the fact that it has a goal.
1396000	1406000	And it has some mechanism for achieving that goal and the question is what kinds of novel scenarios what kind of perturbations is that mechanism able to deal with.
1406000	1417000	So for example, if you have two magnets they're separated by a piece of wood, the magnet is never going to go around to meet its other magnet, because in order to do that it would have to temporarily get further from its goal.
1417000	1422000	And that delayed gratification is not something that magnets can do they're too simple for that.
1422000	1435000	Of course, in his example, Romeo and Juliet are separated by all sorts of physical and social barriers they have all kinds of long term planning all kinds. It didn't end well granted but but they have all kinds of other ways to to try to get around these
1435000	1442000	barriers, and then in between you have all these other things you have cells and autonomous vehicles and various kinds of animals and so on.
1442000	1448000	Let's talk about this very specifically what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy.
1448000	1458000	Well let's look at development first. So we know development is reliable. So, so, so almost all of the time, human embryos give rise to human human bodies.
1458000	1473000	It's very reliable that in itself is not much much intelligence that is simply the kind of the working out of kind of emergent complexity, but there's more to it than that it's the fact that you can actually achieve that from different starting states.
1473000	1482000	So, if you cut embryos in half or into pieces, you don't get half bodies you get perfectly normal mono zygotic twins triplets quadruplets and so on.
1482000	1495000	This system can navigate to its goal this ensemble of states corresponding to the normal human target morphology in this anatomical space from different starting positions and avoiding various local maxima.
1495000	1505000	Some creatures can do it throughout their lifespan so here's an axolotl. These guys regenerate their limbs their eyes their jaws their ovaries portions the brain and heart.
1505000	1517000	And the way it happens is that if you amputate anywhere here, it will rapidly these cells will work very hard to grow and remodel, and then the most amazing thing happens which is that then they stop.
1517000	1531000	That's really the most incredible part of regeneration is that they know when to stop. So, so when I talk about anatomical goals, I mean this capacity not just that you get a complex limb out of a bunch of biochemical reactions, but the fact that if you try to deviate it from this
1531000	1541000	production, it will actually do its do its best spend all kinds of energy to get back there and then it stops. That is the basis of goal directed behavior in this anatomical space.
1541000	1555000	So humans and other mammals can do it a little bit so humans regenerate their liver human children regenerate their fingertips, dear regenerate antlers so the same structure, a centimeter and a half of new bone per day when they're regenerating
1555000	1570000	So we have this we have this a little bit but we're not we're not great at it, but some creatures are amazing. I want to show you one example of what I mean by a kind of creative problem solving by this by the salamander.
1570000	1582000	So, so these amphibians. Here's a cross section through a normal kidney to build is about eight to 10 cells that work together to build this build this to build one one trick you can do is
1582000	1594000	force the cells to have extra numbers of chromosomes. And if they if you do that the cells get bigger. So amazing thing number one is that you still get a normal new even though it has multiple copies of its genome that doesn't seem to bother it.
1594000	1596000	So, so no problem.
1596000	1600000	But the cells get bigger and when the cells get bigger than newt stays the same size.
1600000	1607000	And the only way that's going to happen is, is a fewer cells now participate in this thing. And that's in fact that's what they do.
1607000	1615000	The most amazing thing happens when you make, I think this is a six and five and poly ploid newts that have way too much genetic material.
1615000	1624000	These guys actually make make enormous cells and there's only room for one so what does the cell do it bends around itself to give you that same lumen.
1624000	1637000	So look at what's happening here to two things to notice first that in the service of a large scale anatomical outcome having a tubule, the system calls up different molecular mechanisms in this case cell to cell communication in this case cytoskeletal
1637000	1648000	bending to achieve its goal. Same goal by different means that is a kind of intelligence. The other thing that's going on here is, just think about this from the perspective of a new embryo you're coming into the world.
1648000	1659000	You don't have to be able to construct yourself, not knowing how many copies of your genomic constructions you're going to have. You don't know how big your cells are going to be you don't know how many cells you're going to have is a lot you don't know.
1659000	1668000	And in these novel environments, not only the external environment is novel but your own parts you can't even rely on your own parts. All of that is changing too.
1668000	1683000	And this remarkable ability not just to make complexity but to make to make specific functional anatomies despite novelty and novel situations is a key aspect of intelligent behavior in anatomical space.
1683000	1691000	Another another example that that I like a lot this is something we discovered years ago that tadpoles need to become frogs.
1691000	1697000	So in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so they have to move their eyes their mouth or their nostrils everything has to move around.
1697000	1704000	And it used to be thought that this was a hardwired process every one of these organs moved in the right direction the right amount and you get your from.
1704000	1713000	So this is why it's important to do experiments and these things and not just assume what we did was, we created so called Picasso tadpoles where we basically scrambled all the craniofacial organs.
1714000	1729000	The eyes on top of the head the mouth is off to the side it's totally scrambled. Well these things it turns out remodel into quite normal frogs, because all of the organs will move in new paths in fact sometimes they go too far and actually have to double back until they get to a
1729000	1745000	correct frog face. And so what the genetic actually genetics actually gives you is a highly competent system that can reduce error it's an error minimization scheme what it's able to do is keep working until it gets to its goal it doesn't blindly
1746000	1760000	just go the same way and hope everything works out. So that raises a very obvious question how does it know what a correct frog face looks like how does it remember the set point right any any homie aesthetic process like this has to be able to store a set point.
1760000	1768000	We started studying the one uncontroversial example of cell groups that store goals and that's the brain, and in the brain.
1768000	1779000	This is all done by by an electrochemical network cells here by using these little ion channels these little proteins that allow ions like sodium potassium and so on to get in and out.
1779000	1788000	They acquire a voltage state that voltage state propagates to its neighbors and the whole network can now store and process information, for example, it can keep goal states.
1788000	1802000	This is what physiology looks like in a zebra fish this group made an amazing video. And the commitment of neuroscience is that if you were to be able if you were to measure all this physiology and be able to decode it, then you would know what the animal is thinking about you
1802000	1806000	would be able to get at the memories the goals the preferences, all of that stuff.
1806000	1821000	So it turns out that evolution caught on to this the fact that these electrical networks can serve as a kind of cognitive glue they can bind individual cells together into a collective that remembers and executes goal,
1821000	1830000	implementing behaviors that are much larger than any of the individual cell that that was discovered around the time of bacterial biofilms it's extremely ancient.
1830000	1844000	So, so every cell in your body has ion channels, most of them have these electrical connections to their neighbors they're called gap junctions. And what we started to ask was, could we could we take the deep lessons of neuroscience.
1844000	1853000	And it turns out that not only not only can you can you appropriate the lessons of neuroscience but actually all of the tools. So the drugs, the optogenetics all the tools of neuroscience.
1853000	1867000	And can we ask, what was the body thinking about before it had a brain, both evolutionarily and developmentally, could we read the electrophysiology of the body cells and ask if there was a collective here that's that made decisions and anatomical space, the way that
1867000	1880000	brains help us make decisions in three dimensional space. So we developed the first tools the first molecular tools to read and write the information into the non neural mind of the body so.
1880000	1888000	So here is a an early frog embryo you can that we're using a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye so this is real data these are this is not a simulation.
1888000	1896000	This is a real embryo you can see all the electrical conversations that the cells are having with each other, who's going to be head tail top and bottom and so on.
1896000	1907000	We do a lot of computational simulation to try and understand how how all of this works. I want to show you an example of what these pattern memories look like the first we call the electric face.
1907000	1918000	This is an early frog embryo putting its face together it's a time lapse video about probably probably about 12 to 18 hours. And what you're seeing here is here's one frame out of that video.
1918000	1929000	You see that the voltage patterns what we're tracking here is the voltage of each individual cell is being reported already before long before the genes come on to regionalize that face.
1929000	1937000	Already you can see here's where the mouth is going to go here's where the animals right eyes going to go here are the placards, the left eye comes in shortly after that.
1937000	1949000	This is this is what the cells are remembering as what a correct tadpole faces this is what they're going to build. We know this is important for normal face development because if we move any of these or change any of these patterns.
1949000	1954000	The gene expression will change and the anatomy will change the suit I'm going to show you this in a minute.
1954000	1959000	So that's the normal pattern and you might want to monitor that for birth defects and so on.
1959000	1970000	This is a pathological pattern that you get when you inject a human oncogene into this. So eventually it'll make a tumor, but long before that you can already see these cells are electrically disconnecting from their neighbors they're
1971000	1979000	not interested in what the collective has to say about what they should be building. They're now amoebas at this point the rest of the body is just external environment to them.
1979000	1986000	And we'll talk about this shifting border between self and world and how the cognitive light cone of these cells shrinks.
1986000	1993000	So looking at these patterns is great but the more important thing is can we rewrite them can we show that they're functionally important.
1993000	2000000	And the way we do that is not with there are no applied fields there are no magnets there's no electromagnetic radiation there are no waves no frequencies.
2000000	2013000	What we're doing is we're hacking the interface that the cells normally use to hack each other. This is how cells normally control each other they could through through the ion channels and the gap junctions that are on their surface.
2013000	2018000	So we developed some some tools to read and write electrical states into these tissues.
2018000	2032000	Now, I'll show you some examples of what happens when you do that the by the way when we first proposed this quite quite some time ago, everybody thought that membrane voltage was a housekeeping parameter and that basically if you mess with it what you get is
2032000	2038000	uninterpretable death toxicity and death. And I'm going to show you that that in fact is not what happens.
2039000	2049000	This is one one one of the early examples where what we can do is I showed you that electric face and there was a little voltage pattern that is the deter that was where the eye was going to form.
2049000	2062000	And what happens if you move that pattern somewhere else and you can do that by taking an early frog embryo, injecting some cells that are going to be this posterior part of the animal, inject them with some RNA that encodes a particular
2063000	2074000	potassium in this case it's a potassium ion channel. So when you inject this RNA what it's going to do is is cause the cell to have a new kind of potassium flux which will change the voltage to be a little spot that's like that I spot.
2074000	2085000	Guess what happens when you do that the cells get the message very rapidly and they become an eye. If and they so here's the eye sitting on the gut of the animal if you do that these eyes have the right lens and read and all the same stuff.
2085000	2091000	And there's a few interesting things that you learn from this first you learn that bio electric these bioelectric pattern memories are instructive.
2091000	2100000	Okay, it's not about messing things up you can actually call up new organs by telling by giving them the pattern they're supposed to be that resetting the memory of these cells of what it is that they're building.
2100000	2109000	That's first. Second, it's very modular all the all the competencies in the recipient I mean we didn't put in enough information to say how to make an eye.
2109000	2117000	We just, we just said build an eye here, and they do all the rest they already know how to build an eye but but they needed to be convinced to do so.
2117000	2130000	Also you find out that this that these these cells in the developmental biology textbook it'll tell you that these cells, anything beyond behind this this front of the head here is incompetent to make eye.
2130000	2139000	This is where we need to learn a lot of humility because every assessment of competency or intelligence is basically us. We ourselves are taking an IQ test.
2139000	2146000	Yes, if you prompted with the so called master I gene pack six, then yeah they're not going to make an eye that only works up here in the front of the head.
2146000	2153000	But if you find the thing that they that they actually respond to which is this this bioelectric prompt, then in fact you find out that there are plenty competent to do it.
2153000	2160000	It's not their competency that's that's in question here it's how good are we at recognizing the right way to communicate our goals to these cells.
2160000	2169000	And finally, this I thought was pretty cool which is that this is a lens sitting out in the tail of a tadpole somewhere. The blue cells are the ones we injected.
2169000	2174000	Okay, these are the ones that we gave them the potassium flow to try to convince them to be an eye.
2174000	2179000	But what they did was they recruited a bunch of their neighbors to help because there's not enough of them to make an eye.
2179000	2192000	And these these cells we didn't touch any of these cells directly they they recruited their neighbors, and of course other collective intelligence is do this too so ants and termites will recruit their buddies to help them move something that's too big and so on.
2192000	2205000	So, so, so now you're starting to see how we can actually read and write the, the information, but but the recipient is not a blank canvas it's actually a very competent material it knows how to do all kinds of things that we do not have to teach it to do.
2205000	2214000	So this is leading to some regenerative medicine application so there's a frog that when they lose their legs 45 days later, nothing happens they don't regrow them.
2214000	2226000	We developed a bio electric cocktail that triggers regeneration. It's again so within 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail, all the pro regenerative genes are coming on here.
2226000	2230000	Eventually a pretty respectable leg that's touch sensitive and Motile.
2230000	2241000	So for a year and a half the intervention is only 24 hours. It's not a matter of micromanagement it's not a matter of telling every cell what it has to be you're talking to the stem cells are controlling gene expression isn't any of that.
2241000	2251000	It's right at the beginning, trying to give the cells a prompt a trigger that says go to the leg building region of more space not to the scarring region.
2251000	2269000	So for a year, I must do a disclosure because David Kaplan and I have a spin off company called Morphosuticals, where we're trying to use bioreactors on limb wounds of rodents to try to get limb regeneration happening in in mammals, so stay tuned for that.
2270000	2278000	I'm going to switch gears for a couple minutes and talk about another place where you can actually see these pattern memories, and that is with a plan area.
2278000	2288000	So plan area are very interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, they are highly regenerative so you can cut them into pieces every piece remembers what the entire worm is supposed to look like.
2288000	2291000	Okay, so every piece regenerates into a collect one.
2291000	2296000	The record I believe is something like 275 pieces.
2296000	2308000	They're highly regenerative they are cancer resistant, and they are immortal. So these asexual worms here which reproduced by fission. They do not age. Okay, there's no no such thing as an old asexual planarian.
2308000	2310000	Now they do all this.
2310000	2319000	I would have said a couple years ago I would have said despite now I say because of because I think now we kind of understand more about how this works and incredibly noisy genome.
2320000	2330000	They can be mix employed every cell has a different number of chromosomes, because being being reproducing by fission so they pull themselves and happen and regenerate.
2330000	2339000	They don't throw away all of the somatic mutations the body mutations that we do when we reproduce right your children do not inherit all the mutations that you got in your body.
2339000	2348000	These guys do and for that reason, their genome is a mess, and yet they're the ones with the highly regenerative cancer resistance and immortality.
2348000	2358000	So, we wanted to ask a very simple question when we when we cut a planarian into thirds you get this middle fragment like this. How does this middle fragment know how many heads, it's supposed to have.
2358000	2367000	There's an electrical circuit that specifies the fact that they normally need to have one head and this is extremely reliable this happens correctly all the time.
2367000	2373000	But what you can do and so here's the circuit we you can see one head, one tail, and that's and that's what they will build.
2373000	2381000	What we've been able to do is rewrite this information to say no two heads and it's a little bit messy the technology still in its infancy but we can say two heads.
2381000	2389000	If you do that, this middle fragment will build a two headed worm. Now, the amazing thing about this is that this is not an electrical map of this creature.
2389000	2396000	This is an electrical map of an anatomically normal one headed animal in which we changed the representation.
2396000	2404000	If you don't cut him he say stays one headed there's not there's nothing wrong with him of anatomically there's nothing wrong with him in terms of gene expression which is what you're seeing here.
2404000	2419000	It's only when you when you amputate that the tissue actually consults the memory to know what to do. So it is a latent memory, but also it is a counterfactual memory is not true for this creature right now it is a memory of what it's going to do in the future, if it gets injured.
2419000	2429000	It's the ability this is this is showing you two things first I promised you that we were going to see what these pattern memories actually look like to read them out of the collective intelligence of the brain this is it.
2429000	2436000	When you ask how does it know how many heads literally this is it this is the memory that that that stores it.
2436000	2443000	And the second, the second thing is that it is able to store a representation of what to do that is different from what's going on now.
2443000	2450000	People in cognitive neuroscience call that mental time travel the ability to hold thoughts about things other than what's going on right now so past and future.
2450000	2460000	The body and the collective intelligence of this of this creature is able to do this primitive thing this is I think where a lot of our cognitive tricks come from is this kind of stuff.
2460000	2470000	So the body of a planarian can store at least one of two different memories of what a proper planarian is going to look like to guide future regenerative events.
2470000	2479000	If you have any good memory, this thing remarkably is stable. So if I take these two headed worms and I continue to cut them in plain water no more manipulation of any kind.
2479000	2486000	They continue in perpetuity to regenerate to headed, even though their genome is perfectly normal we never touch the genome there's nothing wrong with their genome.
2486000	2499000	But that's not where the memory is. Okay, so if you ask, where is the memory. It's, it's, it's, it's a subtle question I mean the genetics certainly gives you a piece of hardware that by default comes with the memory that's as one head,
2499000	2504000	the memory is not nailed down by that hardware is actually rewritable. And so here you can see these.
2504000	2512000	You can see these worms hanging out. Not only can you convince them to have the wrong number of heads you can actually convince them that there are different species.
2512000	2521000	So, by cutting off the head of this triangular planarian, you can chase it into attractors and anatomical space that correspond to other species head shapes.
2521000	2537000	So in a flathead like this Pifolina round head like this S Mediterranean, but 100 and between 100 and 150 million years distance between these species and this, but the hardware has no problem visiting these other morphogenetic attractors the way that these species
2537000	2546000	normally do this is where they normally live. And not only the head shape but actually the shape of the brain and the distribution of stem cells becomes just like these other species.
2546000	2561000	So, we now are starting to really see the, the power of this of this reprogrammability the idea that the cells are building to a specification it's not just a feed forward thing where certain will certain rules get acted out and it is what it is.
2561000	2576000	It actually is tracking towards a specific end goal and it's actually minimizing error relative to that end goal. Now, what I want to talk about is that I'm not only can we change the, not only can we change the goals.
2576000	2590000	We can change the size of the goals and evolution already did this so so the goals of this of this little organism are extremely small, you can imagine the cognitive like own which is the size of the biggest goal it can muster are very small all it cares about are
2590000	2600000	things that are happening within this time and space of this of the single cell, but when they come together what evolution did leveraging by electrical networks and various other things.
2600000	2614000	What it did was allow this collective to think of grandiose goals, huge, the idea that were that we're building this giant limb and by the way if the limb gets damaged we're going to have to rebuild and we're not happy until the limb is is complete at that point,
2614000	2627000	the error drops and everything you know everything quiet down, but but the size of the goal of the size of the goals is scaling up. And then of course it that has a failure mode, which is cancer in cancer the size of the goals scales down these these
2627000	2635000	are glioblastoma cells back down to their amoeba they're very modest amoeba like goals of proliferation and going wherever life is good.
2635000	2651000	That's metastasis. So that leads to a to a very specific research program directly in the field of cancer which is, instead of trying to kill these cells with toxic chemotherapy, could we try to reinflate their goal states, could we try to raise
2651000	2670000	their collective IQ so that they would go back to these these lofty plans of building skin and livers and so on. And so when you do this and so we've done this, we were able to inject human oncogenes and then co inject some some ion channel
2670000	2685000	cells that would force the cells to remain in electrical connectivity. And here you can see even even nasty oncogenes like KRAS, it's strongly expressed in fact it's all over the place. This is the same animal there's no tumor, because these cells that the genetics are broken but the
2685000	2693000	physiology is what drives. It's the, it's the, it's the fact that they're connected to a collective and the collective is remembering what it's supposed to be doing.
2693000	2710000	There's an overview of a couple more things to say after that, and an overview of what I think is going on with the future of medicine and the reason that these these deep questions that that JTF and, and, and people who are interested in in
2710000	2722000	collective intelligence the reason all this matters so much is because everything in biomedical interventions has been focused around here these bottom up micromanage kind of things you know surgery and synthetic biology and so on.
2722000	2735000	But, but there's a whole there's a whole ocean of opportunity here around we didn't even talk about this stuff behavior shaping and trying to train networks but all of these prompts and triggers, and which we'll talk about momentarily a gentle implants
2735000	2749000	and so on, that are really targeting the protocognitive capacities of cells and tissues we're not micromanaging it. We are trying to convince them to get buying and convince them using all of the tools.
2749000	2760000	And this is this is why why this is an empirical question, because basically the hypothesis is simply this you can use the tools of behavioral and cognitive science to control these things it's not all about bottom up chemistry.
2760000	2775000	My claim is that and you can see that you can see the details here and everything spelled out in these papers. My claim is that future medicine is going to look a lot more like a weird kind of somatic psychiatry not so much like chemistry and bio electricity is that
2776000	2786000	it's the it's the same thing that that is used in mind body medicine, but it's that that bio physical mechanism that holds and and maintains them.
2786000	2797000	The set points for these collective collective cell groups and that is what we can hack. And I want to point out that we are actually not the only.
2798000	2814000	We're not the only hackers. If you look at an acorn, this is what it makes this is the typical oak leaf, and you might because of how reliable this is you might get the idea that what the oak genome knows how to do is build exactly this flat green thing.
2814000	2824000	And that's what that's what that's what genomes are good for. But there's this which is this amazing evolved bio engineer this little this little parasite wasp.
2824000	2837000	And what it will do is lay lay down an egg and some other chemicals that prompt the cells to build this incredible goal. So this is not made up of wasp cells this is made up of the plant cells.
2837000	2850000	And it is also not an example of genetic modification this this this creature has figured out how to prompt a new competency from these leaves with that we would have never known right if this if this hadn't happened.
2850000	2857000	We have no idea that a genome that typically builds a flat green things like this is actually capable of building something like this.
2857000	2871000	And this is what we need to understand actually we need to understand the, the capabilities that that latent space around the one kind of work or maybe a couple outcomes that we see this goes way deeper than just developmental plasticity.
2871000	2881000	So I want to show in the last few minutes I just want to show you some some examples of rebooting multi cellularity. This is, this is the beginnings of what we call the construction of xenobots.
2881000	2892000	What we did was take some epithelial skin cells off of an orally frog embryo, they could do many things they could do where they could have died they could have spread out formed a nice two dimensional monolayer.
2892000	2910000	Instead what they do is here overnight they they collide they call us together. Okay, and they become this it's a little self contained self motile organism that uses little silly little hairs that are normally typically used to move mucus down the body of the of the
2910000	2920000	temple. And, and this is what they used to swim, and they can go in circles they can kind of patrol back and forth, they can have collective behaviors of different kinds.
2920000	2925000	Here's one, going down a maze so so here it is swimming down.
2925000	2933000	It's going to take this corner without bumping into the opposite wall so it takes the corner, and at this point it turns around for some internal reason that we don't know and it goes back where it came from.
2933000	2946000	The idea is to understand what else are cells and tissues capable of and more fundamentally, where do these goals come from. Here's something interesting that these that these guys can do it's called kinematic self replication.
2946000	2953000	When provided with a loose collection of cells, what they will do is run around and collect them into little piles.
2953000	2963000	And because they're working with an agent material, the same way that evolution wasn't the same that way that we as engineers were working with, not a passive material but a bunch of cells.
2963000	2974000	These little piles mature, and guess what they become they become the next generation of xenobots. And when they mature, what do they do they repeat the process and do exactly the same thing and you get multiple generations.
2974000	2987000	Now, this is this is quite interesting because we could ask, what did the frog genome learn. Well, the traditional story is that it provided this solution to the problem of how to survive a frog environment and then this is what it learned.
2987000	2999000	And here are the standard developmental stages and then here's the tappel behavior, but it also can do this and here's the weird developmental stages of a xenobot and then completely different behaviors.
2999000	3013000	And the thing is, there's never been any xenobots before that there was never selection to be a good zen about no other creature reproduces by kinematic self replication. Why does this work where does it, where does it come from.
3013000	3026000	And I want to connect this this to the to the biomedical slant that we had a moment ago, which is which is this. I'm going to show you this little video. Watch, watch this little guy moving around, and I could ask what what do you think this is.
3026000	3039000	And I think that this is some a little proto organism that I got off of the bottom of a pond somewhere. And I'll tell you that if you sequence the genome of this thing what you see is 100% Homo sapiens.
3039000	3055000	This is made entirely of adult patient cells. And this is a road roadmap towards personalized agential interventions, but here's what I mean by that. The way we create these is, we get donor cells from from adult human patients no embryonic stuff going on here adult human
3055000	3066000	there's a particular protocol that causes them to become these little cilia lined, they start off as little organoids they get lined with the cilia and they start running around like the zenobots I showed you a moment ago.
3066000	3079000	So if you were thinking that well zenobots. I mean we know that embryos are pretty plastic and amphibia are also pretty plastic maybe it's some kind of weird frog specific thing that they do this you know developmental biologists call them animal caps.
3079000	3087000	Maybe this is just an animal catching. Well, if you think that way, what you wouldn't do is make anthrabots, but here we are here are the anthrabots.
3087000	3101000	And one thing that you can see so this is this this great stuff here are human neural cells plated on a petri dish, and we made a scar here like a like a scratch wound, basically, and what what you'll see is that is that these little
3101000	3111000	they can they can navigate the wound. And when they pile up at a particular location in this wound we call this a super bot because there's probably eight or nine or 10 of these things here.
3111000	3124000	What they do is they cause the the they cause the neurons to grow across the gap. A couple days later you lift them up and here's what you can see they took the two sides of the of the neural wound and they and they heal them together.
3124000	3136000	This is this is just the first thing we discovered no no doubt this is just the beginning of all kinds of unexpected things, but who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which sit quietly for decades in your airway.
3136000	3153000	Actually, if given the opportunity could come together form a different kind of life form with different behaviors with the ability to heal other body tissues in your body without any genetic modification without any need for
3153000	3166000	immunosuppression if these things are used in the body that they're your own cells. They share all the priors with you with your body about what health and diseases what inflammation is they don't have to be genetically engineered there are no scaffolds here
3166000	3176000	no weird nano materials. It's just releasing the natural healing competencies of your own cells. There is so much that we don't know about what these, what all these guys are capable of.
3176000	3184000	I want to I want to end here just by by saying this that because because life is so good at remapping information.
3184000	3193000	Life basically assumes that everything is going to change evolution and mutation means your body is going to change the environment is going to change everything's going to change.
3193000	3210000	So every embryo and every new morphogenic system has to not take the priors too seriously and remap what it knows on to a new context I've shown you many examples of that, which means that life is incredibly interoperable any combination of evolved material,
3210000	3223000	modern material and software is some kind of agent. We already have some examples of cyborgs and hybrids and you're going to have humans with all kinds of different proportion of new parts and new new organs and so on.
3223000	3236000	All of this all of this is coming. Everything that Darwin meant when he said endless forms most beautiful is a tiny corner of this state space of possible bodies and minds which is going to be here with us in the coming decades.
3236000	3252000	It means that we have to drop some old untenable categories these binary categories of man machine know all this stuff. These are no good. We're going to have to get beyond questions of what do you look like and how did you get here meaning randomly evolved
3252000	3267000	in order to understand how to ethically relate to others we are going to have to work out ways to relate to minds and bodies that are nowhere on the tree of life with us that are not like us, and come up with much better categories than what we've been working with
3268000	3283000	and what we call AI right now these language models, which are everybody's arguing about them and they are so easy to distinguish from the kinds of things that we have been dealing with in the human world, but but they are not the they are not the difficult case they are just the
3283000	3292000	kind of first part, we are going to have all sorts of hybrid beings that are that are part evolved part designed and part software.
3292000	3311000	So, okay, I'm going to stop here and just just tell you that summarized what I've said intelligence is everywhere. We need to raise rise above our poor ability to recognize it and unfamiliar guys is this is going to be critical for biomedicine and for the ethical flourishing of not just humanity but all sentient beings.
3311000	3325000	We have a research agenda, a principle framework to try to get beyond these old polls of teleophobia on the one hand and animism on the other hand, JTF has been hugely important in this in this arena and I'm extremely grateful for that.
3325000	3340000	And the future consists of dumping these these concepts which are not going to serve as well and move forward in a couple of really interesting areas. So I'm just going to thank the people the postdocs and grad students who contributed to this work.
3340000	3353000	Again, thanks to the the JTF for the funding that has moved a lot of this forward across collaborators and most of all the animal model systems that we learn from. So thank you very much.
3353000	3364000	Thank you, Mike. That was super stimulating. Everything that I had hoped for in your talk so I'm going to close us down since we're on the hour I want to thank you again Mike for joining us and thank you so much.
3364000	3367000	And we're chatting with you more in the future.
3367000	3369000	Absolutely. Anytime. Thank you all so much.
3369000	3371000	Bye.
