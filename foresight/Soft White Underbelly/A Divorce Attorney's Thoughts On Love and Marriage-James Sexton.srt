1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,520
I had a period of time after my divorce

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,880
where I was really ambitious when it came to women.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,040
But then it felt like a job.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,600
Like it felt like a job after a while

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,320
where I was like, God, it's like enough.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,800
It's kind of enough.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,040
You know, like it's like,

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,280
it's like when you've eaten so much

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,620
that you just go, I got that way with posse.

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,800
Like it really was like I just had enough.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,960
Like I was fine.

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,080
I was like, this is great, but.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,360
Well, when you're in your 20s or 30s,

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,480
maybe your libido is a strong meal.

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,880
It makes you insane.

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,720
Yeah, yeah, I was not.

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,560
I definitely was.

18
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,000
As we age, we mellow.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah, which I think is great.

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,640
Although I have to tell you,

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,040
one of the most depressing divorces I ever did

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
was a guy who was, I think, 92.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
Oh, geez.

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,880
And what made it depressing is that he had left his wife

25
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,320
of, I don't know, 50 something, 60 something years

26
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
for a younger woman, a woman in her 50s.

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,400
And I just remember what was sad about it to me

28
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,640
was this guy still being led around by his dick.

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,480
Like I thought, oh my God.

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm gonna be chained to an idiot forever.

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,280
Like I'm gonna forever be led around by my dick.

32
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
And I remember thinking like, no,

33
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,840
I really thought that at like 90 something,

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
I would just like a beautiful woman would walk by

35
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,880
and I'd go, oh, there's a human being.

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Like there would be no.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
You'd appreciate it without.

38
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
Yeah, there would just be no sense of like, yeah.

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,440
You know, there would just, that would be gone from me.

40
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,320
And this guy's proof that 90 something years old

41
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,200
and you're still thinking with your dick, like I.

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,040
Redumed.

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
That terrified me.

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,720
It really did.

45
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
It actually upset me.

46
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,160
Because I thought, man, I thought at some point

47
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I'd get to experience what it's like to just be free.

48
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,680
If you live in New York where there's a financial industry,

49
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,760
there's all kinds of industries here.

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,600
Oh yeah.

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,760
But to me, sometimes I wonder if female attractiveness

52
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
isn't the highest valued commodity in our country.

53
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,800
100% it is.

54
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
100%.

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
It is.

56
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Yeah, yeah, of course.

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
Because men are becoming rich and powerful

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
in order to get a woman.

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Of course.

60
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,940
The woman they want.

61
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,780
Of course.

62
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,240
What an attractive woman.

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,480
And when I say attractive, I don't just mean attractive.

64
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,240
I mean, even just sexually confident.

65
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,100
I mean, what an unbelievably lucrative career that is.

66
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,360
Like I do divorces for people that,

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,200
you know, a woman walks out with $200, $300 million.

68
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
He was an analyst at Goldman Sachs

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
who built a hedge fund and then sold it

70
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
and then used his trading algorithm

71
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
to build it up to $500 million.

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,000
She was hot and slept with him for a while

73
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,480
and then stopped and started sleeping with other people

74
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,160
and playing tennis and having Botox.

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
And she's going to get half.

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Like that's fucking incredible.

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,120
Like, do you know what he had to do to get that?

78
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,520
And what she had to, I'll fuck that guy for $200 million.

79
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
Are you kidding me?

80
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,640
Like that's insane.

81
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,560
That's incredible.

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
Like, and God bless.

83
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
I mean, I'm not saying that this person,

84
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
this is the rules of the game, you know?

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
But you can't argue that that's not easier

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,760
than going to Harvard.

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
No, for sure.

88
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,480
But then the payoff, the trade off for that

89
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,000
is that when they hit a certain age,

90
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
the value decreases.

91
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,520
Right, any stock, if you hold it too long,

92
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
it's going to go down, you know?

93
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,800
Like, so play the stock the right way.

94
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
I mean, and that's what I think.

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
If we were a little more honest

96
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
about the nature of male-female coupling,

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I mean, right now we can't even, you know,

98
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,480
we can't even establish what is gender.

99
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,440
You know, we can't establish any of that anymore.

100
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,840
So divorce has become incredibly hilarious and fraught.

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,520
But to me, what is, like, sometimes you have to stand back

102
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,760
and look at things to get the real perspective

103
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
on what it is.

104
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
And sometimes you look back at marriage.

105
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,720
So when was it invented?

106
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,240
Like 2000 BC, roughly.

107
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,280
And the life expectancy of humans back then was 18 years old.

108
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,120
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
Marriage was created for...

110
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,600
Landownership.

111
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Landownership and things like that.

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
And if you're going to die in your early 20s or whatever,

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,880
then getting married at 16, 18 makes sense.

114
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Well, I think there's a distinction

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,680
that has to be made between pair bonds and marriage, right?

116
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Marriage is a government concept.

117
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
Marriage is a contract.

118
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,040
Marriage is a legal status.

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Pair bonds, right?

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,280
Two people go in it together, you know,

121
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
saying, hey, there's 7.3 billion people in the world

122
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,760
and the two of us, we're going to lock up together

123
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
and we're going to try to hold hands

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and get through this thing.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,320
Till we're eight years old.

126
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, until whatever, you know?

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
I mean, what's interesting is,

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,120
first of all, all marriages end.

129
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,160
They end and death are divorced, but they all end.

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
Like every marriage ends.

131
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
So it's one of the only things that you go,

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,800
wow, I really hope this ends in us dying.

133
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,560
You know, most things, that's not the desired outcome.

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
But in marriage, you hope marriage will end in death.

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
You hope that you will be together

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,160
until one or both of you die, you know?

137
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
But all marriages end.

138
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,480
But as a guy, as a provider,

139
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
if you knew it was going to end

140
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,360
and you were going to have to give away half your money,

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
you might think twice about doing it.

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
Well, I think that's what makes

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,840
being a divorce lawyer interesting,

144
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,680
is that it's a lot of what a court has to do

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,020
is disregard what happened in the marriage,

146
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,240
because A, the truth is at the bottom of a bottomless pit.

147
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,680
Like you're never going to get there.

148
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah, well, he's fucking his secretary.

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,000
Right, because you are not sleeping with me anymore.

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,880
I have a client whose wife acknowledges

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
she didn't sleep with him for six years.

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
What did you think was going on

153
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
if you didn't sleep with him for six years?

154
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
So you, okay, delegate.

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,680
You've delegated that responsibility.

156
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
If you don't want to have sex with him, that's okay.

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
No one should force you to have sex with this person.

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
Let him go have sex with someone else.

159
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
You don't want to do the laundry.

160
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,280
Hire someone to do the laundry.

161
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,680
If you don't want to mow your own lawn,

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
hire someone to mow the lawn.

163
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Delegate that responsibility.

164
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,120
And this guy wasn't even sleeping around.

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
He was going to those hand job places, you know,

166
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
where you get a massage and you get a hand.

167
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,520
Like what the most pathetic thing in the world,

168
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,400
the most innocuous thing in the world.

169
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
He didn't have a girlfriend.

170
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,760
There was no love involved.

171
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
He was getting jacked off for $50.

172
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,840
Like that's sad.

173
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,400
Like I mean, first of all, hand jobs.

174
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,120
Like that's an outdated technology.

175
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,880
That's like a Betamax, you know,

176
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
like who even does that anymore?

177
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,640
But he was doing this and he just thought, okay, that's fine.

178
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,080
She had the indignation to say he is not a,

179
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,800
he shouldn't be a custodial parent.

180
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,440
He's a terrible person because he's doing this.

181
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
And it was like, wait, how is that that much different

182
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,080
than going to a strip club?

183
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
How is that much more different?

184
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Cause we just, you know, he was like, well, should I deny it?

185
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,200
And I was like, is it true?

186
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,400
And he's like, well, yeah, I said, no, we should own it.

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's go in and say, yeah, you know what?

188
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Yeah, it's pathetic.

189
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,600
It's really pathetic.

190
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,360
My wife didn't sleep with me for six years and I'm human.

191
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,080
And I wanted to have sex still.

192
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
I didn't want to blow up my life.

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
I didn't want to screw up my kids

194
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
and have my kids have divorced parents.

195
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
So I thought, all right,

196
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,360
she's clearly not interested in me and more.

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm not going to have a girlfriend

198
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,040
and get caught up in all the things

199
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
where people could get hurt and there's feelings

200
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,560
and fatal attraction and stuff.

201
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm just going to go, it'll be transactional.

202
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,240
Like going to a strip club or anything else.

203
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,000
And I'm, yeah, is it a little pathetic

204
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that I'm a guy who makes a million dollars a year

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,120
in finance and I'm paying someone $50 to jack me off?

206
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, it's kind of pathetic, but you know what?

207
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,120
I figured it out.

208
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,720
But to suggest that that means I'm a bad parent,

209
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,280
that has nothing to do with my parenting at all, period.

210
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You know, so, and thankfully the judge agreed

211
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,240
with me on that one.

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,800
But I really do think that the idea,

213
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,880
I don't think, I mean, if you break it down fundamentally,

214
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,320
56% of marriages end in divorce.

215
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,560
But think about that's the ones that end in divorce.

216
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,680
So how many people, what percentage stay together

217
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,320
for the kids?

218
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Or cause they don't want to give away half their shit.

219
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Another 10% that's conservative.

220
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
Conservative.

221
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
But let's say 20% then, okay?

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
That's at least right.

223
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Now I have a technology that fails 76% of the time.

224
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,160
That's insane.

225
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
That's insane.

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
That's more likely than not.

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
76%, if I told you there's a 76% chance

228
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
when you walk out the door today

229
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,480
you're gonna get hit in the head with a bowling ball,

230
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,400
you would not go out or you'd wear a helmet for sure.

231
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
But people just continue to get married.

232
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Not only do they continue to get married,

233
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,200
there's a presumption that you should get married.

234
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
And if you don't get married,

235
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,420
there's something wrong with you.

236
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,840
So if you've got a girlfriend and you've been with her

237
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,640
for five years and you say to someone,

238
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,600
we're getting married.

239
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,680
They go, oh, that's great.

240
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
They don't go, why?

241
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,200
You're happy.

242
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Why would you get married?

243
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,560
Like everything's going fine.

244
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
Why would you put yourself through that?

245
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Why would you run that risk?

246
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,080
If you say to someone, we've been together five years

247
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,760
and we've decided we're not gonna get married.

248
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
We're gonna move in together,

249
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
but we're not gonna get married.

250
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,760
Ooh, what's wrong?

251
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,920
You got intimacy issues?

252
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,160
What's your problem?

253
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,520
Me want to set 56% end in divorce.

254
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,760
It literally fits the legal definition of negligence.

255
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,240
It's a negligent behavior.

256
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,320
The way you define negligence in law school

257
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,560
is when what you lose by not doing something

258
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,440
is lower than the risk of harm.

259
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,920
It's what's called a BPL analysis.

260
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,480
So the burden of not doing a thing

261
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,480
is lower than the likelihood, the probability of harm.

262
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,920
So BPLs, the burden, probability and loss.

263
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
Marriage is an inherently negligent activity.

264
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
It's like owning a lion.

265
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
Like the likelihood of someone getting hurt

266
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,040
seriously by this is very, very high.

267
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,440
You know, whatever says it to you, because why?

268
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
Because, and I would say to me,

269
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
I've been doing this for over 20 years

270
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,920
and I still get misty-eyed at weddings.

271
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
Like I still really, there's something in me

272
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
that goes like, you know, maybe it'll work out

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
for these two.

274
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
You still believe in much.

275
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
I absolutely believe in love.

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,360
I think love is wonderful.

277
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,720
But love and marriage have very little to do with each other.

278
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't think there's much of a correlation there.

279
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,960
I think that's where we got off track.

280
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
Like I believe in pair bonds.

281
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,480
I believe, I don't think I can learn everything

282
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,400
I need to know about myself from myself.

283
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,160
I think having someone around me who sees my blind spots

284
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,440
and that it doesn't have to be a romantic partner.

285
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,960
That could be a friend, that could be any number of things,

286
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,640
but there is something wonderful

287
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,160
about romantic connection.

288
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
We know that.

289
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,280
I mean, the other statistic is 56% of marriages

290
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,720
and in divorce, but 84% of people who get divorced

291
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,400
are remarried within five years of their divorce.

292
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
Really?

293
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Let's think about that.

294
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,680
So now you've done it and failed

295
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,480
and felt the pain of the loss

296
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,720
and within five years, 84% are remarried.

297
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
So when you fall in love

298
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,080
and you're with a partner who is in love with you,

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,960
it's like hard to put the brakes on and say,

300
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,160
you know what, that's as far as I'm gonna go.

301
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
Well, I think we, you know,

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
whoever discovered water, it wasn't a fish.

303
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,600
And I think when we're in a thing, we don't see it.

304
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,040
And so, I mean, and this is true of any of us.

305
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,400
There must be some endorphins,

306
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
something's being released in our brains.

307
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,280
Listen, you wanna test that theory.

308
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,520
The next time you're out with a couple

309
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,320
who've been together for a while

310
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
and it seems like they maybe got in a fight

311
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,400
or they're just like kind of being impatient

312
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
with each other at the table.

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
You know, when you go like a group thing.

314
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,520
Just say to them, so tell me about how you met.

315
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,040
Tell me the story of how you met

316
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
and everything on them changes.

317
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
At like, they go back to that place.

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,720
And there's this like, oh yeah, and she was this,

319
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,800
because for that second, you go back to that place.

320
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Like you can go, someone with a horrible divorce,

321
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
if you could get them to go to that place

322
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
and talk to you about that time.

323
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,680
Like I would say something, when I was a kid,

324
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
you know, like every kid, you have the fantasy of like,

325
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,640
if you were invisible, what would you do?

326
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
You didn't go to the girl's locker room, you know, whatever.

327
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,200
I have this fantasy that if I could be invisible,

328
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,040
I have about eight clients that I'd like to sneak into their

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
house and find their wedding album.

330
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,480
Like I know it's in the attic somewhere or something.

331
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,160
Cause I would love to see what it looked like

332
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
when these people loved each other.

333
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Because they are weaponized against each other now

334
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
and we are trying to kill each other

335
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,600
and we're taking every secret, every intimacy, everything.

336
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
At their ugliest.

337
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,000
At their ugliest, at their worst.

338
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,600
And there's something in me that just the thought that like,

339
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,720
you guys at some point, like at some point,

340
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,560
you were like, there's 7.3 billion people in the world

341
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,880
and you're the one.

342
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,720
Like you're the one I just want to be with and smell

343
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,120
and touch and like that feeling, we all know that feeling

344
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,240
of like just the electricity of another person, you know?

345
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
And I mean, I think I'm a romantic at heart

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
in the sense that I really get it.

347
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Like I really get why we do this.

348
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,400
I felt it, I know it, I understand it.

349
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,960
But tying that to the technology of marriage to me

350
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,280
makes almost no sense whatsoever.

351
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,000
And I actually think it's almost antagonistic

352
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,640
to that connection with another person.

353
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,040
Because there's so much expectation

354
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
that comes with marriage culturally.

355
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,640
We've created so much stuff around it.

356
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,600
Like when you marry someone, they're supposed to be,

357
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,760
at least in the modern Western model,

358
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,280
your best friend, best roommate, best co-parent,

359
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,280
best travel partner, best roommate, best everything,

360
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,680
best activity partner.

361
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Like how would one person be all of those things?

362
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
That's insane.

363
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,680
Like if I was interviewing for a job

364
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,120
and said, I want you to be the best typist

365
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,760
and I also want you to be best on the phone

366
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,240
and I also want you to be great at that.

367
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,200
And I ran down a list of dissimilar things.

368
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
Like wherever I went to an amazing chef

369
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,080
and I said, I know you're a great chef, but can you farm?

370
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,160
Like that has to do with food,

371
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,560
but they're not the same thing.

372
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,520
Like what are you talking,

373
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,160
so I think why do we put on people this idea?

374
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,960
Like whoever came up with the word soulmate,

375
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,120
really we should be paying,

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
like divorce lawyer should be paying that person dividends.

377
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Because we've convinced people that if this person

378
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,760
isn't meeting every one of your needs,

379
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,800
checking all of these boxes, they're not your soulmate.

380
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,560
Your soulmate would know exactly what to do,

381
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
exactly what to say at exactly the right time.

382
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,040
I can get, I go off on this stuff, tend to.

383
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
What do you think the secret is

384
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
is keeping a marriage vital, keeping it alive?

385
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,400
You know, I think people get unhappy in marriages

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
the way that people go bankrupt,

387
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,600
which is very slowly and then all at once.

388
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,360
I think it's very slow and then it just goes off a cliff.

389
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
So everybody will say, well,

390
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,520
we divorced because he was cheating or she was cheating

391
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,800
or we divorced because he had an alcohol issue

392
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
or a drug issue, which lately we're seeing more

393
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,760
like alcohol and drugs is a big, big thing,

394
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,920
especially post pandemic.

395
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,960
There's a tremendous amount of substance abuse stuff

396
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,440
that's causing a lot of issues in marriages.

397
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,520
And certainly like social media has increased

398
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,920
the accessibility of adultery and connections

399
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
to other people and reconnections

400
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,680
to people from your past who remind you

401
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,600
of a version of yourself that you felt more excited about

402
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,840
because you were younger.

403
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,040
So it's, you know, it used to be

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
if you like ran into the girl you banged in high school,

405
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,080
it was like once every 10 years at reunion, you know,

406
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,680
or if you lived in the same town as you grew up in,

407
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,080
you know, you might run into the person at the Walmart.

408
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,600
But now it's like on Facebook, you have all these excuses

409
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,080
to be able to chit chat with someone

410
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,080
and all these benign entry points, you know, of like,

411
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,240
oh, you know, I saw your pictures from vacation.

412
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,040
Where did you stay in Miami, you know?

413
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,160
And then it becomes, oh, yeah, well, you look great.

414
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,080
I mean, boy, you look fantastic in a bikini

415
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,120
and all of a sudden we're off to the races

416
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
and we're chatting with each other.

417
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
So I, you know, if we were gonna invent

418
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
like an infidelity machine,

419
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,000
you couldn't do better than Facebook and Instagram.

420
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,180
I mean, that's about as good as it gets.

421
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,180
But I genuinely think that the secret

422
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,560
to staying happy in a marriage is probably

423
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,560
the same secret to maintaining a healthy weight.

424
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,680
You know, don't wait till you get super fat

425
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,480
and then try to lose the weight.

426
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Don't wait until you get really sick.

427
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,360
Like my sister is a dentist and she always says,

428
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,240
if you have a toothache, there's nothing I can do really.

429
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,160
Like I can pull the tooth, I can give you a root canal,

430
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,720
but like I can prevent you from getting a toothache.

431
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,360
If you just come see me regularly

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
and you just floss and you just brush your teeth,

433
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
you'll never get a toothache.

434
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,160
By the time your tooth hurts,

435
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
something is already seriously wrong.

436
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
By the time you're in a divorce lawyer's office,

437
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,920
you're fucked, the whole thing's fucked at that point.

438
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,400
Like you'd be better off just, you know,

439
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,840
figuring out the preventative maintenance, right?

440
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,720
Like change the oil in your car.

441
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Like, so I, what I try to, if you reverse engineer divorce,

442
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,880
like most people, the marriage killer, you know,

443
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,800
the, like the cheating or the gambling or the whatever,

444
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,840
that's the symptom.

445
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Like the problem is these little disconnections, you know?

446
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,320
One of the, one of the best stories I have is my,

447
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,880
I had a client, I did her divorce,

448
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,920
and we'd spend a lot of time together because you do.

449
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
You know, when you're a divorce lawyer,

450
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
you spend a lot of time with people

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,240
and you get to know them very well.

452
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
I mean, people will lie to their therapist,

453
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,000
they won't lie to their divorce lawyer

454
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
because A, there's no reason to and B,

455
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,600
you know, I need to know everything

456
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,840
and it's all attorney-client privilege.

457
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,360
And this woman, we were sitting outside the courtroom

458
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,920
waiting on a break in testimony.

459
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,080
And she was a young woman in her,

460
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,720
in her probably like late 30s, you know?

461
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
Very attractive.

462
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,400
And we were just chit-chatting and I said to her,

463
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,120
you know, was there a moment when you realized

464
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
the marriage is over?

465
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
You know, like, was there a moment?

466
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,280
And she said, yeah, yeah.

467
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
And I said, when was it?

468
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,760
And she said, there was this granola that I like.

469
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,640
She said it, they only sold it

470
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
at like this particular grocery store.

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,920
And I like to put it in my yogurt.

472
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,440
And she said, he used to always,

473
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,720
whenever I'd be running low on it,

474
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,200
I would just open the thing one day

475
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,120
and a new bag would be there.

476
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,840
She's like, and I just, she's like,

477
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,560
it made me feel so loved.

478
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,000
Like he didn't, I didn't have to ask.

479
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
He didn't want credit for it.

480
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,480
Like he didn't go like, oh, did you see it?

481
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
I got your granola that you wanted, you know?

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,440
Like he just would do this thing, you know?

483
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
And she said, it was just something that like,

484
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
I just, it always made me smile.

485
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,720
She said, every time the granola was running low

486
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,040
and there was a new bag of granola,

487
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,800
I just felt very loved, you know?

488
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,640
And she said, one day the granola ran out.

489
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,000
And I thought, oh, that's weird.

490
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,480
You know, maybe he didn't see it.

491
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,560
She's like, so I left the bag in there

492
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,360
because I thought, well, at some point he'll notice.

493
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,300
And he didn't notice.

494
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,560
She goes, so I took the bag out and I waited.

495
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
And he didn't get a new bag.

496
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,280
And I thought, okay, this thing's going down.

497
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,760
And I thought to myself, wow, that's like,

498
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,660
you know, that's such a small thing, like granola.

499
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,320
Like you just, but these are the things.

500
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,480
Like these are the little things that make us feel loved

501
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
and that are gestures of love.

502
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,980
And when I said to her, was there anything like that

503
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,000
for you with him?

504
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
And she said, yeah, blowjobs.

505
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,400
And I almost spit out my coffee.

506
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,040
And she goes, no, she goes, when we were first dating

507
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,320
and even first married, she's like,

508
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,720
I used to give blowjobs a lot.

509
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,160
She's like, you know, she's like, do it in the morning,

510
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
just took two minutes.

511
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,320
And he was like super happy the rest of the day, you know?

512
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
She's like the rest of the day.

513
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,400
He would like call me or text me and be like,

514
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720
oh, I'm so good this morning.

515
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,560
You know, I had such pep in my step now.

516
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,920
And she's like, it was just like,

517
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,080
what did it really take out of my life to do that?

518
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
You know, and it made him feel good.

519
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,160
She's like, and then I got to a point where I was like,

520
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,480
well, you know what, no, I'll wait.

521
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
And then tonight we can both, we can have sex.

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
And we'll both enjoy that.

523
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,880
Like what is why I owe him a blowjob?

524
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,480
Like, no, you know, like I don't owe him that, you know?

525
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
And then she said, I got to a point where it was like,

526
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,160
I look back and I'm like, yeah, I guess I,

527
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,240
I didn't do that as often, hardly ever really, you know?

528
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Which came first.

529
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
You know, I said that to her and she said,

530
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
she said, I couldn't tell you.

531
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,840
She said, but I think it's the same thing.

532
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,680
The same thing.

533
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,880
And I do think it's the same thing.

534
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
And I'm not saying blowjobs and granola

535
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,560
is all you need to know, but,

536
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,960
and I'm not, by the way, I'm not saying that,

537
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
that a blowjob is a small thing.

538
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,880
I don't think I have any right to, I've never given one.

539
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,840
But it seems like a phenomenal feat.

540
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,200
And I'm grateful for everyone I've ever received.

541
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,200
But I don't, I don't think it's a massive investment,

542
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,600
right?

543
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,080
Just like buying someone's granola is not a massive.

544
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,920
But when you love somebody,

545
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,360
you love doing things for them.

546
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,640
Right, their pleasure pleases you.

547
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Their joy pleases you.

548
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Like their, their, you know, their happiness makes you happy.

549
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Exactly.

550
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,480
And somewhere along the line,

551
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,160
and it happens a lot in marriage,

552
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,560
it becomes, well, I'm not happy, why should you be happy?

553
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,400
You know?

554
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
And then that creates a spiral.

555
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,160
And I really believe that you can,

556
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,080
that spiral could go in the other direction.

557
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
Like if he did the granola,

558
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,880
I think the blowjobs would have come, you know?

559
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
And if the, like I,

560
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
and if the blowjobs were there,

561
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
I bet he'd have bought the granola.

562
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
Like I can't prove that.

563
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
There's no control group, you know?

564
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
I can't run that research.

565
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,280
But it feels to me like those little things,

566
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,520
like leaving a note, you know?

567
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,560
I've said to some of my friends, you know,

568
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,720
when they say to me like, you know,

569
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
as a divorce lawyer, you see all this misery,

570
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,480
like, what's, how do I stay out of your office?

571
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,800
And I'll often say, I'm like, it's dumb little things, man.

572
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm like, just leave her a note.

573
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm like, leave her a note in the morning.

574
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,160
Just leave a little note, says, hey, beautiful.

575
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,800
You know, so, it was so fun watching that movie

576
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,080
with you last night.

577
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
So glad we got to have a date.

578
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I'll be thinking of you today.

579
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,360
Love you.

580
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,960
Like, what does that take?

581
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
That takes like a minute.

582
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,840
Not even, like, and look what it can do.

583
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,120
Like, look at how that makes this person feel.

584
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,200
And even if right away, it doesn't work.

585
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
On that moment, it doesn't work.

586
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,960
Okay, do it enough times.

587
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Like, and then you're either gonna figure out

588
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,200
that this person's gone, and then just fucking bail.

589
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
You're done.

590
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,920
Like, because if you try for long enough,

591
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,920
and you give like that, but if you're not giving like that,

592
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,040
and then you're not getting back either,

593
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,640
well, I'm not surprised, you know?

594
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,120
That's how you end up in my office,

595
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,320
is this death spiral of everyone,

596
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,960
like, well, I'm not giving Guy and the Grinola

597
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,000
issues, not giving me blowjobs.

598
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,640
Well, I'm not giving him blowjobs, he's mean to me.

599
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,280
Okay, well, everybody's just gonna,

600
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,160
has an equal right to be fucking miserable then.

601
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,360
I think if you're happy with yourself,

602
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,680
be truly happy with who you are at that point in your life,

603
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,000
or whatever the situation is,

604
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,940
I think it's easier for you to be happy with your partner.

605
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,280
Yeah, but I would argue that if you're not happy

606
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,760
with yourself, having someone happy with you

607
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,400
is certainly not gonna hurt your feeling of who you are,

608
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
right?

609
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,200
Like, I don't need someone to tell me I'm handsome

610
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,440
for me to have a nice day,

611
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,960
but I can't think of anybody telling me I was handsome

612
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
that it ruined my day, you know?

613
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Most of the time, you're like, oh, that's nice,

614
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,000
you know, I got that going for me.

615
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
So yeah, I think self-love, of course,

616
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,120
is the most important love,

617
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,040
and to be secure in who you are,

618
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,560
and to not allow your self-definition

619
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
to be easily swayed or pulled.

620
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,720
Like, if you believe the good reviews,

621
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,560
you gotta believe the bad ones too, I get that,

622
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,960
but I just don't think kindness,

623
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,240
like, it's just such an easy,

624
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,780
especially if it's easy, like if it's easy stuff,

625
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,480
like just telling someone that they're beautiful

626
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,000
or handsome or that you're cheering for them.

627
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
To me with marriage, or pair bonds,

628
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,800
I shouldn't even say marriage,

629
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
like the world is trying to kill you all the time,

630
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,920
you know, like people are criticizing you all the time,

631
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,800
you feel like a failure a lot of the time,

632
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,640
if you compare yourself to other people,

633
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,000
you'll constantly be, you know,

634
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,920
comparisons the thief of joy.

635
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,000
So why not have like one person

636
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,720
who's just cheering for you, you know,

637
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,920
like constructive criticism is criticism.

638
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,200
It's still just criticism.

639
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,480
So if your spouse is just sitting around criticizing you

640
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
and telling you all the things you could do

641
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,480
to improve yourself, instead of just being a fan

642
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,680
and just saying, you know what,

643
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,160
I know who you are and you're beautiful,

644
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,600
I know who you are and your heart is good,

645
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,960
and betting on the best parts of a person,

646
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,840
I think that there's no,

647
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,680
there's very little downside to that, you know.

648
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,840
I think it would put guys like me out of business

649
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,040
if people really leveraged that the right way.

650
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,600
I asked you earlier, if you believe in love,

651
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,200
which you said you do, do you believe in marriage?

652
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,040
I mean, I believe people believe in marriage.

653
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
No, but to you.

654
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, do I believe in marriage?

655
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,760
I don't, I don't think it's a useful technology.

656
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
I understand culturally why people do it,

657
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,880
but I don't think people should need it.

658
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,480
I know I certainly don't need marriage.

659
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,160
I don't think marriage, I was married.

660
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,320
I was married before I really ever thought

661
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,160
about what does that mean, you know.

662
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,240
I married my college sweetheart, you know.

663
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,720
I hadn't, I got married because that's what you do,

664
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,160
you get married, you know.

665
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
But I hadn't thought about it as a technology

666
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,560
and why it's there.

667
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I didn't, I didn't understand it the way I do now.

668
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,120
You know, there's a line from a Joseph Brodsky poem

669
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,200
that he wrote when his wife died where he says,

670
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,880
I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.

671
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,800
And I feel that way as a divorce lawyer.

672
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,040
Like I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.

673
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,440
I wish I, I wish I didn't know what the end

674
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,880
of so many marriages looks like

675
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,640
because I think I would have a more optimistic

676
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
and unrealistic view of it.

677
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,240
I would-

678
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,960
Yeah, but you'd be divorced and giving away half your-

679
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,800
I'd be foolish.

680
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,640
Yeah, I'd be foolish.

681
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,800
I'd be as foolish, but I don't know that,

682
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,840
I don't know that it's always good to know, right?

683
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,320
Sometimes there's tremendous joy to be had

684
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,200
and like falling feels like flying for a little while,

685
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,880
you know, till you hit the ground, it feels really good.

686
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,000
As I said earlier, you know,

687
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,840
now that the life expectancy of man is around the 80s

688
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,320
or something, then it's like,

689
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,480
so you're gonna do this from your 20s or 30s until the 80s?

690
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,840
Well, marriage is a technology that was designed

691
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,240
for when women died in childbirth

692
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,120
and when men died in their 40s if they were lucky,

693
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,400
you know, 50s if they were super lucky.

694
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,120
Like if you were in your 50s, your 60s, you were an elder,

695
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,560
you know, that was pretty amazing.

696
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,600
Women, most women died in childbirth.

697
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,040
Like childbirth is traumatic.

698
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,240
It's a traumatic thing and before modern medicine

699
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,880
and before we understood antibiotics.

700
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,520
So marriages is, I don't think anyone ever planned

701
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,440
that it was gonna be, okay, we're gonna do this forever.

702
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,720
You know, we're gonna do this till we're 100.

703
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean, but I think that's part of a bigger problem.

704
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,640
You know, I don't remember who said it,

705
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,040
but I remember someone saying,

706
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,760
I can't remember who it was,

707
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,760
but we are prehistoric creatures, right?

708
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,260
Like we are biological creatures

709
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,760
living in medieval institutions

710
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,760
like education, work, with God-like technology.

711
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,680
How do you think that ends?

712
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,280
Like you think that ends and happily ever after?

713
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,040
Like that's insane.

714
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
Marriage was not designed, I mean,

715
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
think about even the early days of marriage.

716
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,080
Think about every Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,

717
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,200
you know, think about Oklahoma, you know,

718
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,240
where you'd have like, there's like the three people

719
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
in town that aren't married, you know,

720
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,800
and you sort of pick which of the three,

721
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,880
you know, you were gonna go be with.

722
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,880
And now you have access to just an endless supply

723
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,360
of the opposite sex, or I shouldn't even say

724
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,240
the opposite sex, you have an endless supply

725
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
of romantic partners in a device in your hand.

726
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,960
How does that possibly stand up?

727
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
How does marriage, the idea of monogamy,

728
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,120
forced monogamy or enforced monogamy,

729
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,880
how does that ever survive in that environment?

730
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,600
I don't think it can, I don't think it's realistic.

731
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,200
And the statistics prove me right.

732
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,640
You know, the statistics are absolutely in my favor.

733
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
Now again, get married as many times as you want

734
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,080
if you have a prenup.

735
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,400
Go get married, get married's a blast.

736
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
Being married is difficult.

737
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,040
You know, someone once said that it's great

738
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,200
to be married sometimes.

739
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,800
The problem is you're married all the time.

740
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
So you're a fan of prenups?

741
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,280
I'm a huge fan of prenups.

742
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,160
I mean, I shouldn't be because a prenup

743
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,160
for a couple of thousand dollars will save you hundreds

744
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,280
of thousands of dollars potentially in legal fees,

745
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,440
if not millions.

746
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
So there are clients I have that have spent

747
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,520
over a million dollars just in their legal fees,

748
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,000
that if they had spent $2,000 on a prenup,

749
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,760
none of that, they'd still have that money in their pocket.

750
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,640
And that's incredible to me.

751
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,240
Like I have two sons who are adults

752
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
that they are absolutely gonna have prenups.

753
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,520
Like they have to have prenups.

754
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,200
They'd be fools to not have prenups.

755
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
It's like jumping out of a plane with no parachute.

756
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
Why would you do that?

757
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,220
You know, it's just, it's stupid.

758
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,600
Prenups are enforceable, they make sense.

759
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,240
I actually think there's something very romantic

760
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,000
about prenups because they're forcing you

761
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,880
to have a conversation about this relationship.

762
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,120
I genuinely believe that we are the most aware of our health

763
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,440
just after we got sick, right?

764
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,560
Like when we, if you wake up and you have a toothache,

765
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,080
all you can think about is the fact your tooth hurts.

766
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,720
And then your toothache goes away and for like a week.

767
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
You're taking care of your teeth.

768
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,320
You go, oh my God, at least I don't have a toothache.

769
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,960
You know, but then a month goes by and you don't wake up

770
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,800
and go, well, at least I don't have a toothache.

771
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,960
And it's the furthest thing from your mind.

772
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,280
But theoretically you could wake up today and go,

773
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,440
I don't have a toothache.

774
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,760
I don't have a backache.

775
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,240
I don't have a head cold.

776
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
Like this is a great day.

777
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,200
What does a typical prenup look like?

778
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Typical, the easiest prenup in the world.

779
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,960
Easiest, yours, mine, ours.

780
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,280
That's it, yours, mine, ours.

781
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,680
Then your name, it's yours.

782
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
If it's in my name, it's mine.

783
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,200
Like in a divorce, everything,

784
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,440
all the assets are split 50-50.

785
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,760
Well, no, what you say in a prenup-truel agreement is,

786
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,200
if it's an asset or a liability,

787
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
if it's in my name, it's mine.

788
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,960
If it's in your name, it's yours.

789
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,080
If it's in our joint names,

790
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,040
we'll divide it 50-50.

791
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,080
That's it, yours, mine, ours.

792
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,960
And then you have to have ongoing conversations

793
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,720
throughout the marriage about, you know,

794
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,000
hey, I got this bonus at work.

795
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
Do I put it in my account?

796
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Do I put it in the joint account?

797
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,720
If the husband owns a house that's worth

798
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
whatever, $2 million, and he marries a woman.

799
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,680
The house is his still.

800
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,120
Well, they have to have a conversation.

801
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,760
Do I owe you a house?

802
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,000
That's an awkward conversation.

803
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Okay.

804
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
You know what's a more awkward conversation?

805
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,680
I had a conversation 10 years later with a lawyer

806
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,600
about the fact that you have to give half of this house

807
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,560
away to someone.

808
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,400
Isn't it better to have that conversation

809
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,760
when you still, like, why would you learn

810
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,320
how to fight in a fight?

811
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,920
But won't that undermine the love that each person feels?

812
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,760
Why?

813
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,600
Why?

814
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,440
You're gonna die.

815
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Does that undermine your life?

816
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
Or does it make you conscious of the fact

817
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,240
that this is finite and that you should be out there?

818
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,920
Like, I think having a conversation with your partner

819
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,240
about, look, I love you.

820
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,800
You love me.

821
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,880
We want to do this thing together.

822
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
But the numbers are against us

823
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,080
and the world is antagonistic to it.

824
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,320
And I hope we'll be together forever.

825
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,680
But if we split up, what do we owe each other?

826
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,520
What do you expect from me?

827
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,760
Because I have to tell you something.

828
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm a fair person.

829
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm a fair person.

830
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
If you say to me, you know, Jim,

831
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,440
I'm not gonna work as hard

832
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,580
because you make a good living.

833
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,400
So if we split up, I'm gonna need help

834
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,720
for a couple of years because I'm not gonna pay

835
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,200
attention to my career.

836
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,840
Okay, does that unreasonable?

837
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,320
That's totally reasonable.

838
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,400
You know, if I say, hey, listen,

839
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
I have this house and I bought it, you know,

840
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,400
but I'm buying it with money that I made

841
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,120
really before we were together.

842
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,760
So if we split up, I don't really think

843
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,640
you deserve half of it.

844
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,480
I think that if we bought things for it together,

845
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,360
that, okay, those things you can half of,

846
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
but the house itself, like that's money I had

847
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,840
before I met you and why can't you have that conversation?

848
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
What, why not?

849
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
Instead, I mean, you buy a house,

850
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,360
you do a HUD one, a lead paint disclosure,

851
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
you gotta sign all these things that,

852
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,360
this is how much the interest is gonna be

853
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,040
and you get married and you can get a fucking pamphlet.

854
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,640
You don't get anything.

855
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,840
You just did the most legally significant thing

856
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,240
you're ever gonna do other than die

857
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,640
and no one has explained any of it to you.

858
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,560
People come into my office and they go,

859
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,480
well, my retirement account, that's in my name.

860
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,720
And I'm like, yeah, it doesn't matter.

861
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,560
It's in your name?

862
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,800
Okay, was it acquired during the marriage?

863
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,280
Okay, she's got half of it.

864
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,160
Well, I have this bank account, but it's in my sole name.

865
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,600
It's money that I inherited from my mom.

866
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,120
I'm like, okay, it's in your name, yeah,

867
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,000
but you inherited that money during the marriage.

868
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,140
And did you put money that you earned

869
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,800
during the marriage in that account also?

870
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,760
Yeah, okay, that's commingled and transmuted.

871
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,880
That's now marital property.

872
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,960
So they don't know that.

873
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Why?

874
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,440
Because no one tells them that when they're getting married.

875
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,400
All they did, you spend more time talking about the cake

876
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
than you do talking about the fact

877
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
that you just opted out of the title system.

878
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,000
That's gigantic.

879
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,920
You can't legally change the beneficiary

880
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,320
of your life insurance, even to your children,

881
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,520
if you're married, without your spouse

882
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
signing a consent to that.

883
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
No one tells you that when you get married.

884
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,800
You get married, Elvis can marry you for $20

885
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,880
at a drive-thru cathedral.

886
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,360
And it's a legal status, a massive legal,

887
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,920
you buy your spouse a Rolex,

888
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,000
you bought yourself one half of a Rolex.

889
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,280
You buy someone a birthday present who you're married to,

890
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,600
you bought yourself one half of that birthday present.

891
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,320
Nobody know, people don't know that.

892
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,360
They learn that for the first time in my office

893
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,440
or in a courtroom.

894
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,720
That's insane.

895
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,040
What other thing in the world?

896
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,000
Like anything else, any other contract,

897
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,120
you would say, well, wait a minute,

898
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,720
no one explained that to me.

899
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,760
No one explained that to me.

900
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,240
When I leased this car,

901
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
no one explained to me that there's wear and tear.

902
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Doesn't say it anywhere in the contract, right?

903
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,920
Okay, marriage contract doesn't say that.

904
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
It doesn't say, oh, and by the way,

905
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,160
you're opting out of the title system

906
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,200
and your retirement assets and all these other things.

907
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,040
And if there's any debts

908
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,760
and you could have enhanced earning capacity

909
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
or celebrity goodwill that has to be valued

910
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,360
by forensic accountants that'll cost you $100,000,

911
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
you don't, no contract that says that.

912
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,400
It just says, yep, we're getting married.

913
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,360
It's two witnesses, we're good.

914
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,680
What other contract?

915
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,880
What other contract in the United States or anywhere

916
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,920
has that lack of disclosure and is that binding?

917
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,340
None, zero, none.

918
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,820
So a prenup, yes, that's an awkward conversation, I guess.

919
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,220
I don't know that it has to be.

920
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,140
And I have to tell you,

921
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,780
the more awkward of a conversation it is,

922
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,180
the more you should think twice about getting married.

923
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Because if you can't have a conversation with this person

924
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,000
about the possibility that someday one or both of you

925
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,100
might hurt each other,

926
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,100
like how many people, while they're still happy and in love,

927
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,300
say something like, you know, babe, I love you.

928
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,340
But we're gonna disagree about something at some point.

929
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,740
And when we do, how do you like to fight?

930
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,580
Like, do you need a minute?

931
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,800
Like, do you need like to be alone for a minute

932
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,220
so you can kind of calm down?

933
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,700
Or are you the like, hey, we gotta figure this out

934
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,180
and we can't go to bed angry?

935
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,260
Like, cause let's talk about that now

936
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,020
while we're not in the fight.

937
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,580
Like, let's talk about it now while we still get along

938
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,620
and we're happy and we're trying to figure out

939
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,100
how to navigate each other.

940
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,380
It's hard enough to navigate yourself.

941
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,220
I wanna navigate another human being.

942
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,660
Why don't we have that conversation now?

943
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,500
But no, we don't.

944
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,900
We learn on the job.

945
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,340
We learn how to fight in a fight, which is insane.

946
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,460
You know, but again, why?

947
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,500
Well, cause it's awkward.

948
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
It'd be awkward to have that conversation.

949
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,780
More awkward than getting in a fight

950
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,180
where you don't know the rules of engagement,

951
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,540
or you don't know how your partner does better

952
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
or would feel better.

953
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,300
Like, and you're not gonna ask them that

954
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,700
in the heat of battle, you know?

955
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,180
So why wouldn't you have that awkward conversation

956
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,980
while you have this abundance of affection for each other?

957
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,300
I mean, when I negotiate prenups,

958
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
it's the easiest thing in the world in a sense

959
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,500
because these two people really like each other.

960
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,460
You know, they're about to get married.

961
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,980
So they're clearly not trying to kill each other.

962
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,940
At that point, they clearly like each other.

963
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,300
So you just say, hey, listen, go home,

964
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,740
talk to your fiance about X, Y, and Z,

965
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,100
and see what they, you know, see what they think.

966
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,140
And see, tell them what your concern is.

967
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,220
And very often, people will come back and say to me,

968
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,100
I mean, I have to tell you, I've been doing this now,

969
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,060
you know, over 20 years.

970
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,220
I do a lot of prenups.

971
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,260
I do maybe five, six prenups a month,

972
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,020
sometimes during like pre-wedding season,

973
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,500
which is the fall and before the summer,

974
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,260
I'll do 10, 15 a month.

975
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,740
The people who say to me,

976
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,300
oh, well, I don't want to have that conversation.

977
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,620
You know, I think, they get the prenup

978
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,980
and within three, four years, they're divorced.

979
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,660
Sometimes five years and then seven years,

980
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,980
but they're the ones who get divorced.

981
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
They have no business getting married.

982
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,580
Like the ones who have the discussion

983
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,780
and figure out the, well, I'm worried

984
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,580
because if you keep the place, yeah, you're right.

985
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,380
Okay, so what if I give you this amount of money

986
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,460
and it's this much for each of you?

987
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,300
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

988
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,460
Let's do it that way.

989
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,180
Those people, they're probably never gonna put the prenup

990
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,020
in a safe someplace.

991
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,180
You'll never look at it probably.

992
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,740
Good communication solves it all.

993
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,700
Because they're able to talk to each other

994
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,620
and they're able to talk about hard things.

995
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,340
How are you gonna be married to someone?

996
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,540
Have children with someone

997
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,500
and you can't talk about hard things, you know?

998
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,620
Like how?

999
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,900
How are you gonna navigate life

1000
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,820
and not be able to talk about hard things?

1001
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,720
Like that's silly.

1002
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,660
So if you can't talk about hard things,

1003
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,860
don't get fucking married.

1004
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,700
It's okay.

1005
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,540
You don't have to.

1006
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,660
You can stay together.

1007
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,860
But people love, I had a client.

1008
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,540
No joke, guy was in his 70s.

1009
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
He was married four times.

1010
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,780
I did his third and fourth divorces

1011
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,660
and he was getting married for a fifth time.

1012
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,100
And I said to him, I was like,

1013
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,300
because I actually thought he's older.

1014
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,420
So I thought like, does he know

1015
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,660
you don't have to marry them anymore?

1016
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,940
Like maybe he doesn't know.

1017
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,780
He's dividing his assets.

1018
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,980
Yeah, maybe someone didn't tell him.

1019
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,900
Like maybe someone didn't tell him,

1020
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,820
like you can fuck them.

1021
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,180
You don't have to marry them anymore.

1022
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,020
You can just do that.

1023
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,380
He's dividing his asset multiple times.

1024
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,940
Well, I mean, it's getting smaller and smaller every time.

1025
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,780
But I said to him, I was like,

1026
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,820
why are you doing this again?

1027
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
I was like, you don't have to get married.

1028
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,260
Like you're clearly not great at it, you know?

1029
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,820
Like, and he was very funny.

1030
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,260
He said, you know, Jim, he said,

1031
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,900
you buy a car and you drive it for 200,000 miles

1032
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,060
and eventually the engine craps out.

1033
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,460
So you go out and you buy a Ferrari

1034
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,100
or you buy some flashy sports car

1035
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,140
and you drive it for a couple of months

1036
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,820
and you realize this is not the car for me.

1037
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,140
So you get rid of it.

1038
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,540
Then you get another car.

1039
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,140
And you know, you think this one's gonna be the one for you

1040
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
but you know, after you drive it for like a year,

1041
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,100
you realize, yeah, this is not the car for me.

1042
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
You can lease them instead of buying them.

1043
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,260
You're gonna walk everywhere for the rest of your life?

1044
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,340
Yeah, well, that was my answer.

1045
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,260
You could lease them.

1046
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,620
You could lease them or you could,

1047
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,140
you could have some other alternative.

1048
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,460
I mean, here's the thing about marriage,

1049
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,860
is it's a technology.

1050
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,780
So we made it up so we can change it.

1051
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,340
You think marriage will change in the next 20 years?

1052
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,900
No, no, I think it'll,

1053
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,660
I actually think it's gonna have,

1054
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,860
I mean, I think we're leaning,

1055
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,580
I think the pendulum always swings hard

1056
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,420
in the other direction.

1057
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,300
We have a tendency as a culture to overcorrect.

1058
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,700
So I think we're heading into a spiral

1059
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,900
of like traditional stuff.

1060
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,580
Like I think you're gonna see like people getting

1061
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,380
like super religious again

1062
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,140
and people are gonna get super dogmatic.

1063
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,860
I think we're gonna see the trad wife thing.

1064
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,700
We're gonna see the hyper masculine.

1065
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,900
We're gonna see like a very, you know,

1066
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,980
we've got to, we've gone so far

1067
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,700
in the direction of postmodernism

1068
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,820
where nothing means anything

1069
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,180
and everything's just, you know, like there is no definite.

1070
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,540
We've become like Sartre, you know,

1071
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,820
like we've become so postmodern

1072
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,980
that it's become almost the form of rugged individualism.

1073
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,780
I think we're gonna swing in the other direction now

1074
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,900
and traditional institutions are gonna get popular again.

1075
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,300
It will be, I mean, you know, from a marriage place,

1076
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,140
it's gonna be great

1077
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,540
because I think people are gonna get married.

1078
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,780
I mean, people were slowing down on getting married

1079
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,580
for a while and they were getting married later

1080
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,860
and they're having kids later.

1081
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,060
We're declining to have kids.

1082
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,300
And I think as we, I think as a culture,

1083
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,140
we start re-solidifying into gender roles

1084
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,820
or gender tropes, depending on how we wanna look at it.

1085
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,020
I think you're gonna see marriage resurge again,

1086
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,500
but I think that it's still gonna be

1087
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
as flawed of a technology as it ever was.

1088
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,620
And I think we have so much out there now

1089
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,860
to compare ourselves to.

1090
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,020
You know, you used to compare yourself

1091
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,300
to the neighbors next door

1092
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,820
and what car they had in the driveway

1093
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,700
and what they were wearing

1094
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,740
when they left for church on Sunday.

1095
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,060
Now you're just looking at everyone's greatest hits.

1096
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,340
While living your gag reel, you know,

1097
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,060
and you're never looking at any of that stuff

1098
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,100
when you're having like a peak experience.

1099
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,060
You know, you're on the toilet or you're bored

1100
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,940
and you're looking at everyone's hashtag blessed.

1101
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,460
I mean, well, they're in my office.

1102
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,380
I can't tell you how many people do a consult with me

1103
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,340
and they're cheating

1104
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,300
and they haven't slept with their spouse in three years

1105
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,620
and they're miserable

1106
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,300
and you're looking at their Instagram

1107
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,860
and it's all like best life ever, hashtag greatest hubby ever.

1108
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,140
And you're like, what is this?

1109
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,000
It's performance art.

1110
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,240
You know, it's an advertisement of how happy you are

1111
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,840
but this is what people are comparing themselves to.

1112
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,880
They're looking at that

1113
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,040
and going, oh, my marriage isn't that good.

1114
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,680
That marriage isn't that good.

1115
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,720
Trust me, that marriage isn't that good.

1116
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,080
That marriage is in my, look at celebrities.

1117
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,000
You don't even need to look at the people you know.

1118
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,840
Look at celebrities.

1119
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,000
Before they do the, it is with great sadness

1120
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,920
that we advise that we're going to be moving

1121
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,560
in separate directions and consciously uncoupling

1122
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,080
and like that right before that, it's like,

1123
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,200
oh no, we're happy, we're great, we're phenomenal.

1124
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,720
You know, we're constantly advertising

1125
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,520
how wonderful our relationships are while they're on fire.

1126
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,640
You know, and then wondering why everyone's, you know,

1127
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
miserable in their relationship

1128
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,160
because they're comparing it to something fake.

1129
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,800
It's like comparing your body to a photoshopped body.

1130
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,640
You know, it's-

1131
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,960
Other than social media, do you think there's something else

1132
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,720
in our society that made marriage more difficult

1133
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,040
to stay together?

1134
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
Now makes it worse.

1135
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,320
And just like your parents stayed married?

1136
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,720
Yeah, my parents stayed married until my mother passed away.

1137
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,800
Same with me.

1138
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,280
But they were mixed result.

1139
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I see, I think that my parents were not as caught up

1140
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
in their own happiness.

1141
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,320
I think we're very caught up in our own happiness.

1142
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
We're all very self.

1143
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah, we're all very sort of, I don't want to say narcissistic,

1144
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,680
but we're very much like we are the son

1145
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,720
around which everything revolves.

1146
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,760
What am I not getting?

1147
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,200
Yeah, my father was a Vietnam veteran, you know.

1148
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,640
Well, he got out of the Naval Academy in 66

1149
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,680
and went to Vietnam for three years.

1150
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,920
So he was alive.

1151
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,400
So he was like, fuck, I'm ahead.

1152
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm playing with the house's money.

1153
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,360
I'm alive.

1154
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,760
Everybody in their wedding party,

1155
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,840
all the men in their wedding party died in Vietnam.

1156
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
There's five guys in their wedding party.

1157
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,120
They all died in Vietnam.

1158
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,000
My parents never looked at their wedding novel

1159
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,520
because every single man and it was dead.

1160
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,280
They were all helicopter pilots in Vietnam

1161
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,520
who got killed in their 20s, you know.

1162
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,360
So they didn't really see marriages.

1163
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,640
Like it was a partnership.

1164
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,480
It was like, yeah, we're gonna do this thing.

1165
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,320
We're gonna have kids.

1166
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,240
We're gonna raise the kids.

1167
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,240
We're gonna, you know, we're gonna have a house.

1168
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,600
You know, we're gonna have a car.

1169
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,560
Like we'll be successful.

1170
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,400
The lights are on.

1171
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,880
My father was dirt poor.

1172
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,840
He came from like Appalachian part of Virginia,

1173
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,640
a small town called Shawsville.

1174
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Didn't have indoor plumbing

1175
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,520
until he left for the Naval Academy.

1176
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,840
And he just, I think he saw marriages.

1177
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,360
Yeah, that's what you do, you know.

1178
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,640
He met my mom on Fleet Week.

1179
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,480
She was a nurse in the city.

1180
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,600
And he was, you know, on Fleet Week

1181
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,720
and he had his uniform on and he was in a bar

1182
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,800
and he was drunk and he went to her

1183
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,200
and he said, you're the most beautiful woman

1184
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,960
I've ever seen and I'm gonna marry you.

1185
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,320
Cause he was drunk.

1186
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,680
And she said, are you in the military?

1187
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,960
Cause he was wearing a uniform and he said, yep.

1188
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,920
And she said, what country?

1189
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,240
And he said, whatever country you're from.

1190
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,680
And he invited her to visit him at the Naval Academy

1191
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,840
a couple of weeks later and she came.

1192
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,360
But he'd invited three other women.

1193
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,040
He just didn't know if any of them would come.

1194
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,240
So he'd invited all of them.

1195
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,540
So my mom got there and she saw these other women

1196
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:25,140
and she said, either I'm leaving or they're all leaving.

1197
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,860
And he was like, I kind of like her.

1198
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,340
So he made them all leave.

1199
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,660
And they were, yeah, they were married 50 plus years.

1200
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,940
But, you know, their marriage had challenges.

1201
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,300
You know, he was an alcoholic.

1202
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,740
He's been in recovery for maybe seven, eight years

1203
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,040
since she passed, but, and he's remarried.

1204
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,540
But he remarried within a year of my mom dying.

1205
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,620
Like he was the kind of, he's of a generation of men

1206
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,140
that he needed someone to take care of him.

1207
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,220
You know, my mom died.

1208
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,360
He didn't even know how to scramble an egg.

1209
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,480
Like it was, you know, like after she passed,

1210
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,320
I had him come to stay with me and my sons.

1211
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,560
And I was trying to like teach him like, okay, dad,

1212
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,320
here's how you make like a batch of chili

1213
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,360
and then you can eat it all week, you know.

1214
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,500
And I was like, how's this guy gonna,

1215
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,420
cause they had this very, you know,

1216
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,480
but that's what I met another older woman

1217
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,620
and her husband had died.

1218
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,880
She needed someone to take care of.

1219
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,520
He needed someone to take care of him.

1220
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,360
But that generation didn't have it as easy as we know.

1221
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
That's what I'm saying.

1222
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Like they, they, just meeting your basic needs, right?

1223
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,520
They were grateful to be alive.

1224
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,840
They were grateful to be alive

1225
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,480
because they'd either been through a war.

1226
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,560
We're not grateful unless we're driving a Mercedes or a,

1227
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,120
and even then we're not grateful

1228
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,800
because, because the truth is as well.

1229
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,100
Okay, a Mercedes, a Mercedes, who cares?

1230
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,320
You know, when people have a Mercedes,

1231
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
my secretary has a Mercedes.

1232
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,060
She leases it, you know, I drive a Jeep.

1233
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,000
So is she better than me?

1234
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,280
Is she more successful than me?

1235
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,840
She works for me, you know.

1236
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,540
So I don't, I don't know that any of it's enough anymore.

1237
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,920
Like no matter what watch you have,

1238
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,680
somebody's got another one or a better one or five of them.

1239
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,020
And all those comparison that we see.

1240
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,460
It's all, and so I just think that's the thing

1241
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,580
that makes it impossible, right?

1242
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,180
Like if, if, if you're,

1243
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,700
our parents' generation was struggling

1244
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
to just make it through, right?

1245
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,820
To, to meet your basic needs,

1246
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,940
to keep a roof over your head, to raise your children.

1247
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,460
And now where it's very much, are you self-actualized?

1248
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,300
Are you happy?

1249
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,460
Do you have an eight pack at?

1250
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,060
Like it would never have occurred to my father,

1251
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,780
did he have an eight pack?

1252
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,460
It would never have been something he thought of, you know?

1253
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,740
It's just not, it just wasn't on his radar, you know?

1254
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,660
And I don't think my mother would have ever been like,

1255
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,400
oh, you know, he, he doesn't have an eight pack.

1256
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,060
Like that wouldn't, because again,

1257
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,060
though it's not constantly being advertised to him, you know?

1258
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,420
I think that how many women did he interact with in a day?

1259
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,820
You know, how many women do I interact with in a day?

1260
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,740
Visually, or personally in some fashion,

1261
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,820
or, or, you know, in a curated, mediated way.

1262
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,860
And again, those are curated women, by the way.

1263
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,900
So they're Photoshopped, they're airbrushed,

1264
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
they're, they've got filters on them.

1265
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,900
So again, you know, how does marriage survive in that setting?

1266
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,540
It had a hard enough time surviving without all of that.

1267
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,900
I mean, forget kids.

1268
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,740
The divorce rate keeps increasing, right?

1269
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,660
Yeah, it keeps going up, it keeps going up.

1270
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:10,040
It's, it's been hanging around 53 to 56% for a while.

1271
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,300
We had a bump after COVID.

1272
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,820
What are other countries like?

1273
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,700
Countries that have a significant religious narrative

1274
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,260
have the lowest divorce rates.

1275
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,300
So the lowest divorce rates are in like, you know,

1276
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,140
Saudi Arabia.

1277
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,180
Yeah, but they don't have a whole lot of choice.

1278
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,780
Right, you're not allowed to divorce.

1279
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,340
You just have your wife killed, you know?

1280
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,580
So that's, you don't have to divorce.

1281
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,900
So the countries where there is this very strict

1282
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,500
religious prohibition against marriage, or against divorce.

1283
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,340
But I mean, the United States

1284
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,100
is probably the highest divorce rate?

1285
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,580
We're among the highest, yeah.

1286
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,780
I don't think we're the, we might,

1287
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,980
we might be the highest now.

1288
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,040
For a while, Germany had a very high divorce rate.

1289
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,940
France had a pretty high divorce rate.

1290
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,620
What's interesting is, is the divorce rate

1291
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,300
and the marriage satisfaction rates, those are different.

1292
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,340
Cause most people, the goal is not, can we stay married?

1293
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,940
The goal is, can we stay happily married, you know?

1294
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,460
Cause if somebody said to me like, yeah,

1295
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,980
I've been married 25 years

1296
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,300
and I've been fucking miserable for 15 of them.

1297
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,780
Like, I'm not gonna envy you.

1298
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,720
Like, great job, you're really hung in there

1299
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,580
in that awful situation, you know?

1300
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,980
Like, that's not impressive to me, you know?

1301
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,820
I have a cousin who got married and I was,

1302
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,520
I was chatting with her, she's a younger woman.

1303
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,520
And I, her, her husband just joined the police force.

1304
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,540
And I said to him, so I was trying to make small talk.

1305
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,500
And I said, so do you, you know, do you like it?

1306
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,100
And he's from a family of cops.

1307
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,780
And he said, nah, not really.

1308
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,620
But you know, I'm gonna do like the 20 years

1309
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,260
and then you know, you get your pension.

1310
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,220
And I thought, I'll just do my 20, that's 20 years.

1311
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,940
You're 25 years old, that's 25 to 45.

1312
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,180
Those are fucking incredible years.

1313
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,780
You'll never get those back.

1314
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,580
And your approach to life is, yeah, I mean, I don't like it,

1315
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,540
but I'll just kind of do it, you know?

1316
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,400
Like I, I want to tip toe through life

1317
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,900
and arrive safely at death.

1318
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,020
Like that seems, you know, but I, I, I get that that's what

1319
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,740
we're, if that's what marriage is,

1320
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,100
if it's an endurance event, you know,

1321
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,140
where no, no, you've got to stay married, you know?

1322
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,740
Why, I mean, that's why I think

1323
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,500
religions have been very quick to, I mean,

1324
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,940
I always tell people I'm not religious.

1325
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,020
I was raised very Catholic.

1326
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,620
But the reality is that, you know, I mean, there's,

1327
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,620
if in fact, God talked to humanity with 10 commandments,

1328
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,620
I think it's hilarious that the only thing he has to say twice

1329
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,900
is don't fuck people you're not married to.

1330
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Thou shall not kill once, right?

1331
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,360
Honor the Sabbath once.

1332
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,740
Don't covet your neighbor's wife, don't commit adultery.

1333
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,020
It's, it's the only thing.

1334
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,860
It's the only thing that got two commandments.

1335
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,780
So like Bayes goes, don't kill, honor the Sabbath,

1336
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,380
don't fuck people you're not married to,

1337
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,260
seriously, don't fuck people you're not married to.

1338
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,660
Like they just, no, it didn't,

1339
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,020
Dasha, not steal one, you know,

1340
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,780
it's the only one that got double billing.

1341
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,260
Well, religion's a big component.

1342
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,860
It's a huge component too, but why?

1343
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,980
Because how else are you going to control people?

1344
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,420
How else are you going to get people

1345
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,060
to sign on for this thing and not sleep with each other?

1346
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,140
I mean, I'm not saying Freud was right,

1347
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,340
but we do want to sleep with people.

1348
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,220
We do want to kill people that don't do

1349
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,060
what we want them to do.

1350
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,780
Like we have these animal instincts.

1351
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,660
We have these impulses.

1352
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,660
And what do we do with them?

1353
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,540
Well, we have to live in a civilized society.

1354
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,220
So civilization, it's this content.

1355
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,460
We have to suppress certain things.

1356
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,300
If marriage was outlawed or just abolished,

1357
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,340
it would just be a free-for-all.

1358
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,540
I don't know that that's true.

1359
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,380
I mean, I think that,

1360
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,900
I think people would like us to believe that's true.

1361
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,980
You know, I don't believe that.

1362
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,860
Like I don't believe that if,

1363
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,700
Probably a lot of heavy.

1364
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,580
If murder wasn't illegal,

1365
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,700
that I would just go killing people.

1366
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,260
Like I, like, you know, like I,

1367
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,100
I rape and murder as many people as I want to,

1368
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,100
which is none, cause I'm not a monster.

1369
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,660
Like I don't, I rape as many people as I want to, none,

1370
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,820
because I don't want to.

1371
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,780
I wouldn't want to do that to another person.

1372
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,940
I think society would be probably happier without marriage.

1373
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,660
Well, I think we would have a lot less

1374
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,860
of the damage that comes, right?

1375
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,620
I think we'd have to find new narratives

1376
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,020
to structure, to define relationships, right?

1377
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,020
I mean, I do think there is a part of us that wants to say,

1378
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,780
cause you know, as a grown man who's divorced,

1379
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,940
when you're 20 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,

1380
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,180
nobody thinks anything of it.

1381
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,740
When you're 50 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,

1382
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,380
people go, there's a story there.

1383
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,380
Like cause you're either divorced or commitment phobic,

1384
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,340
or why do you have a girlfriend when you're 50?

1385
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,100
Why isn't that your wife?

1386
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,340
So they know there's a story there.

1387
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,220
So we'd have to, and I get it, I get it,

1388
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,500
because if someone says, oh, that's my boyfriend,

1389
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,020
it's like, all right, well, that could be for a week.

1390
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,860
That could have been nothing.

1391
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,580
That could be like, yeah, that's my boyfriend.

1392
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,460
My husband, it's like, oh, okay, wait, that's her husband.

1393
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,220
Like she's got some authority there.

1394
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,740
So I get that there's this idea that we want to say,

1395
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,180
like, you know, it's like when you're a little kid,

1396
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,060
this is my friend, but this is my best friend.

1397
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,620
You know, this is my best friend.

1398
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,580
But like how many adults still need to say that?

1399
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,820
Like how many adults still need to say,

1400
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,860
oh, my friend, Todd and I, and my best friend, Tom and I,

1401
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,660
like, okay, like, so they extra special friend?

1402
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,340
Like, what are they, like, do they get health insurance

1403
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,180
with that?

1404
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,400
Like, what is the deal with that?

1405
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,860
So I think that's kind of what marriage has become,

1406
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,860
is it's like, you know, well, the person I love.

1407
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,420
No, no, but like the person I love.

1408
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,260
Like there's a lot of people I love.

1409
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,660
I wouldn't want to be married to any of them.

1410
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,980
But there's a lot of people I love, you know?

1411
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,740
And I love my ex-wife.

1412
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,180
I wouldn't want to be married to her.

1413
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,380
I think she loves me.

1414
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,420
She wouldn't want to be married to me.

1415
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,260
I don't blame her.

1416
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,920
I'm a great ex-husband.

1417
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,180
I'm a terrible husband.

1418
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,780
I'm a great ex-husband.

1419
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,420
Because the skill set for an ex-husband

1420
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,580
is totally different than skill set for a husband.

1421
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,140
Skill set for a father is completely different

1422
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,980
than that of a husband.

1423
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,220
That's the thing I have to tell people all the time.

1424
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,620
People say, well, he's a terrible husband,

1425
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,940
so he shouldn't have custody of the kids.

1426
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,860
I'm like, what the fuck?

1427
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,620
Where's the overlap between being a good husband

1428
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,420
and being a good father?

1429
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,220
Like being a good father is a whole different skill.

1430
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,700
You could be a great husband and a shit father.

1431
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,860
And you could be an amazing father, a terrible husband.

1432
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,220
Like there's very little overlap in those skill sets.

1433
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,220
You know, maybe good listening skills would be helpful

1434
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,460
in both or patience would be good in both.

1435
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,860
But that's true of almost anything.

1436
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,560
You know, it's a doctor and a lawyer.

1437
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,140
Both be good if you had good listening skills.

1438
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,100
It doesn't mean that the same profession.

1439
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,700
Is divorce harder on women or men?

1440
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,400
That's a great question.

1441
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,180
I think it's equally hard on both,

1442
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,540
but I think that the world is more sympathetic

1443
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,980
to women when they get divorced.

1444
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,380
I think when a woman gets cheated on,

1445
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,340
the man's a piece of shit.

1446
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,800
And when a woman cheats on a man,

1447
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,500
she must have been forced into the arms of this other man

1448
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,860
or she had to explore herself

1449
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,580
or she was being neglected in some fashion.

1450
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,980
So if a man cheats, he's a piece of garbage.

1451
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,580
And if a man's wife cheats,

1452
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,540
he mustn't have been meeting her needs.

1453
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,940
And she had every right in the world.

1454
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,540
Like, so the world is very unsympathetic

1455
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,460
to men when they get divorced.

1456
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,820
But that's been throughout hers.

1457
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,300
Yeah, that's been for, I mean,

1458
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,060
there was a maternal presumption, a legal presumption,

1459
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,900
what was called the tender year's doctrine,

1460
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,100
which was that if a child was under the age of seven,

1461
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,340
they were automatically presumed

1462
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,540
that they would be in the custody of the mother.

1463
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,460
And men, so men get really beat up still in court.

1464
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,220
I mean, the law theoretically is gender blind right now,

1465
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,340
but I don't actually see that.

1466
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,420
Because the law is people, the law is judges,

1467
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,860
and judges are human and they are all the same biases.

1468
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,860
And it's just not a moment right now

1469
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,820
where men are particularly sympathetic characters.

1470
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,540
I think that even young men, I mean,

1471
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,820
if at a school dance they sing Beyonce's Girls

1472
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,500
Who Runs the World, like if there was a song called Men,

1473
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,060
Who Runs the World Men, and it was a positive thing,

1474
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,580
like you get pilloried for that.

1475
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,580
So I think that men have a very hard time right now

1476
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,500
in divorce.

1477
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,020
They see their children less,

1478
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,100
they get hit harder financially.

1479
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,260
They are the bad guy no matter what.

1480
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,780
If they cheat, they're the bad guy.

1481
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,980
If they get cheated on, they were the bad guy

1482
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,380
because they probably neglected her.

1483
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,180
There's a presumption that the man

1484
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,340
is to blame a lot of the time.

1485
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,140
Now again, marriage equality has been a thing for a while.

1486
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,740
So there are tons of gay couples.

1487
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,740
So you have two men, two women divorcing each other.

1488
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,380
And that hasn't really shook out too much yet

1489
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,180
in terms of how that plays out.

1490
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,500
I don't know if it's that gay and lesbian couples

1491
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,580
are better at it than heterosexual couples

1492
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,380
or if it's still they're in the honeymoon period

1493
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,940
because marriage equality hasn't been around that long.

1494
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,780
But I think men find a less sympathetic world.

1495
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,240
But in fairness,

1496
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,780
divorced men have it a little easier, I think.

1497
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,340
Divorced men meet a young woman

1498
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,180
and the woman's like, instant family, just add me.

1499
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,340
That's great, you know.

1500
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,060
If he's got kids, it's like, oh, he's got kids.

1501
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,300
Look at how nurturing he is and how lovely and women,

1502
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,620
you know, they get divorced.

1503
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,540
They've got kids, guys are like, whoop, it's got baggage.

1504
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,140
I'm not going near that.

1505
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:53,140
So I think that men and women have different problems

1506
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,060
post-divorce and the world could be better to both of them.

1507
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:03,060
I think that I have some women who I've done their divorce

1508
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,100
and whatever guy is with them is gonna be very lucky

1509
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,780
because they're beautiful, they're smart, they're good moms,

1510
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,860
but they're also vibrant, exciting women.

1511
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,020
Now they're loaded.

1512
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,220
And they've got money now, yeah, they've got money.

1513
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,340
They don't have as much financial insecurity.

1514
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,860
Although I have to tell you that,

1515
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,580
it's the last remaining feminist taboo.

1516
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,580
I got a lot of women paying alimony these days.

1517
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,020
I mean, women can, women marry the like handsome musician

1518
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,300
who's not successful or the artist, you know.

1519
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,460
There's a lot of listen week.

1520
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,700
It hasn't been, you know, there's been a significant effort

1521
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,900
in our culture in the last decade

1522
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,660
if anyone didn't notice to improve the situation of women.

1523
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,260
If you have an equally qualified man

1524
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,940
and an uniquely qualified woman,

1525
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,140
the woman's the diversity higher, the man's not.

1526
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,060
So I have a lot of women who get, when they get told,

1527
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,780
like, oh yeah, no, you gotta give them half your shit

1528
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,340
or oh no, you gotta pay alimony

1529
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,100
because he makes 50 grand a year and you make 250.

1530
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,020
And they're like, you know,

1531
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,260
they could be the staunchest feminist in the world.

1532
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,740
And when you tell them they gotta pay alimony,

1533
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,700
they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he's a man.

1534
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,580
He's got a strong back, he can get out there and work.

1535
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,020
And then suddenly the whole like gender is a construct

1536
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,500
and there's no such thing.

1537
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,740
That goes right out the window

1538
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,100
and you got told you gotta pay alimony.

1539
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,860
That's like, nope, no, no, no, no.

1540
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,300
I believe in strict gender roles.

1541
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,900
Men should pay alimony.

1542
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,660
Women, even if you earn 10 times,

1543
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,980
you should not have to pay alimony.

1544
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,020
I've had very, very staunchly feminist clients

1545
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,100
who changed their mind about how feminist they were

1546
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,220
when they got told that they were gonna have to pay alimony.

1547
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,140
Interesting.

1548
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,060
Yeah, but I do have a lot of men

1549
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,140
who won't take alimony even though they're entitled to it

1550
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,700
because there's just some feeling of like,

1551
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,660
yeah, no, I'm not doing that.

1552
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,660
It's emasculating.

1553
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,060
Like if she tells people that we know

1554
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,380
that I took alimony from her,

1555
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,020
like people will think I'm less than a man.

1556
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,780
So again, it's all gender stuff.

1557
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,620
It's still out there.

1558
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,820
It's still part of the zeitgeist.

1559
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,620
We're still trying to figure it all out.

1560
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,300
How many marriages are genuinely happy, you think?

1561
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,220
How many married couples?

1562
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,780
Gosh.

1563
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,980
Because I see married couples that have been married.

1564
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,540
It looks like they've been married a decade or two

1565
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,380
and they're having dinner

1566
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,020
and they're having the same conversation they had yesterday

1567
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,460
or the day before or the day before that

1568
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,300
and the weeks and months before that.

1569
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,500
You know, here's what I'll tell you.

1570
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,380
I have, I know a lot of people

1571
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,660
and I think I know one couple

1572
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,380
that has like a genuinely happy marriage.

1573
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,100
What do you think the secret is?

1574
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,540
Ah, they really like each other.

1575
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,380
I don't know.

1576
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,460
Like they're really good to each other.

1577
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,740
I have to tell you, they make me very uncomfortable.

1578
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,580
My ex-wife and I jokingly say

1579
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,460
that they were the reason we got divorced

1580
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:46,380
because we've known them since we were in college

1581
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,380
and we went to Disney with them,

1582
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,700
with their kids and our kids,

1583
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,020
when all the kids were little.

1584
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,060
And we were gonna go on a ride

1585
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,020
with our kids and their kids

1586
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,260
and they were gonna like,

1587
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,220
oh, we'll take the kids on the ride

1588
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,660
and you guys can go.

1589
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,500
And my friend was like,

1590
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,300
oh good, we're just gonna go walk and hold hands.

1591
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,300
And they walked away and like holding hands

1592
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,860
and we looked at them

1593
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,940
and we didn't say anything to each other.

1594
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,940
But like five years later when we got divorced,

1595
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,460
I said, you know, when I saw the two of them together,

1596
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,020
I thought, I don't feel like that about her.

1597
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,140
Like, and she said, oh my God,

1598
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,220
I remember that exact moment and I felt the same way.

1599
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,340
So I think they make people uncomfortable.

1600
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,300
Like when you see someone who's got it right,

1601
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,660
like this guy just loves her.

1602
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,500
He loves her.

1603
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,420
They've been married 25 years

1604
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,740
and dude, it's like he's talking

1605
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,300
about a girl he met yesterday.

1606
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,180
And she's the same way about him.

1607
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,020
Like she's-

1608
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,860
It's a miracle when that happens.

1609
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah, I just think it,

1610
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,100
you know, man, I tell people,

1611
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,340
marriage is like the lottery.

1612
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,180
You are probably not gonna win, you know?

1613
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,540
But if you win, what you win is so good.

1614
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,820
Like, I don't know, maybe buy a ticket, fuck it.

1615
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,740
Like, but buy a ticket, get a prenup.

1616
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,660
Like, do you take all your money

1617
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,740
and buy lottery tickets?

1618
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,820
No, but if you, and I don't buy lottery tickets.

1619
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,660
Like, I don't play the lottery.

1620
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,380
I'm not gonna fucking win, why?

1621
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,420
You know, set the money on fire, it'll be more fun.

1622
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,860
But if somebody said to me, no man, you know what?

1623
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,820
Once a week, I buy $20 worth of lottery tickets.

1624
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,420
All right, go for it, you know?

1625
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,460
Somebody's gotta win, maybe it'll be you.

1626
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,540
Like same thing with marriage.

1627
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,420
Like maybe somebody's gotta win.

1628
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,540
Like yeah, I've met hundreds, if not thousands of couples.

1629
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:29,540
And I know one, one that is legitimately happy

1630
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,860
and like really seem to just feed that happiness

1631
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,820
by that marriage that they have.

1632
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,860
And they both as individuals have become the best version

1633
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,260
of themselves by being, you know what?

1634
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,860
Like, that's, they won the lottery.

1635
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,340
So buy the ticket, I guess, you know?

1636
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,820
But I mean, don't make that your retirement plan.

1637
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,660
Like, don't go like, well, you know, don't worry.

1638
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,780
I'm not saving money for my kid's college

1639
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,620
because, you know, I'm buying lottery tickets.

1640
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,220
Like that's, you're an idiot if you're doing that.

1641
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,220
Excellent.

1642
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,980
Jim, thank you so much for sharing your story.

1643
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,820
It was a pleasure.

1644
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,220
Your thoughts on marriage and love and divorce.

1645
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,460
Fascinating topic, isn't it?

1646
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,620
Yeah, it is, and I suspect it will continue to be.

1647
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,300
I don't know that we're gonna culturally

1648
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,380
get any better at it, but the economy's good, we're busy.

1649
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,180
Economy's bad, we're busy.

1650
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,620
Like we're a recession-proof industry.

1651
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,620
So, you know, it's, even COVID didn't slow us down, you know?

1652
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,900
It probably sped you up.

1653
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,300
Well, people said for better or for worse,

1654
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,140
they didn't say for lunch, you know?

1655
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,380
And when you're locked in the house together,

1656
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,300
that was not great for most marriages.

1657
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,380
Like there was no, it was not,

1658
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,940
hey, we should all spend more time together.

1659
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,660
You know, there was a lot of difficult conversations

1660
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,780
that came out of that.

1661
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,780
Barbers and divorce lawyers, when the pandemic ended,

1662
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,220
we were, the lines were out the door, you know?

1663
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,220
So whatever the next thing is, you know,

1664
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,940
we'll still be here.

1665
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,460
All right, thank you so much.

1666
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,300
You got it, man.

1667
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,460
Thank you.
