Checking Soft White Underbelly/A Divorce Attorney's Thoughts On Love and Marriage-James Sexton.txt
 Jim shares a lighthearted but significant moment about his ex-wife and a couple they've known since college. Their friendship survived a potentially awkward situation where they chose to hold hands in front of their spouses, which later led to both of them realizing they didn't have romantic feelings for their respective partners. This realization eventually contributed to their divorces. Jim reflects on the nature of marriage, comparing it to a lottery where the odds of finding true love and happiness within the institution are low but the potential reward is invaluable. He emphasizes that while everyone's situation is different, the goal should be to strive for personal growth and a fulfilling partnership if one is lucky enough to find it. Jim notes that despite economic conditions or global events like COVID-19, the field of marriage and divorce remains resilient, with people consistently seeking companionship and support, often leading to difficult but necessary conversations within their relationships. He concludes by acknowledging the essential roles played by barbers and divorce lawyers in society, especially after periods of isolation like the pandemic.
