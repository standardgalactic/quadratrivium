00:01.000 --> 00:03.520
I had a period of time after my divorce

00:03.520 --> 00:06.880
where I was really ambitious when it came to women.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.040
But then it felt like a job.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.600
Like it felt like a job after a while

00:10.600 --> 00:12.320
where I was like, God, it's like enough.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.800
It's kind of enough.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.040
You know, like it's like,

00:15.040 --> 00:16.280
it's like when you've eaten so much

00:16.280 --> 00:18.620
that you just go, I got that way with posse.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.800
Like it really was like I just had enough.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.960
Like I was fine.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.080
I was like, this is great, but.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.360
Well, when you're in your 20s or 30s,

00:25.360 --> 00:28.480
maybe your libido is a strong meal.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.880
It makes you insane.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.720
Yeah, yeah, I was not.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.560
I definitely was.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.000
As we age, we mellow.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.800
Yeah, which I think is great.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.640
Although I have to tell you,

00:36.640 --> 00:39.040
one of the most depressing divorces I ever did

00:39.040 --> 00:42.000
was a guy who was, I think, 92.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.960
Oh, geez.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.880
And what made it depressing is that he had left his wife

00:45.880 --> 00:49.320
of, I don't know, 50 something, 60 something years

00:49.320 --> 00:52.320
for a younger woman, a woman in her 50s.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.400
And I just remember what was sad about it to me

00:54.400 --> 00:57.640
was this guy still being led around by his dick.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.480
Like I thought, oh my God.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.320
I'm gonna be chained to an idiot forever.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.280
Like I'm gonna forever be led around by my dick.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.480
And I remember thinking like, no,

01:05.480 --> 01:08.840
I really thought that at like 90 something,

01:08.840 --> 01:11.480
I would just like a beautiful woman would walk by

01:11.480 --> 01:12.880
and I'd go, oh, there's a human being.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.000
Like there would be no.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.840
You'd appreciate it without.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.360
Yeah, there would just be no sense of like, yeah.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.440
You know, there would just, that would be gone from me.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.320
And this guy's proof that 90 something years old

01:23.320 --> 01:25.200
and you're still thinking with your dick, like I.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.040
Redumed.

01:26.040 --> 01:26.880
That terrified me.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.720
It really did.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.560
It actually upset me.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.160
Because I thought, man, I thought at some point

01:31.160 --> 01:34.160
I'd get to experience what it's like to just be free.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.680
If you live in New York where there's a financial industry,

01:36.680 --> 01:38.760
there's all kinds of industries here.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.600
Oh yeah.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.760
But to me, sometimes I wonder if female attractiveness

01:43.760 --> 01:46.760
isn't the highest valued commodity in our country.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.800
100% it is.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.640
100%.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.480
It is.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.320
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.240
Because men are becoming rich and powerful

01:52.240 --> 01:53.280
in order to get a woman.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.120
Of course.

01:54.120 --> 01:54.940
The woman they want.

01:54.940 --> 01:55.780
Of course.

01:55.780 --> 01:58.240
What an attractive woman.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.480
And when I say attractive, I don't just mean attractive.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.240
I mean, even just sexually confident.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.100
I mean, what an unbelievably lucrative career that is.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.360
Like I do divorces for people that,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.200
you know, a woman walks out with $200, $300 million.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.400
He was an analyst at Goldman Sachs

02:14.400 --> 02:16.560
who built a hedge fund and then sold it

02:16.560 --> 02:18.480
and then used his trading algorithm

02:18.480 --> 02:21.360
to build it up to $500 million.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.000
She was hot and slept with him for a while

02:26.040 --> 02:29.480
and then stopped and started sleeping with other people

02:29.480 --> 02:32.160
and playing tennis and having Botox.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.080
And she's going to get half.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.920
Like that's fucking incredible.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.120
Like, do you know what he had to do to get that?

02:38.120 --> 02:41.520
And what she had to, I'll fuck that guy for $200 million.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.600
Are you kidding me?

02:42.600 --> 02:43.640
Like that's insane.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.560
That's incredible.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.080
Like, and God bless.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.920
I mean, I'm not saying that this person,

02:47.920 --> 02:49.920
this is the rules of the game, you know?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.720
But you can't argue that that's not easier

02:52.720 --> 02:53.760
than going to Harvard.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.600
No, for sure.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.480
But then the payoff, the trade off for that

02:56.480 --> 02:59.000
is that when they hit a certain age,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.440
the value decreases.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.520
Right, any stock, if you hold it too long,

03:03.520 --> 03:05.080
it's going to go down, you know?

03:05.080 --> 03:07.800
Like, so play the stock the right way.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.400
I mean, and that's what I think.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.800
If we were a little more honest

03:11.800 --> 03:14.000
about the nature of male-female coupling,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.400
I mean, right now we can't even, you know,

03:15.400 --> 03:18.480
we can't even establish what is gender.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.440
You know, we can't establish any of that anymore.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.840
So divorce has become incredibly hilarious and fraught.

03:23.840 --> 03:28.520
But to me, what is, like, sometimes you have to stand back

03:28.520 --> 03:30.760
and look at things to get the real perspective

03:30.760 --> 03:31.600
on what it is.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.600
And sometimes you look back at marriage.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.720
So when was it invented?

03:35.720 --> 03:38.240
Like 2000 BC, roughly.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.280
And the life expectancy of humans back then was 18 years old.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.120
Yeah, yeah.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.760
Marriage was created for...

03:45.760 --> 03:46.600
Landownership.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.400
Landownership and things like that.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.480
And if you're going to die in your early 20s or whatever,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.880
then getting married at 16, 18 makes sense.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.680
Well, I think there's a distinction

03:55.680 --> 04:00.680
that has to be made between pair bonds and marriage, right?

04:01.520 --> 04:04.800
Marriage is a government concept.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.160
Marriage is a contract.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.040
Marriage is a legal status.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.640
Pair bonds, right?

04:10.640 --> 04:14.280
Two people go in it together, you know,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.680
saying, hey, there's 7.3 billion people in the world

04:16.680 --> 04:19.760
and the two of us, we're going to lock up together

04:19.760 --> 04:21.000
and we're going to try to hold hands

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
and get through this thing.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.320
Till we're eight years old.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.000
Well, until whatever, you know?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.400
I mean, what's interesting is,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.120
first of all, all marriages end.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.160
They end and death are divorced, but they all end.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.280
Like every marriage ends.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.360
So it's one of the only things that you go,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.800
wow, I really hope this ends in us dying.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.560
You know, most things, that's not the desired outcome.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.440
But in marriage, you hope marriage will end in death.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.720
You hope that you will be together

04:42.720 --> 04:45.160
until one or both of you die, you know?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.360
But all marriages end.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.480
But as a guy, as a provider,

04:48.480 --> 04:49.920
if you knew it was going to end

04:49.920 --> 04:51.360
and you were going to have to give away half your money,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.120
you might think twice about doing it.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.560
Well, I think that's what makes

04:54.560 --> 04:55.840
being a divorce lawyer interesting,

04:55.840 --> 04:59.680
is that it's a lot of what a court has to do

04:59.680 --> 05:04.020
is disregard what happened in the marriage,

05:04.020 --> 05:07.240
because A, the truth is at the bottom of a bottomless pit.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.680
Like you're never going to get there.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.720
Yeah, well, he's fucking his secretary.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.000
Right, because you are not sleeping with me anymore.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.880
I have a client whose wife acknowledges

05:14.880 --> 05:16.960
she didn't sleep with him for six years.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.440
What did you think was going on

05:19.440 --> 05:21.280
if you didn't sleep with him for six years?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.960
So you, okay, delegate.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.680
You've delegated that responsibility.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.400
If you don't want to have sex with him, that's okay.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
No one should force you to have sex with this person.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.720
Let him go have sex with someone else.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.920
You don't want to do the laundry.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.280
Hire someone to do the laundry.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.680
If you don't want to mow your own lawn,

05:33.680 --> 05:35.080
hire someone to mow the lawn.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.760
Delegate that responsibility.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.120
And this guy wasn't even sleeping around.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.480
He was going to those hand job places, you know,

05:41.480 --> 05:42.680
where you get a massage and you get a hand.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.520
Like what the most pathetic thing in the world,

05:46.520 --> 05:48.400
the most innocuous thing in the world.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.520
He didn't have a girlfriend.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.760
There was no love involved.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.760
He was getting jacked off for $50.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.840
Like that's sad.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.400
Like I mean, first of all, hand jobs.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.120
Like that's an outdated technology.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.880
That's like a Betamax, you know,

05:59.880 --> 06:01.640
like who even does that anymore?

06:01.640 --> 06:05.640
But he was doing this and he just thought, okay, that's fine.

06:05.640 --> 06:10.080
She had the indignation to say he is not a,

06:10.080 --> 06:11.800
he shouldn't be a custodial parent.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.440
He's a terrible person because he's doing this.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.520
And it was like, wait, how is that that much different

06:17.520 --> 06:19.080
than going to a strip club?

06:19.080 --> 06:20.880
How is that much more different?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.920
Cause we just, you know, he was like, well, should I deny it?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.200
And I was like, is it true?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.400
And he's like, well, yeah, I said, no, we should own it.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.640
Let's go in and say, yeah, you know what?

06:28.640 --> 06:29.640
Yeah, it's pathetic.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.600
It's really pathetic.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.360
My wife didn't sleep with me for six years and I'm human.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.080
And I wanted to have sex still.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.440
I didn't want to blow up my life.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.680
I didn't want to screw up my kids

06:38.680 --> 06:40.360
and have my kids have divorced parents.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.200
So I thought, all right,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.360
she's clearly not interested in me and more.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.680
I'm not going to have a girlfriend

06:44.680 --> 06:46.040
and get caught up in all the things

06:46.040 --> 06:47.960
where people could get hurt and there's feelings

06:47.960 --> 06:49.560
and fatal attraction and stuff.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.280
I'm just going to go, it'll be transactional.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.240
Like going to a strip club or anything else.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.000
And I'm, yeah, is it a little pathetic

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
that I'm a guy who makes a million dollars a year

06:57.000 --> 07:00.120
in finance and I'm paying someone $50 to jack me off?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.280
Yeah, it's kind of pathetic, but you know what?

07:02.280 --> 07:03.120
I figured it out.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.720
But to suggest that that means I'm a bad parent,

07:05.720 --> 07:09.280
that has nothing to do with my parenting at all, period.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.280
You know, so, and thankfully the judge agreed

07:11.280 --> 07:12.240
with me on that one.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.800
But I really do think that the idea,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.880
I don't think, I mean, if you break it down fundamentally,

07:19.880 --> 07:23.320
56% of marriages end in divorce.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.560
But think about that's the ones that end in divorce.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.680
So how many people, what percentage stay together

07:30.680 --> 07:32.320
for the kids?

07:32.320 --> 07:33.880
Or cause they don't want to give away half their shit.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.880
Another 10% that's conservative.

07:35.880 --> 07:36.720
Conservative.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.880
But let's say 20% then, okay?

07:38.880 --> 07:39.720
That's at least right.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.600
Now I have a technology that fails 76% of the time.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.160
That's insane.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.000
That's insane.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.240
That's more likely than not.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.800
76%, if I told you there's a 76% chance

07:50.800 --> 07:51.760
when you walk out the door today

07:51.760 --> 07:53.480
you're gonna get hit in the head with a bowling ball,

07:53.480 --> 07:56.400
you would not go out or you'd wear a helmet for sure.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
But people just continue to get married.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.720
Not only do they continue to get married,

07:59.720 --> 08:03.200
there's a presumption that you should get married.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
And if you don't get married,

08:04.200 --> 08:05.420
there's something wrong with you.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.840
So if you've got a girlfriend and you've been with her

08:08.200 --> 08:11.640
for five years and you say to someone,

08:11.640 --> 08:12.600
we're getting married.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.680
They go, oh, that's great.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.280
They don't go, why?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.200
You're happy.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.400
Why would you get married?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.560
Like everything's going fine.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.880
Why would you put yourself through that?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.720
Why would you run that risk?

08:22.720 --> 08:25.080
If you say to someone, we've been together five years

08:25.080 --> 08:26.760
and we've decided we're not gonna get married.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.600
We're gonna move in together,

08:27.600 --> 08:28.800
but we're not gonna get married.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.760
Ooh, what's wrong?

08:29.760 --> 08:30.920
You got intimacy issues?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.160
What's your problem?

08:32.160 --> 08:35.520
Me want to set 56% end in divorce.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.760
It literally fits the legal definition of negligence.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.240
It's a negligent behavior.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.320
The way you define negligence in law school

08:43.320 --> 08:47.560
is when what you lose by not doing something

08:48.880 --> 08:52.440
is lower than the risk of harm.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.920
It's what's called a BPL analysis.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.480
So the burden of not doing a thing

08:56.480 --> 09:01.480
is lower than the likelihood, the probability of harm.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.920
So BPLs, the burden, probability and loss.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.720
Marriage is an inherently negligent activity.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.240
It's like owning a lion.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.680
Like the likelihood of someone getting hurt

09:13.680 --> 09:16.040
seriously by this is very, very high.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.440
You know, whatever says it to you, because why?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.760
Because, and I would say to me,

09:19.760 --> 09:21.280
I've been doing this for over 20 years

09:21.280 --> 09:23.920
and I still get misty-eyed at weddings.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.080
Like I still really, there's something in me

09:26.080 --> 09:28.160
that goes like, you know, maybe it'll work out

09:28.160 --> 09:29.000
for these two.

09:29.000 --> 09:29.840
You still believe in much.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.000
I absolutely believe in love.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.360
I think love is wonderful.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.720
But love and marriage have very little to do with each other.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.160
I don't think there's much of a correlation there.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.960
I think that's where we got off track.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.360
Like I believe in pair bonds.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.480
I believe, I don't think I can learn everything

09:46.480 --> 09:49.400
I need to know about myself from myself.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.160
I think having someone around me who sees my blind spots

09:53.160 --> 09:55.440
and that it doesn't have to be a romantic partner.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.960
That could be a friend, that could be any number of things,

09:57.960 --> 10:00.640
but there is something wonderful

10:00.640 --> 10:02.160
about romantic connection.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.000
We know that.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.280
I mean, the other statistic is 56% of marriages

10:05.280 --> 10:08.720
and in divorce, but 84% of people who get divorced

10:08.720 --> 10:11.400
are remarried within five years of their divorce.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.240
Really?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.080
Let's think about that.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.680
So now you've done it and failed

10:16.680 --> 10:18.480
and felt the pain of the loss

10:18.480 --> 10:21.720
and within five years, 84% are remarried.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.960
So when you fall in love

10:24.200 --> 10:27.080
and you're with a partner who is in love with you,

10:27.360 --> 10:29.960
it's like hard to put the brakes on and say,

10:29.960 --> 10:32.160
you know what, that's as far as I'm gonna go.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.600
Well, I think we, you know,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.920
whoever discovered water, it wasn't a fish.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.600
And I think when we're in a thing, we don't see it.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.040
And so, I mean, and this is true of any of us.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.400
There must be some endorphins,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
something's being released in our brains.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.280
Listen, you wanna test that theory.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.520
The next time you're out with a couple

10:48.520 --> 10:50.320
who've been together for a while

10:50.320 --> 10:52.240
and it seems like they maybe got in a fight

10:52.240 --> 10:54.400
or they're just like kind of being impatient

10:54.400 --> 10:55.600
with each other at the table.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.240
You know, when you go like a group thing.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.520
Just say to them, so tell me about how you met.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.040
Tell me the story of how you met

11:03.040 --> 11:05.120
and everything on them changes.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.200
At like, they go back to that place.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.720
And there's this like, oh yeah, and she was this,

11:09.720 --> 11:12.800
because for that second, you go back to that place.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.080
Like you can go, someone with a horrible divorce,

11:16.080 --> 11:18.320
if you could get them to go to that place

11:18.320 --> 11:20.240
and talk to you about that time.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.680
Like I would say something, when I was a kid,

11:22.680 --> 11:24.680
you know, like every kid, you have the fantasy of like,

11:24.680 --> 11:26.640
if you were invisible, what would you do?

11:26.640 --> 11:29.360
You didn't go to the girl's locker room, you know, whatever.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.200
I have this fantasy that if I could be invisible,

11:32.200 --> 11:35.040
I have about eight clients that I'd like to sneak into their

11:35.040 --> 11:36.800
house and find their wedding album.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.480
Like I know it's in the attic somewhere or something.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.160
Cause I would love to see what it looked like

11:42.160 --> 11:43.480
when these people loved each other.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.520
Because they are weaponized against each other now

11:46.520 --> 11:48.520
and we are trying to kill each other

11:48.520 --> 11:52.600
and we're taking every secret, every intimacy, everything.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.400
At their ugliest.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.000
At their ugliest, at their worst.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.600
And there's something in me that just the thought that like,

12:00.600 --> 12:03.720
you guys at some point, like at some point,

12:03.720 --> 12:06.560
you were like, there's 7.3 billion people in the world

12:06.560 --> 12:07.880
and you're the one.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.720
Like you're the one I just want to be with and smell

12:11.720 --> 12:16.120
and touch and like that feeling, we all know that feeling

12:16.120 --> 12:19.240
of like just the electricity of another person, you know?

12:19.360 --> 12:23.360
And I mean, I think I'm a romantic at heart

12:23.360 --> 12:25.200
in the sense that I really get it.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.960
Like I really get why we do this.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.400
I felt it, I know it, I understand it.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.960
But tying that to the technology of marriage to me

12:35.960 --> 12:38.280
makes almost no sense whatsoever.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.000
And I actually think it's almost antagonistic

12:41.000 --> 12:43.640
to that connection with another person.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.040
Because there's so much expectation

12:46.040 --> 12:47.640
that comes with marriage culturally.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.640
We've created so much stuff around it.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.600
Like when you marry someone, they're supposed to be,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.760
at least in the modern Western model,

12:56.760 --> 13:00.280
your best friend, best roommate, best co-parent,

13:00.280 --> 13:05.280
best travel partner, best roommate, best everything,

13:05.560 --> 13:06.680
best activity partner.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.720
Like how would one person be all of those things?

13:09.720 --> 13:10.920
That's insane.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.680
Like if I was interviewing for a job

13:14.680 --> 13:17.120
and said, I want you to be the best typist

13:17.120 --> 13:18.760
and I also want you to be best on the phone

13:18.760 --> 13:20.240
and I also want you to be great at that.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.200
And I ran down a list of dissimilar things.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.400
Like wherever I went to an amazing chef

13:25.400 --> 13:28.080
and I said, I know you're a great chef, but can you farm?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.160
Like that has to do with food,

13:30.160 --> 13:31.560
but they're not the same thing.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.520
Like what are you talking,

13:32.520 --> 13:37.160
so I think why do we put on people this idea?

13:37.160 --> 13:39.960
Like whoever came up with the word soulmate,

13:39.960 --> 13:41.120
really we should be paying,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.600
like divorce lawyer should be paying that person dividends.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.960
Because we've convinced people that if this person

13:46.960 --> 13:48.760
isn't meeting every one of your needs,

13:48.760 --> 13:51.800
checking all of these boxes, they're not your soulmate.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.560
Your soulmate would know exactly what to do,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.760
exactly what to say at exactly the right time.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.040
I can get, I go off on this stuff, tend to.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.000
What do you think the secret is

14:03.000 --> 14:06.400
is keeping a marriage vital, keeping it alive?

14:06.400 --> 14:11.400
You know, I think people get unhappy in marriages

14:12.000 --> 14:13.400
the way that people go bankrupt,

14:13.400 --> 14:16.600
which is very slowly and then all at once.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.360
I think it's very slow and then it just goes off a cliff.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.160
So everybody will say, well,

14:22.160 --> 14:24.520
we divorced because he was cheating or she was cheating

14:24.520 --> 14:26.800
or we divorced because he had an alcohol issue

14:26.800 --> 14:29.800
or a drug issue, which lately we're seeing more

14:29.800 --> 14:32.760
like alcohol and drugs is a big, big thing,

14:32.760 --> 14:33.920
especially post pandemic.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.960
There's a tremendous amount of substance abuse stuff

14:35.960 --> 14:38.440
that's causing a lot of issues in marriages.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.520
And certainly like social media has increased

14:40.520 --> 14:43.920
the accessibility of adultery and connections

14:43.920 --> 14:45.600
to other people and reconnections

14:45.600 --> 14:47.680
to people from your past who remind you

14:47.680 --> 14:50.600
of a version of yourself that you felt more excited about

14:50.600 --> 14:51.840
because you were younger.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.040
So it's, you know, it used to be

14:53.040 --> 14:56.480
if you like ran into the girl you banged in high school,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.080
it was like once every 10 years at reunion, you know,

14:59.080 --> 15:01.680
or if you lived in the same town as you grew up in,

15:01.680 --> 15:04.080
you know, you might run into the person at the Walmart.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.600
But now it's like on Facebook, you have all these excuses

15:06.600 --> 15:08.080
to be able to chit chat with someone

15:08.080 --> 15:12.080
and all these benign entry points, you know, of like,

15:12.080 --> 15:14.240
oh, you know, I saw your pictures from vacation.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.040
Where did you stay in Miami, you know?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
And then it becomes, oh, yeah, well, you look great.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.080
I mean, boy, you look fantastic in a bikini

15:20.080 --> 15:22.120
and all of a sudden we're off to the races

15:22.120 --> 15:23.240
and we're chatting with each other.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.240
So I, you know, if we were gonna invent

15:25.240 --> 15:27.080
like an infidelity machine,

15:27.080 --> 15:29.000
you couldn't do better than Facebook and Instagram.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.180
I mean, that's about as good as it gets.

15:31.180 --> 15:36.180
But I genuinely think that the secret

15:36.600 --> 15:40.560
to staying happy in a marriage is probably

15:40.560 --> 15:45.560
the same secret to maintaining a healthy weight.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.680
You know, don't wait till you get super fat

15:47.680 --> 15:49.480
and then try to lose the weight.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.480
Don't wait until you get really sick.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.360
Like my sister is a dentist and she always says,

15:54.360 --> 15:57.240
if you have a toothache, there's nothing I can do really.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.160
Like I can pull the tooth, I can give you a root canal,

15:59.160 --> 16:01.720
but like I can prevent you from getting a toothache.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.360
If you just come see me regularly

16:03.360 --> 16:05.160
and you just floss and you just brush your teeth,

16:05.160 --> 16:06.280
you'll never get a toothache.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.160
By the time your tooth hurts,

16:08.160 --> 16:10.160
something is already seriously wrong.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.480
By the time you're in a divorce lawyer's office,

16:12.480 --> 16:14.920
you're fucked, the whole thing's fucked at that point.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.400
Like you'd be better off just, you know,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.840
figuring out the preventative maintenance, right?

16:20.840 --> 16:22.720
Like change the oil in your car.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.480
Like, so I, what I try to, if you reverse engineer divorce,

16:27.480 --> 16:30.880
like most people, the marriage killer, you know,

16:30.880 --> 16:33.800
the, like the cheating or the gambling or the whatever,

16:33.800 --> 16:35.840
that's the symptom.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.840
Like the problem is these little disconnections, you know?

16:39.880 --> 16:44.320
One of the, one of the best stories I have is my,

16:44.320 --> 16:46.880
I had a client, I did her divorce,

16:46.880 --> 16:48.920
and we'd spend a lot of time together because you do.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.760
You know, when you're a divorce lawyer,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.000
you spend a lot of time with people

16:51.000 --> 16:52.240
and you get to know them very well.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.680
I mean, people will lie to their therapist,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.000
they won't lie to their divorce lawyer

16:55.000 --> 16:56.920
because A, there's no reason to and B,

16:56.920 --> 16:58.600
you know, I need to know everything

16:58.600 --> 17:00.840
and it's all attorney-client privilege.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.360
And this woman, we were sitting outside the courtroom

17:04.360 --> 17:06.920
waiting on a break in testimony.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.080
And she was a young woman in her,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.720
in her probably like late 30s, you know?

17:10.720 --> 17:11.760
Very attractive.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.400
And we were just chit-chatting and I said to her,

17:14.400 --> 17:19.120
you know, was there a moment when you realized

17:19.120 --> 17:20.800
the marriage is over?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.800
You know, like, was there a moment?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.280
And she said, yeah, yeah.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.280
And I said, when was it?

17:26.280 --> 17:29.760
And she said, there was this granola that I like.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.640
She said it, they only sold it

17:31.640 --> 17:34.000
at like this particular grocery store.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.920
And I like to put it in my yogurt.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.440
And she said, he used to always,

17:38.440 --> 17:40.720
whenever I'd be running low on it,

17:40.720 --> 17:42.200
I would just open the thing one day

17:42.200 --> 17:44.120
and a new bag would be there.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.840
She's like, and I just, she's like,

17:45.840 --> 17:47.560
it made me feel so loved.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.000
Like he didn't, I didn't have to ask.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.800
He didn't want credit for it.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.480
Like he didn't go like, oh, did you see it?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.160
I got your granola that you wanted, you know?

17:56.160 --> 17:58.440
Like he just would do this thing, you know?

17:58.440 --> 18:00.000
And she said, it was just something that like,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.920
I just, it always made me smile.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.720
She said, every time the granola was running low

18:03.720 --> 18:05.040
and there was a new bag of granola,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.800
I just felt very loved, you know?

18:07.800 --> 18:10.640
And she said, one day the granola ran out.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.000
And I thought, oh, that's weird.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.480
You know, maybe he didn't see it.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.560
She's like, so I left the bag in there

18:16.560 --> 18:19.360
because I thought, well, at some point he'll notice.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.300
And he didn't notice.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.560
She goes, so I took the bag out and I waited.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.720
And he didn't get a new bag.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.280
And I thought, okay, this thing's going down.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.760
And I thought to myself, wow, that's like,

18:33.760 --> 18:36.660
you know, that's such a small thing, like granola.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.320
Like you just, but these are the things.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.480
Like these are the little things that make us feel loved

18:42.480 --> 18:44.160
and that are gestures of love.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.980
And when I said to her, was there anything like that

18:47.980 --> 18:50.000
for you with him?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.520
And she said, yeah, blowjobs.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.400
And I almost spit out my coffee.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.040
And she goes, no, she goes, when we were first dating

18:58.040 --> 18:59.320
and even first married, she's like,

18:59.320 --> 19:00.720
I used to give blowjobs a lot.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.160
She's like, you know, she's like, do it in the morning,

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
just took two minutes.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.320
And he was like super happy the rest of the day, you know?

19:06.320 --> 19:07.280
She's like the rest of the day.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.400
He would like call me or text me and be like,

19:09.400 --> 19:10.720
oh, I'm so good this morning.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.560
You know, I had such pep in my step now.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.920
And she's like, it was just like,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.080
what did it really take out of my life to do that?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.480
You know, and it made him feel good.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.160
She's like, and then I got to a point where I was like,

19:20.160 --> 19:21.480
well, you know what, no, I'll wait.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.280
And then tonight we can both, we can have sex.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.320
And we'll both enjoy that.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.880
Like what is why I owe him a blowjob?

19:25.880 --> 19:28.480
Like, no, you know, like I don't owe him that, you know?

19:28.480 --> 19:31.200
And then she said, I got to a point where it was like,

19:31.200 --> 19:33.160
I look back and I'm like, yeah, I guess I,

19:33.160 --> 19:36.240
I didn't do that as often, hardly ever really, you know?

19:36.240 --> 19:37.200
Which came first.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.240
You know, I said that to her and she said,

19:40.240 --> 19:41.640
she said, I couldn't tell you.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.840
She said, but I think it's the same thing.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.680
The same thing.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.880
And I do think it's the same thing.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.760
And I'm not saying blowjobs and granola

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
is all you need to know, but,

19:49.560 --> 19:51.960
and I'm not, by the way, I'm not saying that,

19:51.960 --> 19:53.800
that a blowjob is a small thing.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.880
I don't think I have any right to, I've never given one.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.840
But it seems like a phenomenal feat.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.200
And I'm grateful for everyone I've ever received.

20:00.200 --> 20:05.200
But I don't, I don't think it's a massive investment,

20:05.760 --> 20:06.600
right?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.080
Just like buying someone's granola is not a massive.

20:09.080 --> 20:09.920
But when you love somebody,

20:09.920 --> 20:11.360
you love doing things for them.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.640
Right, their pleasure pleases you.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.560
Their joy pleases you.

20:15.560 --> 20:20.560
Like their, their, you know, their happiness makes you happy.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.200
Exactly.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.480
And somewhere along the line,

20:24.480 --> 20:27.160
and it happens a lot in marriage,

20:27.160 --> 20:30.560
it becomes, well, I'm not happy, why should you be happy?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.400
You know?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.000
And then that creates a spiral.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.160
And I really believe that you can,

20:36.160 --> 20:39.080
that spiral could go in the other direction.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.640
Like if he did the granola,

20:40.640 --> 20:43.880
I think the blowjobs would have come, you know?

20:43.880 --> 20:44.720
And if the, like I,

20:44.720 --> 20:46.080
and if the blowjobs were there,

20:46.080 --> 20:47.440
I bet he'd have bought the granola.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.000
Like I can't prove that.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.400
There's no control group, you know?

20:50.400 --> 20:51.680
I can't run that research.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.280
But it feels to me like those little things,

20:55.840 --> 20:57.520
like leaving a note, you know?

20:57.520 --> 21:00.560
I've said to some of my friends, you know,

21:00.560 --> 21:01.720
when they say to me like, you know,

21:01.720 --> 21:03.840
as a divorce lawyer, you see all this misery,

21:03.840 --> 21:05.480
like, what's, how do I stay out of your office?

21:05.480 --> 21:09.800
And I'll often say, I'm like, it's dumb little things, man.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.520
I'm like, just leave her a note.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.920
I'm like, leave her a note in the morning.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.160
Just leave a little note, says, hey, beautiful.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.800
You know, so, it was so fun watching that movie

21:17.800 --> 21:19.080
with you last night.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.520
So glad we got to have a date.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
I'll be thinking of you today.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.360
Love you.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.960
Like, what does that take?

21:23.960 --> 21:24.960
That takes like a minute.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.840
Not even, like, and look what it can do.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.120
Like, look at how that makes this person feel.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.200
And even if right away, it doesn't work.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.800
On that moment, it doesn't work.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.960
Okay, do it enough times.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.800
Like, and then you're either gonna figure out

21:38.800 --> 21:42.200
that this person's gone, and then just fucking bail.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.040
You're done.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.920
Like, because if you try for long enough,

21:44.920 --> 21:48.920
and you give like that, but if you're not giving like that,

21:48.920 --> 21:51.040
and then you're not getting back either,

21:51.040 --> 21:52.640
well, I'm not surprised, you know?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.120
That's how you end up in my office,

21:54.120 --> 21:56.320
is this death spiral of everyone,

21:56.320 --> 21:57.960
like, well, I'm not giving Guy and the Grinola

21:57.960 --> 21:59.000
issues, not giving me blowjobs.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.640
Well, I'm not giving him blowjobs, he's mean to me.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.280
Okay, well, everybody's just gonna,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.160
has an equal right to be fucking miserable then.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.360
I think if you're happy with yourself,

22:07.360 --> 22:09.680
be truly happy with who you are at that point in your life,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.000
or whatever the situation is,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.940
I think it's easier for you to be happy with your partner.

22:15.940 --> 22:19.280
Yeah, but I would argue that if you're not happy

22:19.280 --> 22:23.760
with yourself, having someone happy with you

22:23.760 --> 22:27.400
is certainly not gonna hurt your feeling of who you are,

22:27.400 --> 22:28.240
right?

22:28.240 --> 22:32.200
Like, I don't need someone to tell me I'm handsome

22:32.200 --> 22:33.440
for me to have a nice day,

22:33.440 --> 22:35.960
but I can't think of anybody telling me I was handsome

22:35.960 --> 22:37.960
that it ruined my day, you know?

22:37.960 --> 22:39.960
Most of the time, you're like, oh, that's nice,

22:39.960 --> 22:42.000
you know, I got that going for me.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.840
So yeah, I think self-love, of course,

22:43.840 --> 22:45.120
is the most important love,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.040
and to be secure in who you are,

22:47.040 --> 22:50.560
and to not allow your self-definition

22:50.560 --> 22:52.560
to be easily swayed or pulled.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.720
Like, if you believe the good reviews,

22:53.720 --> 22:56.560
you gotta believe the bad ones too, I get that,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.960
but I just don't think kindness,

22:58.960 --> 23:01.240
like, it's just such an easy,

23:01.240 --> 23:03.780
especially if it's easy, like if it's easy stuff,

23:03.780 --> 23:05.480
like just telling someone that they're beautiful

23:05.480 --> 23:08.000
or handsome or that you're cheering for them.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.320
To me with marriage, or pair bonds,

23:10.320 --> 23:11.800
I shouldn't even say marriage,

23:11.800 --> 23:14.800
like the world is trying to kill you all the time,

23:14.800 --> 23:17.920
you know, like people are criticizing you all the time,

23:17.920 --> 23:19.800
you feel like a failure a lot of the time,

23:19.800 --> 23:21.640
if you compare yourself to other people,

23:21.640 --> 23:23.000
you'll constantly be, you know,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.920
comparisons the thief of joy.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.000
So why not have like one person

23:28.000 --> 23:29.720
who's just cheering for you, you know,

23:29.720 --> 23:32.920
like constructive criticism is criticism.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.200
It's still just criticism.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.480
So if your spouse is just sitting around criticizing you

23:37.480 --> 23:38.640
and telling you all the things you could do

23:38.640 --> 23:41.480
to improve yourself, instead of just being a fan

23:41.480 --> 23:42.680
and just saying, you know what,

23:42.680 --> 23:45.160
I know who you are and you're beautiful,

23:45.160 --> 23:47.600
I know who you are and your heart is good,

23:47.600 --> 23:49.960
and betting on the best parts of a person,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.840
I think that there's no,

23:51.840 --> 23:54.680
there's very little downside to that, you know.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.840
I think it would put guys like me out of business

23:56.840 --> 23:59.040
if people really leveraged that the right way.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.600
I asked you earlier, if you believe in love,

24:00.600 --> 24:03.200
which you said you do, do you believe in marriage?

24:04.560 --> 24:07.040
I mean, I believe people believe in marriage.

24:07.040 --> 24:07.880
No, but to you.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.320
Yeah, do I believe in marriage?

24:09.320 --> 24:11.760
I don't, I don't think it's a useful technology.

24:11.760 --> 24:15.520
I understand culturally why people do it,

24:15.520 --> 24:17.880
but I don't think people should need it.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.480
I know I certainly don't need marriage.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.160
I don't think marriage, I was married.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.320
I was married before I really ever thought

24:27.320 --> 24:29.160
about what does that mean, you know.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.240
I married my college sweetheart, you know.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.720
I hadn't, I got married because that's what you do,

24:33.720 --> 24:35.160
you get married, you know.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.640
But I hadn't thought about it as a technology

24:38.640 --> 24:39.560
and why it's there.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.560
I didn't, I didn't understand it the way I do now.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.120
You know, there's a line from a Joseph Brodsky poem

24:47.120 --> 24:49.200
that he wrote when his wife died where he says,

24:49.200 --> 24:51.880
I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.800
And I feel that way as a divorce lawyer.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.040
Like I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.440
I wish I, I wish I didn't know what the end

24:59.440 --> 25:01.880
of so many marriages looks like

25:01.880 --> 25:04.640
because I think I would have a more optimistic

25:04.640 --> 25:06.400
and unrealistic view of it.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.240
I would-

25:07.240 --> 25:08.960
Yeah, but you'd be divorced and giving away half your-

25:08.960 --> 25:09.800
I'd be foolish.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.640
Yeah, I'd be foolish.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.800
I'd be as foolish, but I don't know that,

25:12.800 --> 25:15.840
I don't know that it's always good to know, right?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.320
Sometimes there's tremendous joy to be had

25:18.320 --> 25:21.200
and like falling feels like flying for a little while,

25:21.200 --> 25:24.880
you know, till you hit the ground, it feels really good.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.000
As I said earlier, you know,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.840
now that the life expectancy of man is around the 80s

25:28.840 --> 25:31.320
or something, then it's like,

25:31.320 --> 25:34.480
so you're gonna do this from your 20s or 30s until the 80s?

25:34.480 --> 25:36.840
Well, marriage is a technology that was designed

25:36.840 --> 25:40.240
for when women died in childbirth

25:40.240 --> 25:44.120
and when men died in their 40s if they were lucky,

25:44.120 --> 25:46.400
you know, 50s if they were super lucky.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.120
Like if you were in your 50s, your 60s, you were an elder,

25:49.120 --> 25:50.560
you know, that was pretty amazing.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.600
Women, most women died in childbirth.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.040
Like childbirth is traumatic.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.240
It's a traumatic thing and before modern medicine

25:56.240 --> 25:57.880
and before we understood antibiotics.

25:57.880 --> 26:02.520
So marriages is, I don't think anyone ever planned

26:02.520 --> 26:06.440
that it was gonna be, okay, we're gonna do this forever.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.720
You know, we're gonna do this till we're 100.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.000
I mean, but I think that's part of a bigger problem.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.640
You know, I don't remember who said it,

26:13.680 --> 26:16.040
but I remember someone saying,

26:16.040 --> 26:17.760
I can't remember who it was,

26:17.760 --> 26:22.760
but we are prehistoric creatures, right?

26:23.680 --> 26:27.260
Like we are biological creatures

26:28.960 --> 26:33.760
living in medieval institutions

26:33.760 --> 26:38.760
like education, work, with God-like technology.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.680
How do you think that ends?

26:41.680 --> 26:44.280
Like you think that ends and happily ever after?

26:44.280 --> 26:46.040
Like that's insane.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.600
Marriage was not designed, I mean,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.800
think about even the early days of marriage.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.080
Think about every Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.200
you know, think about Oklahoma, you know,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.240
where you'd have like, there's like the three people

26:56.240 --> 26:58.400
in town that aren't married, you know,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.800
and you sort of pick which of the three,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.880
you know, you were gonna go be with.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.880
And now you have access to just an endless supply

27:08.280 --> 27:10.360
of the opposite sex, or I shouldn't even say

27:10.360 --> 27:12.240
the opposite sex, you have an endless supply

27:12.240 --> 27:15.520
of romantic partners in a device in your hand.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.960
How does that possibly stand up?

27:18.960 --> 27:22.480
How does marriage, the idea of monogamy,

27:22.480 --> 27:25.120
forced monogamy or enforced monogamy,

27:25.120 --> 27:27.880
how does that ever survive in that environment?

27:27.880 --> 27:30.600
I don't think it can, I don't think it's realistic.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.200
And the statistics prove me right.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.640
You know, the statistics are absolutely in my favor.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.200
Now again, get married as many times as you want

27:39.200 --> 27:40.080
if you have a prenup.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.400
Go get married, get married's a blast.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.000
Being married is difficult.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.040
You know, someone once said that it's great

27:47.040 --> 27:48.200
to be married sometimes.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.800
The problem is you're married all the time.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.100
So you're a fan of prenups?

27:51.100 --> 27:52.280
I'm a huge fan of prenups.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.160
I mean, I shouldn't be because a prenup

27:55.160 --> 27:58.160
for a couple of thousand dollars will save you hundreds

27:58.160 --> 28:00.280
of thousands of dollars potentially in legal fees,

28:00.280 --> 28:01.440
if not millions.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.320
So there are clients I have that have spent

28:04.320 --> 28:06.520
over a million dollars just in their legal fees,

28:06.520 --> 28:10.000
that if they had spent $2,000 on a prenup,

28:10.680 --> 28:12.760
none of that, they'd still have that money in their pocket.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.640
And that's incredible to me.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.240
Like I have two sons who are adults

28:16.240 --> 28:18.320
that they are absolutely gonna have prenups.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.520
Like they have to have prenups.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.200
They'd be fools to not have prenups.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.120
It's like jumping out of a plane with no parachute.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.640
Why would you do that?

28:24.640 --> 28:26.220
You know, it's just, it's stupid.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.600
Prenups are enforceable, they make sense.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.240
I actually think there's something very romantic

28:30.240 --> 28:33.000
about prenups because they're forcing you

28:33.000 --> 28:36.880
to have a conversation about this relationship.

28:37.560 --> 28:42.120
I genuinely believe that we are the most aware of our health

28:42.120 --> 28:44.440
just after we got sick, right?

28:44.440 --> 28:46.560
Like when we, if you wake up and you have a toothache,

28:46.560 --> 28:49.080
all you can think about is the fact your tooth hurts.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.720
And then your toothache goes away and for like a week.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.600
You're taking care of your teeth.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.320
You go, oh my God, at least I don't have a toothache.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.960
You know, but then a month goes by and you don't wake up

28:59.960 --> 29:01.800
and go, well, at least I don't have a toothache.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.960
And it's the furthest thing from your mind.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.280
But theoretically you could wake up today and go,

29:06.320 --> 29:07.440
I don't have a toothache.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.760
I don't have a backache.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.240
I don't have a head cold.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.840
Like this is a great day.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.200
What does a typical prenup look like?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.200
Typical, the easiest prenup in the world.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.960
Easiest, yours, mine, ours.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.280
That's it, yours, mine, ours.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.680
Then your name, it's yours.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.360
If it's in my name, it's mine.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.200
Like in a divorce, everything,

29:24.200 --> 29:26.440
all the assets are split 50-50.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.760
Well, no, what you say in a prenup-truel agreement is,

29:28.760 --> 29:31.200
if it's an asset or a liability,

29:31.200 --> 29:32.720
if it's in my name, it's mine.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.960
If it's in your name, it's yours.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.080
If it's in our joint names,

29:36.080 --> 29:38.040
we'll divide it 50-50.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.080
That's it, yours, mine, ours.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.960
And then you have to have ongoing conversations

29:41.960 --> 29:45.720
throughout the marriage about, you know,

29:45.720 --> 29:47.000
hey, I got this bonus at work.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.160
Do I put it in my account?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.240
Do I put it in the joint account?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.720
If the husband owns a house that's worth

29:50.720 --> 29:53.280
whatever, $2 million, and he marries a woman.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.680
The house is his still.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.120
Well, they have to have a conversation.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.760
Do I owe you a house?

30:00.760 --> 30:02.000
That's an awkward conversation.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.480
Okay.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.480
You know what's a more awkward conversation?

30:05.480 --> 30:07.680
I had a conversation 10 years later with a lawyer

30:07.680 --> 30:09.600
about the fact that you have to give half of this house

30:09.600 --> 30:10.560
away to someone.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.400
Isn't it better to have that conversation

30:12.400 --> 30:14.760
when you still, like, why would you learn

30:14.760 --> 30:16.320
how to fight in a fight?

30:16.320 --> 30:20.920
But won't that undermine the love that each person feels?

30:20.920 --> 30:21.760
Why?

30:21.760 --> 30:22.600
Why?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.440
You're gonna die.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.120
Does that undermine your life?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.440
Or does it make you conscious of the fact

30:27.440 --> 30:30.240
that this is finite and that you should be out there?

30:30.240 --> 30:32.920
Like, I think having a conversation with your partner

30:32.920 --> 30:34.240
about, look, I love you.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.800
You love me.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.880
We want to do this thing together.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.480
But the numbers are against us

30:39.480 --> 30:41.080
and the world is antagonistic to it.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.320
And I hope we'll be together forever.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.680
But if we split up, what do we owe each other?

30:45.680 --> 30:47.520
What do you expect from me?

30:47.520 --> 30:48.760
Because I have to tell you something.

30:48.760 --> 30:49.960
I'm a fair person.

30:49.960 --> 30:50.920
I'm a fair person.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.920
If you say to me, you know, Jim,

30:52.920 --> 30:55.440
I'm not gonna work as hard

30:55.440 --> 30:56.580
because you make a good living.

30:56.580 --> 30:59.400
So if we split up, I'm gonna need help

30:59.400 --> 31:01.720
for a couple of years because I'm not gonna pay

31:01.720 --> 31:03.200
attention to my career.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.840
Okay, does that unreasonable?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.320
That's totally reasonable.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.400
You know, if I say, hey, listen,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.600
I have this house and I bought it, you know,

31:10.600 --> 31:12.400
but I'm buying it with money that I made

31:12.400 --> 31:14.120
really before we were together.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.760
So if we split up, I don't really think

31:15.760 --> 31:17.640
you deserve half of it.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.480
I think that if we bought things for it together,

31:20.480 --> 31:22.360
that, okay, those things you can half of,

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
but the house itself, like that's money I had

31:24.360 --> 31:27.840
before I met you and why can't you have that conversation?

31:27.840 --> 31:29.120
What, why not?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.320
Instead, I mean, you buy a house,

31:32.320 --> 31:35.360
you do a HUD one, a lead paint disclosure,

31:35.360 --> 31:36.880
you gotta sign all these things that,

31:36.880 --> 31:38.360
this is how much the interest is gonna be

31:38.360 --> 31:41.040
and you get married and you can get a fucking pamphlet.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.640
You don't get anything.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.840
You just did the most legally significant thing

31:44.840 --> 31:47.240
you're ever gonna do other than die

31:47.240 --> 31:49.640
and no one has explained any of it to you.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.560
People come into my office and they go,

31:51.560 --> 31:53.480
well, my retirement account, that's in my name.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.720
And I'm like, yeah, it doesn't matter.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.560
It's in your name?

31:55.560 --> 31:56.800
Okay, was it acquired during the marriage?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.280
Okay, she's got half of it.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.160
Well, I have this bank account, but it's in my sole name.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.600
It's money that I inherited from my mom.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.120
I'm like, okay, it's in your name, yeah,

32:05.120 --> 32:07.000
but you inherited that money during the marriage.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.140
And did you put money that you earned

32:09.140 --> 32:10.800
during the marriage in that account also?

32:10.800 --> 32:12.760
Yeah, okay, that's commingled and transmuted.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.880
That's now marital property.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.960
So they don't know that.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.800
Why?

32:16.800 --> 32:19.440
Because no one tells them that when they're getting married.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.400
All they did, you spend more time talking about the cake

32:22.400 --> 32:24.400
than you do talking about the fact

32:24.400 --> 32:27.400
that you just opted out of the title system.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.000
That's gigantic.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.920
You can't legally change the beneficiary

32:31.920 --> 32:35.320
of your life insurance, even to your children,

32:35.320 --> 32:37.520
if you're married, without your spouse

32:37.520 --> 32:39.280
signing a consent to that.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.280
No one tells you that when you get married.

32:40.280 --> 32:43.800
You get married, Elvis can marry you for $20

32:43.800 --> 32:45.880
at a drive-thru cathedral.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.360
And it's a legal status, a massive legal,

32:49.360 --> 32:50.920
you buy your spouse a Rolex,

32:50.920 --> 32:53.000
you bought yourself one half of a Rolex.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.280
You buy someone a birthday present who you're married to,

32:56.120 --> 32:58.600
you bought yourself one half of that birthday present.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.320
Nobody know, people don't know that.

33:00.320 --> 33:03.360
They learn that for the first time in my office

33:03.360 --> 33:04.440
or in a courtroom.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.720
That's insane.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.040
What other thing in the world?

33:08.040 --> 33:11.000
Like anything else, any other contract,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.120
you would say, well, wait a minute,

33:12.120 --> 33:13.720
no one explained that to me.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.760
No one explained that to me.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.240
When I leased this car,

33:16.240 --> 33:18.480
no one explained to me that there's wear and tear.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.160
Doesn't say it anywhere in the contract, right?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.920
Okay, marriage contract doesn't say that.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.800
It doesn't say, oh, and by the way,

33:25.800 --> 33:27.160
you're opting out of the title system

33:27.160 --> 33:29.200
and your retirement assets and all these other things.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.040
And if there's any debts

33:30.040 --> 33:31.760
and you could have enhanced earning capacity

33:31.760 --> 33:33.440
or celebrity goodwill that has to be valued

33:33.440 --> 33:36.360
by forensic accountants that'll cost you $100,000,

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
you don't, no contract that says that.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.400
It just says, yep, we're getting married.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.360
It's two witnesses, we're good.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.680
What other contract?

33:43.680 --> 33:46.880
What other contract in the United States or anywhere

33:46.880 --> 33:49.920
has that lack of disclosure and is that binding?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.340
None, zero, none.

33:52.340 --> 33:56.820
So a prenup, yes, that's an awkward conversation, I guess.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.220
I don't know that it has to be.

33:58.220 --> 33:59.140
And I have to tell you,

33:59.140 --> 34:00.780
the more awkward of a conversation it is,

34:00.780 --> 34:03.180
the more you should think twice about getting married.

34:03.180 --> 34:08.180
Because if you can't have a conversation with this person

34:08.220 --> 34:12.000
about the possibility that someday one or both of you

34:12.000 --> 34:14.100
might hurt each other,

34:14.100 --> 34:19.100
like how many people, while they're still happy and in love,

34:19.980 --> 34:24.300
say something like, you know, babe, I love you.

34:25.540 --> 34:28.340
But we're gonna disagree about something at some point.

34:28.340 --> 34:32.740
And when we do, how do you like to fight?

34:32.740 --> 34:34.580
Like, do you need a minute?

34:34.580 --> 34:36.800
Like, do you need like to be alone for a minute

34:36.800 --> 34:39.220
so you can kind of calm down?

34:39.220 --> 34:41.700
Or are you the like, hey, we gotta figure this out

34:41.700 --> 34:43.180
and we can't go to bed angry?

34:43.180 --> 34:45.260
Like, cause let's talk about that now

34:45.260 --> 34:47.020
while we're not in the fight.

34:47.020 --> 34:50.580
Like, let's talk about it now while we still get along

34:50.580 --> 34:52.620
and we're happy and we're trying to figure out

34:52.620 --> 34:54.100
how to navigate each other.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.380
It's hard enough to navigate yourself.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.220
I wanna navigate another human being.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.660
Why don't we have that conversation now?

34:58.660 --> 34:59.500
But no, we don't.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.900
We learn on the job.

35:00.900 --> 35:04.340
We learn how to fight in a fight, which is insane.

35:04.340 --> 35:06.460
You know, but again, why?

35:06.460 --> 35:08.500
Well, cause it's awkward.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
It'd be awkward to have that conversation.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.780
More awkward than getting in a fight

35:12.780 --> 35:14.180
where you don't know the rules of engagement,

35:14.180 --> 35:17.540
or you don't know how your partner does better

35:17.540 --> 35:18.780
or would feel better.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.300
Like, and you're not gonna ask them that

35:20.300 --> 35:21.700
in the heat of battle, you know?

35:21.700 --> 35:25.180
So why wouldn't you have that awkward conversation

35:25.180 --> 35:27.980
while you have this abundance of affection for each other?

35:27.980 --> 35:30.300
I mean, when I negotiate prenups,

35:30.300 --> 35:32.300
it's the easiest thing in the world in a sense

35:32.300 --> 35:35.500
because these two people really like each other.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.460
You know, they're about to get married.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.980
So they're clearly not trying to kill each other.

35:39.980 --> 35:41.940
At that point, they clearly like each other.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.300
So you just say, hey, listen, go home,

35:43.300 --> 35:45.740
talk to your fiance about X, Y, and Z,

35:45.740 --> 35:48.100
and see what they, you know, see what they think.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.140
And see, tell them what your concern is.

35:50.140 --> 35:53.220
And very often, people will come back and say to me,

35:53.220 --> 35:55.100
I mean, I have to tell you, I've been doing this now,

35:55.100 --> 35:57.060
you know, over 20 years.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.220
I do a lot of prenups.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.260
I do maybe five, six prenups a month,

36:01.260 --> 36:03.020
sometimes during like pre-wedding season,

36:03.020 --> 36:05.500
which is the fall and before the summer,

36:05.500 --> 36:08.260
I'll do 10, 15 a month.

36:08.260 --> 36:10.740
The people who say to me,

36:11.740 --> 36:14.300
oh, well, I don't want to have that conversation.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.620
You know, I think, they get the prenup

36:17.620 --> 36:19.980
and within three, four years, they're divorced.

36:19.980 --> 36:21.660
Sometimes five years and then seven years,

36:21.660 --> 36:22.980
but they're the ones who get divorced.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.980
They have no business getting married.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.580
Like the ones who have the discussion

36:27.580 --> 36:29.780
and figure out the, well, I'm worried

36:29.780 --> 36:31.580
because if you keep the place, yeah, you're right.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.380
Okay, so what if I give you this amount of money

36:33.380 --> 36:34.460
and it's this much for each of you?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.300
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.460
Let's do it that way.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.180
Those people, they're probably never gonna put the prenup

36:38.180 --> 36:39.020
in a safe someplace.

36:39.020 --> 36:40.180
You'll never look at it probably.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.740
Good communication solves it all.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.700
Because they're able to talk to each other

36:43.700 --> 36:45.620
and they're able to talk about hard things.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.340
How are you gonna be married to someone?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.540
Have children with someone

36:50.540 --> 36:53.500
and you can't talk about hard things, you know?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.620
Like how?

36:54.620 --> 36:55.900
How are you gonna navigate life

36:55.900 --> 36:57.820
and not be able to talk about hard things?

36:57.820 --> 36:58.720
Like that's silly.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.660
So if you can't talk about hard things,

37:00.660 --> 37:01.860
don't get fucking married.

37:01.860 --> 37:02.700
It's okay.

37:02.700 --> 37:03.540
You don't have to.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.660
You can stay together.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.860
But people love, I had a client.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.540
No joke, guy was in his 70s.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.580
He was married four times.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.780
I did his third and fourth divorces

37:12.780 --> 37:15.660
and he was getting married for a fifth time.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.100
And I said to him, I was like,

37:17.100 --> 37:19.300
because I actually thought he's older.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.420
So I thought like, does he know

37:20.420 --> 37:22.660
you don't have to marry them anymore?

37:22.660 --> 37:23.940
Like maybe he doesn't know.

37:23.940 --> 37:24.780
He's dividing his assets.

37:24.780 --> 37:25.980
Yeah, maybe someone didn't tell him.

37:25.980 --> 37:26.900
Like maybe someone didn't tell him,

37:26.900 --> 37:27.820
like you can fuck them.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.180
You don't have to marry them anymore.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.020
You can just do that.

37:30.020 --> 37:31.380
He's dividing his asset multiple times.

37:31.380 --> 37:34.940
Well, I mean, it's getting smaller and smaller every time.

37:34.940 --> 37:35.780
But I said to him, I was like,

37:35.780 --> 37:37.820
why are you doing this again?

37:37.820 --> 37:39.820
I was like, you don't have to get married.

37:39.820 --> 37:42.260
Like you're clearly not great at it, you know?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.820
Like, and he was very funny.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.260
He said, you know, Jim, he said,

37:47.380 --> 37:51.900
you buy a car and you drive it for 200,000 miles

37:51.900 --> 37:54.060
and eventually the engine craps out.

37:54.060 --> 37:56.460
So you go out and you buy a Ferrari

37:56.460 --> 37:58.100
or you buy some flashy sports car

37:58.100 --> 37:59.140
and you drive it for a couple of months

37:59.140 --> 38:00.820
and you realize this is not the car for me.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.140
So you get rid of it.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.540
Then you get another car.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.140
And you know, you think this one's gonna be the one for you

38:06.180 --> 38:08.180
but you know, after you drive it for like a year,

38:08.180 --> 38:10.100
you realize, yeah, this is not the car for me.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.100
You can lease them instead of buying them.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.260
You're gonna walk everywhere for the rest of your life?

38:13.260 --> 38:14.340
Yeah, well, that was my answer.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.260
You could lease them.

38:15.260 --> 38:16.620
You could lease them or you could,

38:16.620 --> 38:18.140
you could have some other alternative.

38:18.140 --> 38:19.460
I mean, here's the thing about marriage,

38:19.460 --> 38:20.860
is it's a technology.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.780
So we made it up so we can change it.

38:23.780 --> 38:27.340
You think marriage will change in the next 20 years?

38:27.340 --> 38:29.900
No, no, I think it'll,

38:29.900 --> 38:31.660
I actually think it's gonna have,

38:31.660 --> 38:32.860
I mean, I think we're leaning,

38:32.860 --> 38:34.580
I think the pendulum always swings hard

38:34.580 --> 38:35.420
in the other direction.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.300
We have a tendency as a culture to overcorrect.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.700
So I think we're heading into a spiral

38:40.700 --> 38:42.900
of like traditional stuff.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.580
Like I think you're gonna see like people getting

38:44.580 --> 38:46.380
like super religious again

38:46.380 --> 38:48.140
and people are gonna get super dogmatic.

38:48.140 --> 38:49.860
I think we're gonna see the trad wife thing.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.700
We're gonna see the hyper masculine.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.900
We're gonna see like a very, you know,

38:53.900 --> 38:55.980
we've got to, we've gone so far

38:55.980 --> 38:57.700
in the direction of postmodernism

38:57.700 --> 38:58.820
where nothing means anything

38:58.820 --> 39:01.180
and everything's just, you know, like there is no definite.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.540
We've become like Sartre, you know,

39:03.540 --> 39:05.820
like we've become so postmodern

39:05.820 --> 39:07.980
that it's become almost the form of rugged individualism.

39:07.980 --> 39:09.780
I think we're gonna swing in the other direction now

39:09.780 --> 39:12.900
and traditional institutions are gonna get popular again.

39:12.900 --> 39:16.300
It will be, I mean, you know, from a marriage place,

39:16.300 --> 39:17.140
it's gonna be great

39:17.140 --> 39:18.540
because I think people are gonna get married.

39:18.540 --> 39:20.780
I mean, people were slowing down on getting married

39:20.780 --> 39:23.580
for a while and they were getting married later

39:23.580 --> 39:24.860
and they're having kids later.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.060
We're declining to have kids.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.300
And I think as we, I think as a culture,

39:30.300 --> 39:33.140
we start re-solidifying into gender roles

39:33.140 --> 39:35.820
or gender tropes, depending on how we wanna look at it.

39:35.820 --> 39:39.020
I think you're gonna see marriage resurge again,

39:39.020 --> 39:40.500
but I think that it's still gonna be

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
as flawed of a technology as it ever was.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.620
And I think we have so much out there now

39:46.620 --> 39:48.860
to compare ourselves to.

39:48.860 --> 39:50.020
You know, you used to compare yourself

39:50.020 --> 39:52.300
to the neighbors next door

39:52.300 --> 39:53.820
and what car they had in the driveway

39:53.820 --> 39:54.700
and what they were wearing

39:54.700 --> 39:56.740
when they left for church on Sunday.

39:56.740 --> 40:00.060
Now you're just looking at everyone's greatest hits.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.340
While living your gag reel, you know,

40:02.340 --> 40:05.060
and you're never looking at any of that stuff

40:05.060 --> 40:07.100
when you're having like a peak experience.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.060
You know, you're on the toilet or you're bored

40:09.060 --> 40:10.940
and you're looking at everyone's hashtag blessed.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.460
I mean, well, they're in my office.

40:12.460 --> 40:15.380
I can't tell you how many people do a consult with me

40:15.380 --> 40:16.340
and they're cheating

40:16.340 --> 40:18.300
and they haven't slept with their spouse in three years

40:18.300 --> 40:19.620
and they're miserable

40:19.620 --> 40:21.300
and you're looking at their Instagram

40:21.300 --> 40:24.860
and it's all like best life ever, hashtag greatest hubby ever.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.140
And you're like, what is this?

40:26.140 --> 40:28.000
It's performance art.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.240
You know, it's an advertisement of how happy you are

40:30.240 --> 40:32.840
but this is what people are comparing themselves to.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.880
They're looking at that

40:34.880 --> 40:37.040
and going, oh, my marriage isn't that good.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.680
That marriage isn't that good.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.720
Trust me, that marriage isn't that good.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.080
That marriage is in my, look at celebrities.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.000
You don't even need to look at the people you know.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.840
Look at celebrities.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.000
Before they do the, it is with great sadness

40:49.000 --> 40:50.920
that we advise that we're going to be moving

40:50.920 --> 40:53.560
in separate directions and consciously uncoupling

40:53.560 --> 40:56.080
and like that right before that, it's like,

40:56.080 --> 40:59.200
oh no, we're happy, we're great, we're phenomenal.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.720
You know, we're constantly advertising

41:02.720 --> 41:06.520
how wonderful our relationships are while they're on fire.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.640
You know, and then wondering why everyone's, you know,

41:08.640 --> 41:10.000
miserable in their relationship

41:10.000 --> 41:12.160
because they're comparing it to something fake.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.800
It's like comparing your body to a photoshopped body.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.640
You know, it's-

41:16.640 --> 41:17.960
Other than social media, do you think there's something else

41:17.960 --> 41:20.720
in our society that made marriage more difficult

41:20.720 --> 41:23.040
to stay together?

41:24.040 --> 41:24.880
Now makes it worse.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.320
And just like your parents stayed married?

41:27.320 --> 41:29.720
Yeah, my parents stayed married until my mother passed away.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.800
Same with me.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.280
But they were mixed result.

41:33.280 --> 41:38.280
I see, I think that my parents were not as caught up

41:39.640 --> 41:41.640
in their own happiness.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.320
I think we're very caught up in our own happiness.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.400
We're all very self.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.800
Yeah, we're all very sort of, I don't want to say narcissistic,

41:46.800 --> 41:48.680
but we're very much like we are the son

41:48.680 --> 41:50.720
around which everything revolves.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.760
What am I not getting?

41:51.760 --> 41:54.200
Yeah, my father was a Vietnam veteran, you know.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.640
Well, he got out of the Naval Academy in 66

41:56.640 --> 41:58.680
and went to Vietnam for three years.

41:58.680 --> 41:59.920
So he was alive.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.400
So he was like, fuck, I'm ahead.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.520
I'm playing with the house's money.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.360
I'm alive.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.760
Everybody in their wedding party,

42:04.760 --> 42:06.840
all the men in their wedding party died in Vietnam.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.280
There's five guys in their wedding party.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.120
They all died in Vietnam.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.000
My parents never looked at their wedding novel

42:11.000 --> 42:12.520
because every single man and it was dead.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.280
They were all helicopter pilots in Vietnam

42:14.280 --> 42:16.520
who got killed in their 20s, you know.

42:16.520 --> 42:19.360
So they didn't really see marriages.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.640
Like it was a partnership.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.480
It was like, yeah, we're gonna do this thing.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.320
We're gonna have kids.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.240
We're gonna raise the kids.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.240
We're gonna, you know, we're gonna have a house.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.600
You know, we're gonna have a car.

42:28.600 --> 42:29.560
Like we'll be successful.

42:29.560 --> 42:30.400
The lights are on.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.880
My father was dirt poor.

42:31.880 --> 42:35.840
He came from like Appalachian part of Virginia,

42:35.840 --> 42:37.640
a small town called Shawsville.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
Didn't have indoor plumbing

42:38.640 --> 42:40.520
until he left for the Naval Academy.

42:40.520 --> 42:43.840
And he just, I think he saw marriages.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.360
Yeah, that's what you do, you know.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.640
He met my mom on Fleet Week.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.480
She was a nurse in the city.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.600
And he was, you know, on Fleet Week

42:50.600 --> 42:52.720
and he had his uniform on and he was in a bar

42:52.720 --> 42:55.800
and he was drunk and he went to her

42:55.800 --> 42:58.200
and he said, you're the most beautiful woman

42:58.200 --> 42:59.960
I've ever seen and I'm gonna marry you.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.320
Cause he was drunk.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.680
And she said, are you in the military?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.960
Cause he was wearing a uniform and he said, yep.

43:05.960 --> 43:06.920
And she said, what country?

43:06.920 --> 43:09.240
And he said, whatever country you're from.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.680
And he invited her to visit him at the Naval Academy

43:11.680 --> 43:13.840
a couple of weeks later and she came.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.360
But he'd invited three other women.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.040
He just didn't know if any of them would come.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.240
So he'd invited all of them.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.540
So my mom got there and she saw these other women

43:21.580 --> 43:25.140
and she said, either I'm leaving or they're all leaving.

43:25.140 --> 43:26.860
And he was like, I kind of like her.

43:26.860 --> 43:28.340
So he made them all leave.

43:28.340 --> 43:30.660
And they were, yeah, they were married 50 plus years.

43:30.660 --> 43:32.940
But, you know, their marriage had challenges.

43:32.940 --> 43:34.300
You know, he was an alcoholic.

43:34.300 --> 43:36.740
He's been in recovery for maybe seven, eight years

43:36.740 --> 43:40.040
since she passed, but, and he's remarried.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.540
But he remarried within a year of my mom dying.

43:42.540 --> 43:45.620
Like he was the kind of, he's of a generation of men

43:45.620 --> 43:48.140
that he needed someone to take care of him.

43:48.140 --> 43:49.220
You know, my mom died.

43:49.220 --> 43:51.360
He didn't even know how to scramble an egg.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.480
Like it was, you know, like after she passed,

43:53.480 --> 43:56.320
I had him come to stay with me and my sons.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.560
And I was trying to like teach him like, okay, dad,

43:58.560 --> 44:00.320
here's how you make like a batch of chili

44:00.320 --> 44:02.360
and then you can eat it all week, you know.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.500
And I was like, how's this guy gonna,

44:04.500 --> 44:06.420
cause they had this very, you know,

44:06.420 --> 44:08.480
but that's what I met another older woman

44:08.480 --> 44:10.620
and her husband had died.

44:10.620 --> 44:11.880
She needed someone to take care of.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.520
He needed someone to take care of him.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.360
But that generation didn't have it as easy as we know.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
That's what I'm saying.

44:16.360 --> 44:20.360
Like they, they, just meeting your basic needs, right?

44:20.360 --> 44:21.520
They were grateful to be alive.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.840
They were grateful to be alive

44:22.840 --> 44:24.480
because they'd either been through a war.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.560
We're not grateful unless we're driving a Mercedes or a,

44:26.560 --> 44:28.120
and even then we're not grateful

44:28.120 --> 44:29.800
because, because the truth is as well.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.100
Okay, a Mercedes, a Mercedes, who cares?

44:32.100 --> 44:33.320
You know, when people have a Mercedes,

44:33.320 --> 44:34.640
my secretary has a Mercedes.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.060
She leases it, you know, I drive a Jeep.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.000
So is she better than me?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.280
Is she more successful than me?

44:39.280 --> 44:40.840
She works for me, you know.

44:40.840 --> 44:44.540
So I don't, I don't know that any of it's enough anymore.

44:44.540 --> 44:45.920
Like no matter what watch you have,

44:45.920 --> 44:48.680
somebody's got another one or a better one or five of them.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.020
And all those comparison that we see.

44:50.020 --> 44:53.460
It's all, and so I just think that's the thing

44:53.460 --> 44:55.580
that makes it impossible, right?

44:55.580 --> 44:58.180
Like if, if, if you're,

44:58.180 --> 45:02.700
our parents' generation was struggling

45:02.700 --> 45:04.700
to just make it through, right?

45:04.700 --> 45:06.820
To, to meet your basic needs,

45:06.820 --> 45:09.940
to keep a roof over your head, to raise your children.

45:09.940 --> 45:12.460
And now where it's very much, are you self-actualized?

45:12.460 --> 45:13.300
Are you happy?

45:13.300 --> 45:14.460
Do you have an eight pack at?

45:14.460 --> 45:16.060
Like it would never have occurred to my father,

45:16.060 --> 45:17.780
did he have an eight pack?

45:17.780 --> 45:20.460
It would never have been something he thought of, you know?

45:20.460 --> 45:23.740
It's just not, it just wasn't on his radar, you know?

45:23.740 --> 45:25.660
And I don't think my mother would have ever been like,

45:25.660 --> 45:28.400
oh, you know, he, he doesn't have an eight pack.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.060
Like that wouldn't, because again,

45:30.060 --> 45:33.060
though it's not constantly being advertised to him, you know?

45:33.060 --> 45:36.420
I think that how many women did he interact with in a day?

45:36.420 --> 45:38.820
You know, how many women do I interact with in a day?

45:38.820 --> 45:41.740
Visually, or personally in some fashion,

45:41.740 --> 45:44.820
or, or, you know, in a curated, mediated way.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.860
And again, those are curated women, by the way.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.900
So they're Photoshopped, they're airbrushed,

45:48.900 --> 45:50.900
they're, they've got filters on them.

45:50.900 --> 45:55.900
So again, you know, how does marriage survive in that setting?

45:56.700 --> 46:00.540
It had a hard enough time surviving without all of that.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.900
I mean, forget kids.

46:01.900 --> 46:03.740
The divorce rate keeps increasing, right?

46:03.740 --> 46:05.660
Yeah, it keeps going up, it keeps going up.

46:05.660 --> 46:10.040
It's, it's been hanging around 53 to 56% for a while.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.300
We had a bump after COVID.

46:11.300 --> 46:12.820
What are other countries like?

46:13.700 --> 46:18.700
Countries that have a significant religious narrative

46:19.140 --> 46:21.260
have the lowest divorce rates.

46:21.260 --> 46:24.300
So the lowest divorce rates are in like, you know,

46:24.300 --> 46:25.140
Saudi Arabia.

46:25.140 --> 46:26.180
Yeah, but they don't have a whole lot of choice.

46:26.180 --> 46:27.780
Right, you're not allowed to divorce.

46:27.780 --> 46:29.340
You just have your wife killed, you know?

46:29.340 --> 46:32.580
So that's, you don't have to divorce.

46:32.580 --> 46:34.900
So the countries where there is this very strict

46:34.900 --> 46:38.500
religious prohibition against marriage, or against divorce.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.340
But I mean, the United States

46:39.340 --> 46:41.100
is probably the highest divorce rate?

46:41.100 --> 46:42.580
We're among the highest, yeah.

46:42.940 --> 46:44.780
I don't think we're the, we might,

46:44.780 --> 46:46.980
we might be the highest now.

46:46.980 --> 46:51.040
For a while, Germany had a very high divorce rate.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.940
France had a pretty high divorce rate.

46:54.300 --> 46:56.620
What's interesting is, is the divorce rate

46:56.620 --> 47:00.300
and the marriage satisfaction rates, those are different.

47:00.300 --> 47:04.340
Cause most people, the goal is not, can we stay married?

47:04.340 --> 47:06.940
The goal is, can we stay happily married, you know?

47:06.940 --> 47:08.460
Cause if somebody said to me like, yeah,

47:08.460 --> 47:09.980
I've been married 25 years

47:09.980 --> 47:12.300
and I've been fucking miserable for 15 of them.

47:12.300 --> 47:13.780
Like, I'm not gonna envy you.

47:13.780 --> 47:15.720
Like, great job, you're really hung in there

47:15.720 --> 47:17.580
in that awful situation, you know?

47:17.580 --> 47:19.980
Like, that's not impressive to me, you know?

47:19.980 --> 47:22.820
I have a cousin who got married and I was,

47:22.820 --> 47:25.520
I was chatting with her, she's a younger woman.

47:25.520 --> 47:30.520
And I, her, her husband just joined the police force.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.540
And I said to him, so I was trying to make small talk.

47:32.540 --> 47:35.500
And I said, so do you, you know, do you like it?

47:35.500 --> 47:37.100
And he's from a family of cops.

47:37.100 --> 47:38.780
And he said, nah, not really.

47:38.780 --> 47:40.620
But you know, I'm gonna do like the 20 years

47:40.620 --> 47:42.260
and then you know, you get your pension.

47:42.260 --> 47:47.220
And I thought, I'll just do my 20, that's 20 years.

47:47.220 --> 47:50.940
You're 25 years old, that's 25 to 45.

47:50.940 --> 47:53.180
Those are fucking incredible years.

47:53.180 --> 47:54.780
You'll never get those back.

47:54.780 --> 47:58.580
And your approach to life is, yeah, I mean, I don't like it,

47:58.580 --> 48:00.540
but I'll just kind of do it, you know?

48:00.540 --> 48:02.400
Like I, I want to tip toe through life

48:02.400 --> 48:03.900
and arrive safely at death.

48:03.900 --> 48:08.020
Like that seems, you know, but I, I, I get that that's what

48:08.100 --> 48:10.740
we're, if that's what marriage is,

48:10.740 --> 48:13.100
if it's an endurance event, you know,

48:13.100 --> 48:16.140
where no, no, you've got to stay married, you know?

48:16.140 --> 48:18.740
Why, I mean, that's why I think

48:18.740 --> 48:21.500
religions have been very quick to, I mean,

48:21.500 --> 48:22.940
I always tell people I'm not religious.

48:22.940 --> 48:25.020
I was raised very Catholic.

48:25.020 --> 48:28.620
But the reality is that, you know, I mean, there's,

48:28.620 --> 48:33.620
if in fact, God talked to humanity with 10 commandments,

48:34.620 --> 48:39.620
I think it's hilarious that the only thing he has to say twice

48:39.740 --> 48:42.900
is don't fuck people you're not married to.

48:42.900 --> 48:45.900
Thou shall not kill once, right?

48:45.900 --> 48:48.360
Honor the Sabbath once.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.740
Don't covet your neighbor's wife, don't commit adultery.

48:51.740 --> 48:54.020
It's, it's the only thing.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.860
It's the only thing that got two commandments.

48:56.860 --> 48:59.780
So like Bayes goes, don't kill, honor the Sabbath,

48:59.780 --> 49:01.380
don't fuck people you're not married to,

49:01.420 --> 49:04.260
seriously, don't fuck people you're not married to.

49:04.260 --> 49:05.660
Like they just, no, it didn't,

49:05.660 --> 49:08.020
Dasha, not steal one, you know,

49:08.020 --> 49:09.780
it's the only one that got double billing.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.260
Well, religion's a big component.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.860
It's a huge component too, but why?

49:12.860 --> 49:14.980
Because how else are you going to control people?

49:14.980 --> 49:16.420
How else are you going to get people

49:16.420 --> 49:20.060
to sign on for this thing and not sleep with each other?

49:20.060 --> 49:22.140
I mean, I'm not saying Freud was right,

49:22.140 --> 49:25.340
but we do want to sleep with people.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.220
We do want to kill people that don't do

49:27.220 --> 49:28.060
what we want them to do.

49:28.060 --> 49:29.780
Like we have these animal instincts.

49:29.780 --> 49:31.660
We have these impulses.

49:31.660 --> 49:32.660
And what do we do with them?

49:32.660 --> 49:34.540
Well, we have to live in a civilized society.

49:34.540 --> 49:36.220
So civilization, it's this content.

49:36.220 --> 49:37.460
We have to suppress certain things.

49:37.460 --> 49:39.300
If marriage was outlawed or just abolished,

49:39.300 --> 49:41.340
it would just be a free-for-all.

49:41.340 --> 49:42.540
I don't know that that's true.

49:42.540 --> 49:43.380
I mean, I think that,

49:43.380 --> 49:46.900
I think people would like us to believe that's true.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.980
You know, I don't believe that.

49:48.980 --> 49:51.860
Like I don't believe that if,

49:51.860 --> 49:52.700
Probably a lot of heavy.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.580
If murder wasn't illegal,

49:55.580 --> 49:57.700
that I would just go killing people.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.260
Like I, like, you know, like I,

50:00.260 --> 50:04.100
I rape and murder as many people as I want to,

50:04.100 --> 50:07.100
which is none, cause I'm not a monster.

50:07.100 --> 50:10.660
Like I don't, I rape as many people as I want to, none,

50:10.660 --> 50:11.820
because I don't want to.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.780
I wouldn't want to do that to another person.

50:13.780 --> 50:16.940
I think society would be probably happier without marriage.

50:16.940 --> 50:19.660
Well, I think we would have a lot less

50:19.660 --> 50:22.860
of the damage that comes, right?

50:22.860 --> 50:26.620
I think we'd have to find new narratives

50:27.460 --> 50:32.020
to structure, to define relationships, right?

50:32.020 --> 50:37.020
I mean, I do think there is a part of us that wants to say,

50:37.300 --> 50:40.780
cause you know, as a grown man who's divorced,

50:41.660 --> 50:45.940
when you're 20 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,

50:45.940 --> 50:47.180
nobody thinks anything of it.

50:47.180 --> 50:49.740
When you're 50 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,

50:49.740 --> 50:51.380
people go, there's a story there.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.380
Like cause you're either divorced or commitment phobic,

50:54.380 --> 50:56.340
or why do you have a girlfriend when you're 50?

50:56.340 --> 50:58.100
Why isn't that your wife?

50:58.100 --> 51:00.340
So they know there's a story there.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.220
So we'd have to, and I get it, I get it,

51:03.220 --> 51:06.500
because if someone says, oh, that's my boyfriend,

51:06.500 --> 51:08.020
it's like, all right, well, that could be for a week.

51:08.020 --> 51:08.860
That could have been nothing.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.580
That could be like, yeah, that's my boyfriend.

51:10.580 --> 51:14.460
My husband, it's like, oh, okay, wait, that's her husband.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.220
Like she's got some authority there.

51:16.220 --> 51:19.740
So I get that there's this idea that we want to say,

51:19.740 --> 51:22.180
like, you know, it's like when you're a little kid,

51:22.180 --> 51:25.060
this is my friend, but this is my best friend.

51:25.060 --> 51:26.620
You know, this is my best friend.

51:26.620 --> 51:30.580
But like how many adults still need to say that?

51:30.580 --> 51:32.820
Like how many adults still need to say,

51:32.820 --> 51:36.860
oh, my friend, Todd and I, and my best friend, Tom and I,

51:36.860 --> 51:40.660
like, okay, like, so they extra special friend?

51:40.660 --> 51:43.340
Like, what are they, like, do they get health insurance

51:43.340 --> 51:44.180
with that?

51:44.180 --> 51:45.400
Like, what is the deal with that?

51:45.400 --> 51:47.860
So I think that's kind of what marriage has become,

51:47.860 --> 51:50.860
is it's like, you know, well, the person I love.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.420
No, no, but like the person I love.

51:53.420 --> 51:55.260
Like there's a lot of people I love.

51:55.260 --> 51:57.660
I wouldn't want to be married to any of them.

51:57.660 --> 51:59.980
But there's a lot of people I love, you know?

51:59.980 --> 52:02.740
And I love my ex-wife.

52:02.740 --> 52:04.180
I wouldn't want to be married to her.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.380
I think she loves me.

52:05.380 --> 52:06.420
She wouldn't want to be married to me.

52:06.420 --> 52:07.260
I don't blame her.

52:07.260 --> 52:08.920
I'm a great ex-husband.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.180
I'm a terrible husband.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.780
I'm a great ex-husband.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.420
Because the skill set for an ex-husband

52:13.420 --> 52:15.580
is totally different than skill set for a husband.

52:15.580 --> 52:18.140
Skill set for a father is completely different

52:18.140 --> 52:18.980
than that of a husband.

52:18.980 --> 52:22.220
That's the thing I have to tell people all the time.

52:23.060 --> 52:24.620
People say, well, he's a terrible husband,

52:24.620 --> 52:25.940
so he shouldn't have custody of the kids.

52:25.940 --> 52:26.860
I'm like, what the fuck?

52:26.860 --> 52:30.620
Where's the overlap between being a good husband

52:30.620 --> 52:32.420
and being a good father?

52:32.420 --> 52:34.220
Like being a good father is a whole different skill.

52:34.220 --> 52:36.700
You could be a great husband and a shit father.

52:36.700 --> 52:38.860
And you could be an amazing father, a terrible husband.

52:38.860 --> 52:42.220
Like there's very little overlap in those skill sets.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.220
You know, maybe good listening skills would be helpful

52:44.220 --> 52:46.460
in both or patience would be good in both.

52:46.460 --> 52:47.860
But that's true of almost anything.

52:47.860 --> 52:49.560
You know, it's a doctor and a lawyer.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.140
Both be good if you had good listening skills.

52:51.180 --> 52:53.100
It doesn't mean that the same profession.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.700
Is divorce harder on women or men?

52:56.340 --> 52:57.400
That's a great question.

52:59.820 --> 53:02.180
I think it's equally hard on both,

53:02.180 --> 53:04.540
but I think that the world is more sympathetic

53:04.540 --> 53:06.980
to women when they get divorced.

53:06.980 --> 53:09.380
I think when a woman gets cheated on,

53:09.380 --> 53:11.340
the man's a piece of shit.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.800
And when a woman cheats on a man,

53:13.800 --> 53:16.500
she must have been forced into the arms of this other man

53:16.500 --> 53:17.860
or she had to explore herself

53:17.860 --> 53:20.580
or she was being neglected in some fashion.

53:20.580 --> 53:24.980
So if a man cheats, he's a piece of garbage.

53:24.980 --> 53:27.580
And if a man's wife cheats,

53:27.580 --> 53:29.540
he mustn't have been meeting her needs.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.940
And she had every right in the world.

53:30.940 --> 53:33.540
Like, so the world is very unsympathetic

53:33.540 --> 53:35.460
to men when they get divorced.

53:35.460 --> 53:37.820
But that's been throughout hers.

53:37.820 --> 53:39.300
Yeah, that's been for, I mean,

53:39.300 --> 53:43.060
there was a maternal presumption, a legal presumption,

53:43.060 --> 53:45.900
what was called the tender year's doctrine,

53:45.900 --> 53:48.100
which was that if a child was under the age of seven,

53:48.100 --> 53:49.340
they were automatically presumed

53:49.380 --> 53:51.540
that they would be in the custody of the mother.

53:51.540 --> 53:55.460
And men, so men get really beat up still in court.

53:55.460 --> 53:58.220
I mean, the law theoretically is gender blind right now,

53:58.220 --> 54:01.340
but I don't actually see that.

54:01.340 --> 54:03.420
Because the law is people, the law is judges,

54:03.420 --> 54:06.860
and judges are human and they are all the same biases.

54:06.860 --> 54:08.860
And it's just not a moment right now

54:08.860 --> 54:12.820
where men are particularly sympathetic characters.

54:12.820 --> 54:15.540
I think that even young men, I mean,

54:16.340 --> 54:19.820
if at a school dance they sing Beyonce's Girls

54:19.820 --> 54:22.500
Who Runs the World, like if there was a song called Men,

54:22.500 --> 54:26.060
Who Runs the World Men, and it was a positive thing,

54:26.060 --> 54:27.580
like you get pilloried for that.

54:27.580 --> 54:30.580
So I think that men have a very hard time right now

54:30.580 --> 54:31.500
in divorce.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.020
They see their children less,

54:33.020 --> 54:35.100
they get hit harder financially.

54:36.180 --> 54:38.260
They are the bad guy no matter what.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.780
If they cheat, they're the bad guy.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.980
If they get cheated on, they were the bad guy

54:41.980 --> 54:43.380
because they probably neglected her.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.180
There's a presumption that the man

54:45.180 --> 54:47.340
is to blame a lot of the time.

54:47.340 --> 54:51.140
Now again, marriage equality has been a thing for a while.

54:51.140 --> 54:53.740
So there are tons of gay couples.

54:53.740 --> 54:56.740
So you have two men, two women divorcing each other.

54:56.740 --> 55:00.380
And that hasn't really shook out too much yet

55:00.380 --> 55:02.180
in terms of how that plays out.

55:03.020 --> 55:05.500
I don't know if it's that gay and lesbian couples

55:05.500 --> 55:07.580
are better at it than heterosexual couples

55:07.580 --> 55:09.380
or if it's still they're in the honeymoon period

55:09.380 --> 55:12.940
because marriage equality hasn't been around that long.

55:12.940 --> 55:17.780
But I think men find a less sympathetic world.

55:17.780 --> 55:20.240
But in fairness,

55:22.380 --> 55:25.780
divorced men have it a little easier, I think.

55:25.780 --> 55:30.340
Divorced men meet a young woman

55:30.340 --> 55:33.180
and the woman's like, instant family, just add me.

55:33.180 --> 55:34.340
That's great, you know.

55:34.340 --> 55:37.060
If he's got kids, it's like, oh, he's got kids.

55:37.060 --> 55:41.300
Look at how nurturing he is and how lovely and women,

55:41.300 --> 55:42.620
you know, they get divorced.

55:42.620 --> 55:46.540
They've got kids, guys are like, whoop, it's got baggage.

55:46.540 --> 55:48.140
I'm not going near that.

55:48.140 --> 55:53.140
So I think that men and women have different problems

55:53.380 --> 55:58.060
post-divorce and the world could be better to both of them.

55:58.060 --> 56:03.060
I think that I have some women who I've done their divorce

56:03.860 --> 56:07.100
and whatever guy is with them is gonna be very lucky

56:07.100 --> 56:10.780
because they're beautiful, they're smart, they're good moms,

56:10.780 --> 56:13.860
but they're also vibrant, exciting women.

56:13.860 --> 56:15.020
Now they're loaded.

56:15.020 --> 56:17.220
And they've got money now, yeah, they've got money.

56:17.220 --> 56:19.340
They don't have as much financial insecurity.

56:19.340 --> 56:20.860
Although I have to tell you that,

56:20.860 --> 56:22.580
it's the last remaining feminist taboo.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.580
I got a lot of women paying alimony these days.

56:24.580 --> 56:29.020
I mean, women can, women marry the like handsome musician

56:29.020 --> 56:32.300
who's not successful or the artist, you know.

56:32.300 --> 56:33.460
There's a lot of listen week.

56:33.460 --> 56:37.700
It hasn't been, you know, there's been a significant effort

56:37.700 --> 56:39.900
in our culture in the last decade

56:39.900 --> 56:43.660
if anyone didn't notice to improve the situation of women.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.260
If you have an equally qualified man

56:45.260 --> 56:46.940
and an uniquely qualified woman,

56:46.940 --> 56:49.140
the woman's the diversity higher, the man's not.

56:49.140 --> 56:52.060
So I have a lot of women who get, when they get told,

56:52.060 --> 56:54.780
like, oh yeah, no, you gotta give them half your shit

56:54.780 --> 56:56.340
or oh no, you gotta pay alimony

56:56.340 --> 56:59.100
because he makes 50 grand a year and you make 250.

56:59.100 --> 57:00.020
And they're like, you know,

57:00.020 --> 57:02.260
they could be the staunchest feminist in the world.

57:02.260 --> 57:03.740
And when you tell them they gotta pay alimony,

57:03.740 --> 57:06.700
they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he's a man.

57:06.700 --> 57:09.580
He's got a strong back, he can get out there and work.

57:09.580 --> 57:13.020
And then suddenly the whole like gender is a construct

57:13.020 --> 57:14.500
and there's no such thing.

57:14.500 --> 57:15.740
That goes right out the window

57:15.740 --> 57:17.100
and you got told you gotta pay alimony.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.860
That's like, nope, no, no, no, no.

57:18.860 --> 57:20.300
I believe in strict gender roles.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.900
Men should pay alimony.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.660
Women, even if you earn 10 times,

57:23.660 --> 57:24.980
you should not have to pay alimony.

57:24.980 --> 57:29.020
I've had very, very staunchly feminist clients

57:29.020 --> 57:33.100
who changed their mind about how feminist they were

57:33.100 --> 57:36.220
when they got told that they were gonna have to pay alimony.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.140
Interesting.

57:37.140 --> 57:39.060
Yeah, but I do have a lot of men

57:39.060 --> 57:42.140
who won't take alimony even though they're entitled to it

57:42.140 --> 57:43.700
because there's just some feeling of like,

57:43.700 --> 57:44.660
yeah, no, I'm not doing that.

57:44.660 --> 57:45.660
It's emasculating.

57:45.660 --> 57:47.060
Like if she tells people that we know

57:47.060 --> 57:48.380
that I took alimony from her,

57:48.380 --> 57:50.020
like people will think I'm less than a man.

57:50.020 --> 57:51.780
So again, it's all gender stuff.

57:51.780 --> 57:52.620
It's still out there.

57:52.620 --> 57:54.820
It's still part of the zeitgeist.

57:54.820 --> 57:56.620
We're still trying to figure it all out.

57:56.620 --> 58:00.300
How many marriages are genuinely happy, you think?

58:01.540 --> 58:03.220
How many married couples?

58:03.220 --> 58:04.780
Gosh.

58:04.780 --> 58:06.980
Because I see married couples that have been married.

58:06.980 --> 58:09.540
It looks like they've been married a decade or two

58:09.540 --> 58:10.380
and they're having dinner

58:10.380 --> 58:12.020
and they're having the same conversation they had yesterday

58:12.020 --> 58:13.460
or the day before or the day before that

58:13.460 --> 58:15.300
and the weeks and months before that.

58:15.300 --> 58:16.500
You know, here's what I'll tell you.

58:16.500 --> 58:21.380
I have, I know a lot of people

58:21.380 --> 58:23.660
and I think I know one couple

58:24.740 --> 58:27.380
that has like a genuinely happy marriage.

58:27.380 --> 58:29.100
What do you think the secret is?

58:29.100 --> 58:30.540
Ah, they really like each other.

58:30.540 --> 58:31.380
I don't know.

58:31.380 --> 58:33.460
Like they're really good to each other.

58:33.460 --> 58:36.740
I have to tell you, they make me very uncomfortable.

58:37.700 --> 58:39.580
My ex-wife and I jokingly say

58:39.580 --> 58:42.460
that they were the reason we got divorced

58:42.460 --> 58:46.380
because we've known them since we were in college

58:46.380 --> 58:48.380
and we went to Disney with them,

58:48.380 --> 58:50.700
with their kids and our kids,

58:50.700 --> 58:53.020
when all the kids were little.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.060
And we were gonna go on a ride

58:55.060 --> 58:57.020
with our kids and their kids

58:57.020 --> 58:59.260
and they were gonna like,

58:59.260 --> 59:01.220
oh, we'll take the kids on the ride

59:01.220 --> 59:02.660
and you guys can go.

59:02.660 --> 59:03.500
And my friend was like,

59:03.500 --> 59:06.300
oh good, we're just gonna go walk and hold hands.

59:06.340 --> 59:08.300
And they walked away and like holding hands

59:08.300 --> 59:09.860
and we looked at them

59:09.860 --> 59:11.940
and we didn't say anything to each other.

59:11.940 --> 59:13.940
But like five years later when we got divorced,

59:13.940 --> 59:17.460
I said, you know, when I saw the two of them together,

59:17.460 --> 59:20.020
I thought, I don't feel like that about her.

59:20.020 --> 59:21.140
Like, and she said, oh my God,

59:21.140 --> 59:24.220
I remember that exact moment and I felt the same way.

59:24.220 --> 59:26.340
So I think they make people uncomfortable.

59:26.340 --> 59:29.300
Like when you see someone who's got it right,

59:29.300 --> 59:31.660
like this guy just loves her.

59:31.660 --> 59:32.500
He loves her.

59:32.500 --> 59:34.420
They've been married 25 years

59:34.420 --> 59:36.740
and dude, it's like he's talking

59:36.740 --> 59:38.300
about a girl he met yesterday.

59:38.300 --> 59:40.180
And she's the same way about him.

59:40.180 --> 59:41.020
Like she's-

59:41.020 --> 59:41.860
It's a miracle when that happens.

59:41.860 --> 59:42.860
Yeah, I just think it,

59:42.860 --> 59:44.100
you know, man, I tell people,

59:44.100 --> 59:45.340
marriage is like the lottery.

59:45.340 --> 59:48.180
You are probably not gonna win, you know?

59:48.180 --> 59:52.540
But if you win, what you win is so good.

59:52.540 --> 59:55.820
Like, I don't know, maybe buy a ticket, fuck it.

59:55.820 --> 59:57.740
Like, but buy a ticket, get a prenup.

59:57.740 --> 59:59.660
Like, do you take all your money

59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.740
and buy lottery tickets?

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.820
No, but if you, and I don't buy lottery tickets.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.660
Like, I don't play the lottery.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.380
I'm not gonna fucking win, why?

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.420
You know, set the money on fire, it'll be more fun.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.860
But if somebody said to me, no man, you know what?

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.820
Once a week, I buy $20 worth of lottery tickets.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.420
All right, go for it, you know?

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.460
Somebody's gotta win, maybe it'll be you.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.540
Like same thing with marriage.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.420
Like maybe somebody's gotta win.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.540
Like yeah, I've met hundreds, if not thousands of couples.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:29.540
And I know one, one that is legitimately happy

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.860
and like really seem to just feed that happiness

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.820
by that marriage that they have.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.860
And they both as individuals have become the best version

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.260
of themselves by being, you know what?

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.860
Like, that's, they won the lottery.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.340
So buy the ticket, I guess, you know?

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:51.820
But I mean, don't make that your retirement plan.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.660
Like, don't go like, well, you know, don't worry.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.780
I'm not saving money for my kid's college

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.620
because, you know, I'm buying lottery tickets.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.220
Like that's, you're an idiot if you're doing that.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.220
Excellent.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.980
Jim, thank you so much for sharing your story.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.820
It was a pleasure.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.220
Your thoughts on marriage and love and divorce.

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.460
Fascinating topic, isn't it?

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.620
Yeah, it is, and I suspect it will continue to be.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.300
I don't know that we're gonna culturally

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.380
get any better at it, but the economy's good, we're busy.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.180
Economy's bad, we're busy.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.620
Like we're a recession-proof industry.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.620
So, you know, it's, even COVID didn't slow us down, you know?

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.900
It probably sped you up.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.300
Well, people said for better or for worse,

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.140
they didn't say for lunch, you know?

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.380
And when you're locked in the house together,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.300
that was not great for most marriages.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.380
Like there was no, it was not,

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.940
hey, we should all spend more time together.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.660
You know, there was a lot of difficult conversations

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.780
that came out of that.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.780
Barbers and divorce lawyers, when the pandemic ended,

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.220
we were, the lines were out the door, you know?

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220
So whatever the next thing is, you know,

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.940
we'll still be here.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.460
All right, thank you so much.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.300
You got it, man.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.460
Thank you.
