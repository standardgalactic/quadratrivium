1000	3520	I had a period of time after my divorce
3520	6880	where I was really ambitious when it came to women.
6880	9040	But then it felt like a job.
9040	10600	Like it felt like a job after a while
10600	12320	where I was like, God, it's like enough.
12320	13800	It's kind of enough.
13800	15040	You know, like it's like,
15040	16280	it's like when you've eaten so much
16280	18620	that you just go, I got that way with posse.
18620	20800	Like it really was like I just had enough.
20800	21960	Like I was fine.
21960	24080	I was like, this is great, but.
24080	25360	Well, when you're in your 20s or 30s,
25360	28480	maybe your libido is a strong meal.
28480	29880	It makes you insane.
29880	31720	Yeah, yeah, I was not.
31720	32560	I definitely was.
32560	34000	As we age, we mellow.
34000	35800	Yeah, which I think is great.
35800	36640	Although I have to tell you,
36640	39040	one of the most depressing divorces I ever did
39040	42000	was a guy who was, I think, 92.
42000	42960	Oh, geez.
42960	45880	And what made it depressing is that he had left his wife
45880	49320	of, I don't know, 50 something, 60 something years
49320	52320	for a younger woman, a woman in her 50s.
52320	54400	And I just remember what was sad about it to me
54400	57640	was this guy still being led around by his dick.
57640	59480	Like I thought, oh my God.
60360	62320	I'm gonna be chained to an idiot forever.
62320	64280	Like I'm gonna forever be led around by my dick.
64280	65480	And I remember thinking like, no,
65480	68840	I really thought that at like 90 something,
68840	71480	I would just like a beautiful woman would walk by
71480	72880	and I'd go, oh, there's a human being.
72880	74000	Like there would be no.
74000	74840	You'd appreciate it without.
74840	77360	Yeah, there would just be no sense of like, yeah.
77360	80440	You know, there would just, that would be gone from me.
80440	83320	And this guy's proof that 90 something years old
83320	85200	and you're still thinking with your dick, like I.
85200	86040	Redumed.
86040	86880	That terrified me.
86880	87720	It really did.
87720	88560	It actually upset me.
88600	91160	Because I thought, man, I thought at some point
91160	94160	I'd get to experience what it's like to just be free.
94160	96680	If you live in New York where there's a financial industry,
96680	98760	there's all kinds of industries here.
98760	99600	Oh yeah.
99600	103760	But to me, sometimes I wonder if female attractiveness
103760	106760	isn't the highest valued commodity in our country.
106760	107800	100% it is.
107800	108640	100%.
108640	109480	It is.
109480	110320	Yeah, yeah, of course.
110320	112240	Because men are becoming rich and powerful
112240	113280	in order to get a woman.
113280	114120	Of course.
114120	114940	The woman they want.
114940	115780	Of course.
115780	118240	What an attractive woman.
118240	120480	And when I say attractive, I don't just mean attractive.
120480	123240	I mean, even just sexually confident.
123240	127100	I mean, what an unbelievably lucrative career that is.
127100	129360	Like I do divorces for people that,
129360	132200	you know, a woman walks out with $200, $300 million.
132200	134400	He was an analyst at Goldman Sachs
134400	136560	who built a hedge fund and then sold it
136560	138480	and then used his trading algorithm
138480	141360	to build it up to $500 million.
141360	146000	She was hot and slept with him for a while
146040	149480	and then stopped and started sleeping with other people
149480	152160	and playing tennis and having Botox.
152160	154080	And she's going to get half.
154080	155920	Like that's fucking incredible.
155920	158120	Like, do you know what he had to do to get that?
158120	161520	And what she had to, I'll fuck that guy for $200 million.
161520	162600	Are you kidding me?
162600	163640	Like that's insane.
163640	164560	That's incredible.
164560	166080	Like, and God bless.
166080	167920	I mean, I'm not saying that this person,
167920	169920	this is the rules of the game, you know?
169920	172720	But you can't argue that that's not easier
172720	173760	than going to Harvard.
173760	174600	No, for sure.
174600	176480	But then the payoff, the trade off for that
176480	179000	is that when they hit a certain age,
179000	180440	the value decreases.
180440	183520	Right, any stock, if you hold it too long,
183520	185080	it's going to go down, you know?
185080	187800	Like, so play the stock the right way.
187800	190400	I mean, and that's what I think.
190400	191800	If we were a little more honest
191800	194000	about the nature of male-female coupling,
194000	195400	I mean, right now we can't even, you know,
195400	198480	we can't even establish what is gender.
198480	200440	You know, we can't establish any of that anymore.
200440	203840	So divorce has become incredibly hilarious and fraught.
203840	208520	But to me, what is, like, sometimes you have to stand back
208520	210760	and look at things to get the real perspective
210760	211600	on what it is.
211600	214600	And sometimes you look back at marriage.
214600	215720	So when was it invented?
215720	218240	Like 2000 BC, roughly.
218240	222280	And the life expectancy of humans back then was 18 years old.
222280	223120	Yeah, yeah.
223120	225760	Marriage was created for...
225760	226600	Landownership.
226600	228400	Landownership and things like that.
228400	230480	And if you're going to die in your early 20s or whatever,
230480	233880	then getting married at 16, 18 makes sense.
233880	235680	Well, I think there's a distinction
235680	240680	that has to be made between pair bonds and marriage, right?
241520	244800	Marriage is a government concept.
244800	246160	Marriage is a contract.
246160	249040	Marriage is a legal status.
249040	250640	Pair bonds, right?
250640	254280	Two people go in it together, you know,
254280	256680	saying, hey, there's 7.3 billion people in the world
256680	259760	and the two of us, we're going to lock up together
259760	261000	and we're going to try to hold hands
261000	262000	and get through this thing.
262000	263320	Till we're eight years old.
263320	265000	Well, until whatever, you know?
265000	266400	I mean, what's interesting is,
266400	268120	first of all, all marriages end.
268120	270160	They end and death are divorced, but they all end.
270160	271280	Like every marriage ends.
271280	273360	So it's one of the only things that you go,
273360	275800	wow, I really hope this ends in us dying.
275800	278560	You know, most things, that's not the desired outcome.
278560	281440	But in marriage, you hope marriage will end in death.
281440	282720	You hope that you will be together
282720	285160	until one or both of you die, you know?
285160	286360	But all marriages end.
286360	288480	But as a guy, as a provider,
288480	289920	if you knew it was going to end
289920	291360	and you were going to have to give away half your money,
291360	293120	you might think twice about doing it.
293120	294560	Well, I think that's what makes
294560	295840	being a divorce lawyer interesting,
295840	299680	is that it's a lot of what a court has to do
299680	304020	is disregard what happened in the marriage,
304020	307240	because A, the truth is at the bottom of a bottomless pit.
307240	308680	Like you're never going to get there.
308680	310720	Yeah, well, he's fucking his secretary.
310720	313000	Right, because you are not sleeping with me anymore.
313000	314880	I have a client whose wife acknowledges
314880	316960	she didn't sleep with him for six years.
317360	319440	What did you think was going on
319440	321280	if you didn't sleep with him for six years?
321280	322960	So you, okay, delegate.
322960	324680	You've delegated that responsibility.
324680	326400	If you don't want to have sex with him, that's okay.
326400	328400	No one should force you to have sex with this person.
328400	329720	Let him go have sex with someone else.
329720	330920	You don't want to do the laundry.
330920	332280	Hire someone to do the laundry.
332280	333680	If you don't want to mow your own lawn,
333680	335080	hire someone to mow the lawn.
335080	336760	Delegate that responsibility.
336760	339120	And this guy wasn't even sleeping around.
339120	341480	He was going to those hand job places, you know,
341480	342680	where you get a massage and you get a hand.
342680	346520	Like what the most pathetic thing in the world,
346520	348400	the most innocuous thing in the world.
348400	349520	He didn't have a girlfriend.
349520	350760	There was no love involved.
350760	353760	He was getting jacked off for $50.
353760	354840	Like that's sad.
354840	356400	Like I mean, first of all, hand jobs.
356400	358120	Like that's an outdated technology.
358120	359880	That's like a Betamax, you know,
359880	361640	like who even does that anymore?
361640	365640	But he was doing this and he just thought, okay, that's fine.
365640	370080	She had the indignation to say he is not a,
370080	371800	he shouldn't be a custodial parent.
371800	375440	He's a terrible person because he's doing this.
375440	377520	And it was like, wait, how is that that much different
377520	379080	than going to a strip club?
379080	380880	How is that much more different?
380880	382920	Cause we just, you know, he was like, well, should I deny it?
382920	384200	And I was like, is it true?
384200	386400	And he's like, well, yeah, I said, no, we should own it.
386400	388640	Let's go in and say, yeah, you know what?
388640	389640	Yeah, it's pathetic.
389640	390600	It's really pathetic.
390600	394360	My wife didn't sleep with me for six years and I'm human.
394360	396080	And I wanted to have sex still.
396080	397440	I didn't want to blow up my life.
397440	398680	I didn't want to screw up my kids
398680	400360	and have my kids have divorced parents.
400360	401200	So I thought, all right,
401200	403360	she's clearly not interested in me and more.
403360	404680	I'm not going to have a girlfriend
404680	406040	and get caught up in all the things
406040	407960	where people could get hurt and there's feelings
407960	409560	and fatal attraction and stuff.
409560	411280	I'm just going to go, it'll be transactional.
411280	413240	Like going to a strip club or anything else.
413240	415000	And I'm, yeah, is it a little pathetic
415000	417000	that I'm a guy who makes a million dollars a year
417000	420120	in finance and I'm paying someone $50 to jack me off?
420120	422280	Yeah, it's kind of pathetic, but you know what?
422280	423120	I figured it out.
423120	425720	But to suggest that that means I'm a bad parent,
425720	429280	that has nothing to do with my parenting at all, period.
429280	431280	You know, so, and thankfully the judge agreed
431280	432240	with me on that one.
432240	435800	But I really do think that the idea,
437000	439880	I don't think, I mean, if you break it down fundamentally,
439880	443320	56% of marriages end in divorce.
443320	447560	But think about that's the ones that end in divorce.
447560	450680	So how many people, what percentage stay together
450680	452320	for the kids?
452320	453880	Or cause they don't want to give away half their shit.
453880	455880	Another 10% that's conservative.
455880	456720	Conservative.
456720	458880	But let's say 20% then, okay?
458880	459720	That's at least right.
459720	463600	Now I have a technology that fails 76% of the time.
463600	465160	That's insane.
465160	466000	That's insane.
466000	468240	That's more likely than not.
468240	470800	76%, if I told you there's a 76% chance
470800	471760	when you walk out the door today
471760	473480	you're gonna get hit in the head with a bowling ball,
473480	476400	you would not go out or you'd wear a helmet for sure.
476400	478400	But people just continue to get married.
478400	479720	Not only do they continue to get married,
479720	483200	there's a presumption that you should get married.
483200	484200	And if you don't get married,
484200	485420	there's something wrong with you.
485420	487840	So if you've got a girlfriend and you've been with her
488200	491640	for five years and you say to someone,
491640	492600	we're getting married.
492600	494680	They go, oh, that's great.
494680	496280	They don't go, why?
496280	497200	You're happy.
497200	498400	Why would you get married?
498400	499560	Like everything's going fine.
499560	500880	Why would you put yourself through that?
500880	502720	Why would you run that risk?
502720	505080	If you say to someone, we've been together five years
505080	506760	and we've decided we're not gonna get married.
506760	507600	We're gonna move in together,
507600	508800	but we're not gonna get married.
508800	509760	Ooh, what's wrong?
509760	510920	You got intimacy issues?
510920	512160	What's your problem?
512160	515520	Me want to set 56% end in divorce.
515520	519760	It literally fits the legal definition of negligence.
519760	521240	It's a negligent behavior.
521240	523320	The way you define negligence in law school
523320	527560	is when what you lose by not doing something
528880	532440	is lower than the risk of harm.
532440	533920	It's what's called a BPL analysis.
533920	536480	So the burden of not doing a thing
536480	541480	is lower than the likelihood, the probability of harm.
541800	545920	So BPLs, the burden, probability and loss.
545920	548720	Marriage is an inherently negligent activity.
548720	550240	It's like owning a lion.
550240	553680	Like the likelihood of someone getting hurt
553680	556040	seriously by this is very, very high.
556040	557440	You know, whatever says it to you, because why?
557440	559760	Because, and I would say to me,
559760	561280	I've been doing this for over 20 years
561280	563920	and I still get misty-eyed at weddings.
563920	566080	Like I still really, there's something in me
566080	568160	that goes like, you know, maybe it'll work out
568160	569000	for these two.
569000	569840	You still believe in much.
570280	572000	I absolutely believe in love.
572000	574360	I think love is wonderful.
574360	577720	But love and marriage have very little to do with each other.
577720	580160	I don't think there's much of a correlation there.
580160	582960	I think that's where we got off track.
582960	584360	Like I believe in pair bonds.
584360	586480	I believe, I don't think I can learn everything
586480	589400	I need to know about myself from myself.
589400	593160	I think having someone around me who sees my blind spots
593160	595440	and that it doesn't have to be a romantic partner.
595440	597960	That could be a friend, that could be any number of things,
597960	600640	but there is something wonderful
600640	602160	about romantic connection.
602160	603000	We know that.
603000	605280	I mean, the other statistic is 56% of marriages
605280	608720	and in divorce, but 84% of people who get divorced
608720	611400	are remarried within five years of their divorce.
611400	612240	Really?
612240	613080	Let's think about that.
613080	616680	So now you've done it and failed
616680	618480	and felt the pain of the loss
618480	621720	and within five years, 84% are remarried.
621720	622960	So when you fall in love
624200	627080	and you're with a partner who is in love with you,
627360	629960	it's like hard to put the brakes on and say,
629960	632160	you know what, that's as far as I'm gonna go.
632160	633600	Well, I think we, you know,
633600	635920	whoever discovered water, it wasn't a fish.
635920	638600	And I think when we're in a thing, we don't see it.
638600	641040	And so, I mean, and this is true of any of us.
641040	642400	There must be some endorphins,
642400	644400	something's being released in our brains.
644400	646280	Listen, you wanna test that theory.
646280	648520	The next time you're out with a couple
648520	650320	who've been together for a while
650320	652240	and it seems like they maybe got in a fight
652240	654400	or they're just like kind of being impatient
654400	655600	with each other at the table.
655680	658240	You know, when you go like a group thing.
658240	661520	Just say to them, so tell me about how you met.
661520	663040	Tell me the story of how you met
663040	665120	and everything on them changes.
665120	667200	At like, they go back to that place.
667200	669720	And there's this like, oh yeah, and she was this,
669720	672800	because for that second, you go back to that place.
672800	676080	Like you can go, someone with a horrible divorce,
676080	678320	if you could get them to go to that place
678320	680240	and talk to you about that time.
680240	682680	Like I would say something, when I was a kid,
682680	684680	you know, like every kid, you have the fantasy of like,
684680	686640	if you were invisible, what would you do?
686640	689360	You didn't go to the girl's locker room, you know, whatever.
689360	692200	I have this fantasy that if I could be invisible,
692200	695040	I have about eight clients that I'd like to sneak into their
695040	696800	house and find their wedding album.
696800	699480	Like I know it's in the attic somewhere or something.
699480	702160	Cause I would love to see what it looked like
702160	703480	when these people loved each other.
703480	706520	Because they are weaponized against each other now
706520	708520	and we are trying to kill each other
708520	712600	and we're taking every secret, every intimacy, everything.
712720	714400	At their ugliest.
714400	717000	At their ugliest, at their worst.
717000	720600	And there's something in me that just the thought that like,
720600	723720	you guys at some point, like at some point,
723720	726560	you were like, there's 7.3 billion people in the world
726560	727880	and you're the one.
727880	731720	Like you're the one I just want to be with and smell
731720	736120	and touch and like that feeling, we all know that feeling
736120	739240	of like just the electricity of another person, you know?
739360	743360	And I mean, I think I'm a romantic at heart
743360	745200	in the sense that I really get it.
745200	747960	Like I really get why we do this.
747960	751400	I felt it, I know it, I understand it.
751400	755960	But tying that to the technology of marriage to me
755960	758280	makes almost no sense whatsoever.
758280	761000	And I actually think it's almost antagonistic
761000	763640	to that connection with another person.
763640	766040	Because there's so much expectation
766040	767640	that comes with marriage culturally.
767640	770640	We've created so much stuff around it.
770640	774600	Like when you marry someone, they're supposed to be,
774600	776760	at least in the modern Western model,
776760	780280	your best friend, best roommate, best co-parent,
780280	785280	best travel partner, best roommate, best everything,
785560	786680	best activity partner.
786680	789720	Like how would one person be all of those things?
789720	790920	That's insane.
790920	794680	Like if I was interviewing for a job
794680	797120	and said, I want you to be the best typist
797120	798760	and I also want you to be best on the phone
798760	800240	and I also want you to be great at that.
800240	803200	And I ran down a list of dissimilar things.
803200	805400	Like wherever I went to an amazing chef
805400	808080	and I said, I know you're a great chef, but can you farm?
808080	810160	Like that has to do with food,
810160	811560	but they're not the same thing.
811560	812520	Like what are you talking,
812520	817160	so I think why do we put on people this idea?
817160	819960	Like whoever came up with the word soulmate,
819960	821120	really we should be paying,
821120	823600	like divorce lawyer should be paying that person dividends.
823600	826960	Because we've convinced people that if this person
826960	828760	isn't meeting every one of your needs,
828760	831800	checking all of these boxes, they're not your soulmate.
831800	834560	Your soulmate would know exactly what to do,
834560	836760	exactly what to say at exactly the right time.
839400	842040	I can get, I go off on this stuff, tend to.
842040	843000	What do you think the secret is
843000	846400	is keeping a marriage vital, keeping it alive?
846400	851400	You know, I think people get unhappy in marriages
852000	853400	the way that people go bankrupt,
853400	856600	which is very slowly and then all at once.
856600	860360	I think it's very slow and then it just goes off a cliff.
860360	862160	So everybody will say, well,
862160	864520	we divorced because he was cheating or she was cheating
864520	866800	or we divorced because he had an alcohol issue
866800	869800	or a drug issue, which lately we're seeing more
869800	872760	like alcohol and drugs is a big, big thing,
872760	873920	especially post pandemic.
873920	875960	There's a tremendous amount of substance abuse stuff
875960	878440	that's causing a lot of issues in marriages.
878440	880520	And certainly like social media has increased
880520	883920	the accessibility of adultery and connections
883920	885600	to other people and reconnections
885600	887680	to people from your past who remind you
887680	890600	of a version of yourself that you felt more excited about
890600	891840	because you were younger.
891840	893040	So it's, you know, it used to be
893040	896480	if you like ran into the girl you banged in high school,
896480	899080	it was like once every 10 years at reunion, you know,
899080	901680	or if you lived in the same town as you grew up in,
901680	904080	you know, you might run into the person at the Walmart.
904080	906600	But now it's like on Facebook, you have all these excuses
906600	908080	to be able to chit chat with someone
908080	912080	and all these benign entry points, you know, of like,
912080	914240	oh, you know, I saw your pictures from vacation.
914240	916040	Where did you stay in Miami, you know?
916040	918160	And then it becomes, oh, yeah, well, you look great.
918160	920080	I mean, boy, you look fantastic in a bikini
920080	922120	and all of a sudden we're off to the races
922120	923240	and we're chatting with each other.
923240	925240	So I, you know, if we were gonna invent
925240	927080	like an infidelity machine,
927080	929000	you couldn't do better than Facebook and Instagram.
929000	931180	I mean, that's about as good as it gets.
931180	936180	But I genuinely think that the secret
936600	940560	to staying happy in a marriage is probably
940560	945560	the same secret to maintaining a healthy weight.
945640	947680	You know, don't wait till you get super fat
947680	949480	and then try to lose the weight.
949480	951480	Don't wait until you get really sick.
951480	954360	Like my sister is a dentist and she always says,
954360	957240	if you have a toothache, there's nothing I can do really.
957240	959160	Like I can pull the tooth, I can give you a root canal,
959160	961720	but like I can prevent you from getting a toothache.
961720	963360	If you just come see me regularly
963360	965160	and you just floss and you just brush your teeth,
965160	966280	you'll never get a toothache.
966280	968160	By the time your tooth hurts,
968160	970160	something is already seriously wrong.
970160	972480	By the time you're in a divorce lawyer's office,
972480	974920	you're fucked, the whole thing's fucked at that point.
974920	978400	Like you'd be better off just, you know,
978400	980840	figuring out the preventative maintenance, right?
980840	982720	Like change the oil in your car.
982720	987480	Like, so I, what I try to, if you reverse engineer divorce,
987480	990880	like most people, the marriage killer, you know,
990880	993800	the, like the cheating or the gambling or the whatever,
993800	995840	that's the symptom.
995840	999840	Like the problem is these little disconnections, you know?
999880	1004320	One of the, one of the best stories I have is my,
1004320	1006880	I had a client, I did her divorce,
1006880	1008920	and we'd spend a lot of time together because you do.
1008920	1009760	You know, when you're a divorce lawyer,
1009760	1011000	you spend a lot of time with people
1011000	1012240	and you get to know them very well.
1012240	1013680	I mean, people will lie to their therapist,
1013680	1015000	they won't lie to their divorce lawyer
1015000	1016920	because A, there's no reason to and B,
1016920	1018600	you know, I need to know everything
1018600	1020840	and it's all attorney-client privilege.
1020840	1024360	And this woman, we were sitting outside the courtroom
1024360	1026920	waiting on a break in testimony.
1026920	1028080	And she was a young woman in her,
1028120	1030720	in her probably like late 30s, you know?
1030720	1031760	Very attractive.
1031760	1034400	And we were just chit-chatting and I said to her,
1034400	1039120	you know, was there a moment when you realized
1039120	1040800	the marriage is over?
1040800	1042800	You know, like, was there a moment?
1042800	1044280	And she said, yeah, yeah.
1044280	1046280	And I said, when was it?
1046280	1049760	And she said, there was this granola that I like.
1049760	1051640	She said it, they only sold it
1051640	1054000	at like this particular grocery store.
1054000	1055920	And I like to put it in my yogurt.
1055920	1058440	And she said, he used to always,
1058440	1060720	whenever I'd be running low on it,
1060720	1062200	I would just open the thing one day
1062200	1064120	and a new bag would be there.
1064120	1065840	She's like, and I just, she's like,
1065840	1067560	it made me feel so loved.
1067560	1071000	Like he didn't, I didn't have to ask.
1071000	1072800	He didn't want credit for it.
1072800	1074480	Like he didn't go like, oh, did you see it?
1074480	1076160	I got your granola that you wanted, you know?
1076160	1078440	Like he just would do this thing, you know?
1078440	1080000	And she said, it was just something that like,
1080000	1081920	I just, it always made me smile.
1081920	1083720	She said, every time the granola was running low
1083720	1085040	and there was a new bag of granola,
1085040	1087800	I just felt very loved, you know?
1087800	1090640	And she said, one day the granola ran out.
1091520	1093000	And I thought, oh, that's weird.
1093000	1094480	You know, maybe he didn't see it.
1094480	1096560	She's like, so I left the bag in there
1096560	1099360	because I thought, well, at some point he'll notice.
1099360	1101300	And he didn't notice.
1101300	1105560	She goes, so I took the bag out and I waited.
1105560	1107720	And he didn't get a new bag.
1107720	1110280	And I thought, okay, this thing's going down.
1111720	1113760	And I thought to myself, wow, that's like,
1113760	1116660	you know, that's such a small thing, like granola.
1116660	1119320	Like you just, but these are the things.
1119320	1122480	Like these are the little things that make us feel loved
1122480	1124160	and that are gestures of love.
1124160	1127980	And when I said to her, was there anything like that
1127980	1130000	for you with him?
1130000	1131520	And she said, yeah, blowjobs.
1133080	1135400	And I almost spit out my coffee.
1135400	1138040	And she goes, no, she goes, when we were first dating
1138040	1139320	and even first married, she's like,
1139320	1140720	I used to give blowjobs a lot.
1140720	1143160	She's like, you know, she's like, do it in the morning,
1143160	1144160	just took two minutes.
1144160	1146320	And he was like super happy the rest of the day, you know?
1146320	1147280	She's like the rest of the day.
1147280	1149400	He would like call me or text me and be like,
1149400	1150720	oh, I'm so good this morning.
1150720	1152560	You know, I had such pep in my step now.
1152560	1153920	And she's like, it was just like,
1153920	1156080	what did it really take out of my life to do that?
1156080	1157480	You know, and it made him feel good.
1157480	1160160	She's like, and then I got to a point where I was like,
1160160	1161480	well, you know what, no, I'll wait.
1161480	1163280	And then tonight we can both, we can have sex.
1163280	1164320	And we'll both enjoy that.
1164320	1165880	Like what is why I owe him a blowjob?
1165880	1168480	Like, no, you know, like I don't owe him that, you know?
1168480	1171200	And then she said, I got to a point where it was like,
1171200	1173160	I look back and I'm like, yeah, I guess I,
1173160	1176240	I didn't do that as often, hardly ever really, you know?
1176240	1177200	Which came first.
1178080	1180240	You know, I said that to her and she said,
1180240	1181640	she said, I couldn't tell you.
1181640	1183840	She said, but I think it's the same thing.
1183840	1184680	The same thing.
1184680	1185880	And I do think it's the same thing.
1185880	1187760	And I'm not saying blowjobs and granola
1187760	1189560	is all you need to know, but,
1189560	1191960	and I'm not, by the way, I'm not saying that,
1191960	1193800	that a blowjob is a small thing.
1193800	1195880	I don't think I have any right to, I've never given one.
1195880	1197840	But it seems like a phenomenal feat.
1197840	1200200	And I'm grateful for everyone I've ever received.
1200200	1205200	But I don't, I don't think it's a massive investment,
1205760	1206600	right?
1206600	1209080	Just like buying someone's granola is not a massive.
1209080	1209920	But when you love somebody,
1209920	1211360	you love doing things for them.
1211360	1213640	Right, their pleasure pleases you.
1213640	1215560	Their joy pleases you.
1215560	1220560	Like their, their, you know, their happiness makes you happy.
1221360	1222200	Exactly.
1222200	1224480	And somewhere along the line,
1224480	1227160	and it happens a lot in marriage,
1227160	1230560	it becomes, well, I'm not happy, why should you be happy?
1230560	1231400	You know?
1231400	1234000	And then that creates a spiral.
1234000	1236160	And I really believe that you can,
1236160	1239080	that spiral could go in the other direction.
1239080	1240640	Like if he did the granola,
1240640	1243880	I think the blowjobs would have come, you know?
1243880	1244720	And if the, like I,
1244720	1246080	and if the blowjobs were there,
1246080	1247440	I bet he'd have bought the granola.
1247440	1249000	Like I can't prove that.
1249000	1250400	There's no control group, you know?
1250400	1251680	I can't run that research.
1251680	1255280	But it feels to me like those little things,
1255840	1257520	like leaving a note, you know?
1257520	1260560	I've said to some of my friends, you know,
1260560	1261720	when they say to me like, you know,
1261720	1263840	as a divorce lawyer, you see all this misery,
1263840	1265480	like, what's, how do I stay out of your office?
1265480	1269800	And I'll often say, I'm like, it's dumb little things, man.
1269800	1271520	I'm like, just leave her a note.
1271520	1272920	I'm like, leave her a note in the morning.
1272920	1275160	Just leave a little note, says, hey, beautiful.
1275160	1277800	You know, so, it was so fun watching that movie
1277800	1279080	with you last night.
1279080	1280520	So glad we got to have a date.
1280520	1281520	I'll be thinking of you today.
1281520	1282360	Love you.
1282360	1283960	Like, what does that take?
1283960	1284960	That takes like a minute.
1284960	1287840	Not even, like, and look what it can do.
1287840	1290120	Like, look at how that makes this person feel.
1290120	1292200	And even if right away, it doesn't work.
1292200	1293800	On that moment, it doesn't work.
1293800	1295960	Okay, do it enough times.
1295960	1298800	Like, and then you're either gonna figure out
1298800	1302200	that this person's gone, and then just fucking bail.
1302200	1303040	You're done.
1303040	1304920	Like, because if you try for long enough,
1304920	1308920	and you give like that, but if you're not giving like that,
1308920	1311040	and then you're not getting back either,
1311040	1312640	well, I'm not surprised, you know?
1312640	1314120	That's how you end up in my office,
1314120	1316320	is this death spiral of everyone,
1316320	1317960	like, well, I'm not giving Guy and the Grinola
1317960	1319000	issues, not giving me blowjobs.
1319000	1320640	Well, I'm not giving him blowjobs, he's mean to me.
1320640	1322280	Okay, well, everybody's just gonna,
1322280	1325160	has an equal right to be fucking miserable then.
1325160	1327360	I think if you're happy with yourself,
1327360	1329680	be truly happy with who you are at that point in your life,
1329680	1332000	or whatever the situation is,
1332000	1335940	I think it's easier for you to be happy with your partner.
1335940	1339280	Yeah, but I would argue that if you're not happy
1339280	1343760	with yourself, having someone happy with you
1343760	1347400	is certainly not gonna hurt your feeling of who you are,
1347400	1348240	right?
1348240	1352200	Like, I don't need someone to tell me I'm handsome
1352200	1353440	for me to have a nice day,
1353440	1355960	but I can't think of anybody telling me I was handsome
1355960	1357960	that it ruined my day, you know?
1357960	1359960	Most of the time, you're like, oh, that's nice,
1359960	1362000	you know, I got that going for me.
1362000	1363840	So yeah, I think self-love, of course,
1363840	1365120	is the most important love,
1365120	1367040	and to be secure in who you are,
1367040	1370560	and to not allow your self-definition
1370560	1372560	to be easily swayed or pulled.
1372560	1373720	Like, if you believe the good reviews,
1373720	1376560	you gotta believe the bad ones too, I get that,
1376560	1378960	but I just don't think kindness,
1378960	1381240	like, it's just such an easy,
1381240	1383780	especially if it's easy, like if it's easy stuff,
1383780	1385480	like just telling someone that they're beautiful
1385480	1388000	or handsome or that you're cheering for them.
1388000	1390320	To me with marriage, or pair bonds,
1390320	1391800	I shouldn't even say marriage,
1391800	1394800	like the world is trying to kill you all the time,
1394800	1397920	you know, like people are criticizing you all the time,
1397920	1399800	you feel like a failure a lot of the time,
1399800	1401640	if you compare yourself to other people,
1401640	1403000	you'll constantly be, you know,
1403000	1404920	comparisons the thief of joy.
1404920	1408000	So why not have like one person
1408000	1409720	who's just cheering for you, you know,
1409720	1412920	like constructive criticism is criticism.
1412920	1414200	It's still just criticism.
1414200	1417480	So if your spouse is just sitting around criticizing you
1417480	1418640	and telling you all the things you could do
1418640	1421480	to improve yourself, instead of just being a fan
1421480	1422680	and just saying, you know what,
1422680	1425160	I know who you are and you're beautiful,
1425160	1427600	I know who you are and your heart is good,
1427600	1429960	and betting on the best parts of a person,
1429960	1431840	I think that there's no,
1431840	1434680	there's very little downside to that, you know.
1434680	1436840	I think it would put guys like me out of business
1436840	1439040	if people really leveraged that the right way.
1439040	1440600	I asked you earlier, if you believe in love,
1440600	1443200	which you said you do, do you believe in marriage?
1444560	1447040	I mean, I believe people believe in marriage.
1447040	1447880	No, but to you.
1447880	1449320	Yeah, do I believe in marriage?
1449320	1451760	I don't, I don't think it's a useful technology.
1451760	1455520	I understand culturally why people do it,
1455520	1457880	but I don't think people should need it.
1457880	1460480	I know I certainly don't need marriage.
1460480	1464160	I don't think marriage, I was married.
1464160	1467320	I was married before I really ever thought
1467320	1469160	about what does that mean, you know.
1469160	1471240	I married my college sweetheart, you know.
1471240	1473720	I hadn't, I got married because that's what you do,
1473720	1475160	you get married, you know.
1476480	1478640	But I hadn't thought about it as a technology
1478640	1479560	and why it's there.
1479560	1482560	I didn't, I didn't understand it the way I do now.
1482560	1487120	You know, there's a line from a Joseph Brodsky poem
1487120	1489200	that he wrote when his wife died where he says,
1489200	1491880	I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.
1492760	1494800	And I feel that way as a divorce lawyer.
1494800	1497040	Like I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.
1497040	1499440	I wish I, I wish I didn't know what the end
1499440	1501880	of so many marriages looks like
1501880	1504640	because I think I would have a more optimistic
1504640	1506400	and unrealistic view of it.
1506400	1507240	I would-
1507240	1508960	Yeah, but you'd be divorced and giving away half your-
1508960	1509800	I'd be foolish.
1509800	1510640	Yeah, I'd be foolish.
1510640	1512800	I'd be as foolish, but I don't know that,
1512800	1515840	I don't know that it's always good to know, right?
1515840	1518320	Sometimes there's tremendous joy to be had
1518320	1521200	and like falling feels like flying for a little while,
1521200	1524880	you know, till you hit the ground, it feels really good.
1524880	1526000	As I said earlier, you know,
1526000	1528840	now that the life expectancy of man is around the 80s
1528840	1531320	or something, then it's like,
1531320	1534480	so you're gonna do this from your 20s or 30s until the 80s?
1534480	1536840	Well, marriage is a technology that was designed
1536840	1540240	for when women died in childbirth
1540240	1544120	and when men died in their 40s if they were lucky,
1544120	1546400	you know, 50s if they were super lucky.
1546400	1549120	Like if you were in your 50s, your 60s, you were an elder,
1549120	1550560	you know, that was pretty amazing.
1550560	1552600	Women, most women died in childbirth.
1552600	1554040	Like childbirth is traumatic.
1554040	1556240	It's a traumatic thing and before modern medicine
1556240	1557880	and before we understood antibiotics.
1557880	1562520	So marriages is, I don't think anyone ever planned
1562520	1566440	that it was gonna be, okay, we're gonna do this forever.
1566440	1569720	You know, we're gonna do this till we're 100.
1569720	1572000	I mean, but I think that's part of a bigger problem.
1572000	1573640	You know, I don't remember who said it,
1573680	1576040	but I remember someone saying,
1576040	1577760	I can't remember who it was,
1577760	1582760	but we are prehistoric creatures, right?
1583680	1587260	Like we are biological creatures
1588960	1593760	living in medieval institutions
1593760	1598760	like education, work, with God-like technology.
1599640	1601680	How do you think that ends?
1601680	1604280	Like you think that ends and happily ever after?
1604280	1606040	Like that's insane.
1606040	1607600	Marriage was not designed, I mean,
1607600	1609800	think about even the early days of marriage.
1609800	1612080	Think about every Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,
1612080	1614200	you know, think about Oklahoma, you know,
1614200	1616240	where you'd have like, there's like the three people
1616240	1618400	in town that aren't married, you know,
1618400	1620800	and you sort of pick which of the three,
1620800	1622880	you know, you were gonna go be with.
1622880	1627880	And now you have access to just an endless supply
1628280	1630360	of the opposite sex, or I shouldn't even say
1630360	1632240	the opposite sex, you have an endless supply
1632240	1635520	of romantic partners in a device in your hand.
1635520	1638960	How does that possibly stand up?
1638960	1642480	How does marriage, the idea of monogamy,
1642480	1645120	forced monogamy or enforced monogamy,
1645120	1647880	how does that ever survive in that environment?
1647880	1650600	I don't think it can, I don't think it's realistic.
1650600	1654200	And the statistics prove me right.
1654200	1656640	You know, the statistics are absolutely in my favor.
1656640	1659200	Now again, get married as many times as you want
1659200	1660080	if you have a prenup.
1661040	1663400	Go get married, get married's a blast.
1663400	1665000	Being married is difficult.
1665000	1667040	You know, someone once said that it's great
1667040	1668200	to be married sometimes.
1668200	1669800	The problem is you're married all the time.
1669800	1671100	So you're a fan of prenups?
1671100	1672280	I'm a huge fan of prenups.
1672280	1675160	I mean, I shouldn't be because a prenup
1675160	1678160	for a couple of thousand dollars will save you hundreds
1678160	1680280	of thousands of dollars potentially in legal fees,
1680280	1681440	if not millions.
1681440	1684320	So there are clients I have that have spent
1684320	1686520	over a million dollars just in their legal fees,
1686520	1690000	that if they had spent $2,000 on a prenup,
1690680	1692760	none of that, they'd still have that money in their pocket.
1692760	1694640	And that's incredible to me.
1694640	1696240	Like I have two sons who are adults
1696240	1698320	that they are absolutely gonna have prenups.
1698320	1699520	Like they have to have prenups.
1699520	1701200	They'd be fools to not have prenups.
1701200	1703120	It's like jumping out of a plane with no parachute.
1703120	1704640	Why would you do that?
1704640	1706220	You know, it's just, it's stupid.
1706220	1708600	Prenups are enforceable, they make sense.
1708600	1710240	I actually think there's something very romantic
1710240	1713000	about prenups because they're forcing you
1713000	1716880	to have a conversation about this relationship.
1717560	1722120	I genuinely believe that we are the most aware of our health
1722120	1724440	just after we got sick, right?
1724440	1726560	Like when we, if you wake up and you have a toothache,
1726560	1729080	all you can think about is the fact your tooth hurts.
1729080	1732720	And then your toothache goes away and for like a week.
1732720	1733600	You're taking care of your teeth.
1733600	1737320	You go, oh my God, at least I don't have a toothache.
1737320	1739960	You know, but then a month goes by and you don't wake up
1739960	1741800	and go, well, at least I don't have a toothache.
1741800	1743960	And it's the furthest thing from your mind.
1743960	1746280	But theoretically you could wake up today and go,
1746320	1747440	I don't have a toothache.
1747440	1748760	I don't have a backache.
1748760	1750240	I don't have a head cold.
1750240	1751840	Like this is a great day.
1751840	1754200	What does a typical prenup look like?
1754200	1756200	Typical, the easiest prenup in the world.
1756200	1757960	Easiest, yours, mine, ours.
1757960	1759280	That's it, yours, mine, ours.
1759280	1760680	Then your name, it's yours.
1760680	1762360	If it's in my name, it's mine.
1762360	1764200	Like in a divorce, everything,
1764200	1766440	all the assets are split 50-50.
1766440	1768760	Well, no, what you say in a prenup-truel agreement is,
1768760	1771200	if it's an asset or a liability,
1771200	1772720	if it's in my name, it's mine.
1772720	1773960	If it's in your name, it's yours.
1773960	1776080	If it's in our joint names,
1776080	1778040	we'll divide it 50-50.
1778040	1780080	That's it, yours, mine, ours.
1780080	1781960	And then you have to have ongoing conversations
1781960	1785720	throughout the marriage about, you know,
1785720	1787000	hey, I got this bonus at work.
1787000	1788160	Do I put it in my account?
1788160	1789240	Do I put it in the joint account?
1789240	1790720	If the husband owns a house that's worth
1790720	1793280	whatever, $2 million, and he marries a woman.
1794560	1796680	The house is his still.
1796680	1799120	Well, they have to have a conversation.
1799120	1800760	Do I owe you a house?
1800760	1802000	That's an awkward conversation.
1802000	1803480	Okay.
1803480	1805480	You know what's a more awkward conversation?
1805480	1807680	I had a conversation 10 years later with a lawyer
1807680	1809600	about the fact that you have to give half of this house
1809600	1810560	away to someone.
1810560	1812400	Isn't it better to have that conversation
1812400	1814760	when you still, like, why would you learn
1814760	1816320	how to fight in a fight?
1816320	1820920	But won't that undermine the love that each person feels?
1820920	1821760	Why?
1821760	1822600	Why?
1822600	1823440	You're gonna die.
1823440	1825120	Does that undermine your life?
1825120	1827440	Or does it make you conscious of the fact
1827440	1830240	that this is finite and that you should be out there?
1830240	1832920	Like, I think having a conversation with your partner
1832920	1834240	about, look, I love you.
1834240	1835800	You love me.
1835800	1837880	We want to do this thing together.
1837880	1839480	But the numbers are against us
1839480	1841080	and the world is antagonistic to it.
1841080	1842320	And I hope we'll be together forever.
1842320	1845680	But if we split up, what do we owe each other?
1845680	1847520	What do you expect from me?
1847520	1848760	Because I have to tell you something.
1848760	1849960	I'm a fair person.
1849960	1850920	I'm a fair person.
1850920	1852920	If you say to me, you know, Jim,
1852920	1855440	I'm not gonna work as hard
1855440	1856580	because you make a good living.
1856580	1859400	So if we split up, I'm gonna need help
1859400	1861720	for a couple of years because I'm not gonna pay
1861720	1863200	attention to my career.
1863200	1864840	Okay, does that unreasonable?
1864840	1866320	That's totally reasonable.
1866320	1868400	You know, if I say, hey, listen,
1868400	1870600	I have this house and I bought it, you know,
1870600	1872400	but I'm buying it with money that I made
1872400	1874120	really before we were together.
1874120	1875760	So if we split up, I don't really think
1875760	1877640	you deserve half of it.
1877640	1880480	I think that if we bought things for it together,
1880480	1882360	that, okay, those things you can half of,
1882360	1884360	but the house itself, like that's money I had
1884360	1887840	before I met you and why can't you have that conversation?
1887840	1889120	What, why not?
1889120	1892320	Instead, I mean, you buy a house,
1892320	1895360	you do a HUD one, a lead paint disclosure,
1895360	1896880	you gotta sign all these things that,
1896880	1898360	this is how much the interest is gonna be
1898360	1901040	and you get married and you can get a fucking pamphlet.
1901040	1902640	You don't get anything.
1902640	1904840	You just did the most legally significant thing
1904840	1907240	you're ever gonna do other than die
1907240	1909640	and no one has explained any of it to you.
1909640	1911560	People come into my office and they go,
1911560	1913480	well, my retirement account, that's in my name.
1913480	1914720	And I'm like, yeah, it doesn't matter.
1914720	1915560	It's in your name?
1915560	1916800	Okay, was it acquired during the marriage?
1916800	1918280	Okay, she's got half of it.
1918280	1921160	Well, I have this bank account, but it's in my sole name.
1921160	1923600	It's money that I inherited from my mom.
1923600	1925120	I'm like, okay, it's in your name, yeah,
1925120	1927000	but you inherited that money during the marriage.
1927000	1929140	And did you put money that you earned
1929140	1930800	during the marriage in that account also?
1930800	1932760	Yeah, okay, that's commingled and transmuted.
1932760	1934880	That's now marital property.
1934880	1935960	So they don't know that.
1935960	1936800	Why?
1936800	1939440	Because no one tells them that when they're getting married.
1939440	1942400	All they did, you spend more time talking about the cake
1942400	1944400	than you do talking about the fact
1944400	1947400	that you just opted out of the title system.
1947400	1949000	That's gigantic.
1949000	1951920	You can't legally change the beneficiary
1951920	1955320	of your life insurance, even to your children,
1955320	1957520	if you're married, without your spouse
1957520	1959280	signing a consent to that.
1959280	1960280	No one tells you that when you get married.
1960280	1963800	You get married, Elvis can marry you for $20
1963800	1965880	at a drive-thru cathedral.
1965880	1969360	And it's a legal status, a massive legal,
1969360	1970920	you buy your spouse a Rolex,
1970920	1973000	you bought yourself one half of a Rolex.
1973000	1975280	You buy someone a birthday present who you're married to,
1976120	1978600	you bought yourself one half of that birthday present.
1978600	1980320	Nobody know, people don't know that.
1980320	1983360	They learn that for the first time in my office
1983360	1984440	or in a courtroom.
1984440	1985720	That's insane.
1985720	1988040	What other thing in the world?
1988040	1991000	Like anything else, any other contract,
1991000	1992120	you would say, well, wait a minute,
1992120	1993720	no one explained that to me.
1993720	1994760	No one explained that to me.
1994760	1996240	When I leased this car,
1996240	1998480	no one explained to me that there's wear and tear.
1998480	2001160	Doesn't say it anywhere in the contract, right?
2001160	2003920	Okay, marriage contract doesn't say that.
2003920	2005800	It doesn't say, oh, and by the way,
2005800	2007160	you're opting out of the title system
2007160	2009200	and your retirement assets and all these other things.
2009200	2010040	And if there's any debts
2010040	2011760	and you could have enhanced earning capacity
2011760	2013440	or celebrity goodwill that has to be valued
2013440	2016360	by forensic accountants that'll cost you $100,000,
2016360	2018360	you don't, no contract that says that.
2018360	2020400	It just says, yep, we're getting married.
2020400	2022360	It's two witnesses, we're good.
2022360	2023680	What other contract?
2023680	2026880	What other contract in the United States or anywhere
2026880	2029920	has that lack of disclosure and is that binding?
2029920	2031340	None, zero, none.
2032340	2036820	So a prenup, yes, that's an awkward conversation, I guess.
2036820	2038220	I don't know that it has to be.
2038220	2039140	And I have to tell you,
2039140	2040780	the more awkward of a conversation it is,
2040780	2043180	the more you should think twice about getting married.
2043180	2048180	Because if you can't have a conversation with this person
2048220	2052000	about the possibility that someday one or both of you
2052000	2054100	might hurt each other,
2054100	2059100	like how many people, while they're still happy and in love,
2059980	2064300	say something like, you know, babe, I love you.
2065540	2068340	But we're gonna disagree about something at some point.
2068340	2072740	And when we do, how do you like to fight?
2072740	2074580	Like, do you need a minute?
2074580	2076800	Like, do you need like to be alone for a minute
2076800	2079220	so you can kind of calm down?
2079220	2081700	Or are you the like, hey, we gotta figure this out
2081700	2083180	and we can't go to bed angry?
2083180	2085260	Like, cause let's talk about that now
2085260	2087020	while we're not in the fight.
2087020	2090580	Like, let's talk about it now while we still get along
2090580	2092620	and we're happy and we're trying to figure out
2092620	2094100	how to navigate each other.
2094100	2095380	It's hard enough to navigate yourself.
2095380	2097220	I wanna navigate another human being.
2097220	2098660	Why don't we have that conversation now?
2098660	2099500	But no, we don't.
2099500	2100900	We learn on the job.
2100900	2104340	We learn how to fight in a fight, which is insane.
2104340	2106460	You know, but again, why?
2106460	2108500	Well, cause it's awkward.
2108500	2110500	It'd be awkward to have that conversation.
2110500	2112780	More awkward than getting in a fight
2112780	2114180	where you don't know the rules of engagement,
2114180	2117540	or you don't know how your partner does better
2117540	2118780	or would feel better.
2118780	2120300	Like, and you're not gonna ask them that
2120300	2121700	in the heat of battle, you know?
2121700	2125180	So why wouldn't you have that awkward conversation
2125180	2127980	while you have this abundance of affection for each other?
2127980	2130300	I mean, when I negotiate prenups,
2130300	2132300	it's the easiest thing in the world in a sense
2132300	2135500	because these two people really like each other.
2135500	2137460	You know, they're about to get married.
2137460	2139980	So they're clearly not trying to kill each other.
2139980	2141940	At that point, they clearly like each other.
2141940	2143300	So you just say, hey, listen, go home,
2143300	2145740	talk to your fiance about X, Y, and Z,
2145740	2148100	and see what they, you know, see what they think.
2148100	2150140	And see, tell them what your concern is.
2150140	2153220	And very often, people will come back and say to me,
2153220	2155100	I mean, I have to tell you, I've been doing this now,
2155100	2157060	you know, over 20 years.
2157060	2158220	I do a lot of prenups.
2158220	2161260	I do maybe five, six prenups a month,
2161260	2163020	sometimes during like pre-wedding season,
2163020	2165500	which is the fall and before the summer,
2165500	2168260	I'll do 10, 15 a month.
2168260	2170740	The people who say to me,
2171740	2174300	oh, well, I don't want to have that conversation.
2174300	2177620	You know, I think, they get the prenup
2177620	2179980	and within three, four years, they're divorced.
2179980	2181660	Sometimes five years and then seven years,
2181660	2182980	but they're the ones who get divorced.
2182980	2184980	They have no business getting married.
2184980	2187580	Like the ones who have the discussion
2187580	2189780	and figure out the, well, I'm worried
2189780	2191580	because if you keep the place, yeah, you're right.
2191580	2193380	Okay, so what if I give you this amount of money
2193380	2194460	and it's this much for each of you?
2194460	2195300	Okay, yeah, that's cool.
2195300	2196460	Let's do it that way.
2196460	2198180	Those people, they're probably never gonna put the prenup
2198180	2199020	in a safe someplace.
2199020	2200180	You'll never look at it probably.
2200180	2201740	Good communication solves it all.
2201740	2203700	Because they're able to talk to each other
2203700	2205620	and they're able to talk about hard things.
2205620	2208340	How are you gonna be married to someone?
2208340	2210540	Have children with someone
2210540	2213500	and you can't talk about hard things, you know?
2213500	2214620	Like how?
2214620	2215900	How are you gonna navigate life
2215900	2217820	and not be able to talk about hard things?
2217820	2218720	Like that's silly.
2218720	2220660	So if you can't talk about hard things,
2220660	2221860	don't get fucking married.
2221860	2222700	It's okay.
2222700	2223540	You don't have to.
2223540	2224660	You can stay together.
2224660	2226860	But people love, I had a client.
2226860	2228540	No joke, guy was in his 70s.
2228580	2230580	He was married four times.
2230580	2232780	I did his third and fourth divorces
2232780	2235660	and he was getting married for a fifth time.
2235660	2237100	And I said to him, I was like,
2237100	2239300	because I actually thought he's older.
2239300	2240420	So I thought like, does he know
2240420	2242660	you don't have to marry them anymore?
2242660	2243940	Like maybe he doesn't know.
2243940	2244780	He's dividing his assets.
2244780	2245980	Yeah, maybe someone didn't tell him.
2245980	2246900	Like maybe someone didn't tell him,
2246900	2247820	like you can fuck them.
2247820	2249180	You don't have to marry them anymore.
2249180	2250020	You can just do that.
2250020	2251380	He's dividing his asset multiple times.
2251380	2254940	Well, I mean, it's getting smaller and smaller every time.
2254940	2255780	But I said to him, I was like,
2255780	2257820	why are you doing this again?
2257820	2259820	I was like, you don't have to get married.
2259820	2262260	Like you're clearly not great at it, you know?
2262260	2263820	Like, and he was very funny.
2263820	2266260	He said, you know, Jim, he said,
2267380	2271900	you buy a car and you drive it for 200,000 miles
2271900	2274060	and eventually the engine craps out.
2274060	2276460	So you go out and you buy a Ferrari
2276460	2278100	or you buy some flashy sports car
2278100	2279140	and you drive it for a couple of months
2279140	2280820	and you realize this is not the car for me.
2280820	2282140	So you get rid of it.
2282140	2283540	Then you get another car.
2283540	2286140	And you know, you think this one's gonna be the one for you
2286180	2288180	but you know, after you drive it for like a year,
2288180	2290100	you realize, yeah, this is not the car for me.
2290100	2291100	You can lease them instead of buying them.
2291100	2293260	You're gonna walk everywhere for the rest of your life?
2293260	2294340	Yeah, well, that was my answer.
2294340	2295260	You could lease them.
2295260	2296620	You could lease them or you could,
2296620	2298140	you could have some other alternative.
2298140	2299460	I mean, here's the thing about marriage,
2299460	2300860	is it's a technology.
2300860	2303780	So we made it up so we can change it.
2303780	2307340	You think marriage will change in the next 20 years?
2307340	2309900	No, no, I think it'll,
2309900	2311660	I actually think it's gonna have,
2311660	2312860	I mean, I think we're leaning,
2312860	2314580	I think the pendulum always swings hard
2314580	2315420	in the other direction.
2315820	2318300	We have a tendency as a culture to overcorrect.
2318300	2320700	So I think we're heading into a spiral
2320700	2322900	of like traditional stuff.
2322900	2324580	Like I think you're gonna see like people getting
2324580	2326380	like super religious again
2326380	2328140	and people are gonna get super dogmatic.
2328140	2329860	I think we're gonna see the trad wife thing.
2329860	2331700	We're gonna see the hyper masculine.
2331700	2333900	We're gonna see like a very, you know,
2333900	2335980	we've got to, we've gone so far
2335980	2337700	in the direction of postmodernism
2337700	2338820	where nothing means anything
2338820	2341180	and everything's just, you know, like there is no definite.
2341180	2343540	We've become like Sartre, you know,
2343540	2345820	like we've become so postmodern
2345820	2347980	that it's become almost the form of rugged individualism.
2347980	2349780	I think we're gonna swing in the other direction now
2349780	2352900	and traditional institutions are gonna get popular again.
2352900	2356300	It will be, I mean, you know, from a marriage place,
2356300	2357140	it's gonna be great
2357140	2358540	because I think people are gonna get married.
2358540	2360780	I mean, people were slowing down on getting married
2360780	2363580	for a while and they were getting married later
2363580	2364860	and they're having kids later.
2364860	2367060	We're declining to have kids.
2367060	2370300	And I think as we, I think as a culture,
2370300	2373140	we start re-solidifying into gender roles
2373140	2375820	or gender tropes, depending on how we wanna look at it.
2375820	2379020	I think you're gonna see marriage resurge again,
2379020	2380500	but I think that it's still gonna be
2380500	2382500	as flawed of a technology as it ever was.
2382500	2386620	And I think we have so much out there now
2386620	2388860	to compare ourselves to.
2388860	2390020	You know, you used to compare yourself
2390020	2392300	to the neighbors next door
2392300	2393820	and what car they had in the driveway
2393820	2394700	and what they were wearing
2394700	2396740	when they left for church on Sunday.
2396740	2400060	Now you're just looking at everyone's greatest hits.
2400060	2402340	While living your gag reel, you know,
2402340	2405060	and you're never looking at any of that stuff
2405060	2407100	when you're having like a peak experience.
2407100	2409060	You know, you're on the toilet or you're bored
2409060	2410940	and you're looking at everyone's hashtag blessed.
2410940	2412460	I mean, well, they're in my office.
2412460	2415380	I can't tell you how many people do a consult with me
2415380	2416340	and they're cheating
2416340	2418300	and they haven't slept with their spouse in three years
2418300	2419620	and they're miserable
2419620	2421300	and you're looking at their Instagram
2421300	2424860	and it's all like best life ever, hashtag greatest hubby ever.
2424860	2426140	And you're like, what is this?
2426140	2428000	It's performance art.
2428000	2430240	You know, it's an advertisement of how happy you are
2430240	2432840	but this is what people are comparing themselves to.
2432840	2434880	They're looking at that
2434880	2437040	and going, oh, my marriage isn't that good.
2437040	2438680	That marriage isn't that good.
2438680	2440720	Trust me, that marriage isn't that good.
2440720	2443080	That marriage is in my, look at celebrities.
2443080	2445000	You don't even need to look at the people you know.
2445000	2446840	Look at celebrities.
2446840	2449000	Before they do the, it is with great sadness
2449000	2450920	that we advise that we're going to be moving
2450920	2453560	in separate directions and consciously uncoupling
2453560	2456080	and like that right before that, it's like,
2456080	2459200	oh no, we're happy, we're great, we're phenomenal.
2459200	2462720	You know, we're constantly advertising
2462720	2466520	how wonderful our relationships are while they're on fire.
2466520	2468640	You know, and then wondering why everyone's, you know,
2468640	2470000	miserable in their relationship
2470000	2472160	because they're comparing it to something fake.
2472160	2475800	It's like comparing your body to a photoshopped body.
2475800	2476640	You know, it's-
2476640	2477960	Other than social media, do you think there's something else
2477960	2480720	in our society that made marriage more difficult
2480720	2483040	to stay together?
2484040	2484880	Now makes it worse.
2485000	2487320	And just like your parents stayed married?
2487320	2489720	Yeah, my parents stayed married until my mother passed away.
2489720	2490800	Same with me.
2490800	2493280	But they were mixed result.
2493280	2498280	I see, I think that my parents were not as caught up
2499640	2501640	in their own happiness.
2501640	2503320	I think we're very caught up in our own happiness.
2503320	2504400	We're all very self.
2504400	2506800	Yeah, we're all very sort of, I don't want to say narcissistic,
2506800	2508680	but we're very much like we are the son
2508680	2510720	around which everything revolves.
2510720	2511760	What am I not getting?
2511760	2514200	Yeah, my father was a Vietnam veteran, you know.
2514200	2516640	Well, he got out of the Naval Academy in 66
2516640	2518680	and went to Vietnam for three years.
2518680	2519920	So he was alive.
2519920	2521400	So he was like, fuck, I'm ahead.
2521400	2522520	I'm playing with the house's money.
2522520	2523360	I'm alive.
2523360	2524760	Everybody in their wedding party,
2524760	2526840	all the men in their wedding party died in Vietnam.
2526840	2528280	There's five guys in their wedding party.
2528280	2529120	They all died in Vietnam.
2529120	2531000	My parents never looked at their wedding novel
2531000	2532520	because every single man and it was dead.
2532520	2534280	They were all helicopter pilots in Vietnam
2534280	2536520	who got killed in their 20s, you know.
2536520	2539360	So they didn't really see marriages.
2539360	2540640	Like it was a partnership.
2540640	2542480	It was like, yeah, we're gonna do this thing.
2542480	2543320	We're gonna have kids.
2543320	2544240	We're gonna raise the kids.
2544240	2547240	We're gonna, you know, we're gonna have a house.
2547240	2548600	You know, we're gonna have a car.
2548600	2549560	Like we'll be successful.
2549560	2550400	The lights are on.
2550400	2551880	My father was dirt poor.
2551880	2555840	He came from like Appalachian part of Virginia,
2555840	2557640	a small town called Shawsville.
2557640	2558640	Didn't have indoor plumbing
2558640	2560520	until he left for the Naval Academy.
2560520	2563840	And he just, I think he saw marriages.
2563840	2565360	Yeah, that's what you do, you know.
2565360	2566640	He met my mom on Fleet Week.
2566640	2568480	She was a nurse in the city.
2568480	2570600	And he was, you know, on Fleet Week
2570600	2572720	and he had his uniform on and he was in a bar
2572720	2575800	and he was drunk and he went to her
2575800	2578200	and he said, you're the most beautiful woman
2578200	2579960	I've ever seen and I'm gonna marry you.
2579960	2581320	Cause he was drunk.
2581320	2583680	And she said, are you in the military?
2583680	2585960	Cause he was wearing a uniform and he said, yep.
2585960	2586920	And she said, what country?
2586920	2589240	And he said, whatever country you're from.
2589240	2591680	And he invited her to visit him at the Naval Academy
2591680	2593840	a couple of weeks later and she came.
2593840	2596360	But he'd invited three other women.
2596360	2598040	He just didn't know if any of them would come.
2598040	2599240	So he'd invited all of them.
2599240	2601540	So my mom got there and she saw these other women
2601580	2605140	and she said, either I'm leaving or they're all leaving.
2605140	2606860	And he was like, I kind of like her.
2606860	2608340	So he made them all leave.
2608340	2610660	And they were, yeah, they were married 50 plus years.
2610660	2612940	But, you know, their marriage had challenges.
2612940	2614300	You know, he was an alcoholic.
2614300	2616740	He's been in recovery for maybe seven, eight years
2616740	2620040	since she passed, but, and he's remarried.
2620040	2622540	But he remarried within a year of my mom dying.
2622540	2625620	Like he was the kind of, he's of a generation of men
2625620	2628140	that he needed someone to take care of him.
2628140	2629220	You know, my mom died.
2629220	2631360	He didn't even know how to scramble an egg.
2631360	2633480	Like it was, you know, like after she passed,
2633480	2636320	I had him come to stay with me and my sons.
2636320	2638560	And I was trying to like teach him like, okay, dad,
2638560	2640320	here's how you make like a batch of chili
2640320	2642360	and then you can eat it all week, you know.
2642360	2644500	And I was like, how's this guy gonna,
2644500	2646420	cause they had this very, you know,
2646420	2648480	but that's what I met another older woman
2648480	2650620	and her husband had died.
2650620	2651880	She needed someone to take care of.
2651880	2653520	He needed someone to take care of him.
2653520	2655360	But that generation didn't have it as easy as we know.
2655360	2656360	That's what I'm saying.
2656360	2660360	Like they, they, just meeting your basic needs, right?
2660360	2661520	They were grateful to be alive.
2661520	2662840	They were grateful to be alive
2662840	2664480	because they'd either been through a war.
2664480	2666560	We're not grateful unless we're driving a Mercedes or a,
2666560	2668120	and even then we're not grateful
2668120	2669800	because, because the truth is as well.
2669800	2672100	Okay, a Mercedes, a Mercedes, who cares?
2672100	2673320	You know, when people have a Mercedes,
2673320	2674640	my secretary has a Mercedes.
2674640	2677060	She leases it, you know, I drive a Jeep.
2677060	2678000	So is she better than me?
2678000	2679280	Is she more successful than me?
2679280	2680840	She works for me, you know.
2680840	2684540	So I don't, I don't know that any of it's enough anymore.
2684540	2685920	Like no matter what watch you have,
2685920	2688680	somebody's got another one or a better one or five of them.
2688680	2690020	And all those comparison that we see.
2690020	2693460	It's all, and so I just think that's the thing
2693460	2695580	that makes it impossible, right?
2695580	2698180	Like if, if, if you're,
2698180	2702700	our parents' generation was struggling
2702700	2704700	to just make it through, right?
2704700	2706820	To, to meet your basic needs,
2706820	2709940	to keep a roof over your head, to raise your children.
2709940	2712460	And now where it's very much, are you self-actualized?
2712460	2713300	Are you happy?
2713300	2714460	Do you have an eight pack at?
2714460	2716060	Like it would never have occurred to my father,
2716060	2717780	did he have an eight pack?
2717780	2720460	It would never have been something he thought of, you know?
2720460	2723740	It's just not, it just wasn't on his radar, you know?
2723740	2725660	And I don't think my mother would have ever been like,
2725660	2728400	oh, you know, he, he doesn't have an eight pack.
2728400	2730060	Like that wouldn't, because again,
2730060	2733060	though it's not constantly being advertised to him, you know?
2733060	2736420	I think that how many women did he interact with in a day?
2736420	2738820	You know, how many women do I interact with in a day?
2738820	2741740	Visually, or personally in some fashion,
2741740	2744820	or, or, you know, in a curated, mediated way.
2744820	2746860	And again, those are curated women, by the way.
2746860	2748900	So they're Photoshopped, they're airbrushed,
2748900	2750900	they're, they've got filters on them.
2750900	2755900	So again, you know, how does marriage survive in that setting?
2756700	2760540	It had a hard enough time surviving without all of that.
2760540	2761900	I mean, forget kids.
2761900	2763740	The divorce rate keeps increasing, right?
2763740	2765660	Yeah, it keeps going up, it keeps going up.
2765660	2770040	It's, it's been hanging around 53 to 56% for a while.
2770040	2771300	We had a bump after COVID.
2771300	2772820	What are other countries like?
2773700	2778700	Countries that have a significant religious narrative
2779140	2781260	have the lowest divorce rates.
2781260	2784300	So the lowest divorce rates are in like, you know,
2784300	2785140	Saudi Arabia.
2785140	2786180	Yeah, but they don't have a whole lot of choice.
2786180	2787780	Right, you're not allowed to divorce.
2787780	2789340	You just have your wife killed, you know?
2789340	2792580	So that's, you don't have to divorce.
2792580	2794900	So the countries where there is this very strict
2794900	2798500	religious prohibition against marriage, or against divorce.
2798500	2799340	But I mean, the United States
2799340	2801100	is probably the highest divorce rate?
2801100	2802580	We're among the highest, yeah.
2802940	2804780	I don't think we're the, we might,
2804780	2806980	we might be the highest now.
2806980	2811040	For a while, Germany had a very high divorce rate.
2811040	2812940	France had a pretty high divorce rate.
2814300	2816620	What's interesting is, is the divorce rate
2816620	2820300	and the marriage satisfaction rates, those are different.
2820300	2824340	Cause most people, the goal is not, can we stay married?
2824340	2826940	The goal is, can we stay happily married, you know?
2826940	2828460	Cause if somebody said to me like, yeah,
2828460	2829980	I've been married 25 years
2829980	2832300	and I've been fucking miserable for 15 of them.
2832300	2833780	Like, I'm not gonna envy you.
2833780	2835720	Like, great job, you're really hung in there
2835720	2837580	in that awful situation, you know?
2837580	2839980	Like, that's not impressive to me, you know?
2839980	2842820	I have a cousin who got married and I was,
2842820	2845520	I was chatting with her, she's a younger woman.
2845520	2850520	And I, her, her husband just joined the police force.
2850720	2852540	And I said to him, so I was trying to make small talk.
2852540	2855500	And I said, so do you, you know, do you like it?
2855500	2857100	And he's from a family of cops.
2857100	2858780	And he said, nah, not really.
2858780	2860620	But you know, I'm gonna do like the 20 years
2860620	2862260	and then you know, you get your pension.
2862260	2867220	And I thought, I'll just do my 20, that's 20 years.
2867220	2870940	You're 25 years old, that's 25 to 45.
2870940	2873180	Those are fucking incredible years.
2873180	2874780	You'll never get those back.
2874780	2878580	And your approach to life is, yeah, I mean, I don't like it,
2878580	2880540	but I'll just kind of do it, you know?
2880540	2882400	Like I, I want to tip toe through life
2882400	2883900	and arrive safely at death.
2883900	2888020	Like that seems, you know, but I, I, I get that that's what
2888100	2890740	we're, if that's what marriage is,
2890740	2893100	if it's an endurance event, you know,
2893100	2896140	where no, no, you've got to stay married, you know?
2896140	2898740	Why, I mean, that's why I think
2898740	2901500	religions have been very quick to, I mean,
2901500	2902940	I always tell people I'm not religious.
2902940	2905020	I was raised very Catholic.
2905020	2908620	But the reality is that, you know, I mean, there's,
2908620	2913620	if in fact, God talked to humanity with 10 commandments,
2914620	2919620	I think it's hilarious that the only thing he has to say twice
2919740	2922900	is don't fuck people you're not married to.
2922900	2925900	Thou shall not kill once, right?
2925900	2928360	Honor the Sabbath once.
2928360	2931740	Don't covet your neighbor's wife, don't commit adultery.
2931740	2934020	It's, it's the only thing.
2934020	2936860	It's the only thing that got two commandments.
2936860	2939780	So like Bayes goes, don't kill, honor the Sabbath,
2939780	2941380	don't fuck people you're not married to,
2941420	2944260	seriously, don't fuck people you're not married to.
2944260	2945660	Like they just, no, it didn't,
2945660	2948020	Dasha, not steal one, you know,
2948020	2949780	it's the only one that got double billing.
2949780	2951260	Well, religion's a big component.
2951260	2952860	It's a huge component too, but why?
2952860	2954980	Because how else are you going to control people?
2954980	2956420	How else are you going to get people
2956420	2960060	to sign on for this thing and not sleep with each other?
2960060	2962140	I mean, I'm not saying Freud was right,
2962140	2965340	but we do want to sleep with people.
2965340	2967220	We do want to kill people that don't do
2967220	2968060	what we want them to do.
2968060	2969780	Like we have these animal instincts.
2969780	2971660	We have these impulses.
2971660	2972660	And what do we do with them?
2972660	2974540	Well, we have to live in a civilized society.
2974540	2976220	So civilization, it's this content.
2976220	2977460	We have to suppress certain things.
2977460	2979300	If marriage was outlawed or just abolished,
2979300	2981340	it would just be a free-for-all.
2981340	2982540	I don't know that that's true.
2982540	2983380	I mean, I think that,
2983380	2986900	I think people would like us to believe that's true.
2986900	2988980	You know, I don't believe that.
2988980	2991860	Like I don't believe that if,
2991860	2992700	Probably a lot of heavy.
2992700	2995580	If murder wasn't illegal,
2995580	2997700	that I would just go killing people.
2997700	3000260	Like I, like, you know, like I,
3000260	3004100	I rape and murder as many people as I want to,
3004100	3007100	which is none, cause I'm not a monster.
3007100	3010660	Like I don't, I rape as many people as I want to, none,
3010660	3011820	because I don't want to.
3011820	3013780	I wouldn't want to do that to another person.
3013780	3016940	I think society would be probably happier without marriage.
3016940	3019660	Well, I think we would have a lot less
3019660	3022860	of the damage that comes, right?
3022860	3026620	I think we'd have to find new narratives
3027460	3032020	to structure, to define relationships, right?
3032020	3037020	I mean, I do think there is a part of us that wants to say,
3037300	3040780	cause you know, as a grown man who's divorced,
3041660	3045940	when you're 20 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,
3045940	3047180	nobody thinks anything of it.
3047180	3049740	When you're 50 and you say, oh, that's my girlfriend,
3049740	3051380	people go, there's a story there.
3051380	3054380	Like cause you're either divorced or commitment phobic,
3054380	3056340	or why do you have a girlfriend when you're 50?
3056340	3058100	Why isn't that your wife?
3058100	3060340	So they know there's a story there.
3060340	3063220	So we'd have to, and I get it, I get it,
3063220	3066500	because if someone says, oh, that's my boyfriend,
3066500	3068020	it's like, all right, well, that could be for a week.
3068020	3068860	That could have been nothing.
3068860	3070580	That could be like, yeah, that's my boyfriend.
3070580	3074460	My husband, it's like, oh, okay, wait, that's her husband.
3074460	3076220	Like she's got some authority there.
3076220	3079740	So I get that there's this idea that we want to say,
3079740	3082180	like, you know, it's like when you're a little kid,
3082180	3085060	this is my friend, but this is my best friend.
3085060	3086620	You know, this is my best friend.
3086620	3090580	But like how many adults still need to say that?
3090580	3092820	Like how many adults still need to say,
3092820	3096860	oh, my friend, Todd and I, and my best friend, Tom and I,
3096860	3100660	like, okay, like, so they extra special friend?
3100660	3103340	Like, what are they, like, do they get health insurance
3103340	3104180	with that?
3104180	3105400	Like, what is the deal with that?
3105400	3107860	So I think that's kind of what marriage has become,
3107860	3110860	is it's like, you know, well, the person I love.
3110860	3113420	No, no, but like the person I love.
3113420	3115260	Like there's a lot of people I love.
3115260	3117660	I wouldn't want to be married to any of them.
3117660	3119980	But there's a lot of people I love, you know?
3119980	3122740	And I love my ex-wife.
3122740	3124180	I wouldn't want to be married to her.
3124180	3125380	I think she loves me.
3125380	3126420	She wouldn't want to be married to me.
3126420	3127260	I don't blame her.
3127260	3128920	I'm a great ex-husband.
3128920	3130180	I'm a terrible husband.
3130180	3131780	I'm a great ex-husband.
3131780	3133420	Because the skill set for an ex-husband
3133420	3135580	is totally different than skill set for a husband.
3135580	3138140	Skill set for a father is completely different
3138140	3138980	than that of a husband.
3138980	3142220	That's the thing I have to tell people all the time.
3143060	3144620	People say, well, he's a terrible husband,
3144620	3145940	so he shouldn't have custody of the kids.
3145940	3146860	I'm like, what the fuck?
3146860	3150620	Where's the overlap between being a good husband
3150620	3152420	and being a good father?
3152420	3154220	Like being a good father is a whole different skill.
3154220	3156700	You could be a great husband and a shit father.
3156700	3158860	And you could be an amazing father, a terrible husband.
3158860	3162220	Like there's very little overlap in those skill sets.
3162220	3164220	You know, maybe good listening skills would be helpful
3164220	3166460	in both or patience would be good in both.
3166460	3167860	But that's true of almost anything.
3167860	3169560	You know, it's a doctor and a lawyer.
3169560	3171140	Both be good if you had good listening skills.
3171180	3173100	It doesn't mean that the same profession.
3173100	3174700	Is divorce harder on women or men?
3176340	3177400	That's a great question.
3179820	3182180	I think it's equally hard on both,
3182180	3184540	but I think that the world is more sympathetic
3184540	3186980	to women when they get divorced.
3186980	3189380	I think when a woman gets cheated on,
3189380	3191340	the man's a piece of shit.
3191340	3193800	And when a woman cheats on a man,
3193800	3196500	she must have been forced into the arms of this other man
3196500	3197860	or she had to explore herself
3197860	3200580	or she was being neglected in some fashion.
3200580	3204980	So if a man cheats, he's a piece of garbage.
3204980	3207580	And if a man's wife cheats,
3207580	3209540	he mustn't have been meeting her needs.
3209540	3210940	And she had every right in the world.
3210940	3213540	Like, so the world is very unsympathetic
3213540	3215460	to men when they get divorced.
3215460	3217820	But that's been throughout hers.
3217820	3219300	Yeah, that's been for, I mean,
3219300	3223060	there was a maternal presumption, a legal presumption,
3223060	3225900	what was called the tender year's doctrine,
3225900	3228100	which was that if a child was under the age of seven,
3228100	3229340	they were automatically presumed
3229380	3231540	that they would be in the custody of the mother.
3231540	3235460	And men, so men get really beat up still in court.
3235460	3238220	I mean, the law theoretically is gender blind right now,
3238220	3241340	but I don't actually see that.
3241340	3243420	Because the law is people, the law is judges,
3243420	3246860	and judges are human and they are all the same biases.
3246860	3248860	And it's just not a moment right now
3248860	3252820	where men are particularly sympathetic characters.
3252820	3255540	I think that even young men, I mean,
3256340	3259820	if at a school dance they sing Beyonce's Girls
3259820	3262500	Who Runs the World, like if there was a song called Men,
3262500	3266060	Who Runs the World Men, and it was a positive thing,
3266060	3267580	like you get pilloried for that.
3267580	3270580	So I think that men have a very hard time right now
3270580	3271500	in divorce.
3271500	3273020	They see their children less,
3273020	3275100	they get hit harder financially.
3276180	3278260	They are the bad guy no matter what.
3278260	3279780	If they cheat, they're the bad guy.
3279780	3281980	If they get cheated on, they were the bad guy
3281980	3283380	because they probably neglected her.
3283380	3285180	There's a presumption that the man
3285180	3287340	is to blame a lot of the time.
3287340	3291140	Now again, marriage equality has been a thing for a while.
3291140	3293740	So there are tons of gay couples.
3293740	3296740	So you have two men, two women divorcing each other.
3296740	3300380	And that hasn't really shook out too much yet
3300380	3302180	in terms of how that plays out.
3303020	3305500	I don't know if it's that gay and lesbian couples
3305500	3307580	are better at it than heterosexual couples
3307580	3309380	or if it's still they're in the honeymoon period
3309380	3312940	because marriage equality hasn't been around that long.
3312940	3317780	But I think men find a less sympathetic world.
3317780	3320240	But in fairness,
3322380	3325780	divorced men have it a little easier, I think.
3325780	3330340	Divorced men meet a young woman
3330340	3333180	and the woman's like, instant family, just add me.
3333180	3334340	That's great, you know.
3334340	3337060	If he's got kids, it's like, oh, he's got kids.
3337060	3341300	Look at how nurturing he is and how lovely and women,
3341300	3342620	you know, they get divorced.
3342620	3346540	They've got kids, guys are like, whoop, it's got baggage.
3346540	3348140	I'm not going near that.
3348140	3353140	So I think that men and women have different problems
3353380	3358060	post-divorce and the world could be better to both of them.
3358060	3363060	I think that I have some women who I've done their divorce
3363860	3367100	and whatever guy is with them is gonna be very lucky
3367100	3370780	because they're beautiful, they're smart, they're good moms,
3370780	3373860	but they're also vibrant, exciting women.
3373860	3375020	Now they're loaded.
3375020	3377220	And they've got money now, yeah, they've got money.
3377220	3379340	They don't have as much financial insecurity.
3379340	3380860	Although I have to tell you that,
3380860	3382580	it's the last remaining feminist taboo.
3382580	3384580	I got a lot of women paying alimony these days.
3384580	3389020	I mean, women can, women marry the like handsome musician
3389020	3392300	who's not successful or the artist, you know.
3392300	3393460	There's a lot of listen week.
3393460	3397700	It hasn't been, you know, there's been a significant effort
3397700	3399900	in our culture in the last decade
3399900	3403660	if anyone didn't notice to improve the situation of women.
3403660	3405260	If you have an equally qualified man
3405260	3406940	and an uniquely qualified woman,
3406940	3409140	the woman's the diversity higher, the man's not.
3409140	3412060	So I have a lot of women who get, when they get told,
3412060	3414780	like, oh yeah, no, you gotta give them half your shit
3414780	3416340	or oh no, you gotta pay alimony
3416340	3419100	because he makes 50 grand a year and you make 250.
3419100	3420020	And they're like, you know,
3420020	3422260	they could be the staunchest feminist in the world.
3422260	3423740	And when you tell them they gotta pay alimony,
3423740	3426700	they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he's a man.
3426700	3429580	He's got a strong back, he can get out there and work.
3429580	3433020	And then suddenly the whole like gender is a construct
3433020	3434500	and there's no such thing.
3434500	3435740	That goes right out the window
3435740	3437100	and you got told you gotta pay alimony.
3437100	3438860	That's like, nope, no, no, no, no.
3438860	3440300	I believe in strict gender roles.
3440300	3441900	Men should pay alimony.
3441900	3443660	Women, even if you earn 10 times,
3443660	3444980	you should not have to pay alimony.
3444980	3449020	I've had very, very staunchly feminist clients
3449020	3453100	who changed their mind about how feminist they were
3453100	3456220	when they got told that they were gonna have to pay alimony.
3456220	3457140	Interesting.
3457140	3459060	Yeah, but I do have a lot of men
3459060	3462140	who won't take alimony even though they're entitled to it
3462140	3463700	because there's just some feeling of like,
3463700	3464660	yeah, no, I'm not doing that.
3464660	3465660	It's emasculating.
3465660	3467060	Like if she tells people that we know
3467060	3468380	that I took alimony from her,
3468380	3470020	like people will think I'm less than a man.
3470020	3471780	So again, it's all gender stuff.
3471780	3472620	It's still out there.
3472620	3474820	It's still part of the zeitgeist.
3474820	3476620	We're still trying to figure it all out.
3476620	3480300	How many marriages are genuinely happy, you think?
3481540	3483220	How many married couples?
3483220	3484780	Gosh.
3484780	3486980	Because I see married couples that have been married.
3486980	3489540	It looks like they've been married a decade or two
3489540	3490380	and they're having dinner
3490380	3492020	and they're having the same conversation they had yesterday
3492020	3493460	or the day before or the day before that
3493460	3495300	and the weeks and months before that.
3495300	3496500	You know, here's what I'll tell you.
3496500	3501380	I have, I know a lot of people
3501380	3503660	and I think I know one couple
3504740	3507380	that has like a genuinely happy marriage.
3507380	3509100	What do you think the secret is?
3509100	3510540	Ah, they really like each other.
3510540	3511380	I don't know.
3511380	3513460	Like they're really good to each other.
3513460	3516740	I have to tell you, they make me very uncomfortable.
3517700	3519580	My ex-wife and I jokingly say
3519580	3522460	that they were the reason we got divorced
3522460	3526380	because we've known them since we were in college
3526380	3528380	and we went to Disney with them,
3528380	3530700	with their kids and our kids,
3530700	3533020	when all the kids were little.
3533020	3535060	And we were gonna go on a ride
3535060	3537020	with our kids and their kids
3537020	3539260	and they were gonna like,
3539260	3541220	oh, we'll take the kids on the ride
3541220	3542660	and you guys can go.
3542660	3543500	And my friend was like,
3543500	3546300	oh good, we're just gonna go walk and hold hands.
3546340	3548300	And they walked away and like holding hands
3548300	3549860	and we looked at them
3549860	3551940	and we didn't say anything to each other.
3551940	3553940	But like five years later when we got divorced,
3553940	3557460	I said, you know, when I saw the two of them together,
3557460	3560020	I thought, I don't feel like that about her.
3560020	3561140	Like, and she said, oh my God,
3561140	3564220	I remember that exact moment and I felt the same way.
3564220	3566340	So I think they make people uncomfortable.
3566340	3569300	Like when you see someone who's got it right,
3569300	3571660	like this guy just loves her.
3571660	3572500	He loves her.
3572500	3574420	They've been married 25 years
3574420	3576740	and dude, it's like he's talking
3576740	3578300	about a girl he met yesterday.
3578300	3580180	And she's the same way about him.
3580180	3581020	Like she's-
3581020	3581860	It's a miracle when that happens.
3581860	3582860	Yeah, I just think it,
3582860	3584100	you know, man, I tell people,
3584100	3585340	marriage is like the lottery.
3585340	3588180	You are probably not gonna win, you know?
3588180	3592540	But if you win, what you win is so good.
3592540	3595820	Like, I don't know, maybe buy a ticket, fuck it.
3595820	3597740	Like, but buy a ticket, get a prenup.
3597740	3599660	Like, do you take all your money
3599660	3600740	and buy lottery tickets?
3600740	3602820	No, but if you, and I don't buy lottery tickets.
3602820	3603660	Like, I don't play the lottery.
3603660	3605380	I'm not gonna fucking win, why?
3605380	3608420	You know, set the money on fire, it'll be more fun.
3608420	3610860	But if somebody said to me, no man, you know what?
3610860	3613820	Once a week, I buy $20 worth of lottery tickets.
3613820	3615420	All right, go for it, you know?
3615420	3617460	Somebody's gotta win, maybe it'll be you.
3617460	3618540	Like same thing with marriage.
3618540	3620420	Like maybe somebody's gotta win.
3620420	3624540	Like yeah, I've met hundreds, if not thousands of couples.
3624540	3629540	And I know one, one that is legitimately happy
3629940	3633860	and like really seem to just feed that happiness
3633860	3635820	by that marriage that they have.
3635820	3639860	And they both as individuals have become the best version
3639860	3642260	of themselves by being, you know what?
3642260	3644860	Like, that's, they won the lottery.
3644860	3647340	So buy the ticket, I guess, you know?
3647340	3651820	But I mean, don't make that your retirement plan.
3651820	3653660	Like, don't go like, well, you know, don't worry.
3653660	3655780	I'm not saving money for my kid's college
3655780	3657620	because, you know, I'm buying lottery tickets.
3657620	3660220	Like that's, you're an idiot if you're doing that.
3661380	3662220	Excellent.
3662220	3663980	Jim, thank you so much for sharing your story.
3663980	3664820	It was a pleasure.
3664820	3667220	Your thoughts on marriage and love and divorce.
3667220	3668460	Fascinating topic, isn't it?
3668460	3671620	Yeah, it is, and I suspect it will continue to be.
3671620	3673300	I don't know that we're gonna culturally
3673300	3677380	get any better at it, but the economy's good, we're busy.
3677380	3679180	Economy's bad, we're busy.
3679180	3681620	Like we're a recession-proof industry.
3681620	3686620	So, you know, it's, even COVID didn't slow us down, you know?
3687380	3688900	It probably sped you up.
3688900	3690300	Well, people said for better or for worse,
3690300	3692140	they didn't say for lunch, you know?
3692140	3694380	And when you're locked in the house together,
3694380	3696300	that was not great for most marriages.
3696300	3698380	Like there was no, it was not,
3698380	3700940	hey, we should all spend more time together.
3700940	3703660	You know, there was a lot of difficult conversations
3703660	3704780	that came out of that.
3704780	3707780	Barbers and divorce lawyers, when the pandemic ended,
3707780	3710220	we were, the lines were out the door, you know?
3710220	3712220	So whatever the next thing is, you know,
3712220	3713940	we'll still be here.
3713940	3715460	All right, thank you so much.
3715460	3716300	You got it, man.
3716620	3717460	Thank you.
