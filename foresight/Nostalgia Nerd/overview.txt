Processing Overview for Nostalgia Nerd

Checking Nostalgia Nerd/These Keys Shouldn't Exist ï½œ Nostalgia Nerd.txt
1. The vertical bar (pipe) symbol on UK keyboards has an additional key due to the introduction of extended ASCII codes in 1985 (ISO8859-1 or ECMA94). This added a second vertical bar character, 00A6, alongside the original pipe character, 007C.
2. The original pipe character, 007C, was intentionally made to look "broken" in 1967 to discourage its use as a dash, which was causing formatting issues in teleprinters.
3. In 1985, the broken vertical bar was brought back as a distinct character (00A6) on UK keyboards and some international keyboards, often placed next to the original pipe key.
4. The introduction of this new broken bar character was influenced by IBM's Model M keyboard from 1985, which also reversed the positions of the vertical bars on the keyboard.
5. Despite the introduction of the second vertical bar, the original character still serves as a pipe symbol and is commonly used in various applications.
6. The additional broken bar key on some keyboards doesn't have a specific purpose but can be used for ASCII art or given a bespoke function by programmers.
7. In modern operating systems, both the original and the new broken bar characters are recognized and can be used as intended.
8. The confusion around the two vertical bars on keyboards is a legacy of an old standards dispute that dates back over 50 years.
