Checking Tactile Philosophy/An introduction to Deleuze (what is philosophy).txt
1. The video discusses the role of philosophy, particularly the work of Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari, as an active role in social discourse, offering a framework to channel the chaos of existence into something meaningful and creative. Philosophy is not just an academic pursuit but a way of navigating and making sense of the world.

2. Deleuze and Guattari's work is often seen as difficult due to its complexity and use of technical terminology, which can be inaccessible to those outside of academia. However, their true intent seems to be establishing a theoretical basis for philosophical experimentation, emphasizing the importance of creativity and exploring new possibilities.

3. The video encourages viewers not to simply accept or reject philosophical theories but to engage with them creatively, finding potential movements, lines of flight, and new land within their concepts. This approach is demonstrated by the video itself, which applies Deleuze's ideas to the context of scientism.

4. For those interested in exploring Deleuze's work further, the video suggests various resources, including videos from Jonas Shaker, Then and Now, Philosophize This, and The Plastic Pilots Podcast, as well as books like "Gilles Deleuze and Introduction" by Todd Mays and "The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze" edited by Henry Thomas Hall and Daniel Smith.

5. The video concludes with an invitation to engage with Deleuze's philosophy not just as a set of ideas but as a tool for creating new connections, meanings, and possibilities in one's own life and understanding.
