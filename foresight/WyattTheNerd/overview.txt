Â¡Hola! It seems you've provided a detailed and enthusiastic review of the Superman movie collection, specifically focusing on the DVD set that includes all five films: "Superman: The Movie" (expanded edition), "Superman II" (the Richard Donner Cut), "Superman III," "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace," and "Superman Returns." Here's a summary of your review:

1. **Superman: The Movie (Expanded Edition):** This is the first film in the collection, an expanded version of the original 1978 classic that sets the stage for the Man of Steel. It includes additional footage not seen in the original release and is highly recommended for Superman fans.

2. **Superman II (The Richard Donner Cut):** This is the sequel to the first film, also directed by Richard Donner, and is considered by many to be one of the best superhero films ever made. It features the iconic battle between Superman and General Zod.

3. **Superman III:** The third installment in the series takes a turn towards comedy with Richard Pryor joining the cast. It presents a different side of Superman as he faces challenges from a computer hacker version of Lex Luthor.

4. **Superman IV: The Quest for Peace:** This film is noted to be less well-received, featuring Superman's attempt to disarm nuclear weapons on Earth, leading to a confrontation with a villain created by Lex Luthor and his henchman, Hackman.

5. **Superman Returns:** The most recent of the films included in this collection (as of your review), this film brings Superman back to Earth after a long absence, dealing with personal loss and the legacy he left behind. It's described as having an epic scope and action sequences.

You highlight that this collection is a great value, especially when compared to other movie sets like the Star Wars saga. You recommend it to any Superman fan and note that it can be found at a reasonable price at Walmart. Your review also includes some humor and personal touches, such as your excitement about the collection and a reference to your own car's inability to think.
