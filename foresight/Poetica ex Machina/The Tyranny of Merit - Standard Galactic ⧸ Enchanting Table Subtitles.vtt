00:00.000 --> 00:12.320
Here's a question we should all be asking.

00:12.320 --> 00:18.240
What went wrong, not just with the pandemic, but with our civic life?

00:18.240 --> 00:23.800
What brought us to this polarized, rankerous political moment?

00:23.800 --> 00:29.560
In recent decades, the divide between winners and losers has been deepening.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.840
Poisoning our politics, setting us apart.

00:33.840 --> 00:41.520
This divide is partly about inequality, but it's also about the attitudes toward winning

00:41.520 --> 00:44.680
and losing that have come with it.

00:44.680 --> 00:51.240
Those who landed on top came to believe that their success was their own doing, a measure

00:51.240 --> 00:58.840
of their merit, and that those who lost out had no one to blame but themselves.

00:58.840 --> 01:05.440
This way of thinking about success arises from a seemingly attractive principle.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.600
If everyone has an equal chance, the winners deserve their winnings.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.480
This is the heart of the meritocratic ideal.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.280
In practice, of course, we fall far short.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.960
Not everybody has an equal chance to rise.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.720
Everyone born to poor families tend to stay poor when they grow up.

01:31.720 --> 01:36.760
Affluent parents are able to pass their advantages on to their kids.

01:36.760 --> 01:43.560
At Ivy League universities, for example, there are more students from the top 1 percent

01:43.560 --> 01:50.240
than from the entire bottom half of the country combined.

01:50.240 --> 01:56.200
But the problem isn't only that we fail to live up to the meritocratic principles we

01:56.200 --> 01:58.200
proclaim.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.400
The ideal itself is flawed.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.560
It has a dark side.

02:03.560 --> 02:08.440
Meritocracy is corrosive of the common good.

02:08.440 --> 02:16.680
It leads to hubris among the winners and humiliation among those who lose out.

02:16.680 --> 02:24.160
It encourages the successful to inhale too deeply of their success, to forget the luck

02:24.160 --> 02:30.520
and good fortune that helped them on their way, and it leads them to look down on those

02:30.520 --> 02:35.720
less fortunate, less credentialed than themselves.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.160
This matters for politics.

02:39.160 --> 02:46.320
One of the most potent sources of the populist backlash is the sense among many working people

02:47.200 --> 02:50.440
that elites look down on them.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.520
It's a legitimate complaint.

02:53.520 --> 03:03.080
Even as globalization brought deepening inequality and stagnant wages, its proponents offered

03:03.080 --> 03:06.040
workers some bracing advice.

03:06.040 --> 03:12.480
If you want to compete and win in the global economy, go to college.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.840
What you earn depends on what you learn.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.160
You can make it if you try.

03:19.160 --> 03:25.920
These elites miss the insult implicit in this advice.

03:25.920 --> 03:34.560
If you don't go to college, if you don't flourish in the new economy, your failure is your fault.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.560
That's the implication.

03:36.560 --> 03:43.200
It's no wonder many working people turned against meritocratic elites.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.240
So what should we do?

03:45.240 --> 03:49.920
We need to rethink three aspects of our civic life.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.800
The role of college, the dignity of work, and the meaning of success.

03:55.800 --> 04:04.200
We should begin by rethinking the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity.

04:04.200 --> 04:11.000
For those of us who spend our days in the company of the credential, it's easy to forget

04:11.000 --> 04:13.400
a simple fact.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.720
Because people don't have a four-year college degree.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.720
In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans don't.

04:22.720 --> 04:31.800
So it is folly to create an economy that makes a university diploma a necessary condition

04:31.800 --> 04:36.000
of dignified work and a decent life.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.600
Encouraging people to go to college is a good thing.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.160
Broadening access for those who can't afford it is even better.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.600
But this is not a solution to inequality.

04:47.600 --> 04:55.160
We should focus less on arming people for meritocratic combat and focus more on making

04:55.160 --> 05:02.480
life better for people who lack a diploma, but who make essential contributions to our

05:02.480 --> 05:04.320
society.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.880
We should renew the dignity of work and place it at the center of our politics.

05:09.880 --> 05:16.740
We should remember that work is not only about making a living, it's also about contributing

05:16.740 --> 05:21.640
to the common good and winning recognition for doing so.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.800
Robert F. Kennedy put it well half a century ago.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.120
Fellowship, community, shared patriotism.

05:30.120 --> 05:37.440
These essential values do not come from just buying and consuming goods together.

05:37.440 --> 05:44.160
They come from dignified employment at decent pay, the kind of employment that enables us

05:44.160 --> 05:48.040
to say, I helped to build this country.

05:48.040 --> 05:53.520
I am a participant in its great public ventures.

05:53.520 --> 06:01.440
This civic sentiment is largely missing from our public life today.

06:01.440 --> 06:07.240
We often assume that the money people make is the measure of their contribution to the

06:07.240 --> 06:12.080
common good, but this is a mistake.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.440
Martin Luther King, Jr. explained why.

06:16.440 --> 06:22.680
Reflecting on a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, shortly before he was

06:22.720 --> 06:31.480
assassinated, King said, the person who picks up our garbage is in the final analysis as

06:31.480 --> 06:35.560
significant as the physician.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.720
For if he doesn't do his job, diseases are rampant.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.440
All labor has dignity.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.280
Today's pandemic makes this clear.

06:47.280 --> 06:54.120
Reveals how deeply we rely on workers we often overlook.

06:54.120 --> 07:02.680
Delivery workers, maintenance workers, grocery store clerks, warehouse workers, truckers,

07:02.680 --> 07:08.360
nurse assistants, childcare workers, home health care providers.

07:08.360 --> 07:13.760
These are not the best paid or most honored workers.

07:13.760 --> 07:19.040
But now we see them as essential workers.

07:19.040 --> 07:26.560
This is a moment for a public debate about how to bring their pay and recognition into

07:26.560 --> 07:31.040
better alignment with the importance of their work.

07:31.040 --> 07:42.200
It is also time for a moral, even spiritual, turning, questioning our meritocratic hubris.

07:42.200 --> 07:47.160
Do I morally deserve the talents that enable me to flourish?

07:47.160 --> 07:54.960
Is it my doing that I live in a society that prizes the talents I happen to have?

07:54.960 --> 07:57.760
Or is that my good luck?

07:57.760 --> 08:06.840
Insisting that my success is my due makes it hard to see myself in other people's shoes.

08:06.840 --> 08:12.760
Appreciating the role of luck in life can prompt a certain humility.

08:12.760 --> 08:21.080
There but for the accident of birth, or the grace of God, or the mystery of fate, go I.

08:21.080 --> 08:26.080
This spirit of humility is the civic virtue we need now.

08:26.080 --> 08:34.120
It's the beginning of a way back from the harsh ethic of success that drives us apart.

08:34.120 --> 08:41.880
It points us beyond the tyranny of merit to a less rancorous, more generous of the client.
