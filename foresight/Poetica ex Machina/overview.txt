Checking Poetica ex Machina/The Tyranny of Merit - Standard Galactic ⧸ Enchanting Table Subtitles.txt
 The question of what went wrong with our civic life and why we find ourselves in a polarized, contentious political climate, deeply divided by inequality and competing notions of success and meritocracy, is multifaceted. Over recent decades, the divide between the "winners" and "losers" has widened, exacerbated by a belief among those who have prospered that their success is entirely due to their own merit, while those who have not fared as well are often seen as responsible for their own misfortune.

This belief in meritocracy—that if everyone had an equal chance, winners deserve their winnings—is problematic because it overlooks the systemic inequalities that prevent fair competition. Moreover, the meritocratic ideal itself can be corrosive, fostering hubris among the successful and humiliation among those who are less fortunate or credentialed.

The globalization-driven advice that workers could compete and win in the new economy by simply going to college overlooks the insult implicit in this message: if you don't succeed, it's your fault. This has led many working people to feel resentful towards elite groups they perceive as looking down on them.

To address these issues, we need to rethink three aspects of our civic life:

1. **The Role of College**: The emphasis on a college degree as a prerequisite for dignified work and a decent life is not a solution to inequality but rather a deepening of the divide. We should focus less on preparing people solely for meritocratic competition and more on improving the lives of those without degrees, whose contributions are essential to society.

2. **The Dignity of Work**: Work should be valued for its contribution to the common good, not just for the income it provides. We need to restore the dignity of work by ensuring that all labor is recognized as valuable and by providing decent pay and benefits to workers who are often overlooked or undervalued.

3. **The Meaning of Success**: There needs to be a moral and spiritual shift away from the idea that success is solely a result of individual merit. Recognizing the role of luck and fortune in people's achievements can foster humility and a more empathetic outlook, leading to a less rancorous and more inclusive understanding of what it means to succeed.

In essence, we need to move beyond the current meritocratic mindset towards a more generous conception of community and shared purpose, one that acknowledges the interconnectedness of our fates and values the contributions of all members of society. The pandemic has highlighted the essential roles of often undervalued workers, and this moment calls for a public debate on how to better recognize and compensate their vital work.
