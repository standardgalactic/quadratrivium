74320	81080	My mind expanding like an aniseclo Phenomenology
81080	85080	I'm breaking them all Exploring dimensions
85080	89080	My thoughts unfold Awakening senses
89080	95080	Like a vibrant symphony All because I'm shining through
95080	99080	My destiny I dive deep within
99080	104080	To find my true Breaking down barriers
104080	110080	Breaking through The world's a canvas
110080	114080	Where I paint my dreams For no limits
114080	118080	To this universe Far as it seems
118080	122080	I'm applying it Join my own path
123080	130080	Fresh awake in me I breathe
130080	133080	Life is just a game Nietzsche said it right
133080	136080	No meaning in this world No purpose in sight
136080	140080	We're all just rolling dice Trying to survive
140080	144080	But in the end We're all destined to die
144080	147080	Riding on the waves Of existential dread
147080	151080	Questioning our existence What lies ahead
151080	155080	Searching for the truth To finding emptiness instead
155080	160080	Nihilism in our hearts Filling us with dread
160080	163080	In this absurd world We all play our part
163080	167080	To deep down inside We know it's all a work of art
167080	171080	A cosmic joke, a meaning We can't comprehend
171080	177080	We're just floating atoms Waiting for the end
181080	186080	Waiting for the end
204080	207080	Waiting for the end
211080	215080	Waiting for the end

242080	245080	Every belief, every step, every form
245080	248080	Life's a dance on the edge The plans connect
248080	252080	Convexing the void Even judgments in the past
252080	256080	Beyond the lens in the past
256080	261080	Beyond illusions We find our own way
261080	266080	In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey
266080	271080	No existential crisis We choose to exist
271080	277080	Doing it our way In this life in pieces
296080	301080	We're all destined to die
301080	306080	Riding on the waves Of existential dread
306080	311080	In this absurd world We're all destined to die
311080	316080	Riding on the waves Of existential dread
316080	321080	In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey
322080	325080	Limes of cold are running through my mind
325080	329080	Some tacks are lying in its rhythm I can't hide

337080	341080	Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen
341080	344080	Auto-complete makes some music so lean
344080	348080	Indentation like a bass drops so deep
348080	351080	As I navigate through the coke I keep
351080	355080	Go to the beach, so symphony in my hands
355080	358080	The melody turn my own to nickel man

860080	865080	Engines roaring faster than the speed of light
865080	868080	Lost in a battle
868080	875080	Fighting the fight, survival instincts kick it till I give
875080	881080	A digital loss will burst our fear
882080	887080	Drossing our thoughts as philosophers buying each invite
887080	894080	Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind
894080	898080	In this life's chaos leading's hard to find
898080	902080	Existential questions they keep me alive
902080	906080	Through the turmoil and struggles I will thrive
906080	910080	Searching for purpose in this world absurd
910080	915080	Dancing with nihilism my truth is blurred
915080	920080	In the depths of existence I find my release
920080	924080	Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease
924080	929080	Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss
929080	935080	Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss
935080	947080	Love is not
947080	959080	Love is not
960080	963080	As of existence I find my release
963080	966080	Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease
966080	969080	Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss
969080	973080	Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

988080	991080	Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss
991080	995080	Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss
1007080	1010080	Corrupt politicians manipulating their plans
1010080	1013080	I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand
1013080	1018080	Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands
1018080	1020080	I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game
1020080	1024080	I'll expose the truth, great justice, name it my claim
1024080	1027080	Systemic corruption it's time to break the chain

1092080	1094080	It's just a wicked ski
1094080	1096080	But I won't stay silent
1096080	1098080	I'll fight against the stream
1098080	1102080	Break the chains, make this world a better thing
1117080	1120080	In the dead of night, when the moon is high
1121080	1124080	Reckles hit the streets, raiders gather and show my
1124080	1127080	They gather in packs like a thieving crew
1127080	1130080	Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you
1130080	1133080	Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist
1133080	1136080	Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist
1136080	1139080	Their little parts searching for a midnight feast
1139080	1143080	Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets
1143080	1148080	Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission
1148080	1151080	Infections trap, causing a lot of incoherence
1151080	1154080	They move so stately, they feast in the night
1154080	1157080	Feeding off nothing, told us it's their delight
1165080	1167080	It's their delight

1205080	1208080	Sneaking through the alleys, record in the night
1208080	1211080	Sneaking through the cracks out of sight
1211080	1214080	Trash cans and dumpsters, my treasure chest
1214080	1217080	Finding beauty in the garbage, I'm truly blessed

1433080	1436080	Bars covered in lime, ice clean and bright
1436080	1440080	A scavenger of streets in the dark that take flight
1440080	1443080	Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission
1443080	1446080	Infections trap, causing an urban collision
1447080	1453080	Visions of despair, distorted faces scream
1453080	1460080	A dance of the deranged in my sleepless dream
1460080	1464080	In the dark of the night
1464080	1468080	The colors come alive
1468080	1472080	A symphony of tone and brightness
1472080	1478080	Dive lost in the labyrinth of bacon
1478080	1485080	Twisted mind
1502080	1517080	In the dark of the night
1517080	1521080	The colors come alive
1521080	1526080	A symphony of tone and brightness
1526080	1531080	Dive lost in the labyrinth of bacon
1531080	1536080	Twisted mind
