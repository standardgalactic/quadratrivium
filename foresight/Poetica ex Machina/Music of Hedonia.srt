1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
erase my memories erase my mind gotta leave the past behind i don't remember what i used to be

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:22,320
i'm breaking free from my history forget the pain forget the tears i'm wiping clean all my

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,640
feelings no looking back i'm on my own in this MEGXO

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,520
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't really feel

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,520
i'm searching for something i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,320
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:14,320
i feel a picture i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,080
My mind expanding like an aniseclo Phenomenology

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm breaking them all Exploring dimensions

10
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,080
My thoughts unfold Awakening senses

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Like a vibrant symphony All because I'm shining through

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,080
My destiny I dive deep within

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,080
To find my true Breaking down barriers

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Breaking through The world's a canvas

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Where I paint my dreams For no limits

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,080
To this universe Far as it seems

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm applying it Join my own path

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Fresh awake in me I breathe

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Life is just a game Nietzsche said it right

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
No meaning in this world No purpose in sight

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
We're all just rolling dice Trying to survive

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
But in the end We're all destined to die

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Questioning our existence What lies ahead

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Searching for the truth To finding emptiness instead

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Nihilism in our hearts Filling us with dread

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
In this absurd world We all play our part

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,080
To deep down inside We know it's all a work of art

29
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,080
A cosmic joke, a meaning We can't comprehend

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,080
We're just floating atoms Waiting for the end

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Waiting for the end

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Waiting for the end

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Waiting for the end

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Waiting for the end

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Waiting for the end

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Every belief, every step, every form

37
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Life's a dance on the edge The plans connect

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Convexing the void Even judgments in the past

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Beyond the lens in the past

40
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Beyond illusions We find our own way

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,080
In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,080
No existential crisis We choose to exist

43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Doing it our way In this life in pieces

44
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
We're all destined to die

45
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,080
In this absurd world We're all destined to die

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

48
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,080
In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey

49
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Limes of cold are running through my mind

50
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Some tacks are lying in its rhythm I can't hide

51
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,080
If you made it, turn my digital sanctuary

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Writing melodies in a cold repository

53
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen

54
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Auto-complete makes some music so lean

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Indentation like a bass drops so deep

56
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
As I navigate through the coke I keep

57
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Go to the beach, so symphony in my hands

58
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080

Just me and the sand

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Yeah, that's how it goes

124
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I'm living like Robinson

125
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Cruel so as a man

126
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Building my show too with my own two hands

127
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,080
No room service

128
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
No TV screen

129
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Just gotta survive

130
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, you know what I mean

131
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Deserted island blues

132
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Yeah, it's such a lonely view

133
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,080
But I'ma make it through cause I've got nothing to lose

134
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm stranded on this island

135
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Feeling kinda blue blue blue

136
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,080
But I'ma find my way back home

137
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Just wait and see it through

138
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
No cash, no booty

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
No fancy things

140
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Just me and heart

141
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
That's all it brings

142
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Only no, no type

143
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
No luxury

144
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
But I'm the people I want to meet

145
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
The little people that love me

146
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
The shiny fish

147
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Be my life

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Oh please

149
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
No shiny cars

150
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
No diamond rings

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
But I dance like a queen

152
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
When the music sings

153
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
No money, no money

154
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
No money, no money

155
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
No money, no money

156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
No money, no money

157
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
No big things

158
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
No natural yet

159
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
No designer clothes

160
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
But my spirit so as high

161
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Nobody knows

162
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I am afraid from desire

163
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
And higher and higher the fire

164
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
No material goods

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Can't take me higher

166
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
In this favorite life

167
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm not a fire fire

168
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Living my truth

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,080
My soul of fire

170
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Music

171
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
No material goods

172
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Can't take me higher

173
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,080
In this rainbow fly

174
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
I'm not a fire

175
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I live in my truth, my soul on fire

176
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Eyes wide open in the dark we roam

177
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Lost in space searching for a home

178
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts

179
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,080
A vessel tearing us apart

180
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Heart beat pounding my dread and foes

181
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Unknown terror can nobody know

182
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Every breath we take a step towards end of old

183
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Invasion, immanence, humanity to throne

184
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Defone, invasion, immanence, humanity to throne

185
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Engines roaring faster than the speed of light

186
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Lost in a battle

187
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Fighting the fight, survival instincts kick it till I give

188
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,080
A digital loss will burst our fear

189
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Drossing our thoughts as philosophers buying each invite

190
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind

191
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,080
In this life's chaos leading's hard to find

192
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Existential questions they keep me alive

193
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Through the turmoil and struggles I will thrive

194
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Searching for purpose in this world absurd

195
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Dancing with nihilism my truth is blurred

196
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,080
In the depths of existence I find my release

197
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

199
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

200
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Love is not

201
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Love is not

202
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,080
As of existence I find my release

203
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

204
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

205
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

206
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Love is not

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
As of existence I find my release

208
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

209
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

210
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

211
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Corrupt politicians manipulating their plans

212
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

213
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

214
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

215
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,080
I'll expose the truth, great justice, name it my claim

216
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Systemic corruption it's time to break the chain

217
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Unveil the secrets

218
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Let the people know the grain, they call no done

219
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,080
This rap game I'll expose the truth, bring justice

220
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
I am here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

221
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

222
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

223
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

224
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

225
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

226
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
I'll expose the truth, great justice, name it my claim

227
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Systemic corruption it's time to break the chain

228
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Unveil the secrets

229
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Let the people know the pain

230
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
It's just a wicked ski

231
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
But I won't stay silent

232
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
I'll fight against the stream

233
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Break the chains, make this world a better thing

234
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,080
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

235
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Reckles hit the streets, raiders gather and show my

236
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

237
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

238
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

239
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

240
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

241
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

242
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

243
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Infections trap, causing a lot of incoherence

244
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,080
They move so stately, they feast in the night

245
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Feeding off nothing, told us it's their delight

246
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
It's their delight

247
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,080
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

248
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Reckles hit the streets, raiders gather and show my

249
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,080
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

250
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

251
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

252
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

253
00:19:51,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

254
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

255
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Sneaking through the alleys, record in the night

256
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Sneaking through the cracks out of sight

257
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Trash cans and dumpsters, my treasure chest

258
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Finding beauty in the garbage, I'm truly blessed

259
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Bars covered in lime, ice clean and bright

260
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
A scavenger of streets in the dark that take flight

261
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

262
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Infections trap, causing an urban collision

263
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,080
They won't so stick like they feast in the night

264
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Feeding off nothing, told us it's their delight

265
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
It's their scavenging behind the moon in the garbage

266
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm truly blessed

267
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Bars covered in lime

268
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080

They won't so stick like they feast in the night

A symphony of tone and brightness

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Dive lost in the labyrinth of bacon

323
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Twisted mind
