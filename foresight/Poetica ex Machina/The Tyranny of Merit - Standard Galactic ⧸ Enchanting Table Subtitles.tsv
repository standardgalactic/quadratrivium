0	12320	Here's a question we should all be asking.
12320	18240	What went wrong, not just with the pandemic, but with our civic life?
18240	23800	What brought us to this polarized, rankerous political moment?
23800	29560	In recent decades, the divide between winners and losers has been deepening.
29560	33840	Poisoning our politics, setting us apart.
33840	41520	This divide is partly about inequality, but it's also about the attitudes toward winning
41520	44680	and losing that have come with it.
44680	51240	Those who landed on top came to believe that their success was their own doing, a measure
51240	58840	of their merit, and that those who lost out had no one to blame but themselves.
58840	65440	This way of thinking about success arises from a seemingly attractive principle.
65440	71600	If everyone has an equal chance, the winners deserve their winnings.
71600	76480	This is the heart of the meritocratic ideal.
76480	81280	In practice, of course, we fall far short.
81280	85960	Not everybody has an equal chance to rise.
85960	91720	Everyone born to poor families tend to stay poor when they grow up.
91720	96760	Affluent parents are able to pass their advantages on to their kids.
96760	103560	At Ivy League universities, for example, there are more students from the top 1 percent
103560	110240	than from the entire bottom half of the country combined.
110240	116200	But the problem isn't only that we fail to live up to the meritocratic principles we
116200	118200	proclaim.
118200	121400	The ideal itself is flawed.
121400	123560	It has a dark side.
123560	128440	Meritocracy is corrosive of the common good.
128440	136680	It leads to hubris among the winners and humiliation among those who lose out.
136680	144160	It encourages the successful to inhale too deeply of their success, to forget the luck
144160	150520	and good fortune that helped them on their way, and it leads them to look down on those
150520	155720	less fortunate, less credentialed than themselves.
155720	159160	This matters for politics.
159160	166320	One of the most potent sources of the populist backlash is the sense among many working people
167200	170440	that elites look down on them.
170440	173520	It's a legitimate complaint.
173520	183080	Even as globalization brought deepening inequality and stagnant wages, its proponents offered
183080	186040	workers some bracing advice.
186040	192480	If you want to compete and win in the global economy, go to college.
192480	195840	What you earn depends on what you learn.
195840	199160	You can make it if you try.
199160	205920	These elites miss the insult implicit in this advice.
205920	214560	If you don't go to college, if you don't flourish in the new economy, your failure is your fault.
214560	216560	That's the implication.
216560	223200	It's no wonder many working people turned against meritocratic elites.
223200	225240	So what should we do?
225240	229920	We need to rethink three aspects of our civic life.
229920	235800	The role of college, the dignity of work, and the meaning of success.
235800	244200	We should begin by rethinking the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity.
244200	251000	For those of us who spend our days in the company of the credential, it's easy to forget
251000	253400	a simple fact.
253400	257720	Because people don't have a four-year college degree.
257720	262720	In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans don't.
262720	271800	So it is folly to create an economy that makes a university diploma a necessary condition
271800	276000	of dignified work and a decent life.
276000	279600	Encouraging people to go to college is a good thing.
279600	284160	Broadening access for those who can't afford it is even better.
284160	287600	But this is not a solution to inequality.
287600	295160	We should focus less on arming people for meritocratic combat and focus more on making
295160	302480	life better for people who lack a diploma, but who make essential contributions to our
302480	304320	society.
304320	309880	We should renew the dignity of work and place it at the center of our politics.
309880	316740	We should remember that work is not only about making a living, it's also about contributing
316740	321640	to the common good and winning recognition for doing so.
321640	325800	Robert F. Kennedy put it well half a century ago.
325800	330120	Fellowship, community, shared patriotism.
330120	337440	These essential values do not come from just buying and consuming goods together.
337440	344160	They come from dignified employment at decent pay, the kind of employment that enables us
344160	348040	to say, I helped to build this country.
348040	353520	I am a participant in its great public ventures.
353520	361440	This civic sentiment is largely missing from our public life today.
361440	367240	We often assume that the money people make is the measure of their contribution to the
367240	372080	common good, but this is a mistake.
372080	376440	Martin Luther King, Jr. explained why.
376440	382680	Reflecting on a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, shortly before he was
382720	391480	assassinated, King said, the person who picks up our garbage is in the final analysis as
391480	395560	significant as the physician.
395560	400720	For if he doesn't do his job, diseases are rampant.
400720	404440	All labor has dignity.
404440	407280	Today's pandemic makes this clear.
407280	414120	Reveals how deeply we rely on workers we often overlook.
414120	422680	Delivery workers, maintenance workers, grocery store clerks, warehouse workers, truckers,
422680	428360	nurse assistants, childcare workers, home health care providers.
428360	433760	These are not the best paid or most honored workers.
433760	439040	But now we see them as essential workers.
439040	446560	This is a moment for a public debate about how to bring their pay and recognition into
446560	451040	better alignment with the importance of their work.
451040	462200	It is also time for a moral, even spiritual, turning, questioning our meritocratic hubris.
462200	467160	Do I morally deserve the talents that enable me to flourish?
467160	474960	Is it my doing that I live in a society that prizes the talents I happen to have?
474960	477760	Or is that my good luck?
477760	486840	Insisting that my success is my due makes it hard to see myself in other people's shoes.
486840	492760	Appreciating the role of luck in life can prompt a certain humility.
492760	501080	There but for the accident of birth, or the grace of God, or the mystery of fate, go I.
501080	506080	This spirit of humility is the civic virtue we need now.
506080	514120	It's the beginning of a way back from the harsh ethic of success that drives us apart.
514120	521880	It points us beyond the tyranny of merit to a less rancorous, more generous of the client.
