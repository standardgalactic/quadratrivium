1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,320
Here's a question we should all be asking.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
What went wrong, not just with the pandemic, but with our civic life?

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,800
What brought us to this polarized, rankerous political moment?

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,560
In recent decades, the divide between winners and losers has been deepening.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,840
Poisoning our politics, setting us apart.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,520
This divide is partly about inequality, but it's also about the attitudes toward winning

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,680
and losing that have come with it.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Those who landed on top came to believe that their success was their own doing, a measure

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,840
of their merit, and that those who lost out had no one to blame but themselves.

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,440
This way of thinking about success arises from a seemingly attractive principle.

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,600
If everyone has an equal chance, the winners deserve their winnings.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,480
This is the heart of the meritocratic ideal.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,280
In practice, of course, we fall far short.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,960
Not everybody has an equal chance to rise.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Everyone born to poor families tend to stay poor when they grow up.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,760
Affluent parents are able to pass their advantages on to their kids.

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,560
At Ivy League universities, for example, there are more students from the top 1 percent

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,240
than from the entire bottom half of the country combined.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,200
But the problem isn't only that we fail to live up to the meritocratic principles we

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
proclaim.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,400
The ideal itself is flawed.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,560
It has a dark side.

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,440
Meritocracy is corrosive of the common good.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:16,680
It leads to hubris among the winners and humiliation among those who lose out.

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,160
It encourages the successful to inhale too deeply of their success, to forget the luck

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,520
and good fortune that helped them on their way, and it leads them to look down on those

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,720
less fortunate, less credentialed than themselves.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,160
This matters for politics.

29
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,320
One of the most potent sources of the populist backlash is the sense among many working people

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,440
that elites look down on them.

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,520
It's a legitimate complaint.

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Even as globalization brought deepening inequality and stagnant wages, its proponents offered

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,040
workers some bracing advice.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,480
If you want to compete and win in the global economy, go to college.

35
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
What you earn depends on what you learn.

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,160
You can make it if you try.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,920
These elites miss the insult implicit in this advice.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,560
If you don't go to college, if you don't flourish in the new economy, your failure is your fault.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
That's the implication.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,200
It's no wonder many working people turned against meritocratic elites.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
So what should we do?

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,920
We need to rethink three aspects of our civic life.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,800
The role of college, the dignity of work, and the meaning of success.

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:04,200
We should begin by rethinking the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,000
For those of us who spend our days in the company of the credential, it's easy to forget

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,400
a simple fact.

47
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,720
Because people don't have a four-year college degree.

48
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,720
In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans don't.

49
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:31,800
So it is folly to create an economy that makes a university diploma a necessary condition

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,000
of dignified work and a decent life.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Encouraging people to go to college is a good thing.

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
Broadening access for those who can't afford it is even better.

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,600
But this is not a solution to inequality.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,160
We should focus less on arming people for meritocratic combat and focus more on making

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,480
life better for people who lack a diploma, but who make essential contributions to our

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,320
society.

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,880
We should renew the dignity of work and place it at the center of our politics.

58
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,740
We should remember that work is not only about making a living, it's also about contributing

59
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,640
to the common good and winning recognition for doing so.

60
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,800
Robert F. Kennedy put it well half a century ago.

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Fellowship, community, shared patriotism.

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,440
These essential values do not come from just buying and consuming goods together.

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,160
They come from dignified employment at decent pay, the kind of employment that enables us

64
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,040
to say, I helped to build this country.

65
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,520
I am a participant in its great public ventures.

66
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,440
This civic sentiment is largely missing from our public life today.

67
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,240
We often assume that the money people make is the measure of their contribution to the

68
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,080
common good, but this is a mistake.

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,440
Martin Luther King, Jr. explained why.

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,680
Reflecting on a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, shortly before he was

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:31,480
assassinated, King said, the person who picks up our garbage is in the final analysis as

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,560
significant as the physician.

73
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,720
For if he doesn't do his job, diseases are rampant.

74
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,440
All labor has dignity.

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Today's pandemic makes this clear.

76
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Reveals how deeply we rely on workers we often overlook.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:02,680
Delivery workers, maintenance workers, grocery store clerks, warehouse workers, truckers,

78
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,360
nurse assistants, childcare workers, home health care providers.

79
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,760
These are not the best paid or most honored workers.

80
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,040
But now we see them as essential workers.

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:26,560
This is a moment for a public debate about how to bring their pay and recognition into

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,040
better alignment with the importance of their work.

83
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:42,200
It is also time for a moral, even spiritual, turning, questioning our meritocratic hubris.

84
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,160
Do I morally deserve the talents that enable me to flourish?

85
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,960
Is it my doing that I live in a society that prizes the talents I happen to have?

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,760
Or is that my good luck?

87
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:06,840
Insisting that my success is my due makes it hard to see myself in other people's shoes.

88
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,760
Appreciating the role of luck in life can prompt a certain humility.

89
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:21,080
There but for the accident of birth, or the grace of God, or the mystery of fate, go I.

90
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,080
This spirit of humility is the civic virtue we need now.

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:34,120
It's the beginning of a way back from the harsh ethic of success that drives us apart.

92
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,880
It points us beyond the tyranny of merit to a less rancorous, more generous of the client.
