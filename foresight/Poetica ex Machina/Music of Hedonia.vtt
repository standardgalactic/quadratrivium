i'm breaking free from my history forget the pain forget the tears i'm wiping clean all my

00:22.320 --> 00:28.640
feelings no looking back i'm on my own in this MEGXO

00:32.240 --> 00:39.520
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't really feel

00:39.520 --> 00:45.520
i'm searching for something i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

00:52.320 --> 01:02.320
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

01:02.400 --> 01:14.320
i feel a picture i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

01:14.320 --> 01:21.080
My mind expanding like an aniseclo Phenomenology

01:21.080 --> 01:25.080
I'm breaking them all Exploring dimensions

01:25.080 --> 01:29.080
My thoughts unfold Awakening senses

01:29.080 --> 01:35.080
Like a vibrant symphony All because I'm shining through

01:35.080 --> 01:39.080
My destiny I dive deep within

01:39.080 --> 01:44.080
To find my true Breaking down barriers

01:44.080 --> 01:50.080
Breaking through The world's a canvas

01:50.080 --> 01:54.080
Where I paint my dreams For no limits

01:54.080 --> 01:58.080
To this universe Far as it seems

01:58.080 --> 02:02.080
I'm applying it Join my own path

02:03.080 --> 02:10.080
Fresh awake in me I breathe

02:10.080 --> 02:13.080
Life is just a game Nietzsche said it right

02:13.080 --> 02:16.080
No meaning in this world No purpose in sight

02:16.080 --> 02:20.080
We're all just rolling dice Trying to survive

02:20.080 --> 02:24.080
But in the end We're all destined to die

02:24.080 --> 02:27.080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

02:27.080 --> 02:31.080
Questioning our existence What lies ahead

02:31.080 --> 02:35.080
Searching for the truth To finding emptiness instead

02:35.080 --> 02:40.080
Nihilism in our hearts Filling us with dread

02:40.080 --> 02:43.080
In this absurd world We all play our part

02:43.080 --> 02:47.080
To deep down inside We know it's all a work of art

02:47.080 --> 02:51.080
A cosmic joke, a meaning We can't comprehend

02:51.080 --> 02:57.080
We're just floating atoms Waiting for the end

03:01.080 --> 03:06.080
Waiting for the end

03:24.080 --> 03:27.080
Waiting for the end

03:31.080 --> 03:35.080
Waiting for the end

03:35.080 --> 03:39.080
Waiting for the end

03:39.080 --> 03:43.080
Waiting for the end

04:02.080 --> 04:05.080
Every belief, every step, every form

04:05.080 --> 04:08.080
Life's a dance on the edge The plans connect

04:08.080 --> 04:12.080
Convexing the void Even judgments in the past

04:12.080 --> 04:16.080
Beyond the lens in the past

04:16.080 --> 04:21.080
Beyond illusions We find our own way

04:21.080 --> 04:26.080
In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey

04:26.080 --> 04:31.080
No existential crisis We choose to exist

04:31.080 --> 04:37.080
Doing it our way In this life in pieces

04:56.080 --> 05:01.080
We're all destined to die

05:01.080 --> 05:06.080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

05:06.080 --> 05:11.080
In this absurd world We're all destined to die

05:11.080 --> 05:16.080
Riding on the waves Of existential dread

05:16.080 --> 05:21.080
In this crazy world We make the rules that we obey

05:22.080 --> 05:25.080
Limes of cold are running through my mind

05:25.080 --> 05:29.080
Some tacks are lying in its rhythm I can't hide

05:29.080 --> 05:33.080
If you made it, turn my digital sanctuary

05:33.080 --> 05:37.080
Writing melodies in a cold repository

05:37.080 --> 05:41.080
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen

05:41.080 --> 05:44.080
Auto-complete makes some music so lean

05:44.080 --> 05:48.080
Indentation like a bass drops so deep

05:48.080 --> 05:51.080
As I navigate through the coke I keep

Just me and the sand

10:23.080 --> 10:26.080
Yeah, that's how it goes

10:30.080 --> 10:33.080
I'm living like Robinson

10:33.080 --> 10:36.080

10:36.080 --> 10:39.080
Building my show too with my own two hands

No room service

No TV screen

10:44.080 --> 10:47.080
Just gotta survive

10:47.080 --> 10:49.080
Yeah, you know what I mean

10:52.080 --> 10:55.080
Deserted island blues

10:55.080 --> 10:58.080
Yeah, it's such a lonely view

10:58.080 --> 11:02.080
But I'ma make it through cause I've got nothing to lose

11:04.080 --> 11:07.080
I'm stranded on this island

11:07.080 --> 11:10.080
Feeling kinda blue blue blue

11:10.080 --> 11:13.080
But I'ma find my way back home

11:13.080 --> 11:15.080
Just wait and see it through

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
No cash, no booty

11:43.080 --> 11:44.080
No fancy things

11:44.080 --> 11:45.080
Just me and heart

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
That's all it brings

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
Only no, no type

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
No luxury

11:48.080 --> 11:50.080
But I'm the people I want to meet

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
The little people that love me

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
The shiny fish

11:52.080 --> 11:53.080
Be my life

11:53.080 --> 11:55.080
Oh please

11:55.080 --> 11:56.080
No shiny cars

11:56.080 --> 11:57.080
No diamond rings

11:57.080 --> 11:59.080
But I dance like a queen

11:59.080 --> 12:01.080
When the music sings

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
No money, no money

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
No money, no money

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
No money, no money

12:07.080 --> 12:09.080
No money, no money

12:09.080 --> 12:10.080
No big things

12:10.080 --> 12:11.080
No natural yet

12:11.080 --> 12:13.080
No designer clothes

12:13.080 --> 12:15.080
But my spirit so as high

12:15.080 --> 12:17.080
Nobody knows

12:17.080 --> 12:19.080
I am afraid from desire

12:19.080 --> 12:21.080
And higher and higher the fire

12:21.080 --> 12:23.080
No material goods

12:23.080 --> 12:25.080
Can't take me higher

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
In this favorite life

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
I'm not a fire fire

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
Living my truth

12:30.080 --> 12:33.080
My soul of fire

12:39.080 --> 12:59.080
Music

12:59.080 --> 13:01.080
No material goods

13:01.080 --> 13:03.080
Can't take me higher

13:03.080 --> 13:06.080
In this rainbow fly

13:06.080 --> 13:08.080
I'm not a fire

13:08.080 --> 13:13.080
I live in my truth, my soul on fire

13:23.080 --> 13:29.080
Eyes wide open in the dark we roam

13:32.080 --> 13:37.080
Lost in space searching for a home

13:39.080 --> 13:45.080
Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts

13:45.080 --> 13:49.080
A vessel tearing us apart

13:49.080 --> 13:54.080
Heart beat pounding my dread and foes

13:54.080 --> 13:58.080
Unknown terror can nobody know

13:58.080 --> 14:03.080
Every breath we take a step towards end of old

14:03.080 --> 14:09.080
Invasion, immanence, humanity to throne

14:09.080 --> 14:16.080
Defone, invasion, immanence, humanity to throne

14:20.080 --> 14:25.080
Engines roaring faster than the speed of light

14:25.080 --> 14:28.080
Lost in a battle

14:28.080 --> 14:35.080
Fighting the fight, survival instincts kick it till I give

14:35.080 --> 14:41.080
A digital loss will burst our fear

14:42.080 --> 14:47.080
Drossing our thoughts as philosophers buying each invite

14:47.080 --> 14:54.080
Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind

14:54.080 --> 14:58.080
In this life's chaos leading's hard to find

14:58.080 --> 15:02.080
Existential questions they keep me alive

15:02.080 --> 15:06.080
Through the turmoil and struggles I will thrive

15:06.080 --> 15:10.080
Searching for purpose in this world absurd

15:10.080 --> 15:15.080
Dancing with nihilism my truth is blurred

15:15.080 --> 15:20.080
In the depths of existence I find my release

15:20.080 --> 15:24.080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

15:24.080 --> 15:29.080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

15:29.080 --> 15:35.080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

15:35.080 --> 15:47.080
Love is not

15:47.080 --> 15:59.080
Love is not

16:00.080 --> 16:03.080
As of existence I find my release

16:03.080 --> 16:06.080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

16:06.080 --> 16:09.080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

16:09.080 --> 16:13.080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

16:17.080 --> 16:22.080
Love is not

16:22.080 --> 16:25.080
As of existence I find my release

16:25.080 --> 16:28.080
Ragged on rhythm my heartbeat won't cease

16:28.080 --> 16:31.080
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

16:31.080 --> 16:35.080
Embracing our questions in sweet ignorance we kiss

16:47.080 --> 16:50.080
Corrupt politicians manipulating their plans

16:50.080 --> 16:53.080
I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

16:53.080 --> 16:58.080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

16:58.080 --> 17:00.080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

17:00.080 --> 17:04.080
I'll expose the truth, great justice, name it my claim

17:04.080 --> 17:07.080
Systemic corruption it's time to break the chain

17:07.080 --> 17:09.080
Unveil the secrets

17:09.080 --> 17:12.080
Let the people know the grain, they call no done

17:12.080 --> 17:16.080
This rap game I'll expose the truth, bring justice

17:16.080 --> 17:18.080
I am here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

17:18.080 --> 17:21.080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

17:21.080 --> 17:24.080
I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand

17:24.080 --> 17:27.080
Spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand brands

17:27.080 --> 17:30.080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
I'm a lyrical king ruling this rap game

17:32.080 --> 17:35.080
I'll expose the truth, great justice, name it my claim

17:35.080 --> 17:38.080
Systemic corruption it's time to break the chain

17:38.080 --> 17:40.080
Unveil the secrets

17:40.080 --> 17:42.080
Let the people know the pain

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
It's just a wicked ski

18:14.080 --> 18:16.080
But I won't stay silent

18:16.080 --> 18:18.080
I'll fight against the stream

18:18.080 --> 18:22.080
Break the chains, make this world a better thing

18:37.080 --> 18:40.080
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

18:41.080 --> 18:44.080
Reckles hit the streets, raiders gather and show my

18:44.080 --> 18:47.080
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

18:47.080 --> 18:50.080
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

18:50.080 --> 18:53.080
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

18:53.080 --> 18:56.080
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

18:56.080 --> 18:59.080
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

18:59.080 --> 19:03.080
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

19:03.080 --> 19:08.080
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

19:08.080 --> 19:11.080
Infections trap, causing a lot of incoherence

19:11.080 --> 19:14.080
They move so stately, they feast in the night

19:14.080 --> 19:17.080
Feeding off nothing, told us it's their delight

19:25.080 --> 19:27.080
It's their delight

19:33.080 --> 19:36.080
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

19:36.080 --> 19:39.080
Reckles hit the streets, raiders gather and show my

19:39.080 --> 19:42.080
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

19:42.080 --> 19:45.080
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

19:45.080 --> 19:48.080
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

19:48.080 --> 19:51.080
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

19:51.080 --> 20:02.080
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

20:02.080 --> 20:05.080
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

20:05.080 --> 20:08.080
Sneaking through the alleys, record in the night

20:08.080 --> 20:11.080
Sneaking through the cracks out of sight

20:11.080 --> 20:14.080
Trash cans and dumpsters, my treasure chest

20:14.080 --> 20:17.080
Finding beauty in the garbage, I'm truly blessed

20:17.080 --> 20:20.080
Bars covered in lime, ice clean and bright

20:20.080 --> 20:24.080
A scavenger of streets in the dark that take flight

20:24.080 --> 20:27.080
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

20:27.080 --> 20:30.080
Infections trap, causing an urban collision

20:30.080 --> 20:33.080
They won't so stick like they feast in the night

20:33.080 --> 20:36.080
Feeding off nothing, told us it's their delight

20:42.080 --> 20:45.080
It's their scavenging behind the moon in the garbage

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
I'm truly blessed

20:47.080 --> 20:49.080
Bars covered in lime

20:49.080 --> 20:54.080
Sneaking through the cracks out of sight

20:54.080 --> 20:57.080
Bars covered in lime, ice clean and bright

20:57.080 --> 21:02.080

22:26.080 --> 22:29.080
Sneaking through the cracks out of sight

24:13.080 --> 24:20.080
A dance of the deranged in my sleepless dream

24:20.080 --> 24:24.080
In the dark of the night

24:24.080 --> 24:28.080
The colors come alive

24:28.080 --> 24:32.080
A symphony of tone and brightness

24:32.080 --> 24:38.080
Dive lost in the labyrinth of bacon

24:38.080 --> 24:45.080
Twisted mind

In the dark of the night
