1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, thank you so much. And I'm delighted to be here. Thank you for putting on such an amazing symposium and giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts with you in long form.

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:40,000
So what I'm going to talk about today is basically the fields of collective intelligence in unconventional spaces. And if anybody would like to get in touch with me afterwards, all of the primary papers, the software, everything else is here.

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:56,000
So I want to start by just showing one of my one of my heroes Alan Turing. We all know that he was a forefather of artificial intelligence, he was very interested in this idea of creating cognitive systems and various kinds of intelligence.

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:10,500
And this is this is this is well known. What's maybe less well known is that the same person was really interested in morphogenesis. He wrote one of the very early papers on on trying to understand self organizing chemical systems.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And you might wonder why it is that the same person would be interested in intelligence and morphogenesis and I think that he saw a very deep parallel between these two, these two areas of study and I think he was right on the money in the sense that I think these are actually very much the same question.

6
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Now, most of the time when we think of intelligence, we think of something like this so here's a brain and we think of okay here's a here's a what quote unquote centralized intelligence of some some animal.

7
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:47,500
And then we look at things like this and colonies and so on and sometimes we talk about them as distributed or collective intelligence is swarm cognition and so on.

8
00:01:47,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And so like calls them liquid brains. But actually, it's important to realize that this is just a matter of scale because if one zooms in, you find out that we are all in fact collective intelligences and we are all made of something like this.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:10,500
So this is a single cell. This is a lacrimaria. It has no brain. It has no nervous system. It has no cell to cell communications or stem cells or any of the things that we're used to having in bodies.

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:20,500
What it what it does is it handles all of its local needs so so morphological behavioral metabolic and so on at the single cell level very competently.

11
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:39,500
And the amazing thing about this is that we all have taken the same journey from from what what might be called just physics, which is an oversight right a set of a set of chemical reactions that people would look at and would think okay,

12
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:57,500
this this has no cognitive capacities is just just some physics and chemistry. And yet, slowly, so over a matter of some months and maybe years, this process gives rise to these amazing morphologies and in fact, to high level human cognition that has second order, you know, metacognition and self awareness and so on.

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:09,500
And so this is a journey across the Cartesian cut that we all take. If you follow your own, your own development back far enough, you will find this and before that you will find just so it was quote unquote just physics.

14
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:17,500
So it's really interesting to ask how this transition works this this smooth transition. And so the main points that I'm going to try to transmit today are these.

15
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:31,500
First, that biology uses a kind of multi scale competency architecture of nested problem solvers, and that navigation is a really central concept to try to understand navigation spaces in particular is a central concept to try to understand this.

16
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm going to claim that goal directedness is a is a critical invariant for recognizing building and relating to various unconventional agents.

17
00:03:42,500 --> 00:04:00,500
And I'll describe a kind of cognitive boundary model for the scaling of goals. I'm going to spend about half the talk showing you one specific example in detail, which is this idea that pattern formation biological pattern formation is literally the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells in a space known as

18
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:14,500
morpho space. And I'm going to show you that bio electrical networks are the proto cognitive medium the ancestor of brain function. And this this idea actually has some very practical impacts on biomedicine.

19
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:29,500
This is not just a sort of philosophy this has very specific applications. And in the end I'm going to show you how synthetic by engineering provides a really astronomically large option space for new bodies and new minds that don't have standard evolutionary backstories.

20
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
So we'll get to that towards the end.

21
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:45,500
So, single cells have some really interesting spatial competencies that we can start off by thinking about. So this is a diatom. This is a single cell, and that particular very particular structure is something that it can reliably acquire.

22
00:04:45,500 --> 00:05:00,500
This is a collection of several acetabularia algae. Each one of these things is in fact a single cell that has one nucleus. The whole thing is maybe, I can know six or seven centimeters long, it has some roots, it has a stock, it has a cap here.

23
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:08,500
The whole thing is just one cell. And so this is quite interesting to ask how it is that a single cell can have such such profound morphological differentiation.

24
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:22,500
But these these competencies are not only spatial, they are also behavioral. And so what you're seeing here is a slime mold. This is a fissarum polycephalum. The whole thing is one cell. It can grow to be very large, but the whole thing is one cell.

25
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:31,500
And so when you place it in the middle of this Petri dish, the little white circles are glass discs. There's no food, there's no chemicals, they're completely inert glass.

26
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:47,500
So what it will do as it grows during the first few hours, it sort of grows evenly outward like this. And what it's doing during this time is sending out vibrations into the medium it pulses and sends vibrations into the medium, reading back the vibrations that that return so it's

27
00:05:47,500 --> 00:06:01,500
almost the kind of sonar it's sensing, sensing the properties of the medium. And by doing this, you can actually build a map of its environment, and then reliably make its way over to the heavier mass. So it can reliably detect three discs over one and you can all sorts of fun

28
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:12,500
experiments of stacking them one on top of each other and distributing them. But it has an amazing ability to sense the mass in its vicinity, and to make both morphogenetic and behavioral decisions based on that information.

29
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:22,500
So you can see this cell navigating in this space according to the biomechanical information that it has. So I'm going to show you four basic things today.

30
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:36,500
So first, we're going to try to introduce some biology that you may or may not have seen before, designed to really kind of stretch our idea of what is an organism, what is a mind, what does it mean to navigate space and so on.

31
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:54,500
And then, then we'll get into this very specific examples of bio electricity and morphogenesis. And then we'll talk about some of these novel organisms. So the kind of the traditional view is of these discrete static natural kinds you have a particular animal maybe you have a rat that you're studying

32
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:07,500
in a maze or a human subject or whatever you have. And that's, you know, that's kind of that's kind of your unit. But I want to I want to go beyond this, this sort of garden of Eden view and really emphasize that agents that do these intelligent things are incredibly plastic.

33
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:21,500
So here's one familiar example. Here we start with a caterpillar. This is a creature that lives in a in a largely two dimensional world that crawls around on flat surfaces that choose leaves, and it has a brain appropriate for that purpose.

34
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:33,500
It has to turn into a butterfly which is going to live in a very much a three dimensional world that has to fly it has to drink nectar. And in and it needs a completely different brain this is a soft bodied robot this is a hard bodied

35
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:51,500
controller suitable for hard kinds of bodies. And so in between what happens is during this process, the brain is largely, largely destroyed, most of the connections are broken down, most of the cells die, and and the new brain is rebuilt during the lifetime of the organism.

36
00:07:51,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And so, you know, this this this kind of change makes the confusion of puberty seem like real child's play, you know, in the sense that this is a single agent radically changing its its its brain and its body.

37
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:17,500
And the amazing thing about it is that memories that the caterpillar acquires are retained in the moth or butterfly. So this has been shown so despite the despite the disaggregation of the brain actually some information is able to make it across.

38
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:29,500
This can be even more radical these are these are planaria. These are flatworms and you'll see a lot more about them in this talk. The planaria regenerate any part of their body so you cut them into pieces. The record is something like 275 pieces.

39
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Each piece regrows exactly what's missing including the brain and you get perfect little worms. So, James McConnell back in the 60s, made an observation and it was, you know, quite controversial at the time but we repeated it and actually discovered he was he was absolutely right.

40
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:55,500
What happens is that if you if you train these planaria to recognize a particular region of their environment, let's say one with these little little bumps laser etched into it as the place where they get fed.

41
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You can then amputate the head and the brain. I mean, these animals have a true centralized brain. Amputate the head and the brain leave the tail. The tail sits there for eight or nine days doing pretty much nothing.

42
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Eventually it grows a new fresh brain and somehow that information is imprinted onto this new brain and these animals show retention of that memory.

43
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:24,500
So the information moving through the body being imprinted from one tissue onto another is something that we really need to start to understand.

44
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:33,500
And in fact, beyond beyond those kind of experiments, you can do this invertebrates. We did this in the tadpole. So this is a tadpole of the frogs and a Peslevis.

45
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Here's the brain. Here are the nostrils. Here's the mouth, the gut and the tail. One thing you'll notice is that what we've done is we've prevented the normal eyes from forming.

46
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,500
We've put an ectopic eye on the tail. So this is a this is an eye that forms on the tail.

47
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:56,500
And the amazing thing about these animals is that with no long, in fact, with no period of evolutionary adaptation to this new configuration, they can see perfectly well out of these eyes.

48
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,500
So we've made a device that tests them on visual training cues and sort of automates the same thing we use to test the planarian memory.

49
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:12,500
It's an automated behavior testing device. And what we found is that this eye finds itself in a completely novel environment surrounding my muscle instead of near the brain, puts out an optic nerve.

50
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The optic nerve might connect to the spinal cord. It does not go up to the brain. The brain that evolved for tracking visual data from these two locations suddenly gets information from some weird itchy patch of tissue on its tail.

51
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,500
No problem. It recognizes that as visual data and these animals behave quite well in learning assays.

52
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:40,500
So navigating your world with a radically different configuration of sensory and processing organs.

53
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:51,500
So what we really see in biology is that not only are we nested all structurally, I mean, we all, everyone knows that groups consist of individuals made of organs, tissues, cells and so on.

54
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:59,500
But actually, each one of these levels has competency. It solves problems in its own space and there are lots of different kinds of spaces.

55
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:14,500
And that multi-scale architecture, which is kind of unique, it's something that in engineering we're still really not able to recapitulate, although we're getting there, shows competency in many, many different spaces.

56
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Now, the one thing I'd like to do fundamentally is to generalize this idea of being able to perform intelligently in some space.

57
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:32,500
So typically, we think about three-dimensional spaces. So behavior, moving the body in three-dimensional space.

58
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,500
So it's very easy for us to recognize intelligence in those spaces because all of our sense organs point outward.

59
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And from the time you were very little, you were collecting data on medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds around you in three-dimensional space.

60
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,500
And we know how to recognize birds and mammals and other things behaving intelligently.

61
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:01,500
What we don't have are senses that directly show us, for example, imagine that you were born with a sense that where you could actually feel your blood chemistry,

62
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
all the different things going on in your blood physiology and all of the things that your liver, pancreas and other organs were doing.

63
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,500
In that case, we would have a training set that would allow us to understand intelligent navigation of other spaces.

64
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,500
So that would be physiological space, so the space of physiological parameters.

65
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,500
It might be a transcriptional space, so the space of gene expression, all the different gene expression domains,

66
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,500
or in fact, morpho space, the space of all possible anatomical configurations. We'll talk more about that.

67
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I want to show you, and the fact that we're not familiar with these other spaces means that when we make claims about the cognitive level or the intelligence level of other systems,

68
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
we're really taking an IQ test ourselves.

69
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
What we're really saying is this is what we've recognized the system to be doing,

70
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:54,500
but we can't really assume that we're smart enough to know exactly what it's doing and what it's solving in all of the different spaces.

71
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I want to show you a simple example. Again, these are the planaria, and what we found is that if we put planaria into a solution of barium chloride,

72
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,500
so barium is a non-specific potassium channel blocker. It prevents these cells from exchanging potassium with the outside world.

73
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
When you do this, literally their heads explode. Their heads just overnight they blow up.

74
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,500
The amazing thing is that if you keep the rest of the worm in barium over the next couple of weeks, they regenerate, they grow a brand new head,

75
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
and the new head does not care about barium whatsoever. The new head is barium adapted. That's kind of amazing.

76
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,500
We asked a simple question. We just looked at the transcriptomes of naive worms versus barium adapted heads,

77
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,500
and we just asked, well, what gene expression is different? What's different about these barium adapted heads?

78
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,500
One thing we found is that there's only a handful of genes. There's less than a dozen genes that are in fact different,

79
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:54,500
and so this system is able to figure out which genes to up and down regulate so that it can do its business without being able to pass potassium properly.

80
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,500
But the incredible thing about this is that barium is not anything that planaria ever see in the wild.

81
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,500
This is a completely unnatural novel stressor. So it's implausible to think that at some point there was evolutionary pressure to develop a response to barium.

82
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,500
So what you're really talking about here is you're in the space of gene expression, which is, let's say if they have 20,000 genes,

83
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:27,500
it's a massively very high dimensional space, and you need to walk in that space to find the exact genes that are going to solve your physiological stressor.

84
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Now, you don't have time to sort of randomly flip genes on and off, first of all, because it'll most likely kill you before you find the good combinations.

85
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Also, there's no time for that. These cells don't turn over that fast. It's not like a bacterial evolutionary system.

86
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,500
So it's still very much an open question. How do they navigate this transcriptional space to solve these kinds of problems?

87
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,500
So this to me is very much an example of intelligence in the sense of problem solving, taking what you already might know.

88
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Maybe there's information about what to do in a case of epileptic seizures or so on, and bringing it to a new scenario.

89
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:14,500
And so I've been working on this framework. It's called TAME. It stands for technological approach to mind everywhere.

90
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,500
And the goal of this framework is to be able to recognize, create, and relate to truly diverse intelligences.

91
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:30,500
So we need to handle, of course, the things we're familiar with, birds, primates, and so on, but also weird colonial organisms and swarms and things like that.

92
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Of course, all the new things that are being produced by synthetic morphology and synthetic biology approaches and possible exobiological agents,

93
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:51,500
because studying just the natural systems that are here on Earth and making conclusions about biology from them is a little bit like testing your theory on the same data set that created it, right?

94
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,500
It's all just an N of one pass through phylogenetic space.

95
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:07,500
So I tend to think about all kinds of unconventional, different types of embodiments, whether they be evolved, designed, whatever, and really think about this kind of, this is a scale by Rosenbluth, Wiener, and Bigelow.

96
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Looking at all the different kinds of behaviors that one might have in one space. Notice that it says nothing about what it's made of.

97
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,500
It doesn't say anything about having brains or being a specific kind of organism or scale, temporally or whatever. It's all very functional.

98
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
So this is how we think about things in my group.

99
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
And the key to this framework is that it has to move experimental work forward. It has to enable new capabilities.

100
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
And I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you how that happens.

101
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:42,500
But first, let's just think about this one particular kind of intelligence, which I think is super interesting, anatomical control as a collective intelligence.

102
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:54,500
First of all, notice the basic thing that needs explaining, which is that we all start life as a collection of embryonic blastomers, and this is a cross section through a human torso.

103
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:05,500
So this is what each of us has inside. Now, look at all the incredibly complex invariant order, all the tissues and structures, everything is in the right place next to each other, the right orientation, size, and so on.

104
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,500
So the first question is, where is the shape encoded? How do these cells know to make exactly this?

105
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,500
And you might be tempted to say DNA and genomes, but we can read genomes now.

106
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And what we see is that genomes directly code for protein structure. So the genome specifies the micro level hardware that's present in every cell.

107
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:34,500
But there's nothing directly that you can read out in the genome about the symmetry type of the organism, the size, the shape, how regenerative it's going to be.

108
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,500
This is very much an open problem of how cells know what to what to make and when to stop.

109
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,500
As workers in regenerative medicine, if parts of this are missing, we'd like to know how to signal the cells to rebuild, to do it again.

110
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And as engineers, we'd like to know, well, what else is possible, right? Given the exact same genome, what else can we ask these cells to do?

111
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Or is this the only thing they could possibly do? And you can sort of visualize forward the end game of this whole field as something like this.

112
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,500
It would be an anatomical compiler where you should be able to sit down and draw at the level of anatomy, the animal or plant that you want.

113
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Not the pathways, not genes, but the actual anatomy.

114
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:22,500
And if we knew what we were doing, we would have a system that compiled that description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build this particular thing.

115
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
In this case, a nice three-headed plenarium.

116
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Now, we don't have anything remotely like this. This is a very long term goal.

117
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,500
And the reason that it's really important is because if you think about it, pretty much every problem of biomedicine, with the exception of infectious disease.

118
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:43,500
So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of these things boil down to one problem.

119
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
How do you convince cells to build the exact structure that you want?

120
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
If we solve that problem, all of this goes away.

121
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,500
We'd be able to fix birth defects, regenerate limbs, reprogram tumors. All of this would go away.

122
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
But it's a major problem. Why do we not have an anatomical compiler yet?

123
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:12,500
So I want to be clear that despite the incredible progress in genetics and molecular biology, we face very fundamental questions that have to do with not with the molecular mechanisms, but with the decision making.

124
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
So here's a simple example.

125
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Here is this is a baby axolotl.

126
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
So axolotls are Mexican salamander.

127
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
There's a baby axolotl and baby axolotls have legs.

128
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Here's a tadpole.

129
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Not the frogs and a puslavus.

130
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Tatpoles do not have legs.

131
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
So now in my group, we make something called a frogolotl.

132
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
So this is a half, it's a chimera, half axolotl, half frog.

133
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
You can mix the cells.

134
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
They cooperate with each other just fine.

135
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
They make something, a frogolotl.

136
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Now I ask a simple question.

137
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You've got the genome to the axolotl.

138
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
You've got the genome to the frog.

139
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
How come we don't have any models that tell us whether frogolotls will have legs?

140
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
We have no idea from that information whether frogolotls are going to have legs or not.

141
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
If they do have legs, whether those legs will be made of axolotl cells or also include frog cells.

142
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
We have no idea even though you've got the genetic information.

143
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,500
So it's really important to start to understand the algorithms because where biomedicine is right now

144
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,500
is that we're very good at manipulating molecules and cells and getting information like this,

145
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
which gene and protein talk to which other gene and protein.

146
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
We are a long way away from actually controlling a large scale form and function.

147
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,500
And in fact, you can think about the kind of parallel journey that the computer science took.

148
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,500
This is what programming looked like in the 40s and 50s where in order to control the system,

149
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
you had to physically rewire it, right?

150
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You were pulling wires in and out yet to rewire it.

151
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Nowadays, for a joke, I say to all my students, you know, you're on your laptop,

152
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
you're going to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop.

153
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I want you to get out your soldering iron and start rewiring.

154
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,500
And of course they all laugh because nowadays we don't need to do that.

155
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
We understand that if your hardware is good enough, it's reprogrammable with stimuli,

156
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
with inputs, with experiences, not rewiring.

157
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
But of course, modern molecular medicine is all about the hardware.

158
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,500
We're all very excited about genomic editing and protein pathways and single molecule approaches.

159
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,500
And so I think the reason that we are still roughly where computer science was in the 50s

160
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
is because we've been neglecting one important aspect.

161
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
And that is multi-scale intelligence and biology.

162
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Now, what do I mean by intelligence?

163
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I mean what William James meant, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

164
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,500
And when we talk about pattern and anatomy, when I talk about goals, I mean regions of morphospace.

165
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Now, what's morphospace?

166
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Morphospace is the space of all possible configurations of some particular structure.

167
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
So if you're looking at snail shells, for example, there are three parameters that you can define.

168
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,500
And every shell is, every possible snail shell is some point within this morphospace.

169
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
And this is an idea that's very old.

170
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,500
In fact, Darcy Thompson in the 40s had this interesting example in his book on growth and form,

171
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
where he noticed that if you just deform certain animal shapes placed on a grid,

172
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
you apply specific deformations to the grid, which you get are other species that do exist.

173
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Now, at the time, there was no molecular mechanism, of course, known.

174
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
There was nothing really known about this.

175
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
But I think now we can do some very interesting things with this idea.

176
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:24,500
So navigating these spaces, changing your body shape to move from one region to another is not trivial

177
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
because there may be local minima, there may be barriers, there may be all kinds of things.

178
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,500
So that's the task that we face as morphogenetic agents.

179
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Now embryogenesis is very good at this. It's extremely reliable.

180
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,500
So you start off as this kind of pattern, and eventually you end up here.

181
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
And that's generally very low, very low error.

182
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:55,500
But we can already see actually that this process is not simply a kind of pre-programmed hardwired walk in morphospace

183
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
because we can deviate in the middle.

184
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
So for example, we can take this nice human embryo, divide it in half, literally cut it in half,

185
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,500
and what you get are not two half organisms, you get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

186
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
This is where twins come from.

187
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:18,500
And so this is a regenerative event where each half of this embryo basically realizes that it's actually not where it's supposed to be in morphospace

188
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,500
and it needs to regenerate the other half in order to make the correct changes to get to its goal and where it needs to go.

189
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:31,500
So this is not just embryonic, for example, back to this salamander, this axolotl.

190
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:39,500
These guys regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, their spinal cords, portions of their heart and brain, their ovaries.

191
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
They're incredibly regenerative as adults.

192
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,500
And what happens is that you can amputate, for example, this limb at different positions.

193
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
No matter where you cut, the cells will very quickly grow.

194
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,500
They will grow exactly what's needed to make a normal axolotl limb, and then they stop.

195
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
So this is a kind of example of anatomical homeostasis.

196
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,500
They will continue working from wherever starting position until they get to where they're going.

197
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Parenthetically, this is not just for frogs and axolotls and worms.

198
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
The human liver, of course, is regenerative.

199
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Even the ancient Greeks knew that.

200
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,500
I have no idea how they knew that, but it seems like they did.

201
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Deer, every year, regenerate massive amounts of bone up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day.

202
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Bone, vasculature, innervation, skin.

203
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
And even human children below a certain age can regenerate their fingertips.

204
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
If you just leave it alone, it will basically regrow cosmetically a very, very nice outcome.

205
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
So we have some ability to improve our position in morphospace.

206
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:45,500
One of the most amazing things about it is that as a body, as a living creature, you can't count on your environment.

207
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
You can't count on, in other words, you can't count on the environment being the same as it was before.

208
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,500
You can't count on not being perturbed during the developmental process, maybe physiologically, maybe metabolically, maybe with a parasite or a teratogen.

209
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
So you can't count on that.

210
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
And you still need to get your job done.

211
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
In fact, you can't even count on your own parts being what you expected them to be.

212
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Now, of course, we don't have any machines that can do this, that can repair themselves after damage or put themselves together with diverse parts.

213
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
This is one of my favorite examples of all time.

214
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,500
This is a cross-section through a new kidney tubule.

215
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
So here's the lumen of the tubule and these are the cells that make up the tubule.

216
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Normally, it's, let's say, around eight cells that work together to form this kind of tubule.

217
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:39,500
One thing you can do is you can make these cells what's called polyploid, which means they have extra genetic material.

218
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Amazing thing number one, with the excess genetic material, you still get a perfectly normal, no problem that there are all kinds of extra information around, no problem.

219
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
But what does happen is that the cells get much bigger.

220
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,500
And as the cells get physically bigger, fewer of them are needed to make the exact same shape lumen.

221
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Now, that's amazing thing number two is that the number of these cells will actually scale to their correct size so that you get the same final outcome with different numbers of cells.

222
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:19,500
But the most amazing thing is that when you make these cells absolutely gigantic so that only one cell is big enough to make the whole lumen, what it will do is it will no longer cooperate with other cells.

223
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,500
One cell will bend around itself making the exact same lumen.

224
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Now, the incredible thing about that is this is a different molecular mechanism.

225
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
This was cell-to-cell communication.

226
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
This is cytoskeletal bending.

227
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:46,500
So what happens is that this is a kind of top-down causation where in service of a large-scale anatomical spec, meaning having the correct lumen, you can call up different molecular mechanisms to get the job done.

228
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:58,500
So this, again, is sticking with this theme of intelligence as the ability to handle novelty in terms of getting to where you're going from diverse starting positions with perturbations, both external and internal.

229
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
You know, your own parts are changing.

230
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Can you still do what you need to do?

231
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
And all of this is described in some of these papers.

232
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,500
And then the final thing is that your walkthrough morphospace doesn't even have to be the same path.

233
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
So here, for example, here's a frog.

234
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Frogs normally do not regenerate their legs.

235
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
As I'll tell you momentarily, we have figured out a way to make them regenerate their legs.

236
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,500
And when they do, so this is a pretty good frog leg regeneration.

237
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
You can see here, it's got the toes, the toenails, the webbing.

238
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I mean, everything's good.

239
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:36,500
But in fact, the way it got here is not at all how frogs normally regenerate their limbs, normally develop their limbs.

240
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
So normal frog limb morphogenesis is here.

241
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,500
You make these things and then you sort of make that, you kill off the cells in the middle to make the paddle.

242
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
This grows in a completely different way.

243
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
You've got the middle, this kind of middle stalk here with the toenail, and then the toes sort of come off to the side.

244
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It looks much more like a plant.

245
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,500
So it takes a different path through morphospace, but it ends up in the same place.

246
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:07,500
So all of this is back to illustrating some of these amazing abilities of the cells to navigate.

247
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And so one very canonical example of this that we discovered a few years ago is this.

248
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
So here's a tadpole.

249
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Here's the gut, the brain, the nostrils, and the eyes here.

250
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
This tadpole needs to become a frog.

251
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
In order for a tadpole face to be a frog face, things have to move.

252
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
So the jaws have to move, the eyes have to move forward, everything has to move.

253
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,500
And it used to be thought that this process was hardwired because if you're a standard tadpole and you want to be a standard frog,

254
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
all you have to remember is which direction and by how much every piece of the face moves.

255
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
What we did, and we suspected that there was more intelligence to this process than that.

256
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
And so we did an experiment.

257
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
We created so-called Picasso frogs.

258
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
And so these are tadpoles in which everything is messed up.

259
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,500
The eyes on the side of the head, the jaws are off to the side and the nostrils are too far back.

260
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I mean, everything is in the wrong position.

261
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,500
And we found that these animals still largely make pretty normal frogs because all of these pieces will move in novel paths.

262
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,500
In fact, sometimes they go too far and have to double back to give you a normal frog face.

263
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,500
So what the genetics gives you is not some hardwired system that always moves in the same way.

264
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,500
What it specifies is a really interesting error minimization machine that however you start it off,

265
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,500
obviously with some limits, will try to minimize the error and get to the correct final shape.

266
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
If we had a robotic swarm, a collection of robots that was able to do this,

267
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
we would call this a prize-winning example of collective intelligence,

268
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
but we don't have such a technology yet.

269
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
So we started trying to understand this process.

270
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
How does all this work?

271
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:49,500
To the standard feed-forward kind of open-loop process of developmental biology that you would read about in class,

272
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,500
where there are genes, they make proteins, the proteins interact via some physics and chemistry,

273
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
and then there's this emergent outcome.

274
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:03,500
We add to this these feedback loops whereby this is actually a homeostatic system.

275
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:13,500
If that anatomy is disrupted in some way by injury, by mutations, by teratogens, by parasites, whatever,

276
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
then these feedback loops will kick in to try to minimize error.

277
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
The cells will do what they can to try to get back to the correct shape.

278
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Think about your thermostat. It's a basic homeostatic circuit.

279
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Now, on the one hand, this is pretty expected.

280
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Biologists know all about feedback loops and so on.

281
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,500
On the other hand, there are two kind of weird and unusual things here.

282
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,500
The first is that every homeostatic process has to have a set point.

283
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:45,500
So if you're going to try to get back to where you need to be, you have to remember where the right position is.

284
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
You have to store a set point.

285
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,500
We're used to thinking about scalars, single numbers as set points, so temperature, pH, things like that.

286
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
But in this case, the set point is some sort of a large-scale geometry.

287
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,500
It's a descriptor of some kind of coarse-grained descriptor of an anatomy.

288
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
So it's a complex data structure.

289
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,500
And in general, biologists don't love to think about goal-directed processes.

290
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,500
The idea is there's supposed to be emergence and kind of emergent complexity.

291
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,500
But this idea that things are working towards a goal the way that any navigational system fundamentally does

292
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,500
is really not something that is very comfortable, certainly, for molecular biology.

293
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
So how would something like this work?

294
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:34,500
How could we have a navigating system that can have goals in anatomical space?

295
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
And so here's where we start to think about bioelectricity,

296
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:45,500
because our best example of a mechanism that allows us to navigate space towards goals is the brain.

297
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,500
And in the brain, we know roughly what the architecture looks like.

298
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
There are cells that communicate with other cells and networks.

299
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
These cells have ion channels.

300
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
So these are little proteins that help set a voltage to the cell.

301
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
And that voltage may or may not be communicated to its neighbors through these little gap junctions.

302
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,500
These are like electrical synapses that allow electrical information to pass back and forth.

303
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
And so that's the hardware of the brain.

304
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,500
And what that hardware enables is a kind of software that, among other things, navigates spaces.

305
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
So here's a zebrafish.

306
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,500
This is a movie taken by this group here that shows all the electrical activity in the living zebrafish brain.

307
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,500
And so the commitment of neuroscience is that if we understood how to decode this information,

308
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,500
we would be able to know what the cognitive content of this brain was.

309
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,500
So the memories, the preferences, the goals, whatever else the system was going to do, we should be able to decode it.

310
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
So this is that cycle that's called neural decoding.

311
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,500
We should be able to understand what all these patterns mean.

312
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Well, it turns out that this is not just for brains.

313
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
This is an extremely ancient system.

314
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
All the cells in your body have ion channels.

315
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Most cells have gap junctions with each other.

316
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
And what we might be able to do is just like neuroscientists,

317
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
we might be able to extend this whole scheme to ask,

318
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
what are your tissues thinking about at any point in time?

319
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Specifically, to read the electrical.

320
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
So this is a time lapse of an early frog embryo.

321
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
The colors are a fluorescent dye reporting voltage,

322
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,500
the same way that we did here that was done here with these zebrafish.

323
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,500
And we might be able to decode this information to ask,

324
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
what are the targets in anatomical amorphous space?

325
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
What is this thing going to build?

326
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,500
And so there's this amazing isomorphism between the story of the brain,

327
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,500
where you've got the hardware and the software and there's various experiences

328
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
and various other ways that this software gets modified.

329
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,500
The hardware basically, it just gets built in development.

330
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,500
And what the brain does is it controls muscles to move your body in three-dimensional space.

331
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Now, that's a pretty cool trick. Where did it learn this trick?

332
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Well, evolutionarily, this is exactly the same as something that was going on

333
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
long before brains appeared, which is this exact same system,

334
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,500
but it used to be for moving the body configuration in amorphous space.

335
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Before there were nerves and muscles,

336
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,500
cells needed to talk to each other and process information to get around in amorphous space.

337
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,500
And so we've argued in this paper that basically neural electricity

338
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,500
is just an evolutionary pivot across spaces from amorphous space to three-dimensional space

339
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,500
of a very ancient system for processing information long before brains arose.

340
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,500
So in my group, we were thinking about this and we asked this question,

341
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:46,500
okay, if that's how it works, could we make some tools to read and write this electrical information

342
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,500
and to really understand how it's navigating that shape-change space?

343
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:58,500
So we developed some of the first tools to read and write information into non-brain tissues.

344
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,500
So of course, these dyes, so these are voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes

345
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,500
that report all the electrical conversations that these cells are having with each other.

346
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
So here's a time-lapse of these cells figuring out who's going to be left, right, dorsal, ventral.

347
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,500
So all of this is, you're looking at these cells having those conversations.

348
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,500
We do a lot of computational modeling to ask, okay, given where the ions are going,

349
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
how can we predict these voltages?

350
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I'm going to show you two patterns.

351
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Here's a time-lapse. It happens to be grayscale, but it's the exact same idea.

352
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Here's a time-lapse of a frog embryo putting its face together.

353
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
And what you will see, and this is one frame out of that video,

354
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,500
what you will see is that this is something we call the electric face discovered by my colleague, Danny Adams.

355
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:49,500
When she was in my group doing this profiling, she found that, here's a particular frame from that video

356
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,500
where you can see the animal's right eye, the mouth, the placodes.

357
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,500
All of this is already demarcated before the genes start to come on and really pattern the face.

358
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,500
This is a bioelectric pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like.

359
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
And I'm showing you this one because it's so simple.

360
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
It literally looks like a face, right?

361
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,500
There are other patterns that are much more complex that you can't really just sort of visually decode.

362
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
But this one is very clear.

363
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
This is the memory of what a tadpole face is going to look like.

364
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,500
And if you move this, if you disrupt this electrical pattern,

365
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,500
the gene expression will change and the organogenesis will change.

366
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
And I'll show you examples of that momentarily.

367
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,500
So this is an endogenous pattern that is required for normal development.

368
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,500
In fact, human channelopathies of the human patients that have craniofacial defects

369
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
often have mutations in ion channels that screw up this pattern.

370
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
So that's a normal pattern.

371
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Here's a pathological pattern.

372
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
We've put in a human oncogene.

373
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
These cells will make a tumor.

374
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
But even before the tumor becomes apparent,

375
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,500
you can already see this bioelectrical, aberrant bioelectrical signature of these cells

376
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
basically disconnecting from the rest of the tissue

377
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,500
and going to their unicellular ancient behavior mode

378
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
where the rest of the body is just environment as far as they're concerned.

379
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
So one set of tools is to track these bioelectrical changes.

380
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Now here's another important set of tools.

381
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,500
To actually start to be able to write new information into it.

382
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
And the way we do that, we don't use any applied electric fields.

383
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
There are no waves.

384
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
There are no magnets.

385
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
There's no electromagnetic radiation.

386
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
What we do is we do exactly what neuroscientists do,

387
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:32,500
which is we modify the endogenous mechanisms by which cells establish electrical signals.

388
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,500
So either ion channels, we can open them, we can close them,

389
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,500
we can use light or drugs to do that.

390
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
And the gap junctions, the electrical synapses.

391
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
So we can determine which cells talk to each other's cells

392
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
by opening and closing these little gap junctions.

393
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,500
It's very telling that all of the tools of neuroscience work in other cell types.

394
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Basically the tools can't tell the difference, right?

395
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,500
This distinction between neuroscience and other cells in your body is completely artificial

396
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
and it's a consequence of humans trying to parse the world.

397
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Nature doesn't obey that distinction.

398
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
So what can you do with this?

399
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
I've been talking about this electrical information.

400
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
What does it actually do?

401
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Well, here are a few examples.

402
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
One thing you can do is you can take this tadpole

403
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500
and I've shown you the electric face and so we asked the question,

404
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,500
okay, now that we know that there's a particular voltage state that kickstarts eye development,

405
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
could we simply reproduce that somewhere else?

406
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,500
So we took an ion channel RNA that we knew was going to set the same voltage state.

407
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,500
We injected it into precursor cells that are going to give rise to the gut

408
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
and sure enough, those cells can form a complete eye.

409
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,500
The eyes that are formed will have all the right layers, retina,

410
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,500
optic nerve, all that lens and they can be formed anywhere.

411
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,500
They can be formed anywhere in the body as long as the cells get the right pattern

412
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
that tells them what organ to make.

413
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Now notice two very interesting things here.

414
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
One is that this instruction is highly modular.

415
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,500
We provided a very small piece of information, just a voltage pattern.

416
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,500
We certainly did not give it all the information needed to specify an eye.

417
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Eyes have many cell types, they're very complex.

418
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,500
We have no idea how to micromanage the creation of an eye.

419
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,500
But what we provided was kind of a subroutine call, a signal that says build an eye here

420
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
and the cells do.

421
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
That's the first thing.

422
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
The second amazing thing is that there are two levels of instruction here.

423
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,500
One is us instructing the cells build an eye.

424
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,500
But here what you can see is this is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere

425
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,500
and the blue cells are the ones that carry this ion channel that we put in.

426
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
There's not enough of them to make a good lens.

427
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
So what they've done is recruit their neighbors.

428
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
This is why at the very beginning I pitched this idea that frog allotls might have legs

429
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
that consist also of frog cells.

430
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Why would frog cells build a leg when they normally don't?

431
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,500
It's because cells have the ability to instruct each other about what to build.

432
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
So these cells right here, they've been told to make an eye, but there's not enough of them

433
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
and they know that and so they recruit a bunch of their neighbors,

434
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
these brown cells that we never touched.

435
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
These cells are completely wild type.

436
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,500
And yet they're participating in making this ectopic lens out in the tail of a tadpole.

437
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,500
So there's this amazing ability to instruct and for the cells to then instruct each other.

438
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Now, what else can we make?

439
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Well, we can make using the same methodology by manipulating these ion channels.

440
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,500
We can make odysses, which are balance organs like inner ear type of organs.

441
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,500
We can make complete beating hearts, so ectopic hearts.

442
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
We can make extra forebrain.

443
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,500
And then you can ask if these animals are any smarter than the normal tadpoles.

444
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
We can make ectopic limbs.

445
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,500
So you can see here all kinds of extra legs that we can form.

446
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
And we can even make fins.

447
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
This last one's kind of weird because tadpoles, of course, aren't supposed to have fins.

448
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
We'll get to that momentarily.

449
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,500
What you can see is that by changing the bioelectrical pattern using manipulation of ion channels,

450
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
you can tell this collective where to go in morphospace,

451
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
meaning what types of organs they should be building.

452
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
You're not micromanaging the specifics each step that they take.

453
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
They figure that out on the road.

454
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
In fact, we have no idea how to do that for any of these complex organs,

455
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
but you can indicate regions about where it is that they should be going.

456
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
And this has biomedical implications.

457
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
So frogs, I told you, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs.

458
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
So if a leg is amputated 45 days later, there's nothing.

459
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,500
What we've done is come up with a drug cocktail, a target ion channels,

460
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
that induces leg regeneration.

461
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,500
And so you can see here, 45 days later, there's already a nice leg forming.

462
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
The leg is touch sensitive.

463
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
It's motile.

464
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
It's functional.

465
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,500
It has a pretty good, eventually it has a pretty good final pattern.

466
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,500
And so we're in the process of translating that to mammals.

467
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Hopefully this will work.

468
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,500
I have to do a disclosure here because this is a commercial venture now.

469
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Morphosuticals, Inc., is a spin-off between myself and Dave Kaplan,

470
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,500
where David's lab makes these bioreactors that provide,

471
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,500
that have an aqueous environment for the wound.

472
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
And then we provide the ion channel and other types of payload in there

473
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,500
to hopefully get leg regeneration in mammals.

474
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,500
So this is a clinically relevant approach.

475
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,500
So I want to switch from this now to show you another kind of amazing example

476
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
of what bioelectricity does.

477
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
This is, these are plenarium.

478
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
So I've already told you they have incredible amounts of regenerative ability.

479
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Because of that, they're actually immortal.

480
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
There's no such thing as an old plenarium.

481
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
They do not age.

482
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,500
So these animals pretty much go on forever.

483
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,500
And that's because of this incredible ability to continuously replenish and regenerate

484
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
to keep their pattern perfect.

485
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,500
So I want to show you an example.

486
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
This is a plenarium, one head, one tail.

487
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,500
You cut off the head and the tail, you got this middle fragment.

488
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
We check the gene expression.

489
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Yup, anterior genes are in the head.

490
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
No anterior genes in the tail.

491
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
That's fine.

492
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
And 100% of the time it makes this normal offspring.

493
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
So one head, one tail.

494
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
It regenerates.

495
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Now here, what I'm going to show you is that here's a plenarium, one head, one tail.

496
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Again, anterior genes where they're supposed to be.

497
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,500
But when I cut this guy, he makes a two-headed form.

498
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
And I just told you that this process was very reliable.

499
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Why in the world would a one-headed animal make a two-headed?

500
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
And this isn't Photoshop.

501
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
These are real live animals.

502
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
So here are heads at both ends.

503
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Well, it's because in the meantime, we found that there's an electrical circuit that actually helps this tissue remember how many heads they're supposed to be.

504
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,500
And what you can do in the meantime is take this one-headed animal and you can look at the electrical pattern.

505
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,500
The electrical pattern says one head, one tail.

506
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,500
And we can alter that electrical pattern to say, no, you're going to be, a proper worm should have two heads.

507
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Now you can see it's kind of a mess.

508
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
The technology is still being worked out, but it's very clear.

509
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
We can impose this pattern that says two heads.

510
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,500
And when you cut that animal, boom, that's what the cells make.

511
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Now this is really critical to understand.

512
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,500
This bi-electric pattern is not a map of this two-headed guy.

513
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:06,500
This bi-electrical pattern is a map of this one-headed animal into which we incepted a false memory of what plenaria are supposed to look like.

514
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
And they sit there.

515
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,500
This memory sits there, latent, doing nothing until you injure them.

516
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Once you injure this animal, that is when they will, the cells will pay attention to this pattern and they will go ahead and make a two-headed animal.

517
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:26,500
So if you're wondering where counterfactual, where the ability to consider counterfactuals came from, this kind of mental time travel where you can consider things,

518
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:36,500
have memories and have predictions about things that are not happening right now, this is perhaps the sort of basal precursor of that ability in morphospace.

519
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:43,500
This animal has a representation in morphospace of where it will go if it gets injured at a future time.

520
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
Not what's happening right now.

521
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
This is not where I am right now.

522
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
This is where I'm going to go if I get injured.

523
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Now why do I keep calling this thing a memory?

524
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I keep calling it a memory because if you take these two-headed animals and simply recut them again in plain water, no more manipulations of any kind,

525
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,500
they will continue to rebuild two-headed animals forever as far as we can tell.

526
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:11,500
The question of how many heads a planarian has is not strictly determined by the genome because we didn't touch the genome.

527
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
The genome is wild type.

528
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,500
There's nothing.

529
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
There's no genomic editing here.

530
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
That information is sitting in an electric circuit.

531
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,500
The default, the genetically set default is one head, but it's easily changed.

532
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
And in fact, we can now, well now I say it's easy.

533
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
It took us 10 years to figure it out.

534
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
But in fact, it's quite readily done.

535
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
And in fact, you can set it back.

536
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
You can set it back to being one-headed.

537
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
By again, targeting the information in that electrical circuit.

538
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,500
The first time I showed these data, somebody stood up at our conferences and said,

539
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
well, that's impossible.

540
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Those animals can't exist.

541
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,500
So I always bring this video so everybody can see what the second and third generation of these guys look like.

542
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
So this has all the properties of memory.

543
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
It's long-term stable.

544
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,500
It's rewritable.

545
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
It's got a little bit of labialty.

546
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
So it's rewritable.

547
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
It's got latency or conditional recall.

548
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,500
So you can have a single body can have memories of why a planarian is supposed to look like that aren't true right now.

549
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
And it has discrete possible outcomes.

550
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:15,500
So one of the things that we're doing now is really trying to integrate models of the physiological state space of this animal.

551
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Where the circuit, the electrical circuit has a state space where there are attractors that correspond to one-heads, two-heads, no-heads, and so on.

552
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:35,500
And merge that with models of connectionist artificial neural network type of processes where we already know how to build networks that, for example, do pattern completion.

553
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
And they have a memory of what the pattern should be.

554
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
And if part of that pattern is missing, they can reproduce it and so on.

555
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
This is all part of one problem.

556
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:50,500
And the key is tying it all together with these quantitative models that show how this electrical circuit navigates morpho space.

557
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Now, what I've shown you is that you can tweak that electrical circuit to find an attractor that has two heads instead of one-heads.

558
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
But what else is there?

559
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
What else does this space actually have?

560
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Let's explore that a little bit.

561
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Well, the first thing you find is that, well, it contains head shapes of other species.

562
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:13,500
So what you can do is you can take this planarian, cut off the head, perturb the electrical circuit for about 48 hours, then let them let it go.

563
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,500
And when it finally settles down into the correct attractor, it doesn't always find the right one.

564
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:26,500
So some percent of the time it goes back to normal and makes this nice triangular head from Dderotacephala.

565
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
But sometimes it'll make a round head like this S-Mediterania.

566
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Sometimes it'll make a flat head like this P-Felina.

567
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
In fact, this is stochastic process.

568
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:43,500
The frequency of these is proportional to the evolutionary distance between the real species that are being mimicked here.

569
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
And again, no changes to the genome.

570
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
There's nothing genetically wrong with these animals.

571
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,500
But you can you can find these other attractors and it's not just for head shape.

572
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
It's the shape of the brain.

573
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,500
The distribution of the stem cells become just like these other species.

574
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,500
And it's about there about 100 to 150 million years distant.

575
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Okay, so so you can find those attractors with the exact same genetics.

576
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:12,500
In fact, you can find shapes that don't that that don't correspond to any real planarian as far as we know.

577
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,500
You can make these crazy spiky forms.

578
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
You can make a different symmetry type.

579
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,500
So this kind of cylindrical radial symmetry instead of a flat bilateral symmetry.

580
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,500
You can make combinations where where there's a flat worm with a big tube growing out into the third dimension.

581
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
And again, nothing wrong with the hardware.

582
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
There's no no no mutations.

583
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Another one with the genome.

584
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,500
It's exploring the it's bio electrically exploring the space of where it can be.

585
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:44,500
And so the idea is what we're doing now is is building these kind of full stack models that they're trying to integrate all the way from the molecular

586
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
information about what channels do you have to work with?

587
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,500
So the hardware all the way up through the physiology of, okay, well, what does this mean for the voltage states across the tissue to?

588
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Well, what does that mean for the identity of different organs along the primary axis to what kind of algorithm is this whole thing?

589
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Is this whole thing implementing such that we could actually understand the algorithm and intervene, right?

590
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
So so make make changes.

591
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:19,500
And for this we have we have all kinds of computational platforms such as such as this, which allows you to load up electrical circuits into cells and then simulate

592
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:26,500
simulate tissue and organ level dynamics to understand what the large scale computations are.

593
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:33,500
And so so just as a simple example, again, of why this is why this is useful and what the what the practical implications of this are.

594
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,500
We use this the strategy to find a technique for repairing birth defects.

595
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,500
So here's a tadpole, here's the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.

596
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,500
If it's exposed to nicotine or various other teratogens, you can see there's massive defects.

597
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,500
So the brain is basically gone.

598
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,500
The forebrain is basically gone, the midbrain and high brain are damaged.

599
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:00,500
And so what we did is we built this this bio electrical model that tries to explain how does the brain know what its size and shape should be.

600
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:07,500
And in cases where, for example, here this is even worse than a teratogen, we mutated a key neurogenesis gene is a gene called notch.

601
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
So this gene is mutated.

602
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
You can see the forebrain is just gone, the midbrain and hindbrain are a bubble.

603
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
These animals have no behavior.

604
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
They just lay there doing nothing.

605
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
It's a very strong defect.

606
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:25,500
What we found what we did was we asked that model, which ion channels would we have to open and close to get back to the correct bio electrical memory of what a what a correct brain should be?

607
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Basically, how do I find my way back in morphospace to what a correct brain should be?

608
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
And the model made a prediction.

609
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,500
We tested that prediction.

610
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:39,500
It happens to be an already human approved set of drugs that can do this.

611
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,500
And sure enough, when we did it, there you go.

612
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:49,500
The brain structure comes back, their brain gene expression comes back and their IQ comes back.

613
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:59,500
So if you actually test them for their learning rates, their indistinguishable from controls, even though they've been exposed to teratogens or they have this really nasty genetic defect, some problems and not all problems.

614
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,500
But some problems can be fixed at the level of software.

615
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Sometimes when your hardware isn't quite right, you can make up for it in software by having a better navigation policy through morphospace.

616
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,500
So you're not dead and you're not automatically dead in the water if your hardware is a little wonky.

617
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:24,500
So what that means is we ought to be able to create these pipelines to to and we've already we've already started to help design electroseuticals.

618
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:34,500
That is, you have some particular problem and you can ask the simulation, what type of channel meaning what drug can I use to get back to my correct bioelectrical pattern.

619
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Fundamentally, this is really the question of how do we exploit this electrical interface that these cells are exposed into us, right?

620
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Just like neurons do and people using electrodes and optogenetics and everything else to control brains using this electrical interface.

621
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,500
We can do exactly the same thing to help guide their navigation through morphospace.

622
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:03,500
It's a new way of to think about getting making drugs for various disorders of development of injury and cancer and so on.

623
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Okay, so so I want to just just say a couple of things before I wrap up here.

624
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:16,500
I want to say a couple of things about the scaling of cognition in this whole in this whole business and then show you some some novel synthetic living machines.

625
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:27,500
So the first thing I want to point out is that we've been I started out by saying that thinking about fixed standard animals is kind of limiting.

626
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:34,500
And that's because the border between self and world is is is flexible.

627
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
It can change.

628
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:46,500
So so again, here is a and what what unifies all all of these different kinds of weird intelligences are solving problems in morphospace and in physiological space and so on.

629
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Is their ability to pursue goals meaning to pursue the right region of that morphospace.

630
00:52:51,500 --> 00:53:00,500
So this kind of creature a single cell can have pretty humble little tiny goals right so so on the scale of some number of microns.

631
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,500
It can it can pursue state physiological states a whole metabolic states and so on.

632
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:11,500
But these cells can cooperate and when they cooperate when they cooperate they can pursue very large goals.

633
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:17,500
So building a limb is a huge goal not no individual cell knows what a limb is or how it can count fingers or anything like that.

634
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:28,500
But the collective sure can the collective will absolutely pursue this particular region of morphospace despite all kinds of perturbations and when does it stop it stops when it when it reaches that area.

635
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,500
When it gets to where it's going and the limb is correct that's when it stops.

636
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,500
So there's a scaling of goals here now that happens during evolution.

637
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,500
And as you as you'll see in a minute it also can can happen right in front of your eyes.

638
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,500
But the reverse process we're quite familiar with and that's cancer.

639
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:56,500
So these here are glioblastoma cells human glioblastoma cells and culture cells can defect from this kind of from this kind of situation once they electrically isolate from their neighbors.

640
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:04,500
And then as far as they're concerned they're back to they're back to this scenario the the rest of the body is just external environment to them their their goals are little tiny goals.

641
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
What are the goals of single cell systems.

642
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Well for every cell wants to become two cells and it wants to go wherever life is good and that's metastasis.

643
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:20,500
And so that process that shrinking and growing and in fact these cancer cells are not any more selfish than your normal body cells is just that the self is smaller.

644
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:31,500
A lot of work in game theory of cancer that talks about selfishness and lack of cooperation and not any more selfish is just that the self towards which they work is just little little tiny self is very small.

645
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Whereas here the electrical network is able to bind and if people want I have all sorts of stories about what exactly happens when they bind together but I'll skip that for now for reasons of time.

646
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:58,500
When when individual cells bind into networks those networks have a greater ability to to store memory to have anticipation of future events to perceive spatial spatial kinds of signals in their environment and so the scale grows.

647
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:11,500
And the the biomedical implication of this is that if this were if this were true you should be able to reverse cancer by artificially reconnecting cells to their neighbors.

648
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:17,500
In fact that's what we've that's what we've done so so when you have this this nasty oncogene you can see that in red it's still here.

649
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:27,500
You can prevent the tumor from happening by putting in an ion channel that forces these cells to remain in the right bio electrical state despite the fact that the oncogene is trying to disassociate them.

650
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:38,500
And if you do that the physiology trumps the genetics that will it will the cells will remain even though the oncogene is strongly expressed the cells will remain making nice muscle and skin and whatever else it's supposed to make.

651
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:46,500
So this this this idea of looking at the scaling of the self and the scaling of these goals has real practical implications.

652
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:56,500
And in in my in my model one of the things that it allows the framework to do is to compare directly very diverse intelligences.

653
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:07,500
So any intelligence be it evolved designed some sort of hybrid some sort of alien thing and maybe saw pure software it doesn't matter any agent has a study that can pursue goals.

654
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,500
You can simply plot the size of those goals so so how big are they in space and time right you might have.

655
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:24,500
You might have a tick that only cares about local butyrate concentration and that's all that it's ever going to care about and so it has a tiny little cognitive light cone that allows it to pursue these tiny little goals.

656
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Any more you might have a dog which has a bigger cognitive light cone and has some pretty good memory going backwards as a little bit of anticipation potential forwards.

657
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:45,500
It's never going to care about what happens two towns over three months from now it's impossible that its goal space is simply not that big right and then you can have humans which uniquely perhaps have have a cognitive light cone that's bigger than their own lifespan.

658
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:56,500
So the the human can comprehend and pursue goals that are that are guaranteed not achievable in your lifetime and that for all I know that may drive some interesting psychological pressures that that humans face.

659
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:13,500
But this idea that we are all made of a collective of agents each of these agents is solving problems in its own space and within that space there are differently scaled goals some some very very very very modest and some some some massive you know some humans are working for world peace and and

660
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:25,500
you know these kinds of very complex very large long term things so the idea is that in this multi scale system what happens is that higher levels bend the option space for their subunits so.

661
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:41,500
So so in if you've got a morphogenetic space that that that has attractors for different head shapes that's because those those by electrical states distort the space of gene expression for their cells such that all the cells need to do is go down their

662
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:53,500
concentration gradients the way they normally do they don't have to know where they're going but in fact they end up at a very particular morphological outcome because because the higher level has already distorted that space

663
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:07,500
and so they're all kinds of interesting work to be done looking at mathematical formalisms from relativity theory and from some other disciplines to look at how and how that works and in fact all that's happening here is the scaling up of goals.

664
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:19,500
So once you have a single cell that can do this cycle this this test measure act test compare act kind of cycle let's say for example for keeping pH once you start connecting cells into electrical networks.

665
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:32,500
Now everything scales up their goals are bigger their memories are bigger the the ability to act or bigger this is what evolution is is is doing it's constantly scaling up these these homeostatic units and it's actually.

666
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,500
Pivoting them through different spaces so very simple kinds of organisms.

667
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:53,500
All they could do is traverse metabolic space to keep alive, but eventually that works up to physiological spaces then gene expression becomes a thing and so they could work in transcriptional spaces, then multi the complex anatomy so so more for space and eventually when

668
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:01,500
you're in behavioral space and who knows what other spaces there are linguistic so just to close off in the last few minutes.

669
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,500
I want to I want to show you an example of novelty.

670
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:14,500
So I've been I've been talking about intelligence and the idea that these all of these different different systems are able to handle novel conditions I want to show you an extreme example of that.

671
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:33,500
So this is this is work that Joshua bongard lab and we are doing in in this new institute and we wanted to ask a simple question well a set of questions one is how much how much real time plasticity really is there I mean we've seen that you can get you can get pretty far away from the genomic default but what

672
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:46,500
what what else can these cells do and in fact when we look at development normal development to what extent is it is it fooling us what extent are we basically lulled into thinking that because acorns make oak trees and frogs eggs make make

673
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:58,500
frogs to what extent are we really fooled into thinking that that's basically all that they can do and so we started asking about you know what what might the default competencies of some of these cells and tissues be okay.

674
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:15,500
And so so what we did was was was this simple experiment just going to pause pause this here what we did was a simple experiment where I'm and this all the biology was done by Doug blackeston in my group and the computer science you're about to see was done by Sam Kreegman.

675
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:28,500
What we did was we took some skin cells off of a frog embryo and we put those skin cells by themselves in a dish so we didn't add anything there are no nano materials there are no genetic circuits being added there are no weird trans genes or chemicals.

676
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:37,500
What we do is subtract what do we subtract we subtract all this other stuff we subtract all their normal neighbors that are normally instructing these cells as to what to do.

677
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:50,500
We give them a chance to reboot their multi-cellularity now it's all sorts of things they could do so so they could just go and die they could spread out and get away from each other they could form a flat to a two dimensional monolayer the way that cell culture does.

678
01:00:50,500 --> 01:01:04,500
There are many things that that could happen and so so here's what happens we we dissociate these cells we put them in this little little depression well overnight they sort of come together like this and then they form this little round ball this the flashes you're seeing is calcium

679
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:20,500
signaling so it's a calcium sensitive diet it they start to sort of signal to each other and what they form is something we call Xenobots now why Xenobots because Xenopus lavas is the name of the frog and and it's a bio robotics platform so the way it's the way they're

680
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:29,500
swimming is they have little hairs on their surface these hairs called cilia are normally used to redistribute mucus on them across the body of the frog.

681
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:40,500
Here what they've done is they've sort of they've learned to row and so and so the cells the silly are moving in this thing is propelling itself they can go in circles they can go straight back and forth like this.

682
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Here you can see a bunch of them in their various this is just tracking data so so these two are interacting these are sitting there doing nothing this one's going on kind of a longer journey.

683
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Here here's one navigating a maze this is still water there's no water movement in here.

684
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:07,500
So it moves along it takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall and then at some point for reasons that nobody nobody can predict yet it decides to turn around and go back where it came from.

685
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:15,500
So it again goes along does not need to bump into anything to know that it could take a corner here and then at this point.

686
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,500
Turns around turns around and goes and goes back.

687
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:30,500
Now, one of the things you can see with this calcium signaling is that they're very active. This looks very brain like this looks very similar to that zebrafish kind of signaling that that I showed you before, except there's no neurons here.

688
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:36,500
This is just skin. Everything that you just saw was 100% skin cells there's no there's no brain is no nervous system.

689
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:44,500
So not only, you know, so who knows we're still experimenting with like what what might they be saying to each other when they're when they're doing this.

690
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,500
But what one thing you could you can see they do a couple of interesting things one thing they can do is regenerate.

691
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,500
So here's here's one that was basically cut in half.

692
01:02:52,500 --> 01:03:01,500
And now think about think about the force look at that hinge as it as it folds up about the force that it takes to clamp something shut from 180 degree position.

693
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,500
It folds up right to be back to its to its zen about shape.

694
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:11,500
And one of the things we started thinking about is how can we how can we predict what this kind of system is going to do.

695
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
I mean, nobody knew what what they were going to do.

696
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:19,500
So so Josh Vanguard lab started modeling their their behavior in this kind of simulation.

697
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:26,500
The simulation can actually tell you what the behavior of different shaped bots is going to be and then you can go ahead and microscope them or do various things.

698
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:32,500
You can see the patterns that this is just a carmine powder on the bottom of the dish and these guys sweep it along as they go.

699
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,500
So you can see all the cool patterns that they make as they're navigating.

700
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,500
But but here's something here's something interesting.

701
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:47,500
If you if you simulate them in an environment with a bunch of loose bricks, what you see is that they tend to they tend to collect them into little piles.

702
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
And so what what might be the significance of that?

703
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Well, it turns out the real bots do exactly that.

704
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:58,500
And if you provide them, so these are zenobots provided with a bunch of loose skin cells.

705
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,500
So these white dots are just loose skin cells hanging around.

706
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,500
And what you'll see is that these the zenobots will run around.

707
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
They will collect either together or individually.

708
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,500
They'll make little piles.

709
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:13,500
And because this is an agent material, right, these cells are not passive.

710
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,500
They once the cells are collected into a pile, what do they make?

711
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,500
They make zenobots.

712
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
So this is kinematic self replication.

713
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,500
These bots make copies of themselves from the loose material in the dish.

714
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:29,500
We've made it impossible for them to replicate the way that normally frogs reproduce.

715
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,500
So they can't do that.

716
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,500
But within 48 hours, they show us that there's another way to do this that as far as we know, no other animal uses.

717
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:41,500
It's basically Von Neumann's dream, which is machines that will go out and build copies of themselves from parts that they find laying around.

718
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,500
That's what's going on here.

719
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,500
These zenobots build the next generation of zenobots out of these loose cells.

720
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
When those mature, I guess what they do, they run around do exactly the same thing.

721
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
You get the next generation and then the next generation after that.

722
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:58,500
Now, there's no strong heredity here yet, as far as we know.

723
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,500
And the reason it works here is really critical.

724
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,500
The reason it works is the exact same reason that we were able to make zenobots in the first place.

725
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,500
Because these cells are not passive Legos.

726
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:13,500
They are an agent material that once they get together in a particular group, they know what to do.

727
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,500
They have an innate preference to make bots.

728
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
So that's why these bots are able to make new bots.

729
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:25,500
So here's kind of the amazing thing about it is that same genome.

730
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:29,500
So if you were to sequence a zenobot, all you would ever see is the Zenopus-Levis genome.

731
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
You'd have no idea that it was any different.

732
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,500
That same genome can do at least two different life histories.

733
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
It can do this.

734
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:43,500
So normal Zenopus stages and then normal tappel behavior.

735
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Or it can do this.

736
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Here's an early zenobot.

737
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Here's a zenobot at about two months.

738
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,500
It has a developmental sequence.

739
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,500
It's turning into something.

740
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
What is that?

741
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,500
I have no idea what that is.

742
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,500
There's never been any zenobots before.

743
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,500
So it's some kind of novel developmental stage.

744
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,500
And eventually they have these kinds of behaviors.

745
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
So we're still working out.

746
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
We don't know how much cognition they actually have.

747
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,500
Can they learn?

748
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Can they have preferences?

749
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,500
What do they react to?

750
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,500
We don't know.

751
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,500
We're still figuring that out.

752
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,500
But the amazing thing about it is that for most animals,

753
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,500
the way they navigate both physical and anatomical space,

754
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,500
when you ask why do they have a certain number of legs,

755
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
a certain color, certain behaviors,

756
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,500
the answer is always,

757
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,500
well, because for millions of years,

758
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,500
the ancestors were selected for this or that

759
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
and everybody else died off and now this is what you have.

760
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,500
Well, there's never been any zenobots.

761
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
And there's never been selection to be a good zenobot.

762
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,500
All of this is created on the fly.

763
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,500
This is what they do.

764
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,500
They create a coherent organism.

765
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,500
And by the way, if you ask what do skin cells normally want to do,

766
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
you might think that what they normally want to do

767
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,500
is to be this like passive two-dimensional layer

768
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
on the outside of an animal to keep out the bacteria.

769
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,500
That isn't what they want to do.

770
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500
That's what they're bullied into doing

771
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
by the instructive interactions with the rest of the cells.

772
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,500
If you don't have those cells,

773
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
this is what they're actually,

774
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
this is actually their default behavior.

775
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
So what evolution does is what bioengineers can

776
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
and will be doing is behavior shaping.

777
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,500
It's figuring out signals to get your agential material,

778
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
not passive, not a blank slate,

779
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
but your agential material to do whatever you want to do.

780
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,500
So I'm just going to close up here with a couple of thoughts.

781
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,500
This is just a kind of an overview of this framework

782
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
that we've been working on.

783
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,500
This kind of continuum of agency

784
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,500
across very diverse implementations.

785
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,500
The idea of scaling the boundaries of goals

786
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,500
for any particular system as a way to compare

787
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
radically different types of intelligences

788
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
in different spaces.

789
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Bioelectricity is a particular example.

790
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,500
It's not the only one.

791
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
I'm sure there are other ways to tell this story,

792
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
but bioelectricity is a really great way to look at

793
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,500
what is the cognitive medium of a collective intelligence

794
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,500
and it seems to be electricity in many cases.

795
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,500
And there are all kinds of implications for evolution,

796
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,500
including asking questions about where do these goals come from?

797
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,500
If it's not just selection, where in fact do they come from?

798
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,500
And so just to finish up,

799
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,500
I want to point out that one of the consequences

800
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,500
of the fact that biology can solve problems on the fly

801
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
and that it's incredibly interoperable

802
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,500
is that pretty much any combination of evolved material,

803
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
meaning cells or tissues or genes,

804
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,500
design materials, so smart nano materials,

805
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,500
all kinds of constructs, and software,

806
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,500
any combination of these is some viable creature.

807
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,500
And so when Darwin said Endless Form's most beautiful

808
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,500
being impressed with a variety of biology

809
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,500
that he was seeing around, that's just all of that.

810
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
Everything on Earth is a tiny corner

811
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
of this incredibly huge option space

812
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
which we're already beginning to explore.

813
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,500
So there are already cyborgs, humans with various implants,

814
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,500
both sensory and effectors.

815
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
People can run wheelchairs with their minds

816
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,500
and have all kinds of sensors attached to them.

817
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Hybrots, which are brains driving vehicles

818
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,500
instead of biological bodies.

819
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,500
People started a long time ago making chimeras,

820
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,500
so mules, horses and donkeys make mules.

821
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
So you can start to mix genetic material.

822
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,500
After that, people would make grafts and plants

823
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
and mix at the cellular level.

824
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Every combination, we are going to be living in a world

825
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
where we are surrounded by agents

826
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,500
that don't look like anything familiar

827
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
on the phylogenetic treatment.

828
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,500
This means that we have massive implications

829
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,500
for systems of ethics because the old traditional framework

830
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
where you look at something and you ask,

831
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
where did it come from?

832
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Would it come from a factory or was it natural?

833
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
And what does it look like?

834
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Does it look like a fish, an ape or a human

835
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
or something else?

836
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,500
Those kinds of touchstones are going to be completely useless

837
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,500
in deciding how to relate to these beings

838
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
that are going to be around us in terms of

839
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,500
what do we owe them, what can we expect of them,

840
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,500
all of these things.

841
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
We're not going to be able to rely on familiar categories

842
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,500
of where did it come from and how much like a human

843
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
does it look.

844
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
That's going to be gone.

845
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
We're not going to survive the next few decades.

846
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
So we are going to need to develop novel frameworks

847
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,500
because life is so good at navigating these spaces

848
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,500
that all of these things are going to be viable.

849
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
So I'll just close by saying that

850
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
all of this is discussed in great detail

851
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
in various papers.

852
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
Anybody just please email me and I'll send you everything.

853
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,500
I want to thank the various intelligent beings

854
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
that contributed to all the work I showed you.

855
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
So all of our postdocs, PhD students,

856
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,500
the model systems that we work with,

857
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
they do all the heavy lifting, all the slime molds

858
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,500
and the planarian tap molds and everything else.

859
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
And of course our funders.

860
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
And again, two disclosures.

861
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
So Morphosuticals is a company around

862
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
limb regeneration and fauna systems

863
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,500
is a company for Xenobots.

864
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
And that's it. Thank you so much.

865
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Thank you for listening.

866
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Thank you.
