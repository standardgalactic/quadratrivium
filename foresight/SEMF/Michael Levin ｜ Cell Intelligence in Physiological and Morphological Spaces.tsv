0	24000	Well, thank you so much. And I'm delighted to be here. Thank you for putting on such an amazing symposium and giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts with you in long form.
24500	40000	So what I'm going to talk about today is basically the fields of collective intelligence in unconventional spaces. And if anybody would like to get in touch with me afterwards, all of the primary papers, the software, everything else is here.
40500	56000	So I want to start by just showing one of my one of my heroes Alan Turing. We all know that he was a forefather of artificial intelligence, he was very interested in this idea of creating cognitive systems and various kinds of intelligence.
56500	70500	And this is this is this is well known. What's maybe less well known is that the same person was really interested in morphogenesis. He wrote one of the very early papers on on trying to understand self organizing chemical systems.
71000	87000	And you might wonder why it is that the same person would be interested in intelligence and morphogenesis and I think that he saw a very deep parallel between these two, these two areas of study and I think he was right on the money in the sense that I think these are actually very much the same question.
87500	97500	Now, most of the time when we think of intelligence, we think of something like this so here's a brain and we think of okay here's a here's a what quote unquote centralized intelligence of some some animal.
97500	107500	And then we look at things like this and colonies and so on and sometimes we talk about them as distributed or collective intelligence is swarm cognition and so on.
107500	120500	And so like calls them liquid brains. But actually, it's important to realize that this is just a matter of scale because if one zooms in, you find out that we are all in fact collective intelligences and we are all made of something like this.
120500	130500	So this is a single cell. This is a lacrimaria. It has no brain. It has no nervous system. It has no cell to cell communications or stem cells or any of the things that we're used to having in bodies.
130500	140500	What it what it does is it handles all of its local needs so so morphological behavioral metabolic and so on at the single cell level very competently.
140500	159500	And the amazing thing about this is that we all have taken the same journey from from what what might be called just physics, which is an oversight right a set of a set of chemical reactions that people would look at and would think okay,
159500	177500	this this has no cognitive capacities is just just some physics and chemistry. And yet, slowly, so over a matter of some months and maybe years, this process gives rise to these amazing morphologies and in fact, to high level human cognition that has second order, you know, metacognition and self awareness and so on.
178500	189500	And so this is a journey across the Cartesian cut that we all take. If you follow your own, your own development back far enough, you will find this and before that you will find just so it was quote unquote just physics.
189500	197500	So it's really interesting to ask how this transition works this this smooth transition. And so the main points that I'm going to try to transmit today are these.
197500	211500	First, that biology uses a kind of multi scale competency architecture of nested problem solvers, and that navigation is a really central concept to try to understand navigation spaces in particular is a central concept to try to understand this.
211500	221500	I'm going to claim that goal directedness is a is a critical invariant for recognizing building and relating to various unconventional agents.
222500	240500	And I'll describe a kind of cognitive boundary model for the scaling of goals. I'm going to spend about half the talk showing you one specific example in detail, which is this idea that pattern formation biological pattern formation is literally the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells in a space known as
240500	254500	morpho space. And I'm going to show you that bio electrical networks are the proto cognitive medium the ancestor of brain function. And this this idea actually has some very practical impacts on biomedicine.
254500	269500	This is not just a sort of philosophy this has very specific applications. And in the end I'm going to show you how synthetic by engineering provides a really astronomically large option space for new bodies and new minds that don't have standard evolutionary backstories.
269500	271500	So we'll get to that towards the end.
272500	285500	So, single cells have some really interesting spatial competencies that we can start off by thinking about. So this is a diatom. This is a single cell, and that particular very particular structure is something that it can reliably acquire.
285500	300500	This is a collection of several acetabularia algae. Each one of these things is in fact a single cell that has one nucleus. The whole thing is maybe, I can know six or seven centimeters long, it has some roots, it has a stock, it has a cap here.
300500	308500	The whole thing is just one cell. And so this is quite interesting to ask how it is that a single cell can have such such profound morphological differentiation.
308500	322500	But these these competencies are not only spatial, they are also behavioral. And so what you're seeing here is a slime mold. This is a fissarum polycephalum. The whole thing is one cell. It can grow to be very large, but the whole thing is one cell.
322500	331500	And so when you place it in the middle of this Petri dish, the little white circles are glass discs. There's no food, there's no chemicals, they're completely inert glass.
331500	347500	So what it will do as it grows during the first few hours, it sort of grows evenly outward like this. And what it's doing during this time is sending out vibrations into the medium it pulses and sends vibrations into the medium, reading back the vibrations that that return so it's
347500	361500	almost the kind of sonar it's sensing, sensing the properties of the medium. And by doing this, you can actually build a map of its environment, and then reliably make its way over to the heavier mass. So it can reliably detect three discs over one and you can all sorts of fun
361500	372500	experiments of stacking them one on top of each other and distributing them. But it has an amazing ability to sense the mass in its vicinity, and to make both morphogenetic and behavioral decisions based on that information.
372500	382500	So you can see this cell navigating in this space according to the biomechanical information that it has. So I'm going to show you four basic things today.
382500	396500	So first, we're going to try to introduce some biology that you may or may not have seen before, designed to really kind of stretch our idea of what is an organism, what is a mind, what does it mean to navigate space and so on.
396500	414500	And then, then we'll get into this very specific examples of bio electricity and morphogenesis. And then we'll talk about some of these novel organisms. So the kind of the traditional view is of these discrete static natural kinds you have a particular animal maybe you have a rat that you're studying
414500	427500	in a maze or a human subject or whatever you have. And that's, you know, that's kind of that's kind of your unit. But I want to I want to go beyond this, this sort of garden of Eden view and really emphasize that agents that do these intelligent things are incredibly plastic.
427500	441500	So here's one familiar example. Here we start with a caterpillar. This is a creature that lives in a in a largely two dimensional world that crawls around on flat surfaces that choose leaves, and it has a brain appropriate for that purpose.
441500	453500	It has to turn into a butterfly which is going to live in a very much a three dimensional world that has to fly it has to drink nectar. And in and it needs a completely different brain this is a soft bodied robot this is a hard bodied
454500	471500	controller suitable for hard kinds of bodies. And so in between what happens is during this process, the brain is largely, largely destroyed, most of the connections are broken down, most of the cells die, and and the new brain is rebuilt during the lifetime of the organism.
471500	483500	And so, you know, this this this kind of change makes the confusion of puberty seem like real child's play, you know, in the sense that this is a single agent radically changing its its its brain and its body.
483500	497500	And the amazing thing about it is that memories that the caterpillar acquires are retained in the moth or butterfly. So this has been shown so despite the despite the disaggregation of the brain actually some information is able to make it across.
497500	509500	This can be even more radical these are these are planaria. These are flatworms and you'll see a lot more about them in this talk. The planaria regenerate any part of their body so you cut them into pieces. The record is something like 275 pieces.
509500	525500	Each piece regrows exactly what's missing including the brain and you get perfect little worms. So, James McConnell back in the 60s, made an observation and it was, you know, quite controversial at the time but we repeated it and actually discovered he was he was absolutely right.
525500	535500	What happens is that if you if you train these planaria to recognize a particular region of their environment, let's say one with these little little bumps laser etched into it as the place where they get fed.
535500	545500	You can then amputate the head and the brain. I mean, these animals have a true centralized brain. Amputate the head and the brain leave the tail. The tail sits there for eight or nine days doing pretty much nothing.
545500	555500	Eventually it grows a new fresh brain and somehow that information is imprinted onto this new brain and these animals show retention of that memory.
555500	564500	So the information moving through the body being imprinted from one tissue onto another is something that we really need to start to understand.
564500	573500	And in fact, beyond beyond those kind of experiments, you can do this invertebrates. We did this in the tadpole. So this is a tadpole of the frogs and a Peslevis.
573500	581500	Here's the brain. Here are the nostrils. Here's the mouth, the gut and the tail. One thing you'll notice is that what we've done is we've prevented the normal eyes from forming.
581500	586500	We've put an ectopic eye on the tail. So this is a this is an eye that forms on the tail.
586500	596500	And the amazing thing about these animals is that with no long, in fact, with no period of evolutionary adaptation to this new configuration, they can see perfectly well out of these eyes.
596500	602500	So we've made a device that tests them on visual training cues and sort of automates the same thing we use to test the planarian memory.
602500	612500	It's an automated behavior testing device. And what we found is that this eye finds itself in a completely novel environment surrounding my muscle instead of near the brain, puts out an optic nerve.
612500	624500	The optic nerve might connect to the spinal cord. It does not go up to the brain. The brain that evolved for tracking visual data from these two locations suddenly gets information from some weird itchy patch of tissue on its tail.
624500	630500	No problem. It recognizes that as visual data and these animals behave quite well in learning assays.
630500	640500	So navigating your world with a radically different configuration of sensory and processing organs.
640500	651500	So what we really see in biology is that not only are we nested all structurally, I mean, we all, everyone knows that groups consist of individuals made of organs, tissues, cells and so on.
651500	659500	But actually, each one of these levels has competency. It solves problems in its own space and there are lots of different kinds of spaces.
659500	674500	And that multi-scale architecture, which is kind of unique, it's something that in engineering we're still really not able to recapitulate, although we're getting there, shows competency in many, many different spaces.
674500	683500	Now, the one thing I'd like to do fundamentally is to generalize this idea of being able to perform intelligently in some space.
683500	692500	So typically, we think about three-dimensional spaces. So behavior, moving the body in three-dimensional space.
692500	699500	So it's very easy for us to recognize intelligence in those spaces because all of our sense organs point outward.
699500	707500	And from the time you were very little, you were collecting data on medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds around you in three-dimensional space.
707500	712500	And we know how to recognize birds and mammals and other things behaving intelligently.
712500	721500	What we don't have are senses that directly show us, for example, imagine that you were born with a sense that where you could actually feel your blood chemistry,
721500	727500	all the different things going on in your blood physiology and all of the things that your liver, pancreas and other organs were doing.
727500	733500	In that case, we would have a training set that would allow us to understand intelligent navigation of other spaces.
733500	738500	So that would be physiological space, so the space of physiological parameters.
738500	744500	It might be a transcriptional space, so the space of gene expression, all the different gene expression domains,
744500	750500	or in fact, morpho space, the space of all possible anatomical configurations. We'll talk more about that.
750500	762500	I want to show you, and the fact that we're not familiar with these other spaces means that when we make claims about the cognitive level or the intelligence level of other systems,
762500	764500	we're really taking an IQ test ourselves.
764500	767500	What we're really saying is this is what we've recognized the system to be doing,
767500	774500	but we can't really assume that we're smart enough to know exactly what it's doing and what it's solving in all of the different spaces.
774500	783500	I want to show you a simple example. Again, these are the planaria, and what we found is that if we put planaria into a solution of barium chloride,
783500	790500	so barium is a non-specific potassium channel blocker. It prevents these cells from exchanging potassium with the outside world.
790500	795500	When you do this, literally their heads explode. Their heads just overnight they blow up.
795500	803500	The amazing thing is that if you keep the rest of the worm in barium over the next couple of weeks, they regenerate, they grow a brand new head,
803500	808500	and the new head does not care about barium whatsoever. The new head is barium adapted. That's kind of amazing.
808500	814500	We asked a simple question. We just looked at the transcriptomes of naive worms versus barium adapted heads,
814500	819500	and we just asked, well, what gene expression is different? What's different about these barium adapted heads?
819500	825500	One thing we found is that there's only a handful of genes. There's less than a dozen genes that are in fact different,
825500	834500	and so this system is able to figure out which genes to up and down regulate so that it can do its business without being able to pass potassium properly.
834500	839500	But the incredible thing about this is that barium is not anything that planaria ever see in the wild.
839500	849500	This is a completely unnatural novel stressor. So it's implausible to think that at some point there was evolutionary pressure to develop a response to barium.
849500	856500	So what you're really talking about here is you're in the space of gene expression, which is, let's say if they have 20,000 genes,
856500	867500	it's a massively very high dimensional space, and you need to walk in that space to find the exact genes that are going to solve your physiological stressor.
867500	877500	Now, you don't have time to sort of randomly flip genes on and off, first of all, because it'll most likely kill you before you find the good combinations.
877500	883500	Also, there's no time for that. These cells don't turn over that fast. It's not like a bacterial evolutionary system.
883500	891500	So it's still very much an open question. How do they navigate this transcriptional space to solve these kinds of problems?
891500	899500	So this to me is very much an example of intelligence in the sense of problem solving, taking what you already might know.
899500	906500	Maybe there's information about what to do in a case of epileptic seizures or so on, and bringing it to a new scenario.
906500	914500	And so I've been working on this framework. It's called TAME. It stands for technological approach to mind everywhere.
914500	921500	And the goal of this framework is to be able to recognize, create, and relate to truly diverse intelligences.
921500	930500	So we need to handle, of course, the things we're familiar with, birds, primates, and so on, but also weird colonial organisms and swarms and things like that.
930500	938500	Of course, all the new things that are being produced by synthetic morphology and synthetic biology approaches and possible exobiological agents,
938500	951500	because studying just the natural systems that are here on Earth and making conclusions about biology from them is a little bit like testing your theory on the same data set that created it, right?
951500	955500	It's all just an N of one pass through phylogenetic space.
955500	967500	So I tend to think about all kinds of unconventional, different types of embodiments, whether they be evolved, designed, whatever, and really think about this kind of, this is a scale by Rosenbluth, Wiener, and Bigelow.
968500	974500	Looking at all the different kinds of behaviors that one might have in one space. Notice that it says nothing about what it's made of.
974500	981500	It doesn't say anything about having brains or being a specific kind of organism or scale, temporally or whatever. It's all very functional.
981500	984500	So this is how we think about things in my group.
984500	990500	And the key to this framework is that it has to move experimental work forward. It has to enable new capabilities.
990500	993500	And I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you how that happens.
993500	1002500	But first, let's just think about this one particular kind of intelligence, which I think is super interesting, anatomical control as a collective intelligence.
1002500	1014500	First of all, notice the basic thing that needs explaining, which is that we all start life as a collection of embryonic blastomers, and this is a cross section through a human torso.
1014500	1025500	So this is what each of us has inside. Now, look at all the incredibly complex invariant order, all the tissues and structures, everything is in the right place next to each other, the right orientation, size, and so on.
1025500	1032500	So the first question is, where is the shape encoded? How do these cells know to make exactly this?
1032500	1037500	And you might be tempted to say DNA and genomes, but we can read genomes now.
1037500	1046500	And what we see is that genomes directly code for protein structure. So the genome specifies the micro level hardware that's present in every cell.
1046500	1054500	But there's nothing directly that you can read out in the genome about the symmetry type of the organism, the size, the shape, how regenerative it's going to be.
1054500	1059500	This is very much an open problem of how cells know what to what to make and when to stop.
1059500	1066500	As workers in regenerative medicine, if parts of this are missing, we'd like to know how to signal the cells to rebuild, to do it again.
1066500	1072500	And as engineers, we'd like to know, well, what else is possible, right? Given the exact same genome, what else can we ask these cells to do?
1072500	1079500	Or is this the only thing they could possibly do? And you can sort of visualize forward the end game of this whole field as something like this.
1079500	1087500	It would be an anatomical compiler where you should be able to sit down and draw at the level of anatomy, the animal or plant that you want.
1087500	1090500	Not the pathways, not genes, but the actual anatomy.
1090500	1102500	And if we knew what we were doing, we would have a system that compiled that description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build this particular thing.
1102500	1104500	In this case, a nice three-headed plenarium.
1104500	1108500	Now, we don't have anything remotely like this. This is a very long term goal.
1108500	1116500	And the reason that it's really important is because if you think about it, pretty much every problem of biomedicine, with the exception of infectious disease.
1116500	1123500	So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of these things boil down to one problem.
1123500	1127500	How do you convince cells to build the exact structure that you want?
1127500	1129500	If we solve that problem, all of this goes away.
1129500	1134500	We'd be able to fix birth defects, regenerate limbs, reprogram tumors. All of this would go away.
1134500	1138500	But it's a major problem. Why do we not have an anatomical compiler yet?
1139500	1152500	So I want to be clear that despite the incredible progress in genetics and molecular biology, we face very fundamental questions that have to do with not with the molecular mechanisms, but with the decision making.
1152500	1154500	So here's a simple example.
1154500	1156500	Here is this is a baby axolotl.
1156500	1158500	So axolotls are Mexican salamander.
1158500	1161500	There's a baby axolotl and baby axolotls have legs.
1161500	1162500	Here's a tadpole.
1162500	1164500	Not the frogs and a puslavus.
1164500	1165500	Tatpoles do not have legs.
1165500	1168500	So now in my group, we make something called a frogolotl.
1168500	1172500	So this is a half, it's a chimera, half axolotl, half frog.
1172500	1173500	You can mix the cells.
1173500	1175500	They cooperate with each other just fine.
1175500	1177500	They make something, a frogolotl.
1177500	1179500	Now I ask a simple question.
1179500	1181500	You've got the genome to the axolotl.
1181500	1183500	You've got the genome to the frog.
1183500	1187500	How come we don't have any models that tell us whether frogolotls will have legs?
1187500	1191500	We have no idea from that information whether frogolotls are going to have legs or not.
1191500	1196500	If they do have legs, whether those legs will be made of axolotl cells or also include frog cells.
1196500	1199500	We have no idea even though you've got the genetic information.
1199500	1205500	So it's really important to start to understand the algorithms because where biomedicine is right now
1205500	1210500	is that we're very good at manipulating molecules and cells and getting information like this,
1210500	1214500	which gene and protein talk to which other gene and protein.
1214500	1218500	We are a long way away from actually controlling a large scale form and function.
1218500	1223500	And in fact, you can think about the kind of parallel journey that the computer science took.
1223500	1227500	This is what programming looked like in the 40s and 50s where in order to control the system,
1227500	1229500	you had to physically rewire it, right?
1229500	1232500	You were pulling wires in and out yet to rewire it.
1232500	1236500	Nowadays, for a joke, I say to all my students, you know, you're on your laptop,
1236500	1239500	you're going to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop.
1239500	1242500	I want you to get out your soldering iron and start rewiring.
1242500	1246500	And of course they all laugh because nowadays we don't need to do that.
1246500	1250500	We understand that if your hardware is good enough, it's reprogrammable with stimuli,
1250500	1252500	with inputs, with experiences, not rewiring.
1252500	1255500	But of course, modern molecular medicine is all about the hardware.
1255500	1261500	We're all very excited about genomic editing and protein pathways and single molecule approaches.
1261500	1267500	And so I think the reason that we are still roughly where computer science was in the 50s
1267500	1271500	is because we've been neglecting one important aspect.
1271500	1274500	And that is multi-scale intelligence and biology.
1274500	1276500	Now, what do I mean by intelligence?
1276500	1282500	I mean what William James meant, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.
1282500	1288500	And when we talk about pattern and anatomy, when I talk about goals, I mean regions of morphospace.
1288500	1289500	Now, what's morphospace?
1289500	1296500	Morphospace is the space of all possible configurations of some particular structure.
1296500	1300500	So if you're looking at snail shells, for example, there are three parameters that you can define.
1300500	1307500	And every shell is, every possible snail shell is some point within this morphospace.
1307500	1310500	And this is an idea that's very old.
1310500	1316500	In fact, Darcy Thompson in the 40s had this interesting example in his book on growth and form,
1316500	1320500	where he noticed that if you just deform certain animal shapes placed on a grid,
1320500	1325500	you apply specific deformations to the grid, which you get are other species that do exist.
1325500	1329500	Now, at the time, there was no molecular mechanism, of course, known.
1329500	1331500	There was nothing really known about this.
1331500	1336500	But I think now we can do some very interesting things with this idea.
1336500	1344500	So navigating these spaces, changing your body shape to move from one region to another is not trivial
1344500	1348500	because there may be local minima, there may be barriers, there may be all kinds of things.
1348500	1352500	So that's the task that we face as morphogenetic agents.
1352500	1357500	Now embryogenesis is very good at this. It's extremely reliable.
1357500	1363500	So you start off as this kind of pattern, and eventually you end up here.
1363500	1367500	And that's generally very low, very low error.
1367500	1375500	But we can already see actually that this process is not simply a kind of pre-programmed hardwired walk in morphospace
1375500	1378500	because we can deviate in the middle.
1378500	1383500	So for example, we can take this nice human embryo, divide it in half, literally cut it in half,
1383500	1388500	and what you get are not two half organisms, you get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
1388500	1389500	This is where twins come from.
1389500	1398500	And so this is a regenerative event where each half of this embryo basically realizes that it's actually not where it's supposed to be in morphospace
1398500	1404500	and it needs to regenerate the other half in order to make the correct changes to get to its goal and where it needs to go.
1404500	1411500	So this is not just embryonic, for example, back to this salamander, this axolotl.
1411500	1419500	These guys regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, their spinal cords, portions of their heart and brain, their ovaries.
1419500	1421500	They're incredibly regenerative as adults.
1421500	1426500	And what happens is that you can amputate, for example, this limb at different positions.
1426500	1429500	No matter where you cut, the cells will very quickly grow.
1429500	1433500	They will grow exactly what's needed to make a normal axolotl limb, and then they stop.
1433500	1436500	So this is a kind of example of anatomical homeostasis.
1436500	1442500	They will continue working from wherever starting position until they get to where they're going.
1442500	1448500	Parenthetically, this is not just for frogs and axolotls and worms.
1448500	1450500	The human liver, of course, is regenerative.
1450500	1451500	Even the ancient Greeks knew that.
1451500	1455500	I have no idea how they knew that, but it seems like they did.
1455500	1461500	Deer, every year, regenerate massive amounts of bone up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day.
1461500	1464500	Bone, vasculature, innervation, skin.
1464500	1468500	And even human children below a certain age can regenerate their fingertips.
1468500	1472500	If you just leave it alone, it will basically regrow cosmetically a very, very nice outcome.
1472500	1477500	So we have some ability to improve our position in morphospace.
1477500	1485500	One of the most amazing things about it is that as a body, as a living creature, you can't count on your environment.
1485500	1490500	You can't count on, in other words, you can't count on the environment being the same as it was before.
1490500	1498500	You can't count on not being perturbed during the developmental process, maybe physiologically, maybe metabolically, maybe with a parasite or a teratogen.
1498500	1499500	So you can't count on that.
1499500	1501500	And you still need to get your job done.
1501500	1505500	In fact, you can't even count on your own parts being what you expected them to be.
1505500	1514500	Now, of course, we don't have any machines that can do this, that can repair themselves after damage or put themselves together with diverse parts.
1514500	1517500	This is one of my favorite examples of all time.
1517500	1522500	This is a cross-section through a new kidney tubule.
1522500	1526500	So here's the lumen of the tubule and these are the cells that make up the tubule.
1526500	1531500	Normally, it's, let's say, around eight cells that work together to form this kind of tubule.
1531500	1539500	One thing you can do is you can make these cells what's called polyploid, which means they have extra genetic material.
1539500	1550500	Amazing thing number one, with the excess genetic material, you still get a perfectly normal, no problem that there are all kinds of extra information around, no problem.
1550500	1552500	But what does happen is that the cells get much bigger.
1552500	1558500	And as the cells get physically bigger, fewer of them are needed to make the exact same shape lumen.
1558500	1568500	Now, that's amazing thing number two is that the number of these cells will actually scale to their correct size so that you get the same final outcome with different numbers of cells.
1568500	1579500	But the most amazing thing is that when you make these cells absolutely gigantic so that only one cell is big enough to make the whole lumen, what it will do is it will no longer cooperate with other cells.
1579500	1585500	One cell will bend around itself making the exact same lumen.
1585500	1588500	Now, the incredible thing about that is this is a different molecular mechanism.
1588500	1590500	This was cell-to-cell communication.
1590500	1592500	This is cytoskeletal bending.
1592500	1606500	So what happens is that this is a kind of top-down causation where in service of a large-scale anatomical spec, meaning having the correct lumen, you can call up different molecular mechanisms to get the job done.
1606500	1618500	So this, again, is sticking with this theme of intelligence as the ability to handle novelty in terms of getting to where you're going from diverse starting positions with perturbations, both external and internal.
1618500	1620500	You know, your own parts are changing.
1620500	1622500	Can you still do what you need to do?
1622500	1625500	And all of this is described in some of these papers.
1625500	1631500	And then the final thing is that your walkthrough morphospace doesn't even have to be the same path.
1631500	1634500	So here, for example, here's a frog.
1634500	1636500	Frogs normally do not regenerate their legs.
1636500	1640500	As I'll tell you momentarily, we have figured out a way to make them regenerate their legs.
1640500	1644500	And when they do, so this is a pretty good frog leg regeneration.
1644500	1647500	You can see here, it's got the toes, the toenails, the webbing.
1647500	1648500	I mean, everything's good.
1648500	1656500	But in fact, the way it got here is not at all how frogs normally regenerate their limbs, normally develop their limbs.
1656500	1658500	So normal frog limb morphogenesis is here.
1658500	1663500	You make these things and then you sort of make that, you kill off the cells in the middle to make the paddle.
1663500	1666500	This grows in a completely different way.
1666500	1671500	You've got the middle, this kind of middle stalk here with the toenail, and then the toes sort of come off to the side.
1671500	1672500	It looks much more like a plant.
1672500	1677500	So it takes a different path through morphospace, but it ends up in the same place.
1677500	1687500	So all of this is back to illustrating some of these amazing abilities of the cells to navigate.
1687500	1694500	And so one very canonical example of this that we discovered a few years ago is this.
1694500	1695500	So here's a tadpole.
1695500	1698500	Here's the gut, the brain, the nostrils, and the eyes here.
1698500	1700500	This tadpole needs to become a frog.
1700500	1703500	In order for a tadpole face to be a frog face, things have to move.
1703500	1707500	So the jaws have to move, the eyes have to move forward, everything has to move.
1707500	1713500	And it used to be thought that this process was hardwired because if you're a standard tadpole and you want to be a standard frog,
1713500	1718500	all you have to remember is which direction and by how much every piece of the face moves.
1718500	1722500	What we did, and we suspected that there was more intelligence to this process than that.
1722500	1724500	And so we did an experiment.
1724500	1727500	We created so-called Picasso frogs.
1727500	1730500	And so these are tadpoles in which everything is messed up.
1730500	1735500	The eyes on the side of the head, the jaws are off to the side and the nostrils are too far back.
1735500	1737500	I mean, everything is in the wrong position.
1737500	1744500	And we found that these animals still largely make pretty normal frogs because all of these pieces will move in novel paths.
1744500	1749500	In fact, sometimes they go too far and have to double back to give you a normal frog face.
1749500	1754500	So what the genetics gives you is not some hardwired system that always moves in the same way.
1754500	1760500	What it specifies is a really interesting error minimization machine that however you start it off,
1760500	1766500	obviously with some limits, will try to minimize the error and get to the correct final shape.
1766500	1769500	If we had a robotic swarm, a collection of robots that was able to do this,
1769500	1772500	we would call this a prize-winning example of collective intelligence,
1772500	1775500	but we don't have such a technology yet.
1775500	1779500	So we started trying to understand this process.
1779500	1781500	How does all this work?
1781500	1789500	To the standard feed-forward kind of open-loop process of developmental biology that you would read about in class,
1789500	1795500	where there are genes, they make proteins, the proteins interact via some physics and chemistry,
1795500	1797500	and then there's this emergent outcome.
1797500	1803500	We add to this these feedback loops whereby this is actually a homeostatic system.
1803500	1813500	If that anatomy is disrupted in some way by injury, by mutations, by teratogens, by parasites, whatever,
1813500	1816500	then these feedback loops will kick in to try to minimize error.
1816500	1819500	The cells will do what they can to try to get back to the correct shape.
1819500	1823500	Think about your thermostat. It's a basic homeostatic circuit.
1823500	1827500	Now, on the one hand, this is pretty expected.
1827500	1830500	Biologists know all about feedback loops and so on.
1830500	1834500	On the other hand, there are two kind of weird and unusual things here.
1834500	1838500	The first is that every homeostatic process has to have a set point.
1838500	1845500	So if you're going to try to get back to where you need to be, you have to remember where the right position is.
1845500	1847500	You have to store a set point.
1847500	1852500	We're used to thinking about scalars, single numbers as set points, so temperature, pH, things like that.
1852500	1857500	But in this case, the set point is some sort of a large-scale geometry.
1857500	1861500	It's a descriptor of some kind of coarse-grained descriptor of an anatomy.
1861500	1863500	So it's a complex data structure.
1863500	1868500	And in general, biologists don't love to think about goal-directed processes.
1868500	1873500	The idea is there's supposed to be emergence and kind of emergent complexity.
1873500	1879500	But this idea that things are working towards a goal the way that any navigational system fundamentally does
1879500	1884500	is really not something that is very comfortable, certainly, for molecular biology.
1884500	1887500	So how would something like this work?
1887500	1894500	How could we have a navigating system that can have goals in anatomical space?
1894500	1897500	And so here's where we start to think about bioelectricity,
1897500	1905500	because our best example of a mechanism that allows us to navigate space towards goals is the brain.
1905500	1908500	And in the brain, we know roughly what the architecture looks like.
1908500	1912500	There are cells that communicate with other cells and networks.
1912500	1914500	These cells have ion channels.
1914500	1918500	So these are little proteins that help set a voltage to the cell.
1918500	1922500	And that voltage may or may not be communicated to its neighbors through these little gap junctions.
1922500	1928500	These are like electrical synapses that allow electrical information to pass back and forth.
1928500	1930500	And so that's the hardware of the brain.
1930500	1935500	And what that hardware enables is a kind of software that, among other things, navigates spaces.
1935500	1937500	So here's a zebrafish.
1937500	1944500	This is a movie taken by this group here that shows all the electrical activity in the living zebrafish brain.
1944500	1950500	And so the commitment of neuroscience is that if we understood how to decode this information,
1950500	1956500	we would be able to know what the cognitive content of this brain was.
1956500	1962500	So the memories, the preferences, the goals, whatever else the system was going to do, we should be able to decode it.
1962500	1965500	So this is that cycle that's called neural decoding.
1965500	1969500	We should be able to understand what all these patterns mean.
1969500	1973500	Well, it turns out that this is not just for brains.
1973500	1975500	This is an extremely ancient system.
1975500	1977500	All the cells in your body have ion channels.
1977500	1980500	Most cells have gap junctions with each other.
1980500	1982500	And what we might be able to do is just like neuroscientists,
1982500	1985500	we might be able to extend this whole scheme to ask,
1985500	1988500	what are your tissues thinking about at any point in time?
1988500	1990500	Specifically, to read the electrical.
1990500	1993500	So this is a time lapse of an early frog embryo.
1993500	1996500	The colors are a fluorescent dye reporting voltage,
1996500	2001500	the same way that we did here that was done here with these zebrafish.
2001500	2005500	And we might be able to decode this information to ask,
2005500	2008500	what are the targets in anatomical amorphous space?
2008500	2010500	What is this thing going to build?
2010500	2015500	And so there's this amazing isomorphism between the story of the brain,
2015500	2020500	where you've got the hardware and the software and there's various experiences
2020500	2023500	and various other ways that this software gets modified.
2023500	2027500	The hardware basically, it just gets built in development.
2027500	2033500	And what the brain does is it controls muscles to move your body in three-dimensional space.
2033500	2036500	Now, that's a pretty cool trick. Where did it learn this trick?
2036500	2040500	Well, evolutionarily, this is exactly the same as something that was going on
2040500	2044500	long before brains appeared, which is this exact same system,
2044500	2049500	but it used to be for moving the body configuration in amorphous space.
2049500	2051500	Before there were nerves and muscles,
2051500	2057500	cells needed to talk to each other and process information to get around in amorphous space.
2057500	2064500	And so we've argued in this paper that basically neural electricity
2064500	2069500	is just an evolutionary pivot across spaces from amorphous space to three-dimensional space
2069500	2075500	of a very ancient system for processing information long before brains arose.
2075500	2079500	So in my group, we were thinking about this and we asked this question,
2079500	2086500	okay, if that's how it works, could we make some tools to read and write this electrical information
2086500	2091500	and to really understand how it's navigating that shape-change space?
2091500	2098500	So we developed some of the first tools to read and write information into non-brain tissues.
2098500	2102500	So of course, these dyes, so these are voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes
2102500	2107500	that report all the electrical conversations that these cells are having with each other.
2107500	2111500	So here's a time-lapse of these cells figuring out who's going to be left, right, dorsal, ventral.
2111500	2115500	So all of this is, you're looking at these cells having those conversations.
2115500	2120500	We do a lot of computational modeling to ask, okay, given where the ions are going,
2120500	2122500	how can we predict these voltages?
2122500	2124500	I'm going to show you two patterns.
2124500	2128500	Here's a time-lapse. It happens to be grayscale, but it's the exact same idea.
2128500	2132500	Here's a time-lapse of a frog embryo putting its face together.
2132500	2135500	And what you will see, and this is one frame out of that video,
2135500	2140500	what you will see is that this is something we call the electric face discovered by my colleague, Danny Adams.
2140500	2149500	When she was in my group doing this profiling, she found that, here's a particular frame from that video
2149500	2153500	where you can see the animal's right eye, the mouth, the placodes.
2153500	2159500	All of this is already demarcated before the genes start to come on and really pattern the face.
2159500	2163500	This is a bioelectric pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like.
2163500	2165500	And I'm showing you this one because it's so simple.
2165500	2167500	It literally looks like a face, right?
2167500	2171500	There are other patterns that are much more complex that you can't really just sort of visually decode.
2171500	2173500	But this one is very clear.
2173500	2176500	This is the memory of what a tadpole face is going to look like.
2176500	2180500	And if you move this, if you disrupt this electrical pattern,
2180500	2184500	the gene expression will change and the organogenesis will change.
2184500	2188500	And I'll show you examples of that momentarily.
2188500	2194500	So this is an endogenous pattern that is required for normal development.
2194500	2199500	In fact, human channelopathies of the human patients that have craniofacial defects
2199500	2203500	often have mutations in ion channels that screw up this pattern.
2203500	2204500	So that's a normal pattern.
2204500	2206500	Here's a pathological pattern.
2206500	2208500	We've put in a human oncogene.
2208500	2210500	These cells will make a tumor.
2210500	2212500	But even before the tumor becomes apparent,
2212500	2217500	you can already see this bioelectrical, aberrant bioelectrical signature of these cells
2217500	2219500	basically disconnecting from the rest of the tissue
2219500	2223500	and going to their unicellular ancient behavior mode
2223500	2226500	where the rest of the body is just environment as far as they're concerned.
2226500	2230500	So one set of tools is to track these bioelectrical changes.
2230500	2232500	Now here's another important set of tools.
2232500	2236500	To actually start to be able to write new information into it.
2236500	2238500	And the way we do that, we don't use any applied electric fields.
2238500	2239500	There are no waves.
2239500	2240500	There are no magnets.
2240500	2242500	There's no electromagnetic radiation.
2242500	2245500	What we do is we do exactly what neuroscientists do,
2245500	2252500	which is we modify the endogenous mechanisms by which cells establish electrical signals.
2252500	2255500	So either ion channels, we can open them, we can close them,
2255500	2258500	we can use light or drugs to do that.
2258500	2261500	And the gap junctions, the electrical synapses.
2261500	2264500	So we can determine which cells talk to each other's cells
2264500	2266500	by opening and closing these little gap junctions.
2266500	2270500	It's very telling that all of the tools of neuroscience work in other cell types.
2270500	2272500	Basically the tools can't tell the difference, right?
2272500	2277500	This distinction between neuroscience and other cells in your body is completely artificial
2277500	2280500	and it's a consequence of humans trying to parse the world.
2280500	2283500	Nature doesn't obey that distinction.
2283500	2285500	So what can you do with this?
2285500	2287500	I've been talking about this electrical information.
2287500	2289500	What does it actually do?
2289500	2291500	Well, here are a few examples.
2291500	2294500	One thing you can do is you can take this tadpole
2294500	2297500	and I've shown you the electric face and so we asked the question,
2297500	2302500	okay, now that we know that there's a particular voltage state that kickstarts eye development,
2302500	2304500	could we simply reproduce that somewhere else?
2304500	2309500	So we took an ion channel RNA that we knew was going to set the same voltage state.
2309500	2313500	We injected it into precursor cells that are going to give rise to the gut
2313500	2316500	and sure enough, those cells can form a complete eye.
2317500	2321500	The eyes that are formed will have all the right layers, retina,
2321500	2327500	optic nerve, all that lens and they can be formed anywhere.
2327500	2331500	They can be formed anywhere in the body as long as the cells get the right pattern
2331500	2333500	that tells them what organ to make.
2333500	2335500	Now notice two very interesting things here.
2335500	2338500	One is that this instruction is highly modular.
2338500	2342500	We provided a very small piece of information, just a voltage pattern.
2342500	2345500	We certainly did not give it all the information needed to specify an eye.
2345500	2348500	Eyes have many cell types, they're very complex.
2348500	2351500	We have no idea how to micromanage the creation of an eye.
2351500	2356500	But what we provided was kind of a subroutine call, a signal that says build an eye here
2356500	2358500	and the cells do.
2358500	2359500	That's the first thing.
2359500	2362500	The second amazing thing is that there are two levels of instruction here.
2362500	2365500	One is us instructing the cells build an eye.
2365500	2371500	But here what you can see is this is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere
2371500	2375500	and the blue cells are the ones that carry this ion channel that we put in.
2375500	2377500	There's not enough of them to make a good lens.
2377500	2379500	So what they've done is recruit their neighbors.
2379500	2383500	This is why at the very beginning I pitched this idea that frog allotls might have legs
2383500	2386500	that consist also of frog cells.
2386500	2389500	Why would frog cells build a leg when they normally don't?
2389500	2393500	It's because cells have the ability to instruct each other about what to build.
2393500	2396500	So these cells right here, they've been told to make an eye, but there's not enough of them
2396500	2399500	and they know that and so they recruit a bunch of their neighbors,
2399500	2400500	these brown cells that we never touched.
2401500	2403500	These cells are completely wild type.
2403500	2408500	And yet they're participating in making this ectopic lens out in the tail of a tadpole.
2408500	2413500	So there's this amazing ability to instruct and for the cells to then instruct each other.
2413500	2415500	Now, what else can we make?
2415500	2420500	Well, we can make using the same methodology by manipulating these ion channels.
2420500	2424500	We can make odysses, which are balance organs like inner ear type of organs.
2424500	2428500	We can make complete beating hearts, so ectopic hearts.
2428500	2430500	We can make extra forebrain.
2430500	2434500	And then you can ask if these animals are any smarter than the normal tadpoles.
2434500	2436500	We can make ectopic limbs.
2436500	2439500	So you can see here all kinds of extra legs that we can form.
2439500	2441500	And we can even make fins.
2441500	2444500	This last one's kind of weird because tadpoles, of course, aren't supposed to have fins.
2444500	2446500	We'll get to that momentarily.
2446500	2452500	What you can see is that by changing the bioelectrical pattern using manipulation of ion channels,
2452500	2455500	you can tell this collective where to go in morphospace,
2455500	2458500	meaning what types of organs they should be building.
2458500	2461500	You're not micromanaging the specifics each step that they take.
2461500	2462500	They figure that out on the road.
2462500	2465500	In fact, we have no idea how to do that for any of these complex organs,
2465500	2470500	but you can indicate regions about where it is that they should be going.
2470500	2472500	And this has biomedical implications.
2472500	2476500	So frogs, I told you, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs.
2476500	2479500	So if a leg is amputated 45 days later, there's nothing.
2479500	2483500	What we've done is come up with a drug cocktail, a target ion channels,
2483500	2486500	that induces leg regeneration.
2486500	2490500	And so you can see here, 45 days later, there's already a nice leg forming.
2490500	2492500	The leg is touch sensitive.
2492500	2493500	It's motile.
2493500	2494500	It's functional.
2494500	2498500	It has a pretty good, eventually it has a pretty good final pattern.
2498500	2502500	And so we're in the process of translating that to mammals.
2502500	2503500	Hopefully this will work.
2503500	2506500	I have to do a disclosure here because this is a commercial venture now.
2506500	2510500	Morphosuticals, Inc., is a spin-off between myself and Dave Kaplan,
2510500	2515500	where David's lab makes these bioreactors that provide,
2515500	2518500	that have an aqueous environment for the wound.
2518500	2521500	And then we provide the ion channel and other types of payload in there
2521500	2524500	to hopefully get leg regeneration in mammals.
2524500	2527500	So this is a clinically relevant approach.
2527500	2532500	So I want to switch from this now to show you another kind of amazing example
2532500	2535500	of what bioelectricity does.
2535500	2537500	This is, these are plenarium.
2537500	2541500	So I've already told you they have incredible amounts of regenerative ability.
2541500	2543500	Because of that, they're actually immortal.
2543500	2545500	There's no such thing as an old plenarium.
2545500	2546500	They do not age.
2546500	2550500	So these animals pretty much go on forever.
2550500	2555500	And that's because of this incredible ability to continuously replenish and regenerate
2555500	2557500	to keep their pattern perfect.
2557500	2560500	So I want to show you an example.
2560500	2562500	This is a plenarium, one head, one tail.
2562500	2566500	You cut off the head and the tail, you got this middle fragment.
2566500	2568500	We check the gene expression.
2568500	2570500	Yup, anterior genes are in the head.
2570500	2572500	No anterior genes in the tail.
2572500	2573500	That's fine.
2573500	2576500	And 100% of the time it makes this normal offspring.
2576500	2578500	So one head, one tail.
2578500	2579500	It regenerates.
2579500	2585500	Now here, what I'm going to show you is that here's a plenarium, one head, one tail.
2585500	2587500	Again, anterior genes where they're supposed to be.
2587500	2591500	But when I cut this guy, he makes a two-headed form.
2591500	2593500	And I just told you that this process was very reliable.
2593500	2596500	Why in the world would a one-headed animal make a two-headed?
2596500	2597500	And this isn't Photoshop.
2597500	2599500	These are real live animals.
2599500	2601500	So here are heads at both ends.
2601500	2608500	Well, it's because in the meantime, we found that there's an electrical circuit that actually helps this tissue remember how many heads they're supposed to be.
2608500	2613500	And what you can do in the meantime is take this one-headed animal and you can look at the electrical pattern.
2613500	2616500	The electrical pattern says one head, one tail.
2616500	2621500	And we can alter that electrical pattern to say, no, you're going to be, a proper worm should have two heads.
2621500	2622500	Now you can see it's kind of a mess.
2622500	2625500	The technology is still being worked out, but it's very clear.
2625500	2628500	We can impose this pattern that says two heads.
2628500	2631500	And when you cut that animal, boom, that's what the cells make.
2631500	2633500	Now this is really critical to understand.
2633500	2637500	This bi-electric pattern is not a map of this two-headed guy.
2637500	2646500	This bi-electrical pattern is a map of this one-headed animal into which we incepted a false memory of what plenaria are supposed to look like.
2646500	2647500	And they sit there.
2647500	2650500	This memory sits there, latent, doing nothing until you injure them.
2650500	2656500	Once you injure this animal, that is when they will, the cells will pay attention to this pattern and they will go ahead and make a two-headed animal.
2656500	2666500	So if you're wondering where counterfactual, where the ability to consider counterfactuals came from, this kind of mental time travel where you can consider things,
2666500	2676500	have memories and have predictions about things that are not happening right now, this is perhaps the sort of basal precursor of that ability in morphospace.
2676500	2683500	This animal has a representation in morphospace of where it will go if it gets injured at a future time.
2683500	2684500	Not what's happening right now.
2684500	2685500	This is not where I am right now.
2685500	2687500	This is where I'm going to go if I get injured.
2687500	2689500	Now why do I keep calling this thing a memory?
2689500	2698500	I keep calling it a memory because if you take these two-headed animals and simply recut them again in plain water, no more manipulations of any kind,
2698500	2703500	they will continue to rebuild two-headed animals forever as far as we can tell.
2704500	2711500	The question of how many heads a planarian has is not strictly determined by the genome because we didn't touch the genome.
2711500	2712500	The genome is wild type.
2712500	2713500	There's nothing.
2713500	2714500	There's no genomic editing here.
2714500	2718500	That information is sitting in an electric circuit.
2718500	2722500	The default, the genetically set default is one head, but it's easily changed.
2722500	2724500	And in fact, we can now, well now I say it's easy.
2724500	2726500	It took us 10 years to figure it out.
2726500	2728500	But in fact, it's quite readily done.
2728500	2730500	And in fact, you can set it back.
2730500	2732500	You can set it back to being one-headed.
2732500	2736500	By again, targeting the information in that electrical circuit.
2736500	2740500	The first time I showed these data, somebody stood up at our conferences and said,
2740500	2742500	well, that's impossible.
2742500	2743500	Those animals can't exist.
2743500	2749500	So I always bring this video so everybody can see what the second and third generation of these guys look like.
2749500	2752500	So this has all the properties of memory.
2752500	2753500	It's long-term stable.
2753500	2754500	It's rewritable.
2754500	2755500	It's got a little bit of labialty.
2755500	2756500	So it's rewritable.
2756500	2758500	It's got latency or conditional recall.
2758500	2764500	So you can have a single body can have memories of why a planarian is supposed to look like that aren't true right now.
2764500	2766500	And it has discrete possible outcomes.
2766500	2775500	So one of the things that we're doing now is really trying to integrate models of the physiological state space of this animal.
2775500	2783500	Where the circuit, the electrical circuit has a state space where there are attractors that correspond to one-heads, two-heads, no-heads, and so on.
2783500	2795500	And merge that with models of connectionist artificial neural network type of processes where we already know how to build networks that, for example, do pattern completion.
2795500	2797500	And they have a memory of what the pattern should be.
2797500	2800500	And if part of that pattern is missing, they can reproduce it and so on.
2800500	2802500	This is all part of one problem.
2802500	2810500	And the key is tying it all together with these quantitative models that show how this electrical circuit navigates morpho space.
2810500	2816500	Now, what I've shown you is that you can tweak that electrical circuit to find an attractor that has two heads instead of one-heads.
2816500	2817500	But what else is there?
2817500	2819500	What else does this space actually have?
2819500	2821500	Let's explore that a little bit.
2821500	2825500	Well, the first thing you find is that, well, it contains head shapes of other species.
2825500	2833500	So what you can do is you can take this planarian, cut off the head, perturb the electrical circuit for about 48 hours, then let them let it go.
2833500	2839500	And when it finally settles down into the correct attractor, it doesn't always find the right one.
2839500	2846500	So some percent of the time it goes back to normal and makes this nice triangular head from Dderotacephala.
2846500	2849500	But sometimes it'll make a round head like this S-Mediterania.
2849500	2852500	Sometimes it'll make a flat head like this P-Felina.
2852500	2854500	In fact, this is stochastic process.
2854500	2863500	The frequency of these is proportional to the evolutionary distance between the real species that are being mimicked here.
2863500	2865500	And again, no changes to the genome.
2865500	2867500	There's nothing genetically wrong with these animals.
2867500	2871500	But you can you can find these other attractors and it's not just for head shape.
2871500	2873500	It's the shape of the brain.
2873500	2877500	The distribution of the stem cells become just like these other species.
2877500	2880500	And it's about there about 100 to 150 million years distant.
2880500	2884500	Okay, so so you can find those attractors with the exact same genetics.
2884500	2892500	In fact, you can find shapes that don't that that don't correspond to any real planarian as far as we know.
2892500	2895500	You can make these crazy spiky forms.
2895500	2897500	You can make a different symmetry type.
2897500	2901500	So this kind of cylindrical radial symmetry instead of a flat bilateral symmetry.
2901500	2906500	You can make combinations where where there's a flat worm with a big tube growing out into the third dimension.
2906500	2908500	And again, nothing wrong with the hardware.
2908500	2910500	There's no no no mutations.
2910500	2911500	Another one with the genome.
2911500	2915500	It's exploring the it's bio electrically exploring the space of where it can be.
2915500	2924500	And so the idea is what we're doing now is is building these kind of full stack models that they're trying to integrate all the way from the molecular
2924500	2927500	information about what channels do you have to work with?
2927500	2934500	So the hardware all the way up through the physiology of, okay, well, what does this mean for the voltage states across the tissue to?
2934500	2941500	Well, what does that mean for the identity of different organs along the primary axis to what kind of algorithm is this whole thing?
2941500	2947500	Is this whole thing implementing such that we could actually understand the algorithm and intervene, right?
2947500	2949500	So so make make changes.
2949500	2959500	And for this we have we have all kinds of computational platforms such as such as this, which allows you to load up electrical circuits into cells and then simulate
2959500	2966500	simulate tissue and organ level dynamics to understand what the large scale computations are.
2966500	2973500	And so so just as a simple example, again, of why this is why this is useful and what the what the practical implications of this are.
2973500	2978500	We use this the strategy to find a technique for repairing birth defects.
2978500	2981500	So here's a tadpole, here's the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
2981500	2986500	If it's exposed to nicotine or various other teratogens, you can see there's massive defects.
2986500	2989500	So the brain is basically gone.
2989500	2992500	The forebrain is basically gone, the midbrain and high brain are damaged.
2992500	3000500	And so what we did is we built this this bio electrical model that tries to explain how does the brain know what its size and shape should be.
3000500	3007500	And in cases where, for example, here this is even worse than a teratogen, we mutated a key neurogenesis gene is a gene called notch.
3007500	3008500	So this gene is mutated.
3008500	3011500	You can see the forebrain is just gone, the midbrain and hindbrain are a bubble.
3011500	3013500	These animals have no behavior.
3013500	3014500	They just lay there doing nothing.
3014500	3015500	It's a very strong defect.
3015500	3025500	What we found what we did was we asked that model, which ion channels would we have to open and close to get back to the correct bio electrical memory of what a what a correct brain should be?
3025500	3030500	Basically, how do I find my way back in morphospace to what a correct brain should be?
3030500	3032500	And the model made a prediction.
3032500	3033500	We tested that prediction.
3033500	3039500	It happens to be an already human approved set of drugs that can do this.
3039500	3042500	And sure enough, when we did it, there you go.
3042500	3049500	The brain structure comes back, their brain gene expression comes back and their IQ comes back.
3049500	3059500	So if you actually test them for their learning rates, their indistinguishable from controls, even though they've been exposed to teratogens or they have this really nasty genetic defect, some problems and not all problems.
3059500	3062500	But some problems can be fixed at the level of software.
3062500	3069500	Sometimes when your hardware isn't quite right, you can make up for it in software by having a better navigation policy through morphospace.
3069500	3073500	So you're not dead and you're not automatically dead in the water if your hardware is a little wonky.
3073500	3084500	So what that means is we ought to be able to create these pipelines to to and we've already we've already started to help design electroseuticals.
3084500	3094500	That is, you have some particular problem and you can ask the simulation, what type of channel meaning what drug can I use to get back to my correct bioelectrical pattern.
3094500	3103500	Fundamentally, this is really the question of how do we exploit this electrical interface that these cells are exposed into us, right?
3103500	3110500	Just like neurons do and people using electrodes and optogenetics and everything else to control brains using this electrical interface.
3110500	3114500	We can do exactly the same thing to help guide their navigation through morphospace.
3114500	3123500	It's a new way of to think about getting making drugs for various disorders of development of injury and cancer and so on.
3123500	3128500	Okay, so so I want to just just say a couple of things before I wrap up here.
3128500	3136500	I want to say a couple of things about the scaling of cognition in this whole in this whole business and then show you some some novel synthetic living machines.
3136500	3147500	So the first thing I want to point out is that we've been I started out by saying that thinking about fixed standard animals is kind of limiting.
3147500	3154500	And that's because the border between self and world is is is flexible.
3154500	3155500	It can change.
3155500	3166500	So so again, here is a and what what unifies all all of these different kinds of weird intelligences are solving problems in morphospace and in physiological space and so on.
3166500	3171500	Is their ability to pursue goals meaning to pursue the right region of that morphospace.
3171500	3180500	So this kind of creature a single cell can have pretty humble little tiny goals right so so on the scale of some number of microns.
3180500	3185500	It can it can pursue state physiological states a whole metabolic states and so on.
3185500	3191500	But these cells can cooperate and when they cooperate when they cooperate they can pursue very large goals.
3191500	3197500	So building a limb is a huge goal not no individual cell knows what a limb is or how it can count fingers or anything like that.
3197500	3208500	But the collective sure can the collective will absolutely pursue this particular region of morphospace despite all kinds of perturbations and when does it stop it stops when it when it reaches that area.
3208500	3211500	When it gets to where it's going and the limb is correct that's when it stops.
3211500	3215500	So there's a scaling of goals here now that happens during evolution.
3215500	3219500	And as you as you'll see in a minute it also can can happen right in front of your eyes.
3219500	3223500	But the reverse process we're quite familiar with and that's cancer.
3223500	3236500	So these here are glioblastoma cells human glioblastoma cells and culture cells can defect from this kind of from this kind of situation once they electrically isolate from their neighbors.
3236500	3244500	And then as far as they're concerned they're back to they're back to this scenario the the rest of the body is just external environment to them their their goals are little tiny goals.
3244500	3246500	What are the goals of single cell systems.
3246500	3251500	Well for every cell wants to become two cells and it wants to go wherever life is good and that's metastasis.
3251500	3260500	And so that process that shrinking and growing and in fact these cancer cells are not any more selfish than your normal body cells is just that the self is smaller.
3260500	3271500	A lot of work in game theory of cancer that talks about selfishness and lack of cooperation and not any more selfish is just that the self towards which they work is just little little tiny self is very small.
3271500	3282500	Whereas here the electrical network is able to bind and if people want I have all sorts of stories about what exactly happens when they bind together but I'll skip that for now for reasons of time.
3282500	3298500	When when individual cells bind into networks those networks have a greater ability to to store memory to have anticipation of future events to perceive spatial spatial kinds of signals in their environment and so the scale grows.
3298500	3311500	And the the biomedical implication of this is that if this were if this were true you should be able to reverse cancer by artificially reconnecting cells to their neighbors.
3311500	3317500	In fact that's what we've that's what we've done so so when you have this this nasty oncogene you can see that in red it's still here.
3317500	3327500	You can prevent the tumor from happening by putting in an ion channel that forces these cells to remain in the right bio electrical state despite the fact that the oncogene is trying to disassociate them.
3327500	3338500	And if you do that the physiology trumps the genetics that will it will the cells will remain even though the oncogene is strongly expressed the cells will remain making nice muscle and skin and whatever else it's supposed to make.
3338500	3346500	So this this this idea of looking at the scaling of the self and the scaling of these goals has real practical implications.
3346500	3356500	And in in my in my model one of the things that it allows the framework to do is to compare directly very diverse intelligences.
3356500	3367500	So any intelligence be it evolved designed some sort of hybrid some sort of alien thing and maybe saw pure software it doesn't matter any agent has a study that can pursue goals.
3367500	3373500	You can simply plot the size of those goals so so how big are they in space and time right you might have.
3373500	3384500	You might have a tick that only cares about local butyrate concentration and that's all that it's ever going to care about and so it has a tiny little cognitive light cone that allows it to pursue these tiny little goals.
3384500	3392500	Any more you might have a dog which has a bigger cognitive light cone and has some pretty good memory going backwards as a little bit of anticipation potential forwards.
3392500	3405500	It's never going to care about what happens two towns over three months from now it's impossible that its goal space is simply not that big right and then you can have humans which uniquely perhaps have have a cognitive light cone that's bigger than their own lifespan.
3405500	3416500	So the the human can comprehend and pursue goals that are that are guaranteed not achievable in your lifetime and that for all I know that may drive some interesting psychological pressures that that humans face.
3416500	3433500	But this idea that we are all made of a collective of agents each of these agents is solving problems in its own space and within that space there are differently scaled goals some some very very very very modest and some some some massive you know some humans are working for world peace and and
3433500	3445500	you know these kinds of very complex very large long term things so the idea is that in this multi scale system what happens is that higher levels bend the option space for their subunits so.
3445500	3461500	So so in if you've got a morphogenetic space that that that has attractors for different head shapes that's because those those by electrical states distort the space of gene expression for their cells such that all the cells need to do is go down their
3461500	3473500	concentration gradients the way they normally do they don't have to know where they're going but in fact they end up at a very particular morphological outcome because because the higher level has already distorted that space
3473500	3487500	and so they're all kinds of interesting work to be done looking at mathematical formalisms from relativity theory and from some other disciplines to look at how and how that works and in fact all that's happening here is the scaling up of goals.
3487500	3499500	So once you have a single cell that can do this cycle this this test measure act test compare act kind of cycle let's say for example for keeping pH once you start connecting cells into electrical networks.
3499500	3512500	Now everything scales up their goals are bigger their memories are bigger the the ability to act or bigger this is what evolution is is is doing it's constantly scaling up these these homeostatic units and it's actually.
3513500	3518500	Pivoting them through different spaces so very simple kinds of organisms.
3518500	3533500	All they could do is traverse metabolic space to keep alive, but eventually that works up to physiological spaces then gene expression becomes a thing and so they could work in transcriptional spaces, then multi the complex anatomy so so more for space and eventually when
3534500	3541500	you're in behavioral space and who knows what other spaces there are linguistic so just to close off in the last few minutes.
3541500	3544500	I want to I want to show you an example of novelty.
3544500	3554500	So I've been I've been talking about intelligence and the idea that these all of these different different systems are able to handle novel conditions I want to show you an extreme example of that.
3554500	3573500	So this is this is work that Joshua bongard lab and we are doing in in this new institute and we wanted to ask a simple question well a set of questions one is how much how much real time plasticity really is there I mean we've seen that you can get you can get pretty far away from the genomic default but what
3573500	3586500	what what else can these cells do and in fact when we look at development normal development to what extent is it is it fooling us what extent are we basically lulled into thinking that because acorns make oak trees and frogs eggs make make
3586500	3598500	frogs to what extent are we really fooled into thinking that that's basically all that they can do and so we started asking about you know what what might the default competencies of some of these cells and tissues be okay.
3598500	3615500	And so so what we did was was was this simple experiment just going to pause pause this here what we did was a simple experiment where I'm and this all the biology was done by Doug blackeston in my group and the computer science you're about to see was done by Sam Kreegman.
3616500	3628500	What we did was we took some skin cells off of a frog embryo and we put those skin cells by themselves in a dish so we didn't add anything there are no nano materials there are no genetic circuits being added there are no weird trans genes or chemicals.
3628500	3637500	What we do is subtract what do we subtract we subtract all this other stuff we subtract all their normal neighbors that are normally instructing these cells as to what to do.
3637500	3650500	We give them a chance to reboot their multi-cellularity now it's all sorts of things they could do so so they could just go and die they could spread out and get away from each other they could form a flat to a two dimensional monolayer the way that cell culture does.
3650500	3664500	There are many things that that could happen and so so here's what happens we we dissociate these cells we put them in this little little depression well overnight they sort of come together like this and then they form this little round ball this the flashes you're seeing is calcium
3664500	3680500	signaling so it's a calcium sensitive diet it they start to sort of signal to each other and what they form is something we call Xenobots now why Xenobots because Xenopus lavas is the name of the frog and and it's a bio robotics platform so the way it's the way they're
3680500	3689500	swimming is they have little hairs on their surface these hairs called cilia are normally used to redistribute mucus on them across the body of the frog.
3689500	3700500	Here what they've done is they've sort of they've learned to row and so and so the cells the silly are moving in this thing is propelling itself they can go in circles they can go straight back and forth like this.
3700500	3710500	Here you can see a bunch of them in their various this is just tracking data so so these two are interacting these are sitting there doing nothing this one's going on kind of a longer journey.
3710500	3716500	Here here's one navigating a maze this is still water there's no water movement in here.
3716500	3727500	So it moves along it takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall and then at some point for reasons that nobody nobody can predict yet it decides to turn around and go back where it came from.
3727500	3735500	So it again goes along does not need to bump into anything to know that it could take a corner here and then at this point.
3736500	3739500	Turns around turns around and goes and goes back.
3739500	3750500	Now, one of the things you can see with this calcium signaling is that they're very active. This looks very brain like this looks very similar to that zebrafish kind of signaling that that I showed you before, except there's no neurons here.
3750500	3756500	This is just skin. Everything that you just saw was 100% skin cells there's no there's no brain is no nervous system.
3756500	3764500	So not only, you know, so who knows we're still experimenting with like what what might they be saying to each other when they're when they're doing this.
3764500	3769500	But what one thing you could you can see they do a couple of interesting things one thing they can do is regenerate.
3769500	3772500	So here's here's one that was basically cut in half.
3772500	3781500	And now think about think about the force look at that hinge as it as it folds up about the force that it takes to clamp something shut from 180 degree position.
3781500	3785500	It folds up right to be back to its to its zen about shape.
3785500	3791500	And one of the things we started thinking about is how can we how can we predict what this kind of system is going to do.
3791500	3793500	I mean, nobody knew what what they were going to do.
3793500	3799500	So so Josh Vanguard lab started modeling their their behavior in this kind of simulation.
3799500	3806500	The simulation can actually tell you what the behavior of different shaped bots is going to be and then you can go ahead and microscope them or do various things.
3806500	3812500	You can see the patterns that this is just a carmine powder on the bottom of the dish and these guys sweep it along as they go.
3812500	3815500	So you can see all the cool patterns that they make as they're navigating.
3815500	3818500	But but here's something here's something interesting.
3818500	3827500	If you if you simulate them in an environment with a bunch of loose bricks, what you see is that they tend to they tend to collect them into little piles.
3827500	3829500	And so what what might be the significance of that?
3829500	3832500	Well, it turns out the real bots do exactly that.
3832500	3838500	And if you provide them, so these are zenobots provided with a bunch of loose skin cells.
3838500	3841500	So these white dots are just loose skin cells hanging around.
3841500	3845500	And what you'll see is that these the zenobots will run around.
3845500	3847500	They will collect either together or individually.
3847500	3848500	They'll make little piles.
3848500	3853500	And because this is an agent material, right, these cells are not passive.
3853500	3856500	They once the cells are collected into a pile, what do they make?
3856500	3857500	They make zenobots.
3857500	3859500	So this is kinematic self replication.
3859500	3863500	These bots make copies of themselves from the loose material in the dish.
3863500	3869500	We've made it impossible for them to replicate the way that normally frogs reproduce.
3869500	3870500	So they can't do that.
3870500	3875500	But within 48 hours, they show us that there's another way to do this that as far as we know, no other animal uses.
3875500	3881500	It's basically Von Neumann's dream, which is machines that will go out and build copies of themselves from parts that they find laying around.
3881500	3882500	That's what's going on here.
3882500	3887500	These zenobots build the next generation of zenobots out of these loose cells.
3887500	3890500	When those mature, I guess what they do, they run around do exactly the same thing.
3890500	3893500	You get the next generation and then the next generation after that.
3893500	3898500	Now, there's no strong heredity here yet, as far as we know.
3898500	3901500	And the reason it works here is really critical.
3901500	3905500	The reason it works is the exact same reason that we were able to make zenobots in the first place.
3905500	3908500	Because these cells are not passive Legos.
3908500	3913500	They are an agent material that once they get together in a particular group, they know what to do.
3913500	3916500	They have an innate preference to make bots.
3916500	3919500	So that's why these bots are able to make new bots.
3919500	3925500	So here's kind of the amazing thing about it is that same genome.
3925500	3929500	So if you were to sequence a zenobot, all you would ever see is the Zenopus-Levis genome.
3929500	3931500	You'd have no idea that it was any different.
3931500	3936500	That same genome can do at least two different life histories.
3936500	3937500	It can do this.
3937500	3943500	So normal Zenopus stages and then normal tappel behavior.
3943500	3944500	Or it can do this.
3944500	3945500	Here's an early zenobot.
3945500	3947500	Here's a zenobot at about two months.
3947500	3948500	It has a developmental sequence.
3948500	3949500	It's turning into something.
3949500	3950500	What is that?
3950500	3951500	I have no idea what that is.
3951500	3953500	There's never been any zenobots before.
3953500	3957500	So it's some kind of novel developmental stage.
3957500	3960500	And eventually they have these kinds of behaviors.
3960500	3961500	So we're still working out.
3961500	3963500	We don't know how much cognition they actually have.
3963500	3964500	Can they learn?
3964500	3966500	Can they have preferences?
3966500	3967500	What do they react to?
3967500	3968500	We don't know.
3968500	3969500	We're still figuring that out.
3969500	3974500	But the amazing thing about it is that for most animals,
3974500	3977500	the way they navigate both physical and anatomical space,
3977500	3980500	when you ask why do they have a certain number of legs,
3980500	3982500	a certain color, certain behaviors,
3982500	3983500	the answer is always,
3983500	3984500	well, because for millions of years,
3984500	3986500	the ancestors were selected for this or that
3986500	3988500	and everybody else died off and now this is what you have.
3988500	3990500	Well, there's never been any zenobots.
3990500	3992500	And there's never been selection to be a good zenobot.
3992500	3994500	All of this is created on the fly.
3994500	3995500	This is what they do.
3995500	3998500	They create a coherent organism.
3998500	4002500	And by the way, if you ask what do skin cells normally want to do,
4002500	4004500	you might think that what they normally want to do
4004500	4007500	is to be this like passive two-dimensional layer
4007500	4009500	on the outside of an animal to keep out the bacteria.
4009500	4010500	That isn't what they want to do.
4010500	4012500	That's what they're bullied into doing
4012500	4014500	by the instructive interactions with the rest of the cells.
4014500	4015500	If you don't have those cells,
4015500	4017500	this is what they're actually,
4017500	4019500	this is actually their default behavior.
4019500	4022500	So what evolution does is what bioengineers can
4022500	4024500	and will be doing is behavior shaping.
4024500	4027500	It's figuring out signals to get your agential material,
4027500	4029500	not passive, not a blank slate,
4029500	4031500	but your agential material to do whatever you want to do.
4031500	4035500	So I'm just going to close up here with a couple of thoughts.
4035500	4039500	This is just a kind of an overview of this framework
4039500	4041500	that we've been working on.
4041500	4043500	This kind of continuum of agency
4043500	4046500	across very diverse implementations.
4046500	4049500	The idea of scaling the boundaries of goals
4049500	4051500	for any particular system as a way to compare
4051500	4053500	radically different types of intelligences
4053500	4055500	in different spaces.
4055500	4057500	Bioelectricity is a particular example.
4057500	4058500	It's not the only one.
4058500	4060500	I'm sure there are other ways to tell this story,
4060500	4063500	but bioelectricity is a really great way to look at
4063500	4067500	what is the cognitive medium of a collective intelligence
4067500	4070500	and it seems to be electricity in many cases.
4070500	4073500	And there are all kinds of implications for evolution,
4073500	4077500	including asking questions about where do these goals come from?
4077500	4080500	If it's not just selection, where in fact do they come from?
4080500	4081500	And so just to finish up,
4081500	4084500	I want to point out that one of the consequences
4084500	4087500	of the fact that biology can solve problems on the fly
4087500	4089500	and that it's incredibly interoperable
4089500	4092500	is that pretty much any combination of evolved material,
4092500	4094500	meaning cells or tissues or genes,
4094500	4097500	design materials, so smart nano materials,
4097500	4101500	all kinds of constructs, and software,
4101500	4104500	any combination of these is some viable creature.
4104500	4107500	And so when Darwin said Endless Form's most beautiful
4107500	4110500	being impressed with a variety of biology
4110500	4113500	that he was seeing around, that's just all of that.
4113500	4115500	Everything on Earth is a tiny corner
4115500	4117500	of this incredibly huge option space
4117500	4119500	which we're already beginning to explore.
4119500	4122500	So there are already cyborgs, humans with various implants,
4122500	4125500	both sensory and effectors.
4125500	4127500	People can run wheelchairs with their minds
4127500	4130500	and have all kinds of sensors attached to them.
4130500	4132500	Hybrots, which are brains driving vehicles
4132500	4135500	instead of biological bodies.
4135500	4138500	People started a long time ago making chimeras,
4138500	4140500	so mules, horses and donkeys make mules.
4140500	4142500	So you can start to mix genetic material.
4142500	4145500	After that, people would make grafts and plants
4145500	4147500	and mix at the cellular level.
4147500	4150500	Every combination, we are going to be living in a world
4150500	4152500	where we are surrounded by agents
4152500	4155500	that don't look like anything familiar
4155500	4157500	on the phylogenetic treatment.
4157500	4159500	This means that we have massive implications
4159500	4163500	for systems of ethics because the old traditional framework
4163500	4165500	where you look at something and you ask,
4165500	4167500	where did it come from?
4167500	4169500	Would it come from a factory or was it natural?
4169500	4171500	And what does it look like?
4171500	4173500	Does it look like a fish, an ape or a human
4173500	4175500	or something else?
4175500	4178500	Those kinds of touchstones are going to be completely useless
4178500	4182500	in deciding how to relate to these beings
4182500	4184500	that are going to be around us in terms of
4184500	4187500	what do we owe them, what can we expect of them,
4187500	4189500	all of these things.
4189500	4191500	We're not going to be able to rely on familiar categories
4191500	4194500	of where did it come from and how much like a human
4194500	4196500	does it look.
4196500	4198500	That's going to be gone.
4198500	4200500	We're not going to survive the next few decades.
4200500	4202500	So we are going to need to develop novel frameworks
4202500	4204500	because life is so good at navigating these spaces
4204500	4206500	that all of these things are going to be viable.
4206500	4208500	So I'll just close by saying that
4208500	4210500	all of this is discussed in great detail
4210500	4212500	in various papers.
4212500	4214500	Anybody just please email me and I'll send you everything.
4214500	4217500	I want to thank the various intelligent beings
4217500	4219500	that contributed to all the work I showed you.
4219500	4221500	So all of our postdocs, PhD students,
4221500	4223500	the model systems that we work with,
4223500	4225500	they do all the heavy lifting, all the slime molds
4225500	4228500	and the planarian tap molds and everything else.
4228500	4230500	And of course our funders.
4230500	4232500	And again, two disclosures.
4232500	4234500	So Morphosuticals is a company around
4234500	4236500	limb regeneration and fauna systems
4236500	4238500	is a company for Xenobots.
4238500	4240500	And that's it. Thank you so much.
4240500	4242500	Thank you for listening.
4255500	4257500	Thank you.
