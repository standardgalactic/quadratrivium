1. Dr. Goldberg discusses the concept of agency in various systems, from simple to complex, and how this framework can be applied to understand collective intelligence in biological systems.
   
2. The presentation focuses on bioelectricity as a key cognitive medium in multicellular organisms, particularly highlighting the work with slime molds and planarians.

3. Slime molds exhibit goal-directed behavior without central control, demonstrating that collective intelligence can arise from local interactions without a leader or central command.

4. The planarian's ability to regenerate lost parts and adapt its nervous system after injury shows the plasticity of biological systems.

5. Dr. Goldberg proposes scaling the boundaries of goals as a method to compare different types of intelligences, including those of artificial systems like robots or software.

6. The continuum of agency suggests that any combination of evolved material (biological), design materials (synthetic or engineered), and software can result in viable entities.

7. The discovery of Xenobots, synthetic organisms created by assembling millions of cells into new forms of life, illustrates the potential for bioengineering to create novel beings.

8. The ethical implications of creating new forms of life are significant, as traditional categories and frameworks will become obsolete in understanding and interacting with these entities.

9. Dr. Goldberg emphasizes that we are on the cusp of a revolution in life forms, which necessitates the development of new ethical systems to address the relationships between humans and these novel agents.

10. Dr. Goldberg acknowledges the contributions of her colleagues, postdocs, PhD students, and the model organisms they study, as well as the support from funding sources and her affiliated companies, MorphoSuticals and Fauna Robotics (now known as Xenobots Inc.), which are involved in limb regeneration research and the creation of Xenobots, respectively.
