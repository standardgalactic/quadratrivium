0	5000	Welcome to this brief introduction to TiddlyWiki.
5000	9280	TiddlyWiki is a powerful note-taking tool that helps you collect and structure any kind
9280	12560	of information and work with it to get stuff done.
12560	17560	It's like a hypertext card index system from the future.
17560	23880	TiddlyWiki deals with information in bite-sized linked chunks called Tiddlers.
23880	27640	Tiddlers are the fundamental units of information in TiddlyWiki.
27640	32160	Tiddlers work best when they are as small as possible so that they can be reused by
32160	36440	weaving them together into different narratives and perspectives.
36440	40960	You can create relationships between Tiddlers with links.
40960	45800	They are typed with double-square brackets so that linking becomes part of the punctuation
45800	48040	of writing.
48040	51860	Tiddlers can also include formatting.
51860	55600	Formatted text is typed with special codes like this.
55600	58000	TiddlyWiki is not just for text.
58000	61160	Images are first-class citizens too.
61160	64920	TiddlyWiki even lets you edit images.
64920	71040	TiddlyWiki also supports audio.
71040	77320	Audio is a first-class citizen alongside images and text.
77320	81560	Tiddlers can be further structured with tags.
81560	85760	The Tiddler can have any number of tags to assign it to categories.
85760	91120	Each tag is shown with a drop-down menu that lets you view and navigate to other Tiddlers
91120	94240	with the same tag.
94240	99720	Transcluding a Tiddler inserts a copy of its content, allowing you to reuse the same text
99720	101880	or image more than once.
101880	108720	In this example, we're using the same picture of a cat stored in a Tiddler called MottovenJack.svg
108720	111400	in two different places.
111400	114320	We can also weave Tiddlers together into lists.
114320	120800	Here's an example of a list of all of the Tiddlers that carry a particular tag.
120800	126360	TiddlyWiki is flexible, but it can be extended in new ways with plugins.
126360	133440	For example, the KTex plugin uses an open-source library to typeset mathematical notation.
133440	138000	TiddlyWiki also has translations into several languages that have been created by members
138000	139680	of the community.
140680	147960	So, to find out how to get started, go to tiddlywiki.com slash hash getting started.
147960	148880	Thank you very much.
