1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
In south-east at six tonight, as some ratepayers in north London look forward to lower rates

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,000
in the year ahead, a report on the prospect for the rest of the region.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,400
Mastering the microchip, our two teenagers' expertise with computers is making them a

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
fortune.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
Reaching the victorians, the successes and failures of the campaign to conserve 19th

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
century buildings.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
And loyally...

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,880
Good evening. In south-east at six tonight, you don't need a computer to tell you that

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,400
we're now living in the age of the microchip. Our homes are rapidly being invaded by mini-computers.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,320
And slowly, we're even being programmed into how to use them.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,120
The British market is already worth millions of pounds, and early next week, the latest

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,840
generation of hard and software goes on show in Birmingham.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,760
The BBC's in the forefront with its huge computer literacy project, based on the corporation's

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,040
own microcomputer. There are over 25,000 of them in use in the country's schools.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,920
And already some youngsters in the south-east are making their fortune by mastering the

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
microchip.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,120
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Rustin and Alex Golner, who's 15, are two London schoolboys

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,920
who stand to make about Â£16,000 between them this year, cashing in on the computer craze.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,360
Jeremy's published three books about how to make the best use of your personal mini-computer.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,240
This one, it says, is destined to become the Bible of the BBC user. He's also come up

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,320
with a cassette that speeds up the BBC micro. His latest project is to produce computer

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,760
games for the BBC. Alex Golner's first book of computer programmes is due out in March.

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,280
Well, Jeremy, first of all, how did you become hooked and what's the fascination?

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Well, I started off being interested in electronics and building radios and so on. Then I started

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,280
building small computers, and from then I just started buying ready-built ones instead.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
It must be pretty difficult writing all these best-selling books and trying to struggle

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
with your A-levels.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,200
Uh, yeah, it is, actually. Very difficult. I failed my A-levels in the summer because

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
of it, actually.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Has it all been worthwhile?

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Oh, yeah, very much so.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,120
Now, the fascination up here, we've got this design, which I believe you call French tiles.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Now, is this just typical of the sort of patterns you can make?

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,480
Yeah, I mean, that's just a quarter of an hour's work or something, just as an amusement.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Talking of amusement, Alex, I mean, you've got your games book coming out soon. I think

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,480
a lot of children must have been given computer games for Christmas. Is it healthy to have

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
so many of them sitting around just plugged in playing them?

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,360
I don't think it actually burns their minds, but it does keep them off the street. And it

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,760
also helps them get ready for the big computer world, where nearly everything is being taken

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
over by computers.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,040
Do you think the sort of, uh, the way that teachers are getting computer studies across

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
in school is good?

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, there is a difference between computer studies and computer programming in the primary

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,440
schools to children are being taught about how to program their computer. While in their

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,920
comprehensive schools, people are actually told about their whole system of computing,

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
which is quite different.

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,640
Well, Jeremy, perhaps we could now take a look at your latest computer game, which is called

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Doctor Who, I believe. Now, how does this work? Is this sort of Pac-Man, isn't it?

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,640
Um, yeah, it's based on some of the ideas from Pac-Man, but it's a very long program.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,600
It's taken quite a long time to load off disk.

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,680
And it's going to pop up here. Ah, here we are.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, essentially, you're that little dot in the corner.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Down here?

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
You're chased by those worms who have now eaten me, which is the end of the game.

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,680
Oh, I see. Now, do you think that there is a bit of a generation gap when it comes to

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,480
working with computers? You know, people of my age, it's almost too late to learn?

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,560
No, not at all. Um, I found that quite a lot of people, old age pensioners and people of

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,600
any age, have been writing to me with comments about the books and suggestions and so on.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
So there must be quite a lot of people of all ages interested.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,040
What are the practical applications, really, for home computers? What's one of the most

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
useful things you can do with one in the home?

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,680
I think the most useful thing really is word processing for writing letters and so on.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,920
And then there are the less general applications like shopping lists and what I use it for

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,200
cataloging, cataloging records and books.

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,320
Well, I know you can play all kinds of tricks with it. And in fact, you've even been programming

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,160
it to actually show our South East at Six logo.

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,000
While you get that sorted out, let me just tell people what tomorrow's weather is going

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,400
to be like. Tomorrow will be a mostly cloudy day. And our picture, by the way, comes from

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Mr Page of the Biliriki in Essex. After a dry start, there will be some outbreaks of

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,680
rain for a time and then it will become drier later. It'll be somewhat less cold with afternoon

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,000
temperatures of seven degrees centigrade, as you can see there, 45 Fahrenheit. So rather

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,520
cloudy, some rain for a time. Jeremy, let's have a look at your South East at Six logo.

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,080
That's rather splendid, isn't it? How long did it actually take you to get that together?

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,800
About two hours.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,400
I mean, that's rather, I mean, it's very pretty, but do you think it was worth the effort?

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Well, yes and no. But there's actually quite a lot of complicated maths involved in that,

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,560
which just doesn't show up when you look at it.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,680
Well, Jeremy, I'll tell you now, I'll put you on the spot. You've got nine seconds to

80
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,000
see if you can punch up the nationwide programme. See what you can do. Off you go.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:29,920
Good evening nationwide tonight, underage drinkers. As a fresh campaign is launched to keep young

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,200
people off the bottle, we ask why do they do it and how do they get round the law?
