00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to this brief introduction to TiddlyWiki.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,280
TiddlyWiki is a powerful note-taking tool that helps you collect and structure any kind

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,560
of information and work with it to get stuff done.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,560
It's like a hypertext card index system from the future.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,880
TiddlyWiki deals with information in bite-sized linked chunks called Tiddlers.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,640
Tiddlers are the fundamental units of information in TiddlyWiki.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,160
Tiddlers work best when they are as small as possible so that they can be reused by

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,440
weaving them together into different narratives and perspectives.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,960
You can create relationships between Tiddlers with links.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,800
They are typed with double-square brackets so that linking becomes part of the punctuation

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,040
of writing.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,860
Tiddlers can also include formatting.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,600
Formatted text is typed with special codes like this.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
TiddlyWiki is not just for text.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,160
Images are first-class citizens too.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,920
TiddlyWiki even lets you edit images.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,040
TiddlyWiki also supports audio.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,320
Audio is a first-class citizen alongside images and text.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Tiddlers can be further structured with tags.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,760
The Tiddler can have any number of tags to assign it to categories.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Each tag is shown with a drop-down menu that lets you view and navigate to other Tiddlers

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,240
with the same tag.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,720
Transcluding a Tiddler inserts a copy of its content, allowing you to reuse the same text

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
or image more than once.

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,720
In this example, we're using the same picture of a cat stored in a Tiddler called MottovenJack.svg

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,400
in two different places.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,320
We can also weave Tiddlers together into lists.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,800
Here's an example of a list of all of the Tiddlers that carry a particular tag.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,360
TiddlyWiki is flexible, but it can be extended in new ways with plugins.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,440
For example, the KTex plugin uses an open-source library to typeset mathematical notation.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
TiddlyWiki also has translations into several languages that have been created by members

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
of the community.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,960
So, to find out how to get started, go to tiddlywiki.com slash hash getting started.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
Thank you very much.
