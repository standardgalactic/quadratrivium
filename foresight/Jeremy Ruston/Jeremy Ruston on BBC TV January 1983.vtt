00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
In south-east at six tonight, as some ratepayers in north London look forward to lower rates

00:07.680 --> 00:11.000
in the year ahead, a report on the prospect for the rest of the region.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.400
Mastering the microchip, our two teenagers' expertise with computers is making them a

00:15.400 --> 00:16.400
fortune.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.560
Reaching the victorians, the successes and failures of the campaign to conserve 19th

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
century buildings.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
And loyally...

00:34.560 --> 00:38.880
Good evening. In south-east at six tonight, you don't need a computer to tell you that

00:38.880 --> 00:44.400
we're now living in the age of the microchip. Our homes are rapidly being invaded by mini-computers.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.320
And slowly, we're even being programmed into how to use them.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.120
The British market is already worth millions of pounds, and early next week, the latest

00:51.120 --> 00:54.840
generation of hard and software goes on show in Birmingham.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.760
The BBC's in the forefront with its huge computer literacy project, based on the corporation's

00:59.760 --> 01:05.040
own microcomputer. There are over 25,000 of them in use in the country's schools.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.920
And already some youngsters in the south-east are making their fortune by mastering the

01:08.920 --> 01:09.920
microchip.

01:09.960 --> 01:15.120
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Rustin and Alex Golner, who's 15, are two London schoolboys

01:15.120 --> 01:20.920
who stand to make about Â£16,000 between them this year, cashing in on the computer craze.

01:20.920 --> 01:26.360
Jeremy's published three books about how to make the best use of your personal mini-computer.

01:26.360 --> 01:30.240
This one, it says, is destined to become the Bible of the BBC user. He's also come up

01:30.240 --> 01:35.320
with a cassette that speeds up the BBC micro. His latest project is to produce computer

01:35.360 --> 01:40.760
games for the BBC. Alex Golner's first book of computer programmes is due out in March.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.280
Well, Jeremy, first of all, how did you become hooked and what's the fascination?

01:44.280 --> 01:49.120
Well, I started off being interested in electronics and building radios and so on. Then I started

01:49.120 --> 01:53.280
building small computers, and from then I just started buying ready-built ones instead.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.880
It must be pretty difficult writing all these best-selling books and trying to struggle

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
with your A-levels.

01:57.880 --> 02:03.200
Uh, yeah, it is, actually. Very difficult. I failed my A-levels in the summer because

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
of it, actually.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
Has it all been worthwhile?

02:05.240 --> 02:06.640
Oh, yeah, very much so.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.120
Now, the fascination up here, we've got this design, which I believe you call French tiles.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.320
Now, is this just typical of the sort of patterns you can make?

02:14.320 --> 02:19.480
Yeah, I mean, that's just a quarter of an hour's work or something, just as an amusement.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.920
Talking of amusement, Alex, I mean, you've got your games book coming out soon. I think

02:22.920 --> 02:26.480
a lot of children must have been given computer games for Christmas. Is it healthy to have

02:26.480 --> 02:29.680
so many of them sitting around just plugged in playing them?

02:29.680 --> 02:34.360
I don't think it actually burns their minds, but it does keep them off the street. And it

02:34.360 --> 02:38.760
also helps them get ready for the big computer world, where nearly everything is being taken

02:38.760 --> 02:39.760
over by computers.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.040
Do you think the sort of, uh, the way that teachers are getting computer studies across

02:44.040 --> 02:45.200
in school is good?

02:45.200 --> 02:49.520
Well, there is a difference between computer studies and computer programming in the primary

02:49.520 --> 02:55.440
schools to children are being taught about how to program their computer. While in their

02:55.440 --> 02:59.920
comprehensive schools, people are actually told about their whole system of computing,

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
which is quite different.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.640
Well, Jeremy, perhaps we could now take a look at your latest computer game, which is called

03:04.640 --> 03:08.120
Doctor Who, I believe. Now, how does this work? Is this sort of Pac-Man, isn't it?

03:08.120 --> 03:12.640
Um, yeah, it's based on some of the ideas from Pac-Man, but it's a very long program.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.600
It's taken quite a long time to load off disk.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.680
And it's going to pop up here. Ah, here we are.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.800
Yeah, essentially, you're that little dot in the corner.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Down here?

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Yes.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.480
You're chased by those worms who have now eaten me, which is the end of the game.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.680
Oh, I see. Now, do you think that there is a bit of a generation gap when it comes to

03:30.680 --> 03:34.480
working with computers? You know, people of my age, it's almost too late to learn?

03:34.480 --> 03:39.560
No, not at all. Um, I found that quite a lot of people, old age pensioners and people of

03:39.560 --> 03:43.600
any age, have been writing to me with comments about the books and suggestions and so on.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.240
So there must be quite a lot of people of all ages interested.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.040
What are the practical applications, really, for home computers? What's one of the most

03:50.040 --> 03:52.120
useful things you can do with one in the home?

03:52.160 --> 03:56.680
I think the most useful thing really is word processing for writing letters and so on.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.920
And then there are the less general applications like shopping lists and what I use it for

04:00.920 --> 04:03.200
cataloging, cataloging records and books.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.320
Well, I know you can play all kinds of tricks with it. And in fact, you've even been programming

04:07.320 --> 04:10.160
it to actually show our South East at Six logo.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.000
While you get that sorted out, let me just tell people what tomorrow's weather is going

04:14.000 --> 04:19.400
to be like. Tomorrow will be a mostly cloudy day. And our picture, by the way, comes from

04:19.400 --> 04:24.200
Mr Page of the Biliriki in Essex. After a dry start, there will be some outbreaks of

04:24.200 --> 04:29.680
rain for a time and then it will become drier later. It'll be somewhat less cold with afternoon

04:29.680 --> 04:34.000
temperatures of seven degrees centigrade, as you can see there, 45 Fahrenheit. So rather

04:34.000 --> 04:39.520
cloudy, some rain for a time. Jeremy, let's have a look at your South East at Six logo.

04:39.520 --> 04:44.080
That's rather splendid, isn't it? How long did it actually take you to get that together?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.800
About two hours.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.400
I mean, that's rather, I mean, it's very pretty, but do you think it was worth the effort?

04:51.400 --> 04:55.840
Well, yes and no. But there's actually quite a lot of complicated maths involved in that,

04:55.840 --> 04:57.560
which just doesn't show up when you look at it.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.680
Well, Jeremy, I'll tell you now, I'll put you on the spot. You've got nine seconds to

05:00.680 --> 05:05.000
see if you can punch up the nationwide programme. See what you can do. Off you go.

05:15.800 --> 05:29.920
Good evening nationwide tonight, underage drinkers. As a fresh campaign is launched to keep young

05:29.920 --> 05:34.200
people off the bottle, we ask why do they do it and how do they get round the law?
