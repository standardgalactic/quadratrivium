0	7680	In south-east at six tonight, as some ratepayers in north London look forward to lower rates
7680	11000	in the year ahead, a report on the prospect for the rest of the region.
11000	15400	Mastering the microchip, our two teenagers' expertise with computers is making them a
15400	16400	fortune.
16400	20560	Reaching the victorians, the successes and failures of the campaign to conserve 19th
20560	21560	century buildings.
21560	22560	And loyally...
34560	38880	Good evening. In south-east at six tonight, you don't need a computer to tell you that
38880	44400	we're now living in the age of the microchip. Our homes are rapidly being invaded by mini-computers.
44400	47320	And slowly, we're even being programmed into how to use them.
47320	51120	The British market is already worth millions of pounds, and early next week, the latest
51120	54840	generation of hard and software goes on show in Birmingham.
54840	59760	The BBC's in the forefront with its huge computer literacy project, based on the corporation's
59760	65040	own microcomputer. There are over 25,000 of them in use in the country's schools.
65040	68920	And already some youngsters in the south-east are making their fortune by mastering the
68920	69920	microchip.
69960	75120	Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Rustin and Alex Golner, who's 15, are two London schoolboys
75120	80920	who stand to make about Â£16,000 between them this year, cashing in on the computer craze.
80920	86360	Jeremy's published three books about how to make the best use of your personal mini-computer.
86360	90240	This one, it says, is destined to become the Bible of the BBC user. He's also come up
90240	95320	with a cassette that speeds up the BBC micro. His latest project is to produce computer
95360	100760	games for the BBC. Alex Golner's first book of computer programmes is due out in March.
100760	104280	Well, Jeremy, first of all, how did you become hooked and what's the fascination?
104280	109120	Well, I started off being interested in electronics and building radios and so on. Then I started
109120	113280	building small computers, and from then I just started buying ready-built ones instead.
113280	116880	It must be pretty difficult writing all these best-selling books and trying to struggle
116880	117880	with your A-levels.
117880	123200	Uh, yeah, it is, actually. Very difficult. I failed my A-levels in the summer because
123240	124240	of it, actually.
124240	125240	Has it all been worthwhile?
125240	126640	Oh, yeah, very much so.
126640	131120	Now, the fascination up here, we've got this design, which I believe you call French tiles.
131120	134320	Now, is this just typical of the sort of patterns you can make?
134320	139480	Yeah, I mean, that's just a quarter of an hour's work or something, just as an amusement.
139480	142920	Talking of amusement, Alex, I mean, you've got your games book coming out soon. I think
142920	146480	a lot of children must have been given computer games for Christmas. Is it healthy to have
146480	149680	so many of them sitting around just plugged in playing them?
149680	154360	I don't think it actually burns their minds, but it does keep them off the street. And it
154360	158760	also helps them get ready for the big computer world, where nearly everything is being taken
158760	159760	over by computers.
159760	164040	Do you think the sort of, uh, the way that teachers are getting computer studies across
164040	165200	in school is good?
165200	169520	Well, there is a difference between computer studies and computer programming in the primary
169520	175440	schools to children are being taught about how to program their computer. While in their
175440	179920	comprehensive schools, people are actually told about their whole system of computing,
179920	180920	which is quite different.
180920	184640	Well, Jeremy, perhaps we could now take a look at your latest computer game, which is called
184640	188120	Doctor Who, I believe. Now, how does this work? Is this sort of Pac-Man, isn't it?
188120	192640	Um, yeah, it's based on some of the ideas from Pac-Man, but it's a very long program.
192640	194600	It's taken quite a long time to load off disk.
194600	196680	And it's going to pop up here. Ah, here we are.
196680	200800	Yeah, essentially, you're that little dot in the corner.
200800	201800	Down here?
201800	202800	Yes.
202800	206480	You're chased by those worms who have now eaten me, which is the end of the game.
206480	210680	Oh, I see. Now, do you think that there is a bit of a generation gap when it comes to
210680	214480	working with computers? You know, people of my age, it's almost too late to learn?
214480	219560	No, not at all. Um, I found that quite a lot of people, old age pensioners and people of
219560	223600	any age, have been writing to me with comments about the books and suggestions and so on.
223600	226240	So there must be quite a lot of people of all ages interested.
226240	230040	What are the practical applications, really, for home computers? What's one of the most
230040	232120	useful things you can do with one in the home?
232160	236680	I think the most useful thing really is word processing for writing letters and so on.
236680	240920	And then there are the less general applications like shopping lists and what I use it for
240920	243200	cataloging, cataloging records and books.
243200	247320	Well, I know you can play all kinds of tricks with it. And in fact, you've even been programming
247320	250160	it to actually show our South East at Six logo.
250160	254000	While you get that sorted out, let me just tell people what tomorrow's weather is going
254000	259400	to be like. Tomorrow will be a mostly cloudy day. And our picture, by the way, comes from
259400	264200	Mr Page of the Biliriki in Essex. After a dry start, there will be some outbreaks of
264200	269680	rain for a time and then it will become drier later. It'll be somewhat less cold with afternoon
269680	274000	temperatures of seven degrees centigrade, as you can see there, 45 Fahrenheit. So rather
274000	279520	cloudy, some rain for a time. Jeremy, let's have a look at your South East at Six logo.
279520	284080	That's rather splendid, isn't it? How long did it actually take you to get that together?
284080	285800	About two hours.
286720	291400	I mean, that's rather, I mean, it's very pretty, but do you think it was worth the effort?
291400	295840	Well, yes and no. But there's actually quite a lot of complicated maths involved in that,
295840	297560	which just doesn't show up when you look at it.
297560	300680	Well, Jeremy, I'll tell you now, I'll put you on the spot. You've got nine seconds to
300680	305000	see if you can punch up the nationwide programme. See what you can do. Off you go.
315800	329920	Good evening nationwide tonight, underage drinkers. As a fresh campaign is launched to keep young
329920	334200	people off the bottle, we ask why do they do it and how do they get round the law?
