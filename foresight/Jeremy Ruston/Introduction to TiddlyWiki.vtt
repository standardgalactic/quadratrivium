Welcome to this brief introduction to TiddlyWiki.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.280
TiddlyWiki is a powerful note-taking tool that helps you collect and structure any kind

00:09.280 --> 00:12.560
of information and work with it to get stuff done.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.560
It's like a hypertext card index system from the future.

00:17.560 --> 00:23.880
TiddlyWiki deals with information in bite-sized linked chunks called Tiddlers.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.640
Tiddlers are the fundamental units of information in TiddlyWiki.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.160
Tiddlers work best when they are as small as possible so that they can be reused by

00:32.160 --> 00:36.440
weaving them together into different narratives and perspectives.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.960
You can create relationships between Tiddlers with links.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.800
They are typed with double-square brackets so that linking becomes part of the punctuation

00:45.800 --> 00:48.040
of writing.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.860
Tiddlers can also include formatting.

00:51.860 --> 00:55.600
Formatted text is typed with special codes like this.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.000
TiddlyWiki is not just for text.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.160
Images are first-class citizens too.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.920
TiddlyWiki even lets you edit images.

01:04.920 --> 01:11.040
TiddlyWiki also supports audio.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.320
Audio is a first-class citizen alongside images and text.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.560
Tiddlers can be further structured with tags.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.760
The Tiddler can have any number of tags to assign it to categories.

01:25.760 --> 01:31.120
Each tag is shown with a drop-down menu that lets you view and navigate to other Tiddlers

01:31.120 --> 01:34.240
with the same tag.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.720
Transcluding a Tiddler inserts a copy of its content, allowing you to reuse the same text

01:39.720 --> 01:41.880
or image more than once.

01:41.880 --> 01:48.720
In this example, we're using the same picture of a cat stored in a Tiddler called MottovenJack.svg

01:48.720 --> 01:51.400
in two different places.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.320
We can also weave Tiddlers together into lists.

01:54.320 --> 02:00.800
Here's an example of a list of all of the Tiddlers that carry a particular tag.

02:00.800 --> 02:06.360
TiddlyWiki is flexible, but it can be extended in new ways with plugins.

02:06.360 --> 02:13.440
For example, the KTex plugin uses an open-source library to typeset mathematical notation.

02:13.440 --> 02:18.000
TiddlyWiki also has translations into several languages that have been created by members

02:18.000 --> 02:19.680
of the community.

02:20.680 --> 02:27.960
So, to find out how to get started, go to tiddlywiki.com slash hash getting started.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.880
Thank you very much.
