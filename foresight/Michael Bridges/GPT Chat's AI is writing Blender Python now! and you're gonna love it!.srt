1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
It deletes the default cube to begin with.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
Even an AI deletes the default cube before adding things in.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,040
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,760
Today, we're going to explore using

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,520
Chat GPT in order to write some Python code for Blender for us.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,640
Now, I've tried it in the background and I've been absolutely amazed,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,040
but one warning here, it's not consistent.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,360
If you want to follow along,

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
you can go to, let's just make this bigger for a second,

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,040
chat.openai.com forward slash chat.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, so let's just try something straight away.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,600
Let's stack five cubes on top of each other in Blender using Python.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
That's very badly worded.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,720
Let's just roll with it.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm not going to correct typos either.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,280
It seems to be absolutely fine with that.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
Now, it is very, very busy at the moment,

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,400
so it can take a few minutes to do something,

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,720
which is annoying.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,480
And usually, if it's hanging like this,

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,440
it's just overloaded at the moment.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,800
At which point, I'm going to have to stop the video

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
and wait until it's quieter.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,600
Oh, here we go.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,360
It's telling me what it's going to do.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,040
And it's also used a for loop.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay, this is brilliant,

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,040
because before, when I was trying it,

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,520
it wouldn't use a for loop initially.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
So let's just go and take this.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Okay, there's a copy code button I should have learnt by now.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,560
And let's remove everything from our scene

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,480
and let's run that code.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,440
Okay, so that doesn't work, did it?

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,280
This is one of the things about GPT.

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,960
It can end up sounding very confident.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,440
I mean, it's given us this here.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,560
We run through this code.

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,360
We'll probably work out why it's not there.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,600
Move the other cubes above the first cube.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,960
Interesting, it's only done one, four.

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,120
There are other cubes there by the looks of things,

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,720
but where they've gone, who knows?

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's delete everything out of our scene again

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,800
and let's just try something else.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,920
Let's clear down what we've got here, actually,

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,120
so we can reset the thread

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,800
so it won't remember anything from before.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Using Python, write a script.

50
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,880
I will be able to type one day a script

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,880
to stack four cubes on top of each other in Blender.

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,080
Let's see how it handles this.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,000
It deletes the default cube to begin with.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Even an AI deletes the default cube

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,560
before adding things in.

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
Now, this is a very linear script.

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
I would not write something like this

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
unless I was really, really testing something very specific.

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,400
Cube not found, of course.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,880
Let's just get rid of that.

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Go file, new, general.

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Let's assume that there's something in the scene,

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,600
which is actually quite a clever thing for it to do.

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I've not asked it to delete the cube,

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,720
which is maybe a bit backwards

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,560
because I haven't asked it to do any of that,

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
but there we go.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
We've got four cubes, that's on top of one another.

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
One of the great things about this

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
is we can start adding to it.

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Add a monkey to the top.

72
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Now, is it aware of Suzanne the monkey?

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Use the following code.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,200
So it's built upon its previous stuff at the second cube.

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Now, one thing I have noticed here

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
is if this gets too long,

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,520
then we're gonna end up with it just pausing and stopping.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
So I can see straight away

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,800
that's gonna add it on top, absolutely fine.

80
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not gonna actually paste that in.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What I'm gonna do is can you add loops?

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,760
Because I wouldn't add it in, add it in, add it in.

83
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,640
I would actually loop around those cubes.

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Let's see if it does that.

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
It's also deleting the default cube,

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,880
which you can't do, of course, the second time around.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
So I'm gonna delete that,

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,320
delete everything from the scene, add in the cube.

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
There we go.

90
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
So here it goes.

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
Oh, it's split it out.

92
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
So here's our loop to add the monkey.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
Oh, it separated out that.

94
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
Oh, that is interesting.

95
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay, well, let's see if this new script works.

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
And this is great.

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,160
I haven't had to train it or tell it

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,720
anything about the Blender API.

99
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
And there we go.

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,960
We've got Suzanne on top of four cubes.

101
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,120
Okay, so that's pretty straightforward.

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,960
How far can we push this?

103
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,220
Well, I've tried a couple of things.

104
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,880
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

105
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm gonna delete everything but that bottom cube.

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,280
Build a Mayan pyramid.

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
This is actually one that I've done some work on myself

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
in an introduction to Python course

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm working on at the moment is building a Mayan pyramid.

110
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,640
Let's see how the AI handles it.

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
It's gonna be specific here.

112
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
And sometimes you have to massage the language

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,960
that you use to build a script, to build,

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm sorry, write a script,

115
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,920
to build a Mayan pyramid out of cubes.

116
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,960
Now, the first time I ran this,

117
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,180
it worked absolutely perfectly.

118
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,920
The second time I ran it, it failed miserably.

119
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
This is interesting.

120
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
It's looping around.

121
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
This is completely different code.

122
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,080
If this doesn't work, by the way,

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,000
because I am just gonna copy and paste it in.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,520
If this doesn't work, I'll show you a screenshot

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
of the code as I was playing around with it before.

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
Okay, that's an interesting interpretation of it.

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,980
It kind of works.

128
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,440
We can see that it's building it out of cubes

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,080
and then adjusting the cubes widths and heights

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,720
to try and fit it in.

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,000
That didn't work.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's just blank this out the way and say,

133
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,800
so write a script to build a Mayan pyramid

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
from only primitive in Blender.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,520
That should have said primitives, but there we go.

136
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,600
So it's just giving us instructions.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Okay, that's writing a script rather than code.

138
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,300
So I need to be more specific.

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Okay, so this is great.

140
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,880
This is giving us an actual script

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
as in how to, oh, it's giving us materials.

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,320
I didn't ask it to do that.

143
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Oh, wow.

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
That is impressive.

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
You see, it's done extra stuff here.

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
I don't really want to add materials at the moment,

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,560
although it seems like it can do that.

148
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,960
It's set to diffuse color and specular intensity.

149
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,040
So this isn't a material in the same way

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,920
that you'd usually set up a material using a node graph.

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,320
This is just setting it manually.

152
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,120
It's looking like it's setting it to a mid-level gray

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
and then applying the material.

154
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
That's kind of cool.

155
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
It separated it out.

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Let's try something new.

157
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,560
It's obviously not going to do the Mayan pyramid.

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,320
This is what it did the first time I ever tried it

159
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,920
and it's not done it since.

160
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,560
And that's important to realize

161
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,440
that if you copy exactly what I'm doing,

162
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,880
you're going to get a different result.

163
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,880
So build a castle out of cubes.

164
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,400
This is absolutely nuts.

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Oh no, it's frozen.

166
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,880
I hate it when it freezes like that.

167
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,480
That means it's just run out.

168
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Can you put this all in one script?

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Oh, please work.

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Oh, look like a Mayan pyramid and a castle.

171
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,880
Okay, it's remembered the stuff from before.

172
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm not sure whether this is going to work.

173
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
It's probably going to stop typing everything out.

174
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,040
Yep, there we go.

175
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,440
With two walls and a Mayan pyramid in your blend of sea.

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Well, let's just give it a go.

178
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's see what it ends up looking like.

179
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Let's get rid of everything here.

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
Get rid of everything here.

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
Are we still deleting the default cube?

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,440
I have no idea.

183
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
No, we're not.

184
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
That's fine.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Let's decided not to do that anymore.

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
And we end up with this.

187
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Yeah, this is not a great demonstration of it working.

188
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,080
That's fine.

189
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
Let's try something completely new.

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's go to the menu, reset the thread.

191
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay, so I'm not going to play around

192
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,560
with the Mayan pyramid anymore,

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,320
but I will put up on the screen here.

194
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,920
The first time I ever tried it, it was successful.

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
And this is one of the things.

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,200
AI is not coming for our jobs at the moment.

197
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,560
It will eventually reach a point where it is very, very good.

198
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,760
At that point, what we're able to do as artists

199
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,600
or developers is use it to help us,

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,640
use it to explore ideas really quickly.

201
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,760
Ultimately, it's very good at spewing out rubbish,

202
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,000
but looks good rubbish.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,640
And that's one of the things that can trip you up.

204
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,600
So let's try something completely new here.

205
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,760
Let's write a blender script.

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
And what do we want to do?

207
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,880
To create Stonehenge out of cubes.

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,160
Now, obviously it knows what a Mayan pyramid is,

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,000
so I'm guessing it's going to know what Stonehenge is.

210
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,320
And this is one of the things.

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
We can just explore ideas.

212
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,640
And I would say that looking at code that I've written

213
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
and looking at code that it's produced,

214
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
it does it in a very dumb way.

215
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,440
It may work, it may not work.

216
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,480
And it's just a matter of trying.

217
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,520
I have seen it come out with a very interesting way

218
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,440
of actually approaching a problem,

219
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,120
which is great because it means that I'm also learning

220
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,400
because it has produced something that does indeed work.

221
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay, so in front of us here we have

222
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
what the Mayan pyramid that it did the first time around.

223
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,040
So a couple of things that is really interesting

224
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,520
and certainly not the way that I would approach this code.

225
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,000
I'd probably not have the bpy.obstopmesh.primitive.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,280
I would make this much more readable.

227
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,080
I mean, it is quite readable at the moment

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,960
because it's very short,

229
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
but this was an incredible just approach

230
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,960
and I didn't delete the default cube or anything.

231
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,120
You can see it got it straight away.

232
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,640
I wish I'd recorded what the prompt was.

233
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,120
I wasn't thinking about this when I was just exploring it.

234
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,560
In fact, I wish I even, I was recording at the time

235
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,560
because I got really excited when it nailed this first time.

236
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,200
But anyway, so you can see here,

237
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,800
it actually made some really concise code

238
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,040
and I think it failed on the scene.update at the end

239
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,520
or something along those lines.

240
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,920
So it can do some really useful stuff,

241
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,200
but sometimes it does it in a different way.

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,640
And I'll show you.

243
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
Let's have a look at what it's done here.

244
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
Oh, ooh, ooh, ouch.

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,200
Okay, it's made an array of positions.

246
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,920
That's not what it did when I tried this before.

247
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,800
It actually used a math library.

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,280
It drew a circle and placed the pillars and stuff

249
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,680
on the circle, but let's see what it's created.

250
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,040
I mean, ultimately, it's created this big block here.

251
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,360
Let's get rid of that.

252
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,720
So this is what its interpretation of Stonehenge is.

253
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,800
It's wrong.

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
That isn't Stonehenge.

255
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
Let's just, for argument's sake,

256
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,760
say that is close, but doesn't look like Stonehenge.

257
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,500
It needs to be circular.

258
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,280
Ah, here we go.

259
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,480
This looks a bit more promising.

260
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm not gonna say it's gonna work

261
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
because who knows what it's gonna create.

262
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
Let's just clear our scene out

263
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,480
while we're waiting for it to write our code for us.

264
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,160
And boom, let's just run it.

265
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay, interesting.

266
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Let's get rid of that.

267
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
It's made there.

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,320
Okay, you see, it's got an idea of what's going on.

269
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
And when I tried this before,

270
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
I tried it with things like,

271
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
oh, could you make the Stonehenge a bit more irregular?

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,400
And if I got footage of that,

273
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,720
I'll pop that up on the screen.

274
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,000
I tried to massage it to get it to the point.

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,640
At which point, I could have just made it myself

276
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,360
in half the time.

277
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
So one of the things that I did have

278
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
quite a bit of success with

279
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,560
was writing some helper code.

280
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,080
So let's clear everything down.

281
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,200
And again, I should really put this in a buffer.

282
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm gonna write a script

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,520
to select every object in Blender

284
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,160
or something along those lines.

285
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
So if I have a look at my objects here,

286
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,040
they're all named cube, right?

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,480
All of these stem from a cube that's been manipulated.

288
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,600
So I've asked it to write a script

289
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
to select all mesh objects.

290
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,520
So I'm being specific about what type of objects in Blender

291
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,200
with names containing the word cube.

292
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,560
Now, this is something that I have done in the past.

293
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
So I'll be interested to see how it approaches it.

294
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
And what we'll also do here

295
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,240
is add in a point, bam, just over here.

296
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,200
Let's add in a camera as well.

297
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
It doesn't matter what they're pointing at.

298
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,440
It's just so we've got something else in our scene

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,560
so we can make sure it is only selecting

300
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
the things that we want it to.

301
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Okay, let's run that.

302
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,760
So this is interesting.

303
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,800
It's approaching it from a scene level.

304
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,480
So we see here, bpy.context.scene.

305
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,680
I would typically approach this.

306
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,000
I suppose that is a quite a neat way of doing it.

307
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,560
If I was gonna do selecting all types though,

308
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,520
I'd probably go to bpy.data.objects.

309
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
If the type equals mesh, that's correct.

310
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,160
The cube is in the objects name and said it's true.

311
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,000
Nice.

312
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,760
So the other thing that we're gonna add in really quickly

313
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,960
is add in an icosphere just here

314
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,880
so we know it is only selecting objects

315
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
that aren't named cube.

316
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,920
Okay, let's copy that.

317
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,560
Go to our code and paste that in.

318
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Make sure nothing is selected and run our script.

319
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Look at that.

320
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,440
That is awesome.

321
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
The only thing that this is done

322
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,800
that you'd now need to work out

323
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,400
is make sure that this is not the active selected

324
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,920
because that's gonna do stuff to that icosphere.

325
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,760
Make sure one of those objects is the active selected.

326
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,400
Now, of course, this time round,

327
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
one of the things I've not done,

328
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
I've not asked it and it knows

329
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,120
that it requires Python code.

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,080
That's important.

331
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,840
Let's just see if that works.

332
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Copy code, paste it in.

333
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,040
Yes, yes, now one of our objects

334
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,880
is the active selected, perfect.

335
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,720
So this is how it can really help

336
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,880
by making some helper code for you

337
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,520
or just as I say, exploring different things.

338
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,000
The important thing is that AI is not coming after us yet,

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
but we can use it to support what we're doing,

340
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,960
to help us and aid us in producing better work more quickly,

341
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
which is brilliant.

342
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
Wow, so this is absolutely amazing.

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,400
I love this sort of stuff and it being developed,

344
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,480
whether it's creating images for us or writing code for us,

345
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,720
I think this is a great help at all.

346
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Now, if you try this yourself,

347
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,360
I'd love to see what you end up creating,

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,920
so do share that with me.

349
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
And if you want to learn about Python in Blender

350
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
in a bit more structured manner,

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,840
then check out these videos here.

352
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
I'll see you in the next one.
