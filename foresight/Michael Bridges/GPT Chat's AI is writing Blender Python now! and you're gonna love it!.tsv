0	3600	It deletes the default cube to begin with.
3600	8240	Even an AI deletes the default cube before adding things in.
8240	10040	Hello, everybody, and welcome.
10040	11760	Today, we're going to explore using
11760	16520	Chat GPT in order to write some Python code for Blender for us.
16520	19640	Now, I've tried it in the background and I've been absolutely amazed,
19640	22040	but one warning here, it's not consistent.
22040	23360	If you want to follow along,
23360	25920	you can go to, let's just make this bigger for a second,
25920	30040	chat.openai.com forward slash chat.
30040	33000	Okay, so let's just try something straight away.
33000	42600	Let's stack five cubes on top of each other in Blender using Python.
42600	44120	That's very badly worded.
44120	45720	Let's just roll with it.
45720	47320	I'm not going to correct typos either.
47320	49280	It seems to be absolutely fine with that.
49280	51680	Now, it is very, very busy at the moment,
51680	54400	so it can take a few minutes to do something,
54680	55720	which is annoying.
55720	58480	And usually, if it's hanging like this,
58480	60440	it's just overloaded at the moment.
60440	62800	At which point, I'm going to have to stop the video
62800	65280	and wait until it's quieter.
65280	66600	Oh, here we go.
66600	68360	It's telling me what it's going to do.
68360	70040	And it's also used a for loop.
70040	71440	Okay, this is brilliant,
71440	74040	because before, when I was trying it,
74040	76520	it wouldn't use a for loop initially.
76520	78720	So let's just go and take this.
78720	81720	Okay, there's a copy code button I should have learnt by now.
81840	85560	And let's remove everything from our scene
85560	89480	and let's run that code.
89480	92440	Okay, so that doesn't work, did it?
92440	95280	This is one of the things about GPT.
95280	97960	It can end up sounding very confident.
97960	99440	I mean, it's given us this here.
99440	100560	We run through this code.
100560	103360	We'll probably work out why it's not there.
103360	106600	Move the other cubes above the first cube.
106600	110960	Interesting, it's only done one, four.
110960	113120	There are other cubes there by the looks of things,
113120	114720	but where they've gone, who knows?
114720	117200	Let's delete everything out of our scene again
117200	119800	and let's just try something else.
119800	121920	Let's clear down what we've got here, actually,
121920	123120	so we can reset the thread
123120	125800	so it won't remember anything from before.
125800	129760	Using Python, write a script.
129760	132880	I will be able to type one day a script
132880	137880	to stack four cubes on top of each other in Blender.
138800	141080	Let's see how it handles this.
142760	146000	It deletes the default cube to begin with.
146000	149080	Even an AI deletes the default cube
149080	150560	before adding things in.
150560	153120	Now, this is a very linear script.
153120	155440	I would not write something like this
155440	160160	unless I was really, really testing something very specific.
161720	163400	Cube not found, of course.
163400	165880	Let's just get rid of that.
165880	167680	Go file, new, general.
167680	169760	Let's assume that there's something in the scene,
169760	172600	which is actually quite a clever thing for it to do.
172600	174600	I've not asked it to delete the cube,
174600	177720	which is maybe a bit backwards
177720	179560	because I haven't asked it to do any of that,
179560	180400	but there we go.
180400	183280	We've got four cubes, that's on top of one another.
183280	185320	One of the great things about this
185320	187320	is we can start adding to it.
187320	191320	Add a monkey to the top.
191320	194200	Now, is it aware of Suzanne the monkey?
194200	195600	Use the following code.
195640	199200	So it's built upon its previous stuff at the second cube.
199200	200640	Now, one thing I have noticed here
200640	202760	is if this gets too long,
202760	206520	then we're gonna end up with it just pausing and stopping.
206520	207640	So I can see straight away
207640	210800	that's gonna add it on top, absolutely fine.
210800	212000	I'm not gonna actually paste that in.
212000	217000	What I'm gonna do is can you add loops?
217920	220760	Because I wouldn't add it in, add it in, add it in.
220760	223640	I would actually loop around those cubes.
223640	224720	Let's see if it does that.
224720	226720	It's also deleting the default cube,
226720	228880	which you can't do, of course, the second time around.
228880	230880	So I'm gonna delete that,
230880	234320	delete everything from the scene, add in the cube.
234320	235760	There we go.
235760	237120	So here it goes.
237120	238200	Oh, it's split it out.
238200	241000	So here's our loop to add the monkey.
241000	242520	Oh, it separated out that.
242520	243880	Oh, that is interesting.
245220	248400	Okay, well, let's see if this new script works.
248400	249680	And this is great.
249680	252160	I haven't had to train it or tell it
252160	253720	anything about the Blender API.
253720	254560	And there we go.
254560	257960	We've got Suzanne on top of four cubes.
257960	260120	Okay, so that's pretty straightforward.
260120	261960	How far can we push this?
261960	263220	Well, I've tried a couple of things.
263220	265880	Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.
265880	268120	I'm gonna delete everything but that bottom cube.
268120	271280	Build a Mayan pyramid.
271280	275600	This is actually one that I've done some work on myself
275600	277120	in an introduction to Python course
277120	279760	I'm working on at the moment is building a Mayan pyramid.
279760	282640	Let's see how the AI handles it.
282640	283960	It's gonna be specific here.
283960	285960	And sometimes you have to massage the language
285960	290960	that you use to build a script, to build,
291040	292040	I'm sorry, write a script,
292040	295920	to build a Mayan pyramid out of cubes.
295920	297960	Now, the first time I ran this,
297960	300180	it worked absolutely perfectly.
301380	304920	The second time I ran it, it failed miserably.
304920	305760	This is interesting.
305760	307160	It's looping around.
309480	311720	This is completely different code.
311720	313080	If this doesn't work, by the way,
313080	315000	because I am just gonna copy and paste it in.
315000	317520	If this doesn't work, I'll show you a screenshot
317520	320320	of the code as I was playing around with it before.
322160	324280	Okay, that's an interesting interpretation of it.
324280	325980	It kind of works.
325980	328440	We can see that it's building it out of cubes
328440	332080	and then adjusting the cubes widths and heights
332080	333720	to try and fit it in.
333720	335000	That didn't work.
335000	338760	Let's just blank this out the way and say,
338760	340800	so write a script to build a Mayan pyramid
340800	343000	from only primitive in Blender.
343000	345520	That should have said primitives, but there we go.
345520	348600	So it's just giving us instructions.
350000	353280	Okay, that's writing a script rather than code.
353280	355300	So I need to be more specific.
356400	357920	Okay, so this is great.
357920	360880	This is giving us an actual script
360880	363600	as in how to, oh, it's giving us materials.
363600	365320	I didn't ask it to do that.
365320	366160	Oh, wow.
367200	369600	That is impressive.
369600	371280	You see, it's done extra stuff here.
371280	373440	I don't really want to add materials at the moment,
373440	375560	although it seems like it can do that.
375560	378960	It's set to diffuse color and specular intensity.
378960	381040	So this isn't a material in the same way
381040	384920	that you'd usually set up a material using a node graph.
384920	387320	This is just setting it manually.
387320	390120	It's looking like it's setting it to a mid-level gray
391120	392680	and then applying the material.
392680	393520	That's kind of cool.
393520	395280	It separated it out.
395280	396120	Let's try something new.
396120	398560	It's obviously not going to do the Mayan pyramid.
398560	401320	This is what it did the first time I ever tried it
401320	402920	and it's not done it since.
402920	404560	And that's important to realize
404560	406440	that if you copy exactly what I'm doing,
406440	408880	you're going to get a different result.
408880	413880	So build a castle out of cubes.
416960	419400	This is absolutely nuts.
419400	420600	Oh no, it's frozen.
420600	421880	I hate it when it freezes like that.
421880	423480	That means it's just run out.
424480	429480	Can you put this all in one script?
431280	432480	Oh, please work.
432480	435320	Oh, look like a Mayan pyramid and a castle.
435320	438880	Okay, it's remembered the stuff from before.
438880	440400	I'm not sure whether this is going to work.
440400	444080	It's probably going to stop typing everything out.
444080	445040	Yep, there we go.
445040	446560	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
446560	449440	With two walls and a Mayan pyramid in your blend of sea.
449440	450640	Well, let's just give it a go.
450640	453200	Let's see what it ends up looking like.
453200	454800	Let's get rid of everything here.
454800	456160	Get rid of everything here.
456160	458240	Are we still deleting the default cube?
458240	459440	I have no idea.
460320	461160	No, we're not.
461160	462000	That's fine.
462000	463680	Let's decided not to do that anymore.
463680	465160	And we end up with this.
465160	470160	Yeah, this is not a great demonstration of it working.
471120	472080	That's fine.
472080	473360	Let's try something completely new.
473360	476080	Let's go to the menu, reset the thread.
476080	477360	Okay, so I'm not going to play around
477360	478560	with the Mayan pyramid anymore,
478560	480320	but I will put up on the screen here.
480320	482920	The first time I ever tried it, it was successful.
482920	484560	And this is one of the things.
484560	488200	AI is not coming for our jobs at the moment.
488200	491560	It will eventually reach a point where it is very, very good.
491560	494760	At that point, what we're able to do as artists
494760	497600	or developers is use it to help us,
497600	500640	use it to explore ideas really quickly.
500640	504760	Ultimately, it's very good at spewing out rubbish,
504760	507000	but looks good rubbish.
507000	508640	And that's one of the things that can trip you up.
508640	511600	So let's try something completely new here.
511640	514760	Let's write a blender script.
514760	515880	And what do we want to do?
515880	520880	To create Stonehenge out of cubes.
521880	525160	Now, obviously it knows what a Mayan pyramid is,
525160	529000	so I'm guessing it's going to know what Stonehenge is.
529000	530320	And this is one of the things.
530320	531840	We can just explore ideas.
531840	535640	And I would say that looking at code that I've written
535640	537640	and looking at code that it's produced,
537640	539640	it does it in a very dumb way.
539640	542440	It may work, it may not work.
542440	544480	And it's just a matter of trying.
544480	548520	I have seen it come out with a very interesting way
548520	551440	of actually approaching a problem,
551440	554120	which is great because it means that I'm also learning
554120	557400	because it has produced something that does indeed work.
557400	559040	Okay, so in front of us here we have
559040	561320	what the Mayan pyramid that it did the first time around.
561320	564040	So a couple of things that is really interesting
564040	567520	and certainly not the way that I would approach this code.
567520	571000	I'd probably not have the bpy.obstopmesh.primitive.
571000	573280	I would make this much more readable.
573280	575080	I mean, it is quite readable at the moment
575080	576960	because it's very short,
576960	579280	but this was an incredible just approach
579280	580960	and I didn't delete the default cube or anything.
580960	583120	You can see it got it straight away.
583120	585640	I wish I'd recorded what the prompt was.
585640	588120	I wasn't thinking about this when I was just exploring it.
588120	591560	In fact, I wish I even, I was recording at the time
591560	594560	because I got really excited when it nailed this first time.
594560	596200	But anyway, so you can see here,
596200	598800	it actually made some really concise code
598800	602040	and I think it failed on the scene.update at the end
602040	603520	or something along those lines.
603520	604920	So it can do some really useful stuff,
604920	606200	but sometimes it does it in a different way.
606200	607640	And I'll show you.
607640	609480	Let's have a look at what it's done here.
609480	611880	Oh, ooh, ooh, ouch.
611880	614200	Okay, it's made an array of positions.
614200	616920	That's not what it did when I tried this before.
616920	618800	It actually used a math library.
618800	622280	It drew a circle and placed the pillars and stuff
622280	625680	on the circle, but let's see what it's created.
625680	628040	I mean, ultimately, it's created this big block here.
628040	629360	Let's get rid of that.
629360	633720	So this is what its interpretation of Stonehenge is.
633720	634800	It's wrong.
634800	636800	That isn't Stonehenge.
636800	639760	Let's just, for argument's sake,
639760	644760	say that is close, but doesn't look like Stonehenge.
644780	646500	It needs to be circular.
647440	648280	Ah, here we go.
648280	649480	This looks a bit more promising.
649480	651040	I'm not gonna say it's gonna work
651040	653200	because who knows what it's gonna create.
653200	654560	Let's just clear our scene out
654560	657480	while we're waiting for it to write our code for us.
657480	660160	And boom, let's just run it.
660160	662400	Okay, interesting.
662400	663600	Let's get rid of that.
663600	664440	It's made there.
664440	667320	Okay, you see, it's got an idea of what's going on.
667320	668480	And when I tried this before,
668480	669440	I tried it with things like,
669440	674160	oh, could you make the Stonehenge a bit more irregular?
674160	675400	And if I got footage of that,
675400	676720	I'll pop that up on the screen.
676720	679000	I tried to massage it to get it to the point.
679000	681640	At which point, I could have just made it myself
681640	683360	in half the time.
683360	685920	So one of the things that I did have
685920	687440	quite a bit of success with
687440	689560	was writing some helper code.
689560	692080	So let's clear everything down.
692080	694200	And again, I should really put this in a buffer.
694200	696000	I'm gonna write a script
696000	699520	to select every object in Blender
699520	701160	or something along those lines.
701160	704160	So if I have a look at my objects here,
704160	706040	they're all named cube, right?
706040	709480	All of these stem from a cube that's been manipulated.
709480	711600	So I've asked it to write a script
711600	713400	to select all mesh objects.
713400	717520	So I'm being specific about what type of objects in Blender
717520	720200	with names containing the word cube.
720200	722560	Now, this is something that I have done in the past.
722560	725200	So I'll be interested to see how it approaches it.
725200	726960	And what we'll also do here
726960	730240	is add in a point, bam, just over here.
730240	732200	Let's add in a camera as well.
732200	733640	It doesn't matter what they're pointing at.
733640	735440	It's just so we've got something else in our scene
735440	737560	so we can make sure it is only selecting
737560	739560	the things that we want it to.
739560	740680	Okay, let's run that.
740680	741760	So this is interesting.
741760	743800	It's approaching it from a scene level.
743800	746480	So we see here, bpy.context.scene.
746480	748680	I would typically approach this.
748680	751000	I suppose that is a quite a neat way of doing it.
751000	753560	If I was gonna do selecting all types though,
753560	757520	I'd probably go to bpy.data.objects.
757520	760000	If the type equals mesh, that's correct.
760000	763160	The cube is in the objects name and said it's true.
763160	764000	Nice.
764000	766760	So the other thing that we're gonna add in really quickly
766760	768960	is add in an icosphere just here
768960	770880	so we know it is only selecting objects
770880	772400	that aren't named cube.
772400	773920	Okay, let's copy that.
773920	777560	Go to our code and paste that in.
777560	780280	Make sure nothing is selected and run our script.
780280	781280	Look at that.
781280	782440	That is awesome.
782440	783880	The only thing that this is done
783880	785800	that you'd now need to work out
785800	789400	is make sure that this is not the active selected
789400	792920	because that's gonna do stuff to that icosphere.
792920	797760	Make sure one of those objects is the active selected.
797760	799400	Now, of course, this time round,
799400	801960	one of the things I've not done,
801960	804360	I've not asked it and it knows
804360	807120	that it requires Python code.
807120	808080	That's important.
809280	810840	Let's just see if that works.
810840	812840	Copy code, paste it in.
813960	816040	Yes, yes, now one of our objects
816040	817880	is the active selected, perfect.
817880	819720	So this is how it can really help
819720	821880	by making some helper code for you
821880	824520	or just as I say, exploring different things.
824520	828000	The important thing is that AI is not coming after us yet,
828000	831360	but we can use it to support what we're doing,
831360	835960	to help us and aid us in producing better work more quickly,
835960	837040	which is brilliant.
837040	839600	Wow, so this is absolutely amazing.
839600	842400	I love this sort of stuff and it being developed,
842400	845480	whether it's creating images for us or writing code for us,
845480	847720	I think this is a great help at all.
847720	848720	Now, if you try this yourself,
848720	850360	I'd love to see what you end up creating,
850360	851920	so do share that with me.
851920	854480	And if you want to learn about Python in Blender
854480	856000	in a bit more structured manner,
856000	857840	then check out these videos here.
857840	859240	I'll see you in the next one.
