Processing Overview for Michael Bridges
============================
Checking Michael Bridges/GPT Chat's AI is writing Blender Python now! and you're gonna love it!.txt
1. **Initial Attempt**: The speaker initially tried to get an AI to replicate Stonehenge, but the result was not satisfactory and looked too regular. They wanted a circular structure with irregularities.

2. **Helper Code**: The speaker then decided to use the AI to write helper code in Blender to select all mesh objects named "cube" within the scene. This was done by specifying the search criteria as objects whose names contain the word "cube."

3. **Selection Process**: The AI successfully generated a Python script that could select all objects with the word "cube" in their name, which demonstrated its ability to understand and execute tasks related to Blender's Python API (bpy).

4. **Additional Objects**: To test the AI further, the speaker added an icosphere and a camera to ensure that the script would only select the intended mesh objects and not other unrelated items.

5. **Final Script Execution**: The speaker executed the generated script, which correctly selected all mesh objects named "cube." They also pointed out the importance of ensuring the correct object is active before running such scripts.

6. **Conclusion**: The speaker expressed excitement about the potential of AI to assist with tasks like writing code in Blender and encouraged viewers to experiment with this technology, sharing their results for inspiration.

7. **Learning Resources**: For those interested in learning more about Python scripting in Blender, the speaker recommended additional video resources to deepen understanding and skills.
