{"text": " Okay. Thanks. Starting my clock. I'm going to talk about Vim today, so I already changed my clothes, as you can see. Just a quick, quick, raise your hands. Who's using Vim for development? Okay, that's almost the majority. Who's using traditional graphical IDEs for development? All right. Okay, so there are at least five people in the room that might be able to learn something here. All the rest, you will probably know what I'm talking about. Where do I come from? So to put this into perspective somehow, I guess when I was 12 or so, I started writing my first program in basic, I think, on an Amiga or C64, I can't remember. Later, when the internet arrived at our home, I started doing PHP and using Dreamweaver. At university, they taught us Java and we used Eclipse. My first job, I was using C-Sharp in Visual Studio for a couple of years, and my second job, I used Python and Wing IDE, which I enjoyed much more, by the way. Last year, when I came here to PyCon, I figured that lots and lots of very smart people were actually using Vim. I already knew about Vim, obviously, all the time, but I always thought that it's much too complicated and I will never have the time to learn this and it will kill all my productivity for months or so. But when I saw that, I don't know, guys like Jacob Kaplan, most of what, are using Vim all the time and are being obviously very productive with it, I thought maybe I should give it a try. It was actually PyCon's fault that I started using Vim last year. Thanks to you all. Why should you care? I mean, most of you care anyway, so I probably can skip the slide, but obviously, Vim is cross-platform, so if you're using Ubuntu, you can use Vim. If you're using macOS, you can use Vim. At home, I've got several laptops and whatever I feel like. Every day, I can just open my laptop and my Vim with my Vim config is there and it just works and it looks the same and feels the same everywhere. It's standard on most systems, so for example, when I'm doing web development, I SSH into my web servers and you can be sure that Vim is installed there, so it's quite good when, I don't know, there's an emergency and you have to SSH into the machine. You want to know that you have a good editor on that server that you can use and that you can use in a fast and efficient way and you don't want to screw up your files because there's an editor that you usually never use because you are used to a graphical IDE. It's very fast. I mean, when I remember back the times when I was using Eclipse, the startup time, I was usually leaving my desk and getting a cup of tea or so. Vim is almost instantaneous, obviously. It's good for your health, sounds funny, but I can testify it's true. When I was programming for like 10 hours a day with a classical IDE and moving back and forth to the arrow keys to navigate in the text file, it actually hurts. When I started using Vim six or seven months ago and I got this idea of using HJKL for the movement only, I was really unbinding the arrow keys so that I must force myself and hammer it into my muscle memory as fast as possible. It actually helps but because you have your fingers on the central row when you are typing with 10 fingers, they are naturally resting there and you can just switch to movement mode and use HJKL to move and switch back to insert mode and you don't have to move your hand at all and it makes a big fat difference when you work a whole day and when you code a whole day. It's highly customizable, of course. It's great for pair programming which is something that I want to demonstrate if we have enough time at the end. Yeah, you can work anywhere, anytime. It's interesting when at my last job we basically had the opportunity to get any hardware that we wanted so I got myself a big fat 30 inch screen and at that time I thought that dual screen setup is the most awesome thing in the world and it makes you so much more productive but I realized that since I'm using Vim, I use screen or T-Markz as a screen multiplexer so I can switch between tabs quickly so suddenly I have lots and lots of windows and desktops at my hand, just a fingertip away and I have actually not used my second screen for six months or what? I don't use it anymore so I can just go, I can code on an airplane, I can code on a beach, I can code anywhere and I don't need to have an office environment or something, I just need my laptop and internet connection. Another cool thing that I came up with when I thought about this slide yesterday is you can change jobs and keep your tools, like maybe today we are coding in Python, maybe tomorrow we are coding in Haskell or C++ or whatever and probably Vim will have a plug-in that suits that new programming language that we will use in the future as well so we will probably, I mean if you use Vim, you will probably never have to change your editor ever again. By the way, all this is probably also true for Emacs, I guess they are quite similar but I've never tried that one. So what am I? Pardon? Okay, so to me what do I need in order to say that yes this thing is a workable IDE, I want to have fast access to all files, I mean those files that are currently open maybe in several tabs or splits and files that I know that are in the project, I want to have a nice color scheme and I want to be able to change it quickly, I mean some editors give you a good way to change the color scheme but maybe there's no standard file format or what so you cannot really exchange the color scheme easily, it's pretty easy with Vim. I want to have syntax highlighting for all common files that I will use which are in my case Python, HTML and CSS files and JavaScript files. I want to have static code analysis, I mean with Python everybody knows we have this great PEP8 document which tells us how to code beautifully and there are tools for checking like Flake8 or Pylint or PEP8, there are tools that can check your code against the PEP8 specifications and they will highlight if there are like I don't know unused imports or unused variables and stuff like that or there's a space too much or too many empty lines at the end of the file or something like that. Code completion obviously is the main thing why people use IDEs and I will show you how to get that with Vim. Go to definition is another cool thing like when I'm using Django the framework is so big it has so many classes and modules and I usually although I know it by heart almost I usually cannot remember what parameters the function accepts for example and I don't want to go to Google or to the Django docs all the time and look it up so just jump to the definition and look at the actual implementation of the method and see what kinds of parameters the function allows and then you will also see the doc string and yeah it's quite useful. Refactoring is something that this setup that I'm going to show is able to do but I have actually never used it so I cannot demonstrate it. I somehow feel that using refactoring with a dynamically typed language like Python is I don't know a bit it feels dangerous to me I wouldn't trust the system. Debugging I think it can be done from within Vim but I usually don't do it I use iPython and IPDB and just open another terminal window and I will insert break points using Vim with a short key and then open another terminal window and start my program and just wait until the breakpoint is hit and inspect the scope which I will demonstrate here as well. Okay so we have four topics here. I will show you how to install Vim. I will show you how to configure it for the first time starting from scratch. I will show you how you can manage your plug-ins because the standard way of downloading it, unsipping it and putting the correct files into the correct folders is quite messy there's a better way to do it and if time is left I will show how you can use Vim for pair programming with Tmax. Okay installing Vim is pretty simple. This is a script that I always execute whenever I set up a new server for my web project or when I reinstall my own system just clone the source and the important bit is here this enablepython interpreter part which you will need because the the Python mode plug-in is written in Python and so Vim has to be compiled with with Python being enabled and you know I used to install it into my home opt Vim folder so I don't disturb any other users on the system and that's it basically and when you've done that you can check if everything has worked by by just typing Vim minus minus version and you will get a lot a lot of stuff and you should search for the plus Python flag it will tell you that it has actually been compiled with Python support sometimes it goes wrong and when there's minus Python you know that you did something wrong and you should try again um yeah so that's installing Vim should take around five to eight minutes or so um your first .vimrc file so when when you start using Vim people usually recommend or advise you to um to start from scratch don't take a fully brown Vim file from from from some hardcore hacker or so there's so much stuff inside you will get lost better start from scratch and and whenever you feel that oh I want to do this how can I do this just google for it go to the Vim IRC channel there are super many super smart people inside and they are extremely helpful whenever I ask a question I get an answer within two minutes um vimbits.com is a pretty cool website where it's like hacker news people can post their their snippets and people can upvote and downvote it so it's like every month or so I just go there and see what's what's hot and and what's bubbling on top and you usually can find lots of crazy ideas you wouldn't you would never think of yourself um and I can only advise you to save your .vimrc file on on your own .files repository on github many many programmers do that and it's a great way to get inspiration just like for example I was talking to him right now and and and and he was showing me some great tricks that I didn't know about and I immediately asked him is your .vimrc file on github he's like yes of course so I know what I'm going to do when I'm home today um yeah so let's do it I I just deleted my own .vimrc file and and created a new one um so when you start Vim for the first time it will look like crap it looks just like the terminal doesn't really look like an editor um so let's try to make this thing beautiful and look like an IDE the first thing I usually do is um I put this buff write post thing here so I don't have to close and reopen the file all the time when I do changes from now on when I when I save the file will be uh reload it's like doing source on the terminal for when when you change some your bash rc file you do source bash rc and then the changes will happen so now we will do the same when we save um the standard behavior of the clipboard is something that I never really understand so when you do clipboard equals unnamed it's basically the way you would expect it to be with any other editor so when you copy something from a website you can just paste it into Vim and when you select and copy something inside of Vim you can just paste it somewhere else which wouldn't work right away then you can enable the mouse so now when I press the option key I can use the mouse cursor to yeah to do what the mouse cursor is supposed to do and this backspace equals to um it's quite useful because the standard behavior of the backspace key is a bit weird I don't actually know what it what it does normally maybe somebody here can explain it to me uh so when I oh shit sorry um I will comment this out and save again so now let's say I'm typing something and then I'm typing something more and I want to press the backspace key oh no it works okay usually um maybe some other settings have fixed this behavior as well but usually when I try to use the backspace key it just stops there is some text in the line I'm in insert mode and I'm pressing backspace but it just stops I don't know why this happens and this setting this BS bullshit equals to will make will turn the backspace key into a real backspace key I like to remap my map leader key the map leader key is the special keys because the the keyboard is so full with shortcuts already that they ran out of keys so the map leader key gives you the possibility to bind another full set of keyboard keys um because when you press the map leader key them will wait for one second and see if you press any other keys so suddenly we can press comma and something else to have even more um places to bind stuff to then okay this is something that I cannot demonstrate right now because the color scheme is not installed um saving as you have seen I usually have to you have to type call on w to save I don't like that I it's like I was using ides for so long I I just have the habit of typing and pressing ctrl s for save okay I can't press ctrl s here in vim but I remap it to ctrl z and now it's already in my muscle memory again so from now on with these settings in whatever mode I am I can just press um ctrl z and it will save very convenient the same thing is true for quit usually you would have to type call on q for quitting I don't like that so I like leader e for quitting it's much faster to me but this is like this is the reason why you should start from scratch because you will probably have different ideas of where all these bindings should be for you for yourself um okay you can have tabs and splits in vim and you want to be able to easily navigate between them so let me demonstrate that uh when you when you create new tabs it's like this it's just tabs very normal um but the standard way to navigate is like pressing ctrl w and then um one of the movement keys for tabs I prefer to press the leader key and then n for going left and m for going right so the leader key I put it on on comma and m and n is just all next to each other so it makes it allows me to fast to to to switch between tabs very fast the same is true for splits so when I have a horizontal split here you would have to press ctrl w j for going downwards into the uh uh bottom split I I don't see why I should press two keys so I I know I remap that so that I can just press ctrl j for going down ctrl k for going up or if you have a vertical split you can press ctrl h and l to go left and right so it's it's basically just like moving around the cursor just to press the ctrl key then you will be moving around the splits so very convenient okay um yeah here's a very useful thing that you will probably use when you develop with python because it's encouraged to have all the imports sorted alphabetically and vim users will always do this because it's so easy I just bound it to con to to leader s and I can just select a block of code press leader s and it will it will be sorted alphabetically very nice um oh yes this one is cool I found this on vimbits.com I can select a block of code and and then and use the um greater than and less than signs to move the whole block of code usually you can easily do this this with vim anyways but it will lose its selection so um with this snippet it will remain its selection so you can press it multiple times yeah uh okay um this one I cannot demonstrate it right now but it will show trailing white space usually you don't want to have trailing white space in your code because I don't know when you submit a a patch to an open source project and most people will have a script that deletes all white space when they save and when you inserted some stupid white space and the next person is editing the same file you will end up with lots of diffs where you didn't actually do anything it's just because the other person automatically deleted your stupid white space so just make sure you never insert any unwanted white space and this this line here will make sure that its big fat red block showing you here's white space delete this um color schemes can be installed easily in I have um all this file is on github so if you want to start from scratch you can clone this repository um and um do the same that same thing as well sometimes you will find comments here like this one this will explain how you do actually install a color scheme so it's just create a dot vim slash colors folder go inside that folder and then download this one bad color scheme and there you go um syntax highlighting this is something that will not work when I save so I have to restart this file and now we have syntax highlighting so vim knows its own syntax for its own configuration file and here are a bunch of settings for now we are getting into the area of making this more look like an IDE so now we have column numbers and the 80 characters line usually you don't want to write your Python scripts longer than 80 characters so there's a very subtle line here I don't know if you can see it it's just a little bit darker huh thanks and um this one is pretty cool when you when you write a doc string for example and maybe you don't want to care about um I'm wrapping it correctly and you are writing over the 80 characters line after that just point the cursor somewhere into that block and press Q huh why does it not work I'm confused okay I I entered awesome okay but why does this happen hmm because I didn't save ah yeah okay okay let's try that again press Q and it wraps the block of text accordingly so that nothing goes over that line it's not always useful because like when you have when you're using markdown or restart check text and you have for example you have bullet lists it doesn't really know that the bullet lists belong under each like how to explain sorry so it's like when you have bullet lists like this and then this and you press Q it will destroy your bullet list and put everything into one line so don't use it all the time but sometimes it can be quite useful um under history of 700 yeah something that I like um for pison you don't want to use tabs you want to use spaces and you want to use you want to indent by four um this one is for when you do regular use you use regular expressions for search that they are case insensitive ah come on this one um it's a bit tricky I don't know if everybody needs this um vim creates a lot of swap files and and backup files when when you save and I like to use file system watches so that whenever I save all my tests get executed immediately in another in another terminal window and the standard behavior seems to be that it creates three or four file system events and my tests get executed three or four times in a row which sucks so and with these three settings I got to fix this and when you save it's actually just one file system event okay so that is about the vim rc now we'll talk about some plugins that will introduce all this id stuff that I want to have it's it's four plugins I won't I won't say much say much about them right now I will just show you how they look like um oh yeah when you when you want to work with plugins within the the standard way is you have to download a zip file or a tar ball and you have to unpack it and you have to install it into the dot vim folder and then there can be several different subfolders there can be an ft plugin folder there can be a syntax folder and each plugin more complex plugins will have so many files that you have to you have to read the readme and it will tell you like copy this file into that folder and this file into that folder and it's a big huge mess and for you and especially when you want to get rid of that plugin later on you can't remember which files did belong to that plugin and in which folders are they so it's a mess use pathogen instead it's very easy to install you have to create this autoload folder uh and a bundle folder then download the the pathogen file and that's it and and insert this call pathogen infect setting here and you are good to go from now on you can install plugins by just unpacking them into the bundle folder so for example if we want to install vim power line we will go into the bundle folder and we will just clone the whole power line repository and usually vim repositories repositories of vim plugins on github are created in a way that the root folder has the files all in the current in the correct folder so you can just clone the thing into the bundle folder and it will work okay um so here's a setting for vim power line you will see when i demonstrate it just a second control p is a plugin for quickly navigating through files and opening files and python mode is is a very very great project i think it's a wrapper around uh several other plug vim plugins that deal with python and and and make vim more like a python IDE so it's it's much easier to just install this one plugin then several others okay this one is some stuff okay and python folding allows you to collapse and expand your your whole code so now that i have installed these four plugins let's go to some test repository so i've created a stupid little demo project here python project um so the first thing we can see we have code we have syntax highlighting it looks like python code python code it's it's it looks nice um yeah the folding plugin now i can use f to fold and unfold blocks of code or i can use uh capital f to fold everything which is quite handy if the file is a bit long so i don't want to scroll down and then press control d control d control d to go down um i just fold everything and maybe do a search for the for the function name and i will be i will reach the code that i want to work on quickly um yeah yeah then you should use my version i don't know it just works i never have problems with the doc strings yeah when i when i point the cursor here and press f it will only okay i don't have a class in the syntax but if you would point the cursor at the class definition and press f it will collapse the whole class uh yeah um functions are too long okay yeah um there is the i think py lint or or py flag or so has a feature of telling you that the function is too complex where if you have too many nested if and else things it will say this function is too complex and usually those functions are also too long okay um one thing about rope rope deals with all this go to definition stuff and code completion stuff uh when you when you use it for the first time you should execute rope open project and this will create a dot rope project folder which contains a config file and in that config file you will find a line about python pass and here i would insert my the parts to my virtual environment for example when i'm using when i'm working on jango project i would insert the pass to the virtual environment of that jango project so that python rope actually knows where jango is otherwise it like code completion wouldn't work right um yeah so let's try this um no we will try this later so um static code analysis when i'm when i'm doing stuff like this it will open a quick fix window down here and it will tell me that i have just inserted invalid syntax very useful uh or for example here it will tell me there is a variable that is never used or for example if i import something that i never use it will tell me there's an import that is never used and uh when i go down to this quick fix window i can navigate through these items and when i press enter it will jump to the actual line that has the error and so i can quickly fix this error go down to the to the quick fix window jump up here fix this error as well and and then i'm good to go um yeah code completion very obvious so let's say i i know there's a method that starts with l and i press control space it will give me all options that it guesses it it is usually also assumes some python build in functions it assumes variables that i have defined in this module before or it assumes functions that i have imported by using the star import for example um okay now control p is the other plugin that deals with opening files so when i press control p it gives me a list of all files in the project and it has some fuzzy file file pattern pattern matching logic or whatever so when i know okay i want to open this file that is called something with u utils or something i just press u it narrows down the results to everything that has a u inside or maybe everything that has an r o rope okay config rope config there i am right so you can even um just type down parts of the passes like maybe you know some folder names and you know some parts of the file name so you just type down some parts of the folder name or some parts of the file name and you will get the file so let's open utils in a in a new tab for example when you press control t it will open a new tab whereas when you press control v it will open a new vertical split um what else do we have oh yeah jump to definition so let's let's assume i want to use the url join methods and i forgot the possible parameters to this method so i can just press control g and it would jump to to my uh python installation and and look up the url join methods so i can just have a look at the method declaration and implementation and i can see ah a low fragments that was the name and i can read the doc string and find out what it does yeah last but not least debugging by pressing con leader b i can insert breakpoints and i think it will also also automatically save the file not sure maybe it doesn't and now i will open another terminal window and execute this demo project and it will stop at the breakpoint and you can get you can get this by just doing pip install or easy install ipython and easy install ipdb it's extremely useful um ipython ipdb will give you um color some syntax highlighting here it will give you tap completion um so to get started you should just type question mark there are the few commands that are available it looks like a huge list but most of them are duplicates like a and alias is the same and so you can just press question mark a or you will get an example what a does so some useful commands are l to give you a little bit more context around the line we are currently on when you press it several times it will go down you can say show me line 10 to 40 for example if you want to go more up um n stands for next well that's going to be bt backtrace very cool it will show us that we are actually here in this line in this file in this function and we came from here from this file this function from this line so maybe you will realize that okay the bug isn't actually here it's it's up here by when you when you use bt for backtrace maybe you will realize that ah something is is fishy up here so you can just use you and you will go up the backtrace so now we will you can see that now we are in the demo file so it jumped up here and we are now in the one frame above the in the backtrace and you can use arcs to inspect the currently available variables and the current scope so um oh what did i do that was not good sorry so arcs to inspect the variables and i mean this is just a python interpreter you can you can type anything that there's a valid python command for example type data what type was data oh it's a dictionary so cool then i can press dot and press tap twice and it will give me all options that the dictionary has so um i remember there was something about keys to get the keys so oh yes keys there it is and yeah so this i mean if you are a python beginner this is the best way to to learn actually to actually learn python put breakpoints into your code inspect all the stuff and then play around and see what what the python built-ins and all the data types have to offer all right um that's how i use them as a python ide i think that's pretty good already um last thing i think a few minutes i left um i will talk about how you can if you are still not convinced why you should use a terminal editor oh come on um this will take just two minutes um if you're still not convinced i'm in a situation that my team has um spread all over the world so the person that i work with the most is is sitting in germany i'm sitting in singapore and um usually we want to do pair programming right he has a question i have a question he has a bug and he doesn't he doesn't know how to solve it and then i usually want to look at his code and what we did all the time until recently is we start skype and we do skype screen sharing and then it crashes so we switch over to team viewer and try that and it's super slow and laggy whatever i'd say i'm like saying and talking quickly and jumping through the code and whatever i'd say he will see it 10 seconds later or five seconds later and it's it's just big brain fuck it does it's not fun right so there's a tool called vmax it's some wrapper around tmax and um i can start a vmax session by just typing vmax as i did just now and the other person i will i will do um i will set a port forwarding in my router at home to port 22 and i will give the other person my ip and so the other person will be able to do ssh pair pair proger at my ip so i i created a new user with lots of restrictions so this person is not able to delete my home folder or something oh why does this not work now j i think oh yes you are correct thanks pair proger okay okay and then the person can type vmax attach and now he will see what i see and i will see how big his screen is or how small so i will i will scold him and say hey please resize your terminal um yeah and now we can basically whatever i type here will be uh will be done on the other side as well so we can do we can start using vim and we can start implementing our python code together so i can type and he can take over and he can type again he can type as well pretty cool and since this is only some bytes of of of text being sent over the wire this is absolutely fast and instantaneous all right um where's my keynote thing thank you so much questions yeah yeah it's on my system he's he's doing ssh into my machine and then he's attaching to the vmax session and we are working on exactly the same file questions so what was power line oh yes sorry i assume it's that no no this this is tmax this is uh something that i have configured my tmax to do power line is this thing below here so um yeah it shows you it gives you a graphical feedback if i'm in insert mode it's blue if i'm in select mode it's orange yeah it's it's it's just helpful usually it's like when i come back from from from lunch break i can't remember oh where did i left it was it was i in insert mode or was i in select mode so i always press control c to go or press escape to to go back into the other mode but maybe i just want to be in insert mode and i come back oh i'm in insert mode i i can go i can go on typing i have some of the things that you've got in store but i don't have some of the other cool things you've got um uh where are you going to share all this information yeah um i have it on on my github repository very long url github that's github slash mbroch and then you will find my vim as a python ide talk and yeah no my dot files is a different repository but yeah of course yeah i will um i will export them as pdf and upload what is the best what is the best service to upload and share slides slide share speaker deck no okay speaker deck uh fun github the pdf you mean yeah just check out github okay yeah i will do that as well pardon hey i i i just started using vim last year i i i still have to get deeper you know maybe next year i will give a talk about uh creating slides with la la la leitec okay um uh thank you very much", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.84, "text": " Okay.
