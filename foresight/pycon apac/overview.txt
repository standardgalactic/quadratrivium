Checking pycon apac/Vim as a Python IDE - Martin Brochhaus.txt
1. The speaker uses a terminal editor (vim) as his preferred Python IDE and believes it's already quite good.
2. He discusses the benefits of using a terminal editor, especially for remote collaboration, citing an example where he works with a colleague in Germany by sharing a vim session in real-time through SSH.
3. The speaker sets up a new user with restrictions on his local machine to allow a colleague to remotely access and work on the code together without risking data loss or other security concerns.
4. They use a tool called `vmax` for setting up the shared session, which is initiated by typing `vmax` in the terminal and then allowing the colleague to attach to this session via `vmax attach` and their own SSH connection to the speaker's IP address.
5. The speaker mentions Powerline, a plugin that provides visual cues for modes like insert or select in vim.
6. He encourages the audience to check out his configuration and setup on GitHub, where he shares his dot files and other code-related talks.
7. He offers to export his presentation slides as PDFs and upload them to a sharing service like Speaker Deck for easy access.
8. The speaker acknowledges that while he has been using vim for years, it's a tool that can take time to master, and he encourages others to explore and learn more about it.
9. He wraps up by thanking the audience and inviting any questions they might have.

The speaker emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of using a terminal editor like vim, particularly for remote development tasks, due to its speed and low-overhead nature.
