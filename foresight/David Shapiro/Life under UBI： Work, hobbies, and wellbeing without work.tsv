0	6400	Hello everybody, David Shapiro here with another video. So today's video is by popular demand
6960	12320	as we talk more and more about artificial intelligence and the potential of
13200	15840	UBI and AI displacing a lot of jobs.
16840	22880	For some people it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that a lot of people are going to be out of work real soon probably for good.
24200	29080	There's more and more universal basic income experiments going on around the world.
30160	36400	And if you didn't see it, I have another video called post-labor economics, which kind of talks about more of the
37040	42400	macroeconomic aspects of that. But in this case, people really wanted to learn about
43280	46640	UBI on an individual level. So let's get right in.
47360	49920	Just a real quick plug from my Patreon before we get in.
50720	52720	I do have a Patreon and
53280	56000	all the tiers get you into the private discord
56800	59440	where I am often available to chat with people.
60000	63920	There's two Patreon Discord, so there's the premium Patreon Discord
64480	69280	which I prioritize, make sure that I answer all questions that people send me on Patreon if you're in the premium tier.
70000	73040	And I also do have occasional office hours
73760	80160	where we just all kind of get in a voice chat together. And then I do have a higher tier for one-on-one sessions.
80560	82560	All right, back to the show.
82640	84640	So first let's set the stage.
85440	87440	Imagine this future scenario.
87840	92880	Every American gets $2,000 a month, no questions asked, starting at age 18.
93360	99120	Let's also, for the sake of this thought experiment, assume that health care is either heavily subsidized or
100320	105360	for all intents and purposes free. If you check out my post-labor economics video,
105760	112160	I talk about how AI could lower the cost of lots of things, including health care, by a factor of
112560	114800	100x or 1,000x in the long run.
115520	121280	Let's also assume that the unemployment rate will be about 70%. There are some people calling for more,
122000	124000	some people calling for less,
124400	126800	but just looking at the number of jobs that are
128880	131360	vulnerable to being automated away with AI today,
132080	134960	my personal estimate is that it's around 70%.
136240	144160	Let's also assume, for the sake of argument that parents get a little bit of UBI per child, but it also tapers per child.
145280	149120	So basically, you don't want to necessarily hand out
149920	154640	as much UBI for every child because that incentivizes some people to just keep having more children.
155600	158080	But on the other hand, you also want to ensure that
158640	163600	you incentivize the behaviors that you want to see. And so one thing that people are concerned about, some people
164240	170560	are concerned about, is population collapse, actually. This is what we're seeing in places like Italy, Japan, North Korea,
171520	176160	and other places where the population is actually already slowly contracting.
176640	182240	And so you basically need to incentivize people to have children. You need to reward them. Right now,
182880	187920	you get tax breaks in the form of dependent tax credit.
188480	192400	So basically, this is kind of like a reverse, or not a reverse tax credit,
192640	197680	but a tax credit in the form of increased income on a monthly basis to help pay for children.
198000	201440	Let's also assume that GDP growth is going to be something like 15%
202160	204480	due to AI automation. So the idea is that
205200	209920	most people aren't working, but the GDP is still growing like crazy. The stock market is growing like crazy.
210480	214080	So corporations and politicians, there's plenty of wealth to go around.
214480	218880	So we're basically assuming that a state exists of economic abundance,
219680	223280	and then also some redistribution. Oh, and there was a question. Someone was asking,
223760	229680	what's the difference between this and socialism? So the difference between this and socialism is
229680	235760	that socialism is about collective ownership or state ownership. So in this case, UBI actually
235760	240640	fits within capitalism and neoliberalism because the state isn't owning anything. The state is just
240640	245760	taxing and redistributing within the existing framework. Another assumption that we're going
245760	251280	to make, and I talked about this again in the post-labor economics video, is we're basically
251280	256400	going to assume that inflation and deflation are going to be modulated by some of these market forces
257680	262240	with things like quantitative easing, tax rates, and that sort of stuff. So we're not going to
262240	268240	address that further in this video. Just assume that prices are stable-ish. Okay, so
269280	275440	absolute just right off the bat. Let's talk about budgeting. You get $2,000 a month. No further
275440	280800	questions asked. The first thing that everyone's thinking is the rent is still way too damn high
280800	287680	for this. My mortgage payment, which is, I bought this house almost 10 years ago, so before things
287680	293920	went absolutely insane, my mortgage payment is about $1,200 a month, which is pretty good.
295120	302320	But that being said, the lowest mortgage payment I ever had was $325 a month for a $65,000 apartment.
303040	308160	So it can be done, obviously, as demand goes up in certain areas, the prices also go up.
309120	314560	But point being is that for most people, these numbers probably sound completely
315120	319600	ridiculous. It's not going to happen again because, again, 10 years ago, the economy
319600	325680	has changed a lot. Inflation, supply and demand has changed. We're facing housing crunches and
325680	332720	recessions and all that kind of stuff. So again, it's like, oh, everyone's heard someone from our
332800	339440	parents or grandparents age like, oh, I put a family through college on a cashier's salary.
340000	345360	Believe me, I am aware that economics change over time. We will address the housing thing in
345360	350480	just a minute. I'm just kind of setting the stage as to saying, OK, we need to figure out a way to
350480	357680	get housing into $600 a month or so for everyone. Cars are another huge, huge expense for Americans.
358400	364400	So these are the two biggest expenses for most people. So, for instance, I have friends that
364400	370960	their car payment is $600 or $700 a month. That's insane. So you combine that with,
372320	378160	let's say I had a $600 car payment on top of a $1,200 mortgage, that's $1,800 a month,
378160	382400	leaving $200 a month for everything else. That's not going to fly. That's not going to work.
383360	389120	Now, that being said, if we can get rent or mortgages back down to $600 a month for most
389120	395360	people, and if we can get rid of cars, that leaves about $1,400 a month for everything else. And
395360	402320	also remember, in this hypothetical scenario, health care is highly subsidized or functionally free
402320	408560	for most people. OK, so housing, biggest expense. Let's talk about housing first, because if we
408640	413840	can get that under control, the whole UBI thing looks a lot more sustainable and feasible for
413840	420880	most people. So the first thing is downsizing. A lot of people are already downsizing. Tiny houses
420880	426080	are all the rage right now. Katrina cottages, that kind of kickstarted it because after Hurricane
426080	433680	Katrina, actually what happened was a few celebrities got together and paid for architects to design
434320	440160	cottages, small houses that were very cheap and easy to build so that people that were affected by
440160	448400	Katrina could recover more quickly. That didn't start the tiny house trend, but that certainly
448400	452320	put it on the map. And people are like, oh, Katrina houses, they're pretty cute. Because again,
452320	458400	they paid for professional architects to make something that was sustainable and appealing,
458400	464480	not just cheap and efficient. So demand for smaller houses is creating new markets. There's
465600	470240	last time I looked up at tiny houses a few years ago, there were not a whole lot of options.
470240	473920	Now there are tiny house kits, there are prefabs, there are all kinds of stuff.
475120	481920	Some of the some of the cheapest DIY like livable tiny houses that I could find were around $4,000,
481920	487760	which is much, much more efficient than a $200,000 house or a $400,000 house.
487760	492240	You can also get prebuilt for around $12,000, and that's, you know, starting price, you can spend
492240	498480	up to $200,000 on a prefab tiny house, which is still cheaper than, you know, a half a million
498480	504560	dollar suburban house. One thing, one of the biggest problems with tiny houses is that
504560	511200	regulations and zoning laws need to be updated. In many municipalities and jurisdictions,
511200	515920	a tiny house is not allowed to be the primary residence. You can have what's called an auxiliary
515920	520160	dwelling unit in many places, which is basically you can put a tiny house in your backyard,
520160	526080	but then you need a regular full-sized house. So my wife and I were about to downsize,
526080	531680	but even in the countryside, the minimum house size that we're allowed to build is 1200 square feet.
531680	535760	So it's smaller than my current house, but it still doesn't qualify as a tiny house. We would
535760	540960	love to have built something smaller, but because of the, because of the county zoning laws,
540960	546720	we're not allowed to build anything smaller. So in order to accommodate a shift to a UBI,
546720	550880	we're going to need different zoning laws or areas that are zoned for tiny houses.
551520	557760	Another option is portable tiny houses such as trailers or van dwelling. Now, lots of people,
557760	561920	you know, there's the van dwelling subreddit. There's plenty of influencers on TikTok and
561920	568800	YouTube and Instagram and everywhere else that either travel or live in a van full-time or whatever.
569200	574800	This is, this is good for some people. It can be very cheap. You can also spend a lot of money
575440	580640	pimping out a van or a bus or whatever. There are challenges associated with this,
580640	585520	such as safety, where do you stay, permanent address. It also requires a vehicle,
585520	591280	which again, vehicles can be really expensive. The last thing is micro apartments. So
592160	597360	not everyone wants to own their own home or their own land. So micro apartments are something that
597440	602800	is an option. They're increasingly popular. But again, there's a lot of regulations,
602800	610080	particularly in America, that prevent us from even building tiny apartments. Usually the smallest
610080	615840	studio apartment you can get is around 400 to 500 square feet, which, you know, there's nothing
615840	621040	wrong with that. But those are often in trendy areas. And so even though it's a small apartment,
621040	626800	they're often very, very expensive. So they're not really optimized for being economical. That
626800	634640	being said, as I mentioned, as the market demand for these things goes up, the pressure for cities
634640	641360	to accommodate that and for the capitalist class, for the corporations to accommodate that will go
641360	647840	up. And again, there's lots of experiments going on, but there hasn't been a new establishment.
647840	653440	And so one thing that I want to talk about is in the context of history, the American suburbs,
654000	660400	those were intentionally designed about 80 years ago. After World War II, as the
661200	668080	nation was beginning to urbanize very quickly, all the regulations and patterns and architectural
668080	674720	designs and municipal layouts, that didn't exist. The modern suburb, the subdivision,
674720	680560	was a new invention. And so the fact that we invented a new way of living within the last
680640	686240	century tells me that we can invent a new way of living again, and it probably won't take that long.
687200	691520	Because where there's a will, there's a way. And certainly, necessity is the mother of all
691520	696720	invention. And we will need to figure out alternative ways of living that are not centered on the
696720	702880	American suburb. Another option other than downsizing is combining households. So this is
702880	709920	called co-living or co-housing. There are successful co-housing and co-living things
709920	715200	around the world. In America, they're usually actually more expensive because of construction
715200	723040	costs, regulations, red tape, and so on and so forth. In many cases, particularly if you look on
723040	728480	Reddit under the co-housing and co-living subreddits, there are plenty of horror stories of very,
728480	735200	very dangerous manipulative people building these communities. So I want to urge caution
735200	742000	before you get involved in any of those kinds of things. Now that being said, there are successful
742000	748000	examples in America, but there are more successful examples around the world, particularly in Europe,
748000	756720	in various places. There's eco villages which are focused on sustainability. They're basically like
757040	766000	co-op farms, essentially. Now that being said, there's a lot of rising trends around
766000	771440	co-living in conventional houses. You don't necessarily need a special village or a special
771440	776320	structure, right? Because that's where the red tape and regulation and excess cost comes in.
776320	781200	What a lot of people do is actually just combine finances and live in a larger house.
781920	786880	So there's a trend that started a few years ago called mom-munes, and there's actually
786880	793920	services that can help single moms find each other to join forces, band together, and combine
793920	800880	households. Obviously, not everyone is a single mother, so that model doesn't work for everyone,
800880	808800	but put it this way. Some of my friends in my 20s, they got together and rented a large house,
808800	814480	and so having two or three couples living together, or even just a few friends, you know,
814480	819680	three, four, five friends living together, if you combine those incomes and you end up with
819680	826320	eight or $12,000 per month guaranteed income from universal-based income from combining households,
826320	831840	you can afford a pretty nice house for that. And so this is a pretty simple model,
833360	837360	but what I will say is that finding the right people can be challenging. Certainly,
838160	843440	there are plenty of cases of people having gotten stuck with toxic roommates or destructive
844160	848640	partners or whatever and getting trapped in those situations, so we will need to keep in mind that
848640	853840	some people are going to be better and safer living on their own. Certainly, plenty of people want
853840	860560	to live that way, but that being said, the social advantages that come from joining forces and
860560	867120	banding together, of course, we're on the tail end of the pandemic, in which case a lot of people
867120	871440	actually were kind of forced into that situation. You know, we created our little survival groups,
871440	878640	right? It was like the walking dead, you know, you band together. So anyways, whether you downsize
878640	885200	or join forces or a little bit of both, those are ways that you can drastically reduce housing costs
885200	891440	here in America. Again, the biggest thing is that particularly on the downsizing, we need to update
891520	897040	our zoning laws and regulations to accommodate this, but I have no doubt that the pressure from
897040	905280	people to do this will kind of force the government's hand. All right, so transportation. I mentioned,
905280	911680	you know, cars are really expensive and America is a car culture, so how do we reduce transportation
911680	918640	costs? The first thing is walkable cities. So most cities, I don't know about most, but many
918640	925360	cities in Europe were designed and built and founded long before cars. And so because of that,
925360	930160	walkability is kind of intrinsic to a lot of European cities. However, whoops, come back,
930880	938000	a lot of American cities were designed and built with cars in mind. And so because of that, a lot
938000	944480	of American cities are designed around the car. They actually prioritize and privilege cars over
944560	950320	pedestrians, which is super, super problematic. Now, that being said, there are literally dozens
950320	956560	of major projects going on around the world to experiment with new walkable cities. And then,
956560	961200	of course, there are, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of smaller experiments,
962160	968480	you know, of like urban revitalization. The cities near where I live, all up and down the
968480	975520	east coast in the south, they're building walkable areas, maybe not the entire city is walkable,
975520	982560	but some of it is walkable. And so this focus on green spaces and walkability is rising.
982560	986640	There's a couple of YouTube channels I want to recommend. One is City Beautiful, and the other
986640	990800	is not just bikes. These are really great channels. They're really informative, and they will point
990800	995680	out all of the things wrong with American cities, the things that some American cities get right,
995680	1001360	that'll compare American cities with European and Asian cities as well. But for instance,
1001360	1008800	I've been to Paris, and I was surprised at such a sprawling city. I was at the cathedral on the
1008800	1013280	hill, Sacre-Cour, which means Sacred Heart, and I know I didn't say it with the right accent.
1014560	1019680	But it's literally Paris to the horizon. You cannot see outside of the city from the middle of the
1019680	1024880	city, but you don't need a car in Paris. It's wild. And like as an American, that was the first
1024880	1031600	time I'd been one in a city that big, but two in a fully walkable city. Some of the metros were
1031600	1035120	fully automated, which was really cool, because you could go all the way up to the front and look
1035120	1041520	out the front windows. There's buses, there's light rail, and then of course they have the
1041520	1047440	TGV, which is the high-speed rail to get outside of the city. Anyways, point being is that there
1047440	1052880	are lots of these experiments going on. And so for people that want to stay living inside of a city,
1052960	1058400	if you combine those micro apartments or those co-living situations with walkability,
1058400	1064240	that will drastically, drastically reduce cost of living for many people. It will take some time
1064240	1069920	to build this up, especially since we've got so much invested in being a car culture. But ride
1069920	1075840	sharing and fully automated cars are coming, and I actually forgot to create a slide for this.
1075840	1080000	But one of the things that a lot of the big auto manufacturers want to do is actually have
1080000	1088320	fleets of robo taxis. And so rather than owning a car, you'll just use an app to summon a Ford or
1088320	1097200	a Chevy or a Toyota or whatever. And as competition drives down the price, I think I did a calculation
1097200	1105360	once that the total annual cost for me, if I were able to switch to a robo taxi based on the
1105360	1111840	hypothetical rider mile cost, would probably be about $600 a year. And I'm someone who drives
1111840	1119280	20,000 miles per year. So the possibility of doing ride shares and robo taxis could drastically,
1119280	1125120	drastically reduce the cost of ownership for automobiles. Or rather, you get rid of the ownership
1125120	1131840	cost and you just rent in real time. Another thing is if you don't want to live in the city,
1131840	1135280	because I sure as heck don't want to live in the city, I am not a city boy, I'm a country
1135280	1140640	boy, is what I call coaster villages. And these are starting to pop up. They're often just called
1140640	1147040	like tiny house communities or RV communities or whatever. But again, this is one of the things
1147040	1152480	where zoning laws need to be updated. But fortunately, these experiments are going.
1152480	1157840	But basically, think of the Shire, think of Hobbiton, but instead of underground houses,
1157840	1167840	it's tiny houses and Katrina cottages and tag along kind of trailers. Basically, what I anticipate
1167840	1173920	is going to happen is that in cheap rural land, a lot of that land is going to end up being used
1173920	1181040	for very, very small, planned, nearly self sufficient, not necessarily fully self sufficient.
1181040	1186640	I'm not saying an eco village, but rather than having these things planned around cars and
1186640	1193120	subdivisions, it'll be planned around sustainability. And so what I mean by coaster is someone who
1193120	1197120	decides, you know what, I'm just going to coast on UBI. I'm going to be happy with that. But I also
1197120	1206320	want to live in the countryside. You will need things like HOAs because good regulations and
1206320	1212160	good agreements make good neighbors. And so you will need stuff like HOAs still in some of these
1212160	1216720	places, but the total cost of living there is going to be much, much lower. Because imagine
1216720	1223840	if your plot of land and your tiny house is about $40,000 total, right, the mortgage payment on that
1223840	1229200	is going to be like 80 bucks a month or something like that. Maybe maybe, well, let's say 200 bucks
1229200	1238640	a month, you can afford that. That's going to be a 10th of your monthly $2,000 income. So between
1238640	1244320	these two possibilities, walkable cities for those who want the urban living and tiny house
1244320	1250240	villages out in the countryside, we can probably accommodate a lot of people very efficiently
1250240	1257040	and very cheaply. Okay, cool. So I think, oh, and also another advantage of these coaster villages
1257040	1263360	is you don't necessarily need a car. You know, if you live like Bilbo Baggins and Frodo, you just
1263360	1268720	walk to your neighbors, it's a tiny little village. All right, now one thing that a lot of people ask
1268720	1273840	is, okay, yeah, but what, you know, what if I still want more money? What if I'm willing to work?
1273840	1279840	What if I'm able to work? What is, what are the options going to be so that I can still, you know,
1279840	1286560	make some money and get by? So after doing a lot of research, one thing that I found is that local
1286560	1291360	goods and services, there's going to be a lot of these that are going to stick around. And this
1291360	1297440	is because even if a robot can do it, these are these are things that you still prefer a human to
1297440	1303040	do, and that most humans will be willing to pay another human to do. So the first category is
1303040	1308720	the health and wellness stuff. So this includes fitness coaches, personal trainers, massage therapists,
1308720	1313600	that sort of stuff. These are the, these are the kind of things that require a human touch
1313600	1318960	or human empathy, or at least those are highly preferable. So this will be things like
1319760	1325040	barbers and dentists and massage therapists, that sort of thing. Education, tutoring,
1325040	1332240	mentoring and coaching. These are also things that that could be pretty durable against being
1332240	1338560	automated away. Certainly, some online learning is going to be fully replaced by things like chat
1338560	1345440	GPT. Excuse me, many students are already using chat GPT for learning and mentoring and tutoring.
1345440	1349520	And certainly, I mean, even I use that if there's something that I want to learn about, it is one
1349520	1355840	of the best teaching resources out there, because it's interactive. Now that being said, there are
1355840	1361200	still going to be plenty of classes and skills that are going to be better taught by a human,
1361200	1366560	because a human has the same abilities and capacities that you do. So say, for instance,
1366560	1372240	you go to a painting class or a cooking class, or a carpentry class. Those are the kinds of things
1372320	1377840	that that you will, you will prefer to pay for a human just for the experience of being with
1377840	1385600	other people, right? Another thing is going to be experiences such as performances and entertainment,
1385600	1391680	local music, stage performances, busking, you know, those sorts of things are going to be
1392400	1397200	pretty resilient, because again, we are a social species. And so we want that connection with
1397200	1403520	other people. Renfairs, I think, are going to be really popular. And so, you know, you can go set
1403520	1408080	up your booth and do face painting at a renfair or whatever kind of festival or convention you
1408080	1415440	want to go to. Caregiving, grooming, and hygiene, these are other things. So whether it is child care
1415440	1421760	or elder care, or pet care, those kinds of jobs are going to be very resilient against being fully
1421760	1427040	automated away. Because again, even if you do have a robot that can take care of grandma,
1427040	1433040	grandma probably would want to see you rather than a robot, unless you don't get along. Maybe
1433040	1439360	it's better that way. But also like your dog, right? Like my dog hates machines, right? So he
1439360	1446640	would freak out if a robot showed up to take him for a walk. So, you know, granted, I work at home
1446640	1452640	all day every day, so I don't need walkers. But some people would. Other domestic services like
1452640	1460480	gardening, lawn care, cooking, cleaning, growing and sharing food, these are things that will probably
1460480	1467760	persist as well. Because again, local economies, circular economies, these are rising in popularity.
1467760	1473840	And then finally, artisan and craftsmen, handmade goods, arts and crafts, these are the kinds of
1473840	1479680	things that people will really value and cherish. And it's also something that a machine intrinsically
1479680	1486560	cannot do. In the age where machines can make all kinds of furniture and mass produce it,
1486560	1491600	we still already have Etsy where you can buy handmade clothing and handmade furniture and
1491600	1498960	handmade tools. And so the demand is already there. And one thing that can happen of, and yes,
1498960	1504160	they're more expensive, but these are much higher quality goods. And they're also much more durable.
1505360	1511280	So again, even if those, even if mass produced goods become cheaper due to AI, there's still
1511280	1517840	going to be a demand for those high quality handmade, unique goods and arts and crafts.
1518800	1524400	Now, okay, so that's local goods and services. There's also still going to be online and remote.
1524480	1531200	So content creators like me, probably going to stick around influencers, streamers, whether it's a
1531200	1536800	lifestyle blog or travel blog or whatever, I follow, I started following lots of lifestyle
1536800	1542000	bloggers. Usually they're attractive women, because you know, that's just the pattern.
1542880	1548320	But I also follow plenty of plenty of guys who like build stuff, or go on adventures, that kind
1548320	1553200	of thing. And the reason that I think that these are going to stick around is because even if you
1553200	1559920	have a fully digital avatar, your brain knows that it's fake, right? Some people, of course,
1559920	1566080	will be plenty entertained by, you know, a digital avatar. But really, as a human,
1566080	1572320	I want to see another human's experience. I want to learn from that human. I want to empathize
1572320	1578080	with that person. And so content influence streamers, you know, it's the personality,
1578080	1583840	it's the realness, the authenticity. Even if there is some performance associated with it,
1583840	1589920	that's what people really want to connect with. Crowdfunding platforms like Patreon only fans,
1589920	1595760	plenty of other alternatives are out there. Those are going to stick around. And so basically,
1595760	1600240	the two ways that you can make money online in the future, I think, are going to be ads and
1600240	1606160	crowdfunding. There's also white label services like subscription based services. But that's
1606160	1611360	essentially crowdfunding, right? Like you pay to get in, and then you get access to exclusive
1611360	1617920	content. Game hosts, coaches, and trainers of various kinds. So one of my Patreon supporters
1617920	1624080	is actually a professional online coach, and she teaches other coaches. And this is actually a
1624080	1631520	really, really huge market segment. I had no idea how big it was. But again, having that one on one
1631520	1635280	time with someone where you can say, Hey, this is what I'm struggling with, because we're humans,
1635280	1639680	we're always going to be struggling with something, right? But then like game hosts,
1639680	1645120	there's paid dungeon masters that can host that can run D&D campaigns for you. All kinds of stuff
1645120	1650800	is possible online that are intrinsically better done if it's a human. That being said, there are
1650800	1656880	plenty of people working on using GPT technologies to automate, you know, game hosts and that sort
1656880	1661840	of stuff. So some of this is going to be is going to change. But a lot of these things,
1661840	1668480	again, people are willing are the demand for the human is high enough that people are going to be
1668480	1676320	willing to pay for it. Now, on top of making more money on with the UBI, there is also a lot that
1676320	1681040	you can do to reduce to further reduce costs. Obviously, the biggest things are housing and
1681040	1685040	transportation, we already talked about how to reduce the cost there. There's a lot of other
1685040	1690160	stuff that we can do to keep reducing costs in order to make better use of the free time that
1690160	1695280	we have. So for instance, tool sharing, tool libraries, there's actually, I didn't realize
1695280	1702000	this, but many county libraries or, you know, city libraries already have tools that you can check out.
1702800	1707680	And then of course, if the demand for that goes up, then libraries, you know, will continue to do
1707680	1713120	that. There's also maker spaces that you can join usually with a small fee that give you a space to
1713120	1719200	build stuff and borrow tools, circular economics, which is, you know, reusing as much as you can,
1719200	1722560	refurbishing stuff. We're going to talk about refurbishing more in a future slide.
1724000	1730480	Clothing exchanges, clothing swaps, other good swaps, like one thing that I do is that every
1730480	1735680	now and then I just, I have a folding card table and I'll put it out by the road and I just will
1735680	1742080	give stuff away, right? And so by just giving stuff away and sharing, right, you don't even have to
1742080	1748880	worry about, you know, bartering or exchanging or buying stuff, just giving stuff away and making
1748880	1756160	use of those essentially community-based donations. Sharing services as well. So say for instance,
1756960	1761680	you know, you might provide childcare for people in your community, not necessarily for pay,
1761680	1767120	but in exchange they give you food or something, right? So that goes back to bartering and trading.
1767760	1774320	DIY skills, repairing things, fixing things, cleaning up, whatever. There's lots and lots
1774320	1781440	of value that you can get by learning more skills and thus further reducing costs. Caregiving,
1781440	1786320	domestic stuff, I already mentioned that. Okay, so let's talk about the psychology of this. One
1786320	1791120	thing that people are concerned about is, yeah, but what do you do for fun? What do you do for
1791120	1796160	sense of mastery? What do you do for challenge? If I lose my job, you know, how do I have any
1796160	1802320	sense of self-esteem? So let's talk about the psychology of living under UBI. First, we're
1802320	1807680	going to talk about what we're going to use frameworks for this. So first, one of the most
1807680	1812240	famous ones is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. So if you're not familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of
1812240	1817680	Needs, it is basically just this pyramid, which is color-coded like the food pyramid if you're in
1817680	1825040	America, but it says you need to satisfy these needs starting from bottom to top. So physiological
1825040	1830240	needs include air, water, food, shelter, sleep, that sort of stuff. Safety needs, which is about,
1830640	1836640	are you in physical danger? Do you feel safe at home? Is your environment quiet enough?
1837680	1841040	Are there any dangerous smells or chemicals or whatever?
1842400	1848400	Above that, once you have those needs met, the next most fundamental need is love and belonging. So
1848400	1853840	you need friends, you need family, you need to feel that human connection. And of course, we're
1853840	1858720	in a loneliness crisis. I think something like 30% of young people today don't have a single
1859040	1864560	best friend, which is really horrible. And I'm hoping that UBI gives us more free time to connect
1864560	1872080	with people. Above love and belonging, you need esteem, self-esteem, which is self-respect, status,
1872080	1877520	recognition, that sort of stuff. And then finally, self-actualization. So this is what a lot of
1877520	1883120	people are referring to when they worry about, okay, well, if I lose my job, what am I going to do?
1883120	1889200	I need some kind of self-actualization. And so self-actualization is the impulse to become the
1889200	1896000	best version of yourself. That is the version to reach your highest level. And so these are
1896000	1902240	things that are still going to need to be there. And we'll talk about this in future slides in
1902240	1909680	terms of how can you achieve the best version of yourself? Another framework that I'm a big
1909680	1915040	fan of is what's called TLC or therapeutic lifestyle changes. This is a model that was
1915040	1920560	developed by Roger Walsh. And it is an eight-point framework that talks about how do you make a
1920560	1925680	better life for yourself? So the framework is pretty simple, pretty straightforward. One,
1925680	1931280	and this is in no particular order, by the way, one spirituality. So being involved in some kind
1931280	1936640	of spirituality doesn't have to be a megachurch or anything like that. You know, paganism, witchcraft,
1937440	1943760	neo-hellenism, all kinds of stuff, Norse reconstructionists, lots and lots of spiritual
1943760	1949760	frameworks are kind of becoming popular, as certainly a lot of us younger people are more
1949760	1956640	pagan. Giving back, so volunteering and community service is one of the things that, you know,
1956640	1962400	again, we kind of alluded to this already in terms of cost reduction. But giving back, volunteering,
1963120	1969120	giving your time is actually a really good way to build up self-esteem. It's deeply satisfying.
1969920	1976880	Like I said, one thing that I love is just giving stuff away. And if I had more free time and energy,
1976880	1983120	I would probably volunteer more because I have certain skills. And, you know, honestly, a lot
1983120	1988160	of the code that I give away, because I publish all of my code under open-source standards,
1988880	1992560	to me, that is kind of like giving back. And it's very satisfying. I love seeing the little
1992560	1999360	stars and forks on my GitHub repos. Time and nature, hiking, walking, going to the lake,
1999360	2004080	whatever. This is really important for your physical and mental health. I go for a walk
2004080	2009120	pretty much every day, unless the weather is bad or unless I'm sick or too tired.
2009920	2013840	Recreational activities, we're going to talk a lot about recreational activities
2013840	2018560	in upcoming slides. Rest and relaxation. If you don't have to go to work, you can spend a lot
2018560	2024800	more time resting and relaxing. Diet and nutrition. We've talked a lot about how, or we will talk more
2024800	2030000	about how all the free time that you get from UBI will allow you to do things like gardening,
2030000	2034880	but also allow you to learn to cook and spend more time cooking. Because a lot of people don't have
2034880	2041120	time to cook good meals because they're too busy working and resting. And so UBI with additional
2041120	2047920	free time will help people really improve their diet and nutrition. Seven, exercise and activity.
2047920	2053760	So this is like exercising for the sake of exercise, which for me, I get that with time and nature
2053760	2058560	because I go for walks. And I also like to do other things, although I haven't done it as much
2058560	2063760	lately, hiking, climbing, that sort of stuff, kayaking. Relationships and connection. We already
2063760	2068800	talked about relationships and connection in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. And also you will see
2068800	2074320	that relationships and connections, spending time with friends and family is common for all
2074320	2080000	psychological well-being frameworks. Self-determination theory. This is one of my favorite frameworks
2080000	2085440	because it is so simple. And it kind of encapsulates a lot, but it's also not a hierarchy. You need
2085440	2091440	all three of these at all times. And so the idea is that self-determination theory is,
2091440	2097280	this is what people are intrinsically motivated by. These are the intrinsic psychological needs
2097280	2104400	of all humans. So first is autonomy or individual liberty. We need to feel like we are in control
2104400	2110160	of our lives and our fate. This is absolutely critical for all humans. Even humans in
2110160	2115440	collectivist societies, there's always a tension between individual needs and group needs.
2116480	2121120	But that's intrinsic to all social species. It's about balancing the self versus the group.
2121920	2127520	Desire for competence and mastery. So this has to do with Maslow's top hierarchy of needs,
2127520	2133120	which is self-esteem and self-actualization. So competence and mastery, basically feeling
2133120	2138320	like you're good at something. One way to measure this is that we thrive with what's called optimal
2138320	2144080	stress. So optimal stress means that you need some kind of challenge. For instance, people play Elden
2144080	2150000	Ring. People play Dark Souls. These really frustrating, impossible games that I personally
2150080	2154400	don't like. But the idea is that you try and fail, and then when you finally succeed,
2155120	2158800	you feel a sense of mastery. And of course, video games are not the only way to get mastery,
2158800	2162640	but video games are a good way to get a sense of mastery. And as we'll talk about,
2162640	2168000	once we talk about hobbies, there are lots and lots of other ways to get that sense of mastery.
2168000	2172880	Finally, desire for relatedness and connection. As a social species, we are intrinsically
2172880	2177680	motivated to seek out connection with others. And so by keeping in mind what our intrinsic
2177680	2183680	base needs are and building a life around that, we can still maintain our psychological well-being
2183680	2188560	even if we don't have a career, at least a conventional career that we're familiar with.
2189520	2194240	Okay, as I promised, hobbies, this is the last section of the video. And this is honestly where
2194240	2200080	I had the most fun. And it made me really realize, I'm looking forward to this. So I'm going to do
2200080	2205680	everything that I can to help make this future state come to fruition with my YouTube channel
2205680	2211360	and my open source research. So the first thing, obviously gaming, a lot of you tell me how excited
2211360	2217200	you are for the possibility of FDVR, which means full dive virtual reality. Everyone knows what
2217200	2223440	FDVR is, you saw it in the matrix. The idea is that you plug your head in. And as far as you can
2223440	2229440	tell, it is 100% real. We also explored this with Ready Player One, which had like haptic suits.
2230880	2235200	I don't know if it's possible, a haptic suit seems like it's probably more possible in the near
2235200	2241360	term. Full dive VR, such as what you see in the matrix, might not be possible. But you never know.
2241360	2246400	People are working on brain computer interfaces. So if you can just plug in all the sensory
2246400	2251200	information directly into your head, maybe it's possible. Anyways, whatever you want to do,
2251200	2255760	whatever experience you want to have, should hypothetically be possible with FDVR.
2258400	2263280	Part of gaming is that it can be social, right? Game with friends, whether you're competing online
2263280	2269200	with friends, or you got a guild or a clan that you've built. You can also do parallel play in
2269200	2274400	person. So this is what I do with my wife. We heckle each other. While she's playing Assassin's
2274400	2277840	Creed, I'll be like, Hey, did you know that you're on fire? And she's like, Yes, Dave, I know that I'm
2277840	2283920	on fire. You know, parallel play is a great thing to do with friends. You can sit around, you know,
2283920	2288320	I used to do this back in my college days with my buddies, drinking a couple beers, playing Call of
2288320	2293440	Duty, trolling each other. It can be a really great thing. And I'm glad to see that the younger
2293440	2298560	generations do this still. My nephew and all of his friends, they play Minecraft together and other
2298560	2305120	things. There are what I will say is there are some potential downsides. Screen time can be detrimental
2305120	2309760	to your health. But if you balance it with some of the other things, like in the therapeutic
2309760	2313760	lifestyle changes, make sure that you go outside, touch grasses, kids are saying these days.
2314240	2321040	It can also be addictive and isolation is possible. I do suspect that we will see legislation coming
2321040	2326160	that kind of at least provides warnings for how addictive things are. There's a book that I refer
2326160	2331840	to often called Liquid Rain, where they talk about how full dive VR could actually be
2331840	2336480	programmatically addictive, like where it could just stimulate your dopamine. And so you feel
2336480	2340480	like you're having more fun than you actually are. And then when you're not in the full dive VR,
2340720	2347040	you could physically crave it and get sick if you don't have it. So we do need to be careful
2347040	2355120	with creating gaming as a central lifestyle. And another thing is that a gaming world is not
2355120	2358640	necessarily the real world and most people's brains will keep track of that difference.
2359520	2364400	And so it might not be good for self actualization. For instance, if you're a gamer,
2364400	2368720	you might not get the sense that you're reaching your full potential. That being said,
2368800	2372960	if you're a competitive gamer, maybe that is the way that you reach your full potential.
2374240	2379600	Making and fixing things. We humans evolved to use our hands. That is why we have so much
2379600	2385280	dexterity in our hands. We are the tool users. And so one of my best friends from back in the day
2385280	2389280	is working on rebuilding a thistle. So this is a thistle. It's a small racing boat.
2390320	2396240	We would be doing this all day every day if we had UBI and no need to work for money.
2397200	2402400	And because the shop where he's rebuilding his, there's two other ones that are just waiting
2402400	2407440	for someone to come and fix. And if I had the time, that's what I'd be doing. Why? Because it's
2407440	2412480	something that my friend does and you can then race it and do competitive stuff. But there's also
2412480	2417440	skill building, right? The sense of mastery that you get from building something from fixing it
2417440	2422720	and having that thing that you can show off and use. This is a really great way to get a sense of
2422720	2427600	mastery. There's plenty of other things that people do. Lots of guys like rebuild mustangs or
2427600	2436480	corvettes, fixing up old houses and other things. So reusing, refurbishing, fixing, building things.
2436480	2441280	These are really great ways that also tap into really primal needs for humans.
2442480	2446560	Some of the things that are really popular today, particularly with young people,
2446560	2452800	forging, leatherworking, sewing, other carpentry, all of these things revolve around tool use.
2453360	2459600	And so whatever hobby you pick up, if it uses tools, chances are there's a lot of skills involved,
2459600	2465200	which can also lead to that sense of mastery. Cooking, I mentioned this earlier. Cooking is one
2465200	2470000	of the oldest trades, one of the oldest professions out there, and everyone needs to eat. Plus cooking
2470000	2475280	is a good social activity. My wife and I cook together pretty much every day or at least we
2475280	2480080	take turns. Some people compulsively cook and feed other people. My sister-in-law is like that.
2480080	2485440	She loves cooking for people. Point being is that there are a lot of hobbies out there
2486080	2493440	that center around making or fixing things. Outdoor stuff, hiking, climbing, canoeing, boating,
2493440	2502160	whatever. There's all kinds of stuff that we could stand to do more of if you had more free time
2502160	2506000	because you didn't have to work, because you didn't have to be at a desk or at an office
2506000	2512640	or at the store or whatever. And it's not just fishing. Obviously that's the prototypical example
2512640	2517280	where a guy gets to retirement age and he decides he's going to go fishing every day.
2517280	2522880	Not everyone wants to do that. I get it. You could do competitive fishing, but there's also other
2523440	2528400	kinds of competitive outdoor stuff like cross-country challenges. I ran Tough Mudder almost 10 years
2528400	2534320	ago, and I was hungover as heck when I ran it. I was not hungover by the end of it. I burned all
2534320	2542000	that toxins off. Skiing, kayaking, all kinds of really challenging stuff that you can do outside.
2542000	2546160	A lot of my friends picked up mountain biking, which you could do practically anywhere
2548000	2553200	during the pandemic. So one thing that I realized when I was making this video is that if we got
2553200	2559200	UBI tomorrow, I would probably go hike the Appalachian Trail. I love being outside. I love
2559200	2563040	being in the mountains, and that is something that I want to do. But right now, my brain is like,
2563040	2567520	well, I'm still got to make YouTube. I still got to do AI stuff. I still have meetings with my
2567520	2572320	Patreon supporters. So doing the Appalachian Trail is not really an option for me right now,
2572320	2578640	unless I were to take like three months off, which maybe I should. Anyways, fitness. Fitness is the
2578640	2584400	most familiar model that a lot of people use to get mastery, whether it's yoga or Pilates or
2585120	2590640	running or cycling, martial arts, strength training. These are all things that people,
2591440	2597520	many, many people do, and it can be a little cultish for some people. There's also fitness-based
2597520	2603440	competitions like Iron Man, American Ninja, that sort of stuff. That being said, there are many,
2603840	2609120	many, many additional benefits other than just it's something to do.
2610480	2616960	Better fitness leads to reduced pain, increased health, cognitive benefits, emotional benefits,
2616960	2621920	plus you get to show off your body. There's lots of people that love being fit just for the sake
2621920	2630320	of feeling sexy. There are so many people that I knew and have met and where they decided to get fit,
2631280	2638000	started climbing, started going to the gym, and the transformation that they felt as they felt
2638000	2642400	better about themselves, about their body, the sense of accomplishment that they get from that
2642400	2648160	is incredible. It's still not for everyone. So I want to say, okay, even if you have all the options
2648160	2653840	in the world and you decide that exercise isn't for you, that's fine. Or fitness, exercises for
2653840	2659440	everyone. Fitness might not be for you. Meetups. So I am a huge fan of meetup.com. I actually
2659520	2666560	met my now wife at a meetup. We're both writers. So the kinds of tools that are out there. So
2666560	2673120	meetup.com is there specifically for finding people with the same interests, challenges, or
2673120	2680160	whatever. So meetup.com, it's free to join. I tell people about it all the time. I think more
2680160	2686400	people should be on meetup, whether you have a special interest or if you've got something
2686400	2693680	that you're coping with. There's support groups on meetup. I host a local AI meetup. I'm actually
2693680	2699040	going to that later today. Let's see. There's intellectual kinds of things. There's chess
2699040	2706640	clubs. There's spirituality clubs, arts, crafts, photography, all kinds of stuff. Whatever your
2706640	2712080	interest is, especially if you live in a city, you can find other people that have that same
2712560	2719920	interest, which is a really great way to get that social connection. But then also,
2719920	2727280	some of these things can lead to senses of mastery, for instance. All right. So this is life under UBI.
2728240	2733120	I hope that you got a lot out of this. Like I said, making this video, actually, I kind of
2733120	2739040	clarified a lot for myself. And it makes me personally a lot more excited for the future.
2739040	2747520	And personally, this was probably the most fun that I've had in making a video yet. So anyways, cheers.
