0	5360	I gave a talk last night to a bunch of students at Clemson University, and as often happens
5360	11440	when you talk to a bunch of really sharp young people with good questions, it spawned a lot
11440	14400	of thoughts and robust discussions.
14400	18840	And so what I wanted to do was share some of the insights from that conversation that
18840	24200	I had and give you a little bit of updates in terms of kind of my current thinking on
24200	25560	post-labor economics.
25560	32800	So the overarching questions that people ask are, if we are heading for an AI revolution,
32800	37560	a cognitive labor revolution, how is the economy going to work after everyone loses
37560	42080	their jobs, what industries will survive, and which ones will collapse?
42080	46900	So we're going to unpack this from an individual level as well as an aggregate level looking
46900	49320	at the economy as a whole.
49320	52960	So if you're new to this channel or you're new to this concept, post-labor economics
52960	59520	is a new economic paradigm that I personally predict is going to be coming, where the very
59520	64080	short version is, if you no longer need human labor, what else changes?
64080	69280	If the combination of AI, quantum computing, robots, and other automation replaces the
69280	73880	need for human labor, then obviously a lot of things change.
73880	77960	This means that we'll have to fundamentally renegotiate our relationship with labor,
77960	82200	with work, with money, with businesses, and so on and so forth.
82200	89240	So as AI ramps up very quickly, it's gaining new capabilities literally on a weekly basis,
89240	91080	sometimes on a daily basis.
91080	97140	We are heading towards a hyperabundance of cognitive labor, of knowledge work.
97140	101760	In the third industrial revolution, we had a revolution of internet and computers.
101760	107200	So communication accelerated, number crunching accelerated, but by and large automation was
107200	111400	still relegated to manufacturing processes.
111400	120840	Now with this rise of artificial intelligence, we're looking at what's called labor substitution,
120840	126720	in which case you have machines that are able to do new kinds of automation.
126720	132000	We're able to not just automate manufacturing jobs, we're able to automate knowledge work.
132000	136040	And so this is going to drastically disrupt the employment landscape.
136040	140400	And of course, the prevailing wisdom is that technology always creates new jobs.
140400	142380	This isn't necessarily true.
142380	147680	What technology does is it lowers costs, which we will also talk about later in this video.
147680	154360	But when you lower costs, that frees up capital and time and energy and money to be used elsewhere,
154360	160480	which then creates new sectors of demands, new total addressable markets, which then
160480	161920	translates to new jobs.
161920	166800	So there's actually several degrees of separation between technologies and jobs growth.
166800	171600	However, if those new markets are also addressable by the machines that we're building, that's
171600	174780	not necessarily going to translate to human jobs.
174780	177640	So with all that being said, how is this going to work?
177640	178640	How is this going to look?
178640	183280	So what I'm going to present is not necessarily a complete picture because the idea of post-labor
183280	186040	economics is still evolving.
186040	191840	But I think it is a worthwhile and necessary conversation to have moving forward, particularly
191840	194000	as AI ramps up.
194000	197000	So prima facie of benefits.
197000	202040	Just at first glance, there's obviously a lot of benefits to having a ramp up of AI,
202040	204280	otherwise we wouldn't be doing it.
204280	206400	Number one, productivity surge.
206400	212120	If you have better machines, more intelligent computers, better language models, and increasingly
212120	215240	advanced AI, you get productivity benefits.
215240	219900	This has already been empirically proven, where, for instance, Microsoft just had their
219900	226420	Ignite keynote speech, where developers that use co-pilots are 55% more productive.
226420	230580	In some cases, depending on the task, you can be 200% more productive.
230580	236460	And based on the work that I'm doing, I think that before too long, we're just going to
236460	240340	replace human labor altogether in some domains, and it's going to be just completely taken
240340	241980	over by machines.
241980	246700	So an old school example of this is think about telephone operators.
246700	253780	Telephone operators were entirely substituted by automatic telephone routing machines.
253780	258260	Likewise, I think that a lot of coding and a lot of other computer-centric jobs are going
258260	263700	to be just fully automated away before too long, and the speed of productivity is going
263700	264900	to go up.
264900	269300	That's a good thing, but it also has knock-on effects and consequences.
269300	270620	Scientific acceleration.
270620	277500	So as I've produced some tools in the past about reading and summarizing papers, and
277500	282780	now, of course, we have chatbots that have 100,000 token windows, you can stuff a whole
282780	288620	bunch of scientific papers into these, there's also better AI-based tools to search for papers.
288620	293660	So pretty much every scientist that I've talked to is now using AI to accelerate their work.
293660	296380	Now obviously, it's not doing primary science on its own.
296380	301020	This is helping with things like literature reviews and then drafting manuscripts, but
301020	302900	still it's helping.
302900	306780	And then you look at the contribution that labs such as DeepMind are doing, where they're
306780	311580	actually creating fundamentally new step changes in what is scientifically capable with tools
311580	312580	like AlphaFold.
312580	318660	So if you're not familiar with AlphaFold, this is an AI model that allows you to accurately
318660	323340	predict the ways that proteins will fold, which has greatly accelerated drug discovery
323340	326580	and other kinds of biomedical research.
326580	331260	There's also creativity is being drastically impacted now.
331260	336980	We're just starting to see the first full-scale productions of text to video.
336980	341300	And I don't remember who, but someone just predicted that the first 90-minute Hollywood
341300	344580	feature film will be created within the next year.
344580	349260	And so that also has profound implications, because if it becomes infinitely cheaper to
349260	355220	make a Hollywood blockbuster film, that's going to disrupt Disney, Hollywood, Netflix.
355220	362140	It's going to disrupt the celebrity culture and also just the way that we consume digital
362140	363220	entertainment.
363220	365900	So that is going to be profoundly disruptive.
365900	369420	But again, on the surface, it's a good thing because then it's like, okay, well, we get
369420	373860	more entertainment and it's cheaper and faster and more personalized.
373860	376140	We can also scale problem solving.
376260	381100	Basically, if you've watched some of my recent videos about agents and agent swarms, once
381100	386940	you can instantiate one good AI model, you can instantiate billions of copies of that
386940	388660	AI model.
388660	393100	That is cognitive labor that is scalable in a way that is not scalable with humans.
393100	397100	And this is something that I talk about when I talk about the automation paradox is because
397100	402460	until you get that final automation engine online, nothing really happens.
402460	408180	But then, so 0% of the work gets done until the very end and then it's done and then 100%
408180	410860	of the work gets done very quickly.
410860	414620	And then, of course, this will also have knock-on effects in terms like education and many other
414620	417220	industries that we'll unpack later in this video.
417220	420860	One thing that I predict is going to happen is what I call price collapse.
420860	426580	So this is not rocket science, but as we're already seeing, for instance, all the graphics
426580	431260	in this slide deck were generated in a few seconds with AI.
431260	435480	So rather than paying a graphic designer hundreds if not thousands of dollars per video, it
435480	440420	literally cost me a few cents with Dolly and Mid Journey to make the graphics.
440420	446540	So that is a price collapse of a factor of hundreds if not tens of thousands of times
446540	448980	cheaper and faster to do it.
448980	453300	You can expect the same kinds of price collapses for all kinds of services.
453300	458540	As I just mentioned, once we nail text to video, that means a 90-minute Hollywood blockbuster
458540	464900	instead of costing $100 million is going to cost $10,000 if that may be less.
464900	470820	Legal services, financial services, all kinds of things, medical services, health care.
470820	475620	The knock-on effects are very difficult to overstate because we don't really have a
475620	476620	mental model.
476620	483020	We don't have personal experience when entire job sectors and labor markets are drastically
483020	489620	disrupted, not by 10% or 50%, but by 10,000% or a million percent cheaper.
489620	494140	We just don't have a way of comprehending the economic effects that that has.
494140	498500	Now even in industries where AI does not directly impact it.
498500	502940	So for instance, AI can't necessarily make steel move faster in ships.
502940	505420	AI can't make trees grow faster.
505420	510600	However, by removing human labor from it, you can still drastically reduce the cost
510600	517660	of primary goods and services like coal, steel, timber, stone, asphalt, concrete, those
517660	518940	sorts of things.
518940	524760	And so even then, some of the costs can be reduced and avoided, not 100%, but we're
524760	530700	going to have this really interesting economic paradigm where some things, primary resources
530700	535520	like land, are going to mostly hold their value, but other goods and services are going
535520	537440	to basically be free.
537440	540860	And this is why I think that billionaires like Bill Gates are buying up forest land
540860	545100	and farmland, because they're reading the writing on the wall saying, don't invest in
545100	551460	financial industries, don't invest in healthcare, don't invest in X, Y, and Z, instead invest
551460	554140	in things that are going to stick around.
554140	556820	And I'll talk about industries that I predict are going to stick around.
556820	560520	Now one thing I need to caution is this is not investing advice.
560520	561900	This is not financial advice.
561900	567720	This is just me reading the tea leaves in what I see and my interpretation of the investing
567720	570240	behavior of others.
570240	575720	In no means is this a recommendation, because I could be completely and fundamentally wrong
575720	577600	about all of this.
577600	580760	So you have been thoroughly warned.
580760	584760	Another component of this whole trend is reduced aggregate demand.
584760	590280	So one of the students that I gave the talk to asked a really phenomenal question about,
590280	596980	if, for instance, we all start losing our jobs, then we, the consumers, have less money
596980	599860	and in aggregate we will have less demand.
599860	603220	So this is going to impact what business is actually produced.
603220	607260	Because if we have less demand, businesses are going to be less incentivized to produce
607260	611100	goods and services for us, because, well, you don't try and sell something to people
611100	612820	that don't have money.
612820	617260	And so this is actually one of the biggest questions that I see all the time on the comments
617260	622320	as well, is if we don't have money to spend, how is the economy going to work?
622320	628360	So I'm not going to fully address this in this video, but citizens, civilians, we're
628360	629800	not the only consumers.
629800	634240	There's also business to business transactions as well as business to government transactions,
634240	641800	which I think the bulk of the economy is going to shift to being B2B and B2G or public sector
641800	643840	expenditures.
643840	649340	Now there are also some primary demands that all civilians have, and we'll talk about that
649340	654140	in just a second, but I did need to address that reduced aggregate demand is probably
654140	658620	one of the biggest risk factors that we'll see in terms of the economy stalling if and
658620	661900	when we see unemployment rates rising sharply.
661900	666900	Because again, you know, if you go from a six-figure job or even a $50,000 job and you
666900	671820	end up stuck on unemployment benefits or a universal basic income and your income is
671820	679880	reduced to $20,000 a year, that is, you have substantially less market power, purchasing
679880	682880	power in the economy as an actor.
682880	686360	And so this is really going to fundamentally disrupt the economy.
686360	691800	Again, it remains to be seen if this happens, but there have been some recent reports, very
691800	697880	alarming reports showing that AI, such as ChatGPT, are already disrupting a very broad
697900	702620	spectrum of industries and some in very unexpected ways.
702620	709620	So I've told this story before, but one of my former clients told me a story where once
709620	717120	the data analytics tool came out with ChatGPT, it replaced an entire bioinformatic statistician,
717120	720620	which that's a job that you need a master's degree or a PhD to do.
720620	727180	And so then suddenly this tool that costs $20 a month dislocates a job, a human-paying
727200	731800	job that would have cost $8,000 a month or more to have a human in that role.
731800	737160	So that is the magnitude of reduced aggregate demand that we're looking for or that we're
737160	738160	looking at happening.
738160	743320	Now, there is another component of this, which is primary needs, which we'll talk about in
743320	744600	just a moment.
744600	750080	So what this is all leading to is fundamentally new market paradigms.
750080	755120	And so this paradigm shift, this slide is more about some predictions that I have.
755120	761380	So for instance, if we have robots, if we have AI, then perhaps as we're kind of moving
761380	767260	towards a deglobalization and there's trends such as circular economies and farm to table,
767260	773020	I wonder if we're going to see the same thing with manufacturing of goods and also providing
773020	774500	of services.
774500	779740	Because if you can just provide goods and services on demand locally rather than having
779740	781960	long logistic chains.
781960	786900	So for instance, imagine that your theater is running a local version that it just generated
786900	790120	in the cloud rather than waiting for Hollywood.
790120	794940	Likewise, imagine that you go to the Amazon store and instead of some goods that are manufactured
794940	797560	in China, it's just 3D printed in the back.
797560	802480	So this is a little bit more speculative, but we already have some fictional examples
802480	805600	of this like the replicators and Star Trek.
805600	809400	It's within the realm of possibilities, but I think more eminently what we'll see is
809400	815620	on demand production of digital goods and digital services such as legal services, entertainment,
815620	817020	music, that sort of thing.
817020	822140	That stuff is already in the pipeline, local manufacturing of physical goods.
822140	826220	That may or may not happen, but I just wanted to point out that we are looking at some of
826220	828540	these kinds of shifts.
828540	833580	Now one thing that could happen is that as the economic landscape changes, we could see
833580	840200	what's called industry narrowing, which is that many companies and many job sectors or
840200	845640	market segments might just go away for good because they're made completely irrelevant.
845640	848800	Those business models are made completely obsolete.
848800	852280	So time will tell, but it has happened before.
852280	857200	An example is you don't really have horse breeders as a major economic thing anymore.
857200	858200	Why?
858200	863520	Because horses, as an entire industry, were replaced by automobiles over a century ago.
863520	868180	And so while horse care and horse breeding and carriage building and all that fun stuff
868180	871660	was a major industry because horses were used for everything.
871660	872860	Draft horses were used on farms.
872860	876180	They were used for moving goods and services and moving people.
876180	877940	Now that's no longer a thing.
877940	879860	And so we've seen it before.
879860	884380	We will see it again, but it's difficult to predict exactly which industries will fully
884380	889380	collapse and be relegated to a luxury service because there are still horse breeders, but
889380	892380	this is more of old money kind of stuff.
892380	895680	So what are the industries that will survive?
895680	900080	Just off the cuff, here's kind of what I brainstormed as the industries that I think
900080	903720	will probably stick around and be relatively durable.
903720	905720	Again, this is not investing advice.
905720	908600	Personally, I am not invested in any of these.
908600	912680	So take everything that I'm saying here with a gigantic grain of salt.
912680	915280	But first and foremost, raw materials and energy.
915280	916280	We're going to need steel.
916280	917600	We're going to need concrete and stone.
917600	918960	We're going to need timber.
918960	921240	We're going to need water, right?
921260	923940	Those kinds of things are based on primary needs.
923940	927780	So that is something that if you're a living, breathing human being, you need food.
927780	928780	You need shelter.
928780	929780	You need clothes.
929780	934140	So some of those things are going, the demand for those is going to be persistent, even
934140	939620	if it's fully automated, even if it is done by machines and robots and AI.
939620	943580	Semiconductors, obviously if everything is running on AI, we're going to need chip fabs.
943580	948460	We're going to need memories, CPUs, GPUs, RAM, servers, supercomputers.
948460	949720	That industry is sticking around.
949720	951320	If anything, it's going to be bigger.
951320	956480	It might be the primary industry, honestly, because I also predict that in the long run,
956480	960640	it's just more economically feasible for open source data and open source models.
960640	964520	I just watched the entire Microsoft Ignite keynote speech.
964520	968000	Microsoft is going all in on closed source models like GPT-4.
968000	971640	They're also going all in on open source models.
971640	973840	So they are hedging their bets.
973840	978160	However it pans out, Microsoft and NVIDIA, it's all going to be running on their hardware
978220	982060	and their cloud platforms, whether or not it's produced by open AI, whether or not it's
982060	987220	produced by Meta, or whether it's produced by Carnegie Mellon, or whoever else.
987220	992100	Robotics and automation, if you build the tools that build the tools, you're set.
992100	995940	So there's a meme that goes around that says, during a gold rush, sell pickaxes.
995940	1001260	So the ones that sell the pickaxes, the ones that sell the robots that do everything else,
1001260	1004500	the ones that sell the automation hardware and software that do everything else, they're
1004500	1006380	going to be fine.
1006400	1011880	Fuel tech, so this is going to have to do with water, agriculture, sustainable farming,
1011880	1018600	solar energy, other renewables, whether it's thorium reactors or molten salt or nuclear
1018600	1020080	fusion, whatever.
1020080	1026560	Those things, again, because energy is a primary need, as well as food, I think that those
1026560	1029560	industries are going to stick around, which again is why I think people like Bill Gates
1029560	1032640	are investing in farmland and timberland.
1032640	1033640	Makes sense to me.
1033640	1036380	In their shoes, I do the same exact thing.
1036380	1038380	And then finally, experience industries.
1038380	1045020	So as we all transition away from working the nine to five grind, which I can say from
1045020	1049340	personal experience, yeah, you get rid of the desk job, you get bored and you want
1049340	1050420	stuff to do.
1050420	1054140	So that means movie theaters, that means restaurants, that means yoga studios, that
1054140	1060740	means retreats, vacations, Airbnbs, all kinds of everything around the experience industry
1060740	1066800	I think is going to be a major, major pillar of the economy moving forward.
1066800	1071840	But again, it's going to be interesting because technically, film and TV are part of the experience
1071840	1077360	industry, but the models, the cloud providers that build the models that write the new TV
1077360	1080000	shows and movies, those are going to be the ones that stick around.
1080000	1082800	Netflix, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.
1082800	1085160	Disney, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.
1085160	1089320	Now I did look it up before I made this video, Disney did actually assemble like a strike
1089340	1094300	force, an AI strike force that they're actively exploring every way that they can incorporate
1094300	1096460	AI into their business.
1096460	1101580	So I think Disney is probably well positioned to stick around and they're already using
1101580	1107980	AI for their animatronics, they're already using AI to help with drafting movies.
1107980	1112060	Maybe they should have used AI for Ant-Man Quantamania or maybe they did use AI and that
1112060	1114740	was the problem, I don't know.
1114740	1118460	So what are the industries that I predict are going to go extinct?
1118460	1123640	Healthcare, I've mentioned this before where when you combine regenerative medicine, rejuvenation
1123640	1128320	therapies and all the all the advancements that we're going to see from Alpha Fold 2,
1128320	1132720	Alpha Fold 3 and everything else, I suspect that our relationship with healthcare is going
1132720	1136520	to be fundamentally and drastically different within five to 10 years.
1136520	1140840	A lot of people still ask me, like Dave, when are we going to hit longevity escape velocity?
1140840	1146800	Last year there were three rejuvenation therapies in the pipeline, this year there are 20.
1146800	1155940	The economic incentive to nail rejuvenation therapies is so high and it's getting investment
1155940	1161380	from everyone from DARPA to like all of Silicon Valley, Google has, you know, Alphabet has
1161380	1166820	their rejuvenation, their regeneration therapy wing, so it's coming.
1166820	1170500	The money is there, where the money goes results follow.
1170500	1174820	The same thing has happened with solar, the same thing has happened with AI, so the money
1174840	1176800	is there, it's just a matter of time.
1176800	1182040	I remember back in 2010 when I first started paying attention to solar and I'm like, oh,
1182040	1187440	it's ramping up and now a lot of nations and a lot of companies are exceeding their carbon
1187440	1192000	neutral targets, obviously that's a contentious field, so I'm not going to get too bogged
1192000	1198040	down into it, but the point being is that back in 2010, nobody thought that solar would
1198040	1202680	be where it is today and now it is, likewise the investment is ramping up in regenerative
1202860	1206980	medicine, so it's coming down the pipeline.
1206980	1210220	Education is also going to fundamentally change.
1210220	1214860	A lot of us are already using chat GPT and other tools to learn as fast as we can.
1214860	1220060	I've actually consulted with a bunch of different startups that are trying to do either tools
1220060	1225980	for teachers, tools for universities or avatars to teach students.
1225980	1230820	If you ever watch Star Trek Voyager, you go to the holodeck and you have like a personalized
1230840	1237720	holodeck program with VR that's entirely possible that students have one-on-one mentoring sessions
1237720	1243040	with holographic avatars, that would be really cool.
1243040	1249320	University systems are currently deeply strained and if jobs are going away, then you're not
1249320	1253240	going to be going to university to get a better job, so then why would you go to university?
1253240	1256800	That's a conversation for another time, but that is something that some of the students
1256800	1259240	at Clemson asked.
1259260	1264060	My short answer was university experience is good if you're going to become a global
1264060	1270740	citizen and you still have a monumental task before you in helping the human species become
1270740	1274380	a truly global species in a global culture, because we are not right now.
1274380	1277020	We are very, very fragmented.
1277020	1282180	Financial automation, now obviously Wall Street and the finance industry and the investment
1282180	1289180	industry, that's not going away, but insurance and a bunch of other things, I honestly suspect
1289260	1293420	that the margins are going to get too thin on a lot of these industries and it's going
1293420	1295540	to be radically restructured.
1295540	1300340	And then finally, as I've been talking about, I do think that our relationship with digital
1300340	1303940	entertainment is going to fundamentally shift and I think we're going to see a lot of implosions
1303940	1308460	and a lot of collapses, because again, if you need to pay an A-list celebrity $20 million
1308460	1315460	to make a movie or you could make 200 movies with AI for the same price, guess which one
1315480	1319520	you're probably going to do just for the sake of economics.
1319520	1321840	Real quick plug for my Patreon.
1321840	1328040	I have an upcoming webinar masterclass on December 8th at 11 a.m. U.S. Eastern.
1328040	1329560	I have two tiers on my Patreon.
1329560	1333520	There's the $5 basic tier, which gets you access to Discord, and then the $50 premium
1333520	1339040	tier, which gets you access to a bunch more exclusive content, but yeah, so go ahead and
1339040	1344480	sign up if you're interested and moving right back along into the show.
1344500	1350060	So I mentioned primary needs, so this is a first principles view of what is it that
1350060	1351060	people need?
1351060	1356500	Because there are 8 billion people on the planet and even if money goes away tomorrow,
1356500	1361980	even if everything is fully automated, this is an attempt to take a first principles view
1361980	1364900	of, okay, what is it that people actually need?
1364900	1367020	Because where there's a need, there's a way.
1367020	1372740	If there's the biological, the animal impetus to achieve these things, we will figure it
1372740	1373740	out.
1374160	1377960	I've got a little infographic, so there's food, there's housing, there's water, there's
1377960	1381360	energy, so those are all primary needs.
1381360	1386000	I think that as the economy pivots, those industries, as I mentioned, are going to be
1386000	1388520	the ones that are the most durable.
1388520	1394400	Power generation, food preparation, production and movement, homes, that sort of thing.
1394400	1399080	This is why, for instance, many people have said the housing industry is the safest investment
1399080	1400720	because everyone needs somewhere to live.
1400740	1404820	Likewise, food is something that everyone needs, but the margins are already really thin on
1404820	1405820	food.
1405820	1411900	But, so this, I think, is going to be, like focusing on a primary needs economic paradigm
1411900	1417060	is going to be the first phase of the pivot to post-labor economics because people have
1417060	1421360	talked about universal basic income or universal basic services.
1421360	1428460	If we see a commensurate price collapse, it's entirely possible that electricity will basically
1428460	1432840	become free, at least at the scale that most people consume it at.
1432840	1435520	My power bill that I just paid was $180.
1435520	1440480	What if that goes down to $18 a month because of hyperabundance of solar and other renewables?
1440480	1448360	What if water becomes practically free, cleansed, healthy water because of energy hyperabundance?
1448360	1453080	What if all the knock-on effects of AI and automation makes houses cheaper because the
1453080	1458120	price of timber goes down and the price of concrete goes down and also then the cost
1458120	1461740	of building houses goes down because then you can do it with robots?
1461740	1467460	So again, I think that it is not outside the realm of possibility that the cost of living
1467460	1471580	within the next five to 10 years could go down by as much as like 10x.
1471580	1475700	So like, you know, if your cost of living right now is $40,000 a year, you might be
1475700	1480500	able to have the same standard of living with $4,000 a year in 10 years.
1480500	1486220	That's kind of what I'm hoping for because that price collapse will offset the reduced
1486220	1489960	aggregate demand because, yes, people might have less money, but if everything is that
1489960	1497120	much cheaper or even, you know, more like, let's say prices go down 100x, but your income
1497120	1502000	goes down 10x, you're effectively 10 times wealthier than you were before.
1502000	1508840	So obviously, if all you have in life is just housing and food and clothes, that's relatively
1508840	1509840	boring.
1509840	1513680	So I then took a look at secondary needs.
1513680	1516200	So secondary needs are the spice of life.
1516200	1519740	This is the stuff that makes life interesting and fun and engaging.
1519740	1522940	And so the categories that I came up with were rich experiences.
1522940	1528820	So like travel, vacations, peak experiences like concerts and, you know, dance clubs and
1528820	1532980	that sort of stuff, those are going to be something that is very persistent.
1532980	1535940	There's going to be a durable demand for that.
1535940	1537140	Creativity and expression.
1537140	1542660	So again, as you have more time and you get away from, you know, the office job, I and
1542660	1546240	many people like me are engaging more and more in creative pursuits.
1546240	1547240	I'm writing a novel.
1547240	1550840	I know lots of people that as soon as they retire, they go back to acting and singing
1550840	1552200	and that sort of thing.
1552200	1555700	I know plenty of people who are painters and digital artists.
1555700	1559280	And so the industries around those, even if those are cottage industries and they're not
1559280	1566440	primary economic drivers, the persistent demand for human creativity and artistic expression
1566440	1570000	is going to be around as long as there are humans.
1570000	1571000	Digital stimulation.
1571000	1575660	So there are many of those, many of us who just want challenges for the sake of challenges.
1575660	1580220	So even if AI can do everything, you know, people are still going to play chess.
1580220	1582660	Again, machines are already better than humans at chess.
1582660	1583980	We still play chess.
1583980	1586660	People are still going to be programming and coding and doing hackathons.
1586660	1589900	Yes, even if the AI can do it better, you still want to see, you want to test your
1589900	1592620	metal against the machine.
1592620	1595340	So reading for pleasure, those kinds of things.
1595340	1597180	Obviously not everyone is a nerd like me.
1597180	1599860	So not everyone is like, you know what, if I don't have to use my brain, I'm not going
1599880	1600880	to use my brain.
1600880	1601880	I'm just going to go to the beach.
1601880	1602880	That's perfectly fine too.
1602880	1607720	Culture and community is another aspect that I think is going to stick around and actually
1607720	1609400	probably be magnified.
1609400	1616360	So what I mean is walkable cities, green spaces, parks, co-living and co-housing situations,
1616360	1622280	community centers, religious experiences, whether churches, you know, there's a lot
1622280	1628200	of talk around the future of ideology, like is Christianity growing or going away?
1628200	1632020	There's geopolitical tensions between, you know, for instance, Christianity and Islam,
1632020	1638260	but there's also a resurgence of neo-paganism, you know, witches are all the rage right now.
1638260	1639420	So that sort of thing.
1639420	1642780	But then also, you know, there's still talk about the meaning crisis and that sort of
1642780	1643780	thing.
1643780	1647660	And so people are, you know, kind of desperate for that meaning and that connection, particularly
1647660	1651260	when you think about the fact that we're in the middle of a loneliness epidemic.
1651260	1655740	So the need for culture, community and spirituality and connection are also going to be persistent
1655740	1657860	and those are presently underserved needs.
1658200	1662640	I've been a big fan of the book, The Status Game, by William Store and so one thing that
1662640	1669200	I realized is, or one question that I get is, okay, well, if you can't make money and
1669200	1674320	therefore you can't, you know, build up your social status through conspicuous consumption,
1674320	1675320	what do we do?
1675320	1678480	Well, there's lots of other ways to build up status.
1678480	1680280	You can get famous on YouTube.
1680280	1684040	You can, you know, go to the gym and get a sexy body.
1684040	1686720	You can become a chess grandmaster.
1686720	1688540	There's all kinds of things that you can do.
1688540	1690660	You can become a musician.
1690660	1697020	Social status throughout history has been largely predicated on other things other than wealth.
1697020	1702500	Wealth as a social status is a relatively new phenomenon, particularly under capitalism
1702500	1707340	and neoliberalism, where you incentivize people to accumulate more wealth because against
1707340	1710620	conspicuous consumption is one of the best ways to signal status.
1710620	1714100	But there are plenty of other ways to signal status.
1714100	1720680	Through education, piety, spirituality, intellectual pursuits, physical pursuits like athleticism.
1720680	1724880	Again, that's why I picked this image of a bunch of attractive young people laying on
1724880	1725880	the beach.
1725880	1726880	Why?
1726880	1729320	Because part of what's happening in this image is status.
1729320	1733520	They're signaling their status by literally showing off their bodies is that's one thing
1733520	1734520	that people do.
1734520	1737920	And if you ever go to the gym, there are people that do that, boys and girls, men and women
1737920	1741440	will show off their bodies at the gym and that's part of why they're doing it is because
1741440	1742440	it makes them feel good.
1742440	1746380	They go to the gym and they're like, I'm shredded, I look really good.
1746380	1752780	So anyways, I do suspect that as people come to understand this, that a status economy
1752780	1755620	is going to replace the attention economy.
1755620	1760060	And we already see this like YouTubers and other influencers that have more subscribers
1760060	1764100	are like, ah, well, I've got five times as subscribers that you do so therefore I'm better.
1764100	1769780	So like it's a popularity contest, but that is a proxy for the status contest.
1769780	1775120	Now this is the biggest thing that scares me is and this is what I actually am really
1775120	1779240	interested in talking to more people about is forming a new social contract.
1779240	1783960	So the current social contract is around a three-way relationship between the government.
1783960	1788200	So we got Uncle Sam here and then we got the corporate fat cats and then we've got ordinary
1788200	1790200	people.
1790200	1797440	So right now, Uncle Sam, the government mediates the relationship between the businesses and
1797440	1800100	the people, the labor workforce.
1800100	1804580	But if the demand for labor goes away, then suddenly the government and businesses are
1804580	1809740	holding all the cards and that's a surefire way to get a dystopian hellscape.
1809740	1811380	So how do we do that?
1811380	1813260	How do we navigate and fix it?
1813260	1816420	First, we need to rebalance power.
1816420	1822700	This means that we need to shift the priority away from businesses and more towards people
1822700	1826500	and government, particularly voter power.
1826500	1832880	And we'll do this through shoring up democratic institutions such as voter reforms, increasing
1832880	1841240	civic engagement, adding new levers of power that citizens have in terms of steering the
1841240	1846360	government and ensuring that the government serves the people as much if not more than
1846360	1847360	businesses.
1847360	1852080	We'll need some sort of redistribution mechanisms and honestly having some sort of redistribution
1852080	1857660	behooves the businesses because again, if aggregate consumer demand goes down, that's
1857660	1859660	bad for business.
1859660	1862300	If your customers are all broke, that's no good.
1862300	1866540	So we'll need to make sure that consumers have money to spend in order to keep the economy
1866540	1872060	going and pretty much some sort of redistribution, whether it's negative income tax or UBI or
1872060	1876900	universal basic services, we'll need something.
1876900	1882280	The way that I articulated it mathematically is if wealth and income inequality and gradients
1882280	1885240	are too steep, then you can't go uphill.
1885240	1887480	You can't go uphill forever.
1887480	1890680	And this will also require some kind of regulatory overhaul.
1890680	1895080	Now there are a lot of tools in the toolbox in terms of fiscal policy and monetary policy
1895080	1896920	that are already available.
1896920	1902200	So what I suspect is going to happen is that the establishment is going to do very small
1902200	1904680	incremental changes across the board.
1904680	1909740	It's not going to be one big policy, it's going to be dozens if not hundreds of little
1909740	1917980	incremental policy changes on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual basis to adjust slowly because
1917980	1920340	again, law of unintended consequences.
1920340	1925300	If you change too many things at once, you might end up making things worse, which would
1925300	1927060	be bad.
1927060	1932180	So just as a recap on this whole thing, we're talking at the highest level about knowledge
1932180	1934300	labor substitution.
1934320	1938600	The four criteria that I give is better, faster, cheaper, safer.
1938600	1942640	As machines and AI become better, faster, cheaper and safer than humans at knowledge
1942640	1947760	work, one, there's no economic incentive to keep humans in those jobs.
1947760	1951880	But then it could also be considered unethical to keep humans in those jobs.
1951880	1958400	So for instance, if an AI doctor is better, faster, cheaper and safer than a human doctor,
1958400	1959400	who are you going to go to?
1959400	1961840	You're going to go to the robot doctor because the outcomes are going to be better and it's
1961840	1964040	going to be cheaper.
1964040	1969140	In that scenario, it might become unethical to allow humans to continue practicing medicine.
1969140	1977460	Likewise, for driving, once we stick the landing on full self-driving and let's say that automatic
1977460	1985860	cars can drive 10 billion miles per fatality or less, it might become illegal to allow
1985860	1989540	humans to continue driving except in certain circumstances.
1989540	1991980	So that's one thing to keep in mind.
1991980	1996080	Reduced aggregate demand is going to be one of the major economic signals that we're
1996080	2000520	going to be afraid of because if aggregate consumer demand goes down, the economy falters
2000520	2001920	so on and so forth.
2001920	2004040	So we'll need something to shore that up.
2004040	2009360	Now again, the converse of that is price collapse might offset that.
2009360	2013880	But that's two very powerful deflationary pressures, which we should expect to see some
2013880	2016440	deflationary pressure because that's what technology does.
2016440	2020320	It makes goods and services cheaper, but I don't think we're ready for how much cheaper
2020320	2022660	some of those goods and services are going to be.
2022660	2027340	So then I talked about primary needs, which is just first principle, look at yourself
2027340	2028340	as an animal.
2028340	2033020	What is it that you need and what are you willing to work or fight or whatever to get?
2033020	2037500	That's food, water, clothing, housing, your basic fundamental needs.
2037500	2042060	Status economy is going to be a big component of how this all shakes out in terms of our
2042060	2045620	social living, how we live on a day-to-day basis.
2045620	2048740	Some of these things like some of the goods and services that stick around will be about
2048740	2049740	status.
2049960	2054160	When I talk about status economy, I'm talking more about actually how we allocate our personal
2054160	2056080	time and resources.
2056080	2057480	We might spend more time at the gym.
2057480	2060560	We might spend more time practicing piano, like that sort of stuff, and I'm talking
2060560	2061960	about myself here.
2061960	2063760	I was just like, I used to play piano as a kid.
2063760	2064760	You know what?
2064760	2066080	It might be time for me to pick that up again.
2066080	2067080	Why?
2067080	2068400	Because I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at it.
2068400	2072040	I've completely forgotten it all because it was, I'm not going to say how long ago
2072040	2073040	it was.
2073040	2074720	It was a long time ago.
2074720	2075800	New social contract.
2075820	2080780	So negotiating a new social contract, honestly changing the narratives around money and around
2080780	2085500	democracy is probably the hardest part of all this because as I said, we've got lots
2085500	2090540	of, we've got lots of tools in the financial toolbox in terms of monetary policy and fiscal
2090540	2091540	policy.
2091540	2095780	However, in America, our narratives around the ownership class, around wealth, around
2095780	2100460	privilege, around the elites, that is probably going to be the biggest sticking point honestly
2100460	2104540	because a lot of people are temporarily embarrassed millionaires and so they're like, oh, we'll
2104560	2108800	protect the millionaire class, protect the corporate class at all costs and it's like,
2108800	2109960	they don't need any protection.
2109960	2111520	They're fine.
2111520	2116760	So we need to change the focus from the engines of productivity to us and I'm not talking
2116760	2122480	about radically restructuring the entire economy, but you know, we need to change something.
2122480	2125360	And then finally, as I already mentioned, deflationary pressures.
2125360	2127200	So I don't need to rehash that.
2127200	2128200	Thanks for watching.
2128200	2129360	I hope you got a lot out of this video.
2129360	2130880	Like, subscribe, so on and so forth.
2130880	2131880	I'll see you next time.
2131880	2132320	Cheers.
