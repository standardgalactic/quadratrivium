1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
I gave a talk last night to a bunch of students at Clemson University, and as often happens

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,440
when you talk to a bunch of really sharp young people with good questions, it spawned a lot

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,400
of thoughts and robust discussions.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,840
And so what I wanted to do was share some of the insights from that conversation that

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,200
I had and give you a little bit of updates in terms of kind of my current thinking on

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560
post-labor economics.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,800
So the overarching questions that people ask are, if we are heading for an AI revolution,

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,560
a cognitive labor revolution, how is the economy going to work after everyone loses

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,080
their jobs, what industries will survive, and which ones will collapse?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,900
So we're going to unpack this from an individual level as well as an aggregate level looking

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,320
at the economy as a whole.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,960
So if you're new to this channel or you're new to this concept, post-labor economics

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,520
is a new economic paradigm that I personally predict is going to be coming, where the very

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
short version is, if you no longer need human labor, what else changes?

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
If the combination of AI, quantum computing, robots, and other automation replaces the

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,880
need for human labor, then obviously a lot of things change.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,960
This means that we'll have to fundamentally renegotiate our relationship with labor,

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,200
with work, with money, with businesses, and so on and so forth.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,240
So as AI ramps up very quickly, it's gaining new capabilities literally on a weekly basis,

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
sometimes on a daily basis.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,140
We are heading towards a hyperabundance of cognitive labor, of knowledge work.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,760
In the third industrial revolution, we had a revolution of internet and computers.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,200
So communication accelerated, number crunching accelerated, but by and large automation was

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,400
still relegated to manufacturing processes.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:02:00,840
Now with this rise of artificial intelligence, we're looking at what's called labor substitution,

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,720
in which case you have machines that are able to do new kinds of automation.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,000
We're able to not just automate manufacturing jobs, we're able to automate knowledge work.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,040
And so this is going to drastically disrupt the employment landscape.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,400
And of course, the prevailing wisdom is that technology always creates new jobs.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,380
This isn't necessarily true.

31
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,680
What technology does is it lowers costs, which we will also talk about later in this video.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,360
But when you lower costs, that frees up capital and time and energy and money to be used elsewhere,

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,480
which then creates new sectors of demands, new total addressable markets, which then

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
translates to new jobs.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
So there's actually several degrees of separation between technologies and jobs growth.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,600
However, if those new markets are also addressable by the machines that we're building, that's

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,780
not necessarily going to translate to human jobs.

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,640
So with all that being said, how is this going to work?

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
How is this going to look?

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
So what I'm going to present is not necessarily a complete picture because the idea of post-labor

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,040
economics is still evolving.

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,840
But I think it is a worthwhile and necessary conversation to have moving forward, particularly

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
as AI ramps up.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So prima facie of benefits.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,040
Just at first glance, there's obviously a lot of benefits to having a ramp up of AI,

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,280
otherwise we wouldn't be doing it.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,400
Number one, productivity surge.

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,120
If you have better machines, more intelligent computers, better language models, and increasingly

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,240
advanced AI, you get productivity benefits.

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,900
This has already been empirically proven, where, for instance, Microsoft just had their

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,420
Ignite keynote speech, where developers that use co-pilots are 55% more productive.

52
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,580
In some cases, depending on the task, you can be 200% more productive.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,460
And based on the work that I'm doing, I think that before too long, we're just going to

54
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,340
replace human labor altogether in some domains, and it's going to be just completely taken

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
over by machines.

56
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,700
So an old school example of this is think about telephone operators.

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,780
Telephone operators were entirely substituted by automatic telephone routing machines.

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,260
Likewise, I think that a lot of coding and a lot of other computer-centric jobs are going

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,700
to be just fully automated away before too long, and the speed of productivity is going

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,900
to go up.

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,300
That's a good thing, but it also has knock-on effects and consequences.

62
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,620
Scientific acceleration.

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,500
So as I've produced some tools in the past about reading and summarizing papers, and

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,780
now, of course, we have chatbots that have 100,000 token windows, you can stuff a whole

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,620
bunch of scientific papers into these, there's also better AI-based tools to search for papers.

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,660
So pretty much every scientist that I've talked to is now using AI to accelerate their work.

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,380
Now obviously, it's not doing primary science on its own.

68
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,020
This is helping with things like literature reviews and then drafting manuscripts, but

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,900
still it's helping.

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,780
And then you look at the contribution that labs such as DeepMind are doing, where they're

71
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,580
actually creating fundamentally new step changes in what is scientifically capable with tools

72
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
like AlphaFold.

73
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,660
So if you're not familiar with AlphaFold, this is an AI model that allows you to accurately

74
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,340
predict the ways that proteins will fold, which has greatly accelerated drug discovery

75
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,580
and other kinds of biomedical research.

76
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,260
There's also creativity is being drastically impacted now.

77
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,980
We're just starting to see the first full-scale productions of text to video.

78
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,300
And I don't remember who, but someone just predicted that the first 90-minute Hollywood

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,580
feature film will be created within the next year.

80
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,260
And so that also has profound implications, because if it becomes infinitely cheaper to

81
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,220
make a Hollywood blockbuster film, that's going to disrupt Disney, Hollywood, Netflix.

82
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:02,140
It's going to disrupt the celebrity culture and also just the way that we consume digital

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,220
entertainment.

84
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,900
So that is going to be profoundly disruptive.

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,420
But again, on the surface, it's a good thing because then it's like, okay, well, we get

86
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,860
more entertainment and it's cheaper and faster and more personalized.

87
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,140
We can also scale problem solving.

88
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,100
Basically, if you've watched some of my recent videos about agents and agent swarms, once

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,940
you can instantiate one good AI model, you can instantiate billions of copies of that

90
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,660
AI model.

91
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,100
That is cognitive labor that is scalable in a way that is not scalable with humans.

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
And this is something that I talk about when I talk about the automation paradox is because

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,460
until you get that final automation engine online, nothing really happens.

94
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,180
But then, so 0% of the work gets done until the very end and then it's done and then 100%

95
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,860
of the work gets done very quickly.

96
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,620
And then, of course, this will also have knock-on effects in terms like education and many other

97
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,220
industries that we'll unpack later in this video.

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,860
One thing that I predict is going to happen is what I call price collapse.

99
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,580
So this is not rocket science, but as we're already seeing, for instance, all the graphics

100
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,260
in this slide deck were generated in a few seconds with AI.

101
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,480
So rather than paying a graphic designer hundreds if not thousands of dollars per video, it

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,420
literally cost me a few cents with Dolly and Mid Journey to make the graphics.

103
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,540
So that is a price collapse of a factor of hundreds if not tens of thousands of times

104
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,980
cheaper and faster to do it.

105
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,300
You can expect the same kinds of price collapses for all kinds of services.

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,540
As I just mentioned, once we nail text to video, that means a 90-minute Hollywood blockbuster

107
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,900
instead of costing $100 million is going to cost $10,000 if that may be less.

108
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,820
Legal services, financial services, all kinds of things, medical services, health care.

109
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,620
The knock-on effects are very difficult to overstate because we don't really have a

110
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
mental model.

111
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,020
We don't have personal experience when entire job sectors and labor markets are drastically

112
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,620
disrupted, not by 10% or 50%, but by 10,000% or a million percent cheaper.

113
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,140
We just don't have a way of comprehending the economic effects that that has.

114
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,500
Now even in industries where AI does not directly impact it.

115
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,940
So for instance, AI can't necessarily make steel move faster in ships.

116
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,420
AI can't make trees grow faster.

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,600
However, by removing human labor from it, you can still drastically reduce the cost

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:37,660
of primary goods and services like coal, steel, timber, stone, asphalt, concrete, those

119
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,940
sorts of things.

120
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,760
And so even then, some of the costs can be reduced and avoided, not 100%, but we're

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,700
going to have this really interesting economic paradigm where some things, primary resources

122
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,520
like land, are going to mostly hold their value, but other goods and services are going

123
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
to basically be free.

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,860
And this is why I think that billionaires like Bill Gates are buying up forest land

125
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,100
and farmland, because they're reading the writing on the wall saying, don't invest in

126
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,460
financial industries, don't invest in healthcare, don't invest in X, Y, and Z, instead invest

127
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,140
in things that are going to stick around.

128
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,820
And I'll talk about industries that I predict are going to stick around.

129
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,520
Now one thing I need to caution is this is not investing advice.

130
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,900
This is not financial advice.

131
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,720
This is just me reading the tea leaves in what I see and my interpretation of the investing

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,240
behavior of others.

133
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,720
In no means is this a recommendation, because I could be completely and fundamentally wrong

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,600
about all of this.

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,760
So you have been thoroughly warned.

136
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Another component of this whole trend is reduced aggregate demand.

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,280
So one of the students that I gave the talk to asked a really phenomenal question about,

138
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,980
if, for instance, we all start losing our jobs, then we, the consumers, have less money

139
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,860
and in aggregate we will have less demand.

140
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,220
So this is going to impact what business is actually produced.

141
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,260
Because if we have less demand, businesses are going to be less incentivized to produce

142
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,100
goods and services for us, because, well, you don't try and sell something to people

143
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,820
that don't have money.

144
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,260
And so this is actually one of the biggest questions that I see all the time on the comments

145
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,320
as well, is if we don't have money to spend, how is the economy going to work?

146
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,360
So I'm not going to fully address this in this video, but citizens, civilians, we're

147
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,800
not the only consumers.

148
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,240
There's also business to business transactions as well as business to government transactions,

149
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,800
which I think the bulk of the economy is going to shift to being B2B and B2G or public sector

150
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,840
expenditures.

151
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,340
Now there are also some primary demands that all civilians have, and we'll talk about that

152
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,140
in just a second, but I did need to address that reduced aggregate demand is probably

153
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,620
one of the biggest risk factors that we'll see in terms of the economy stalling if and

154
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,900
when we see unemployment rates rising sharply.

155
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Because again, you know, if you go from a six-figure job or even a $50,000 job and you

156
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,820
end up stuck on unemployment benefits or a universal basic income and your income is

157
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:19,880
reduced to $20,000 a year, that is, you have substantially less market power, purchasing

158
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
power in the economy as an actor.

159
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,360
And so this is really going to fundamentally disrupt the economy.

160
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,800
Again, it remains to be seen if this happens, but there have been some recent reports, very

161
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,880
alarming reports showing that AI, such as ChatGPT, are already disrupting a very broad

162
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,620
spectrum of industries and some in very unexpected ways.

163
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,620
So I've told this story before, but one of my former clients told me a story where once

164
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:57,120
the data analytics tool came out with ChatGPT, it replaced an entire bioinformatic statistician,

165
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,620
which that's a job that you need a master's degree or a PhD to do.

166
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,180
And so then suddenly this tool that costs $20 a month dislocates a job, a human-paying

167
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,800
job that would have cost $8,000 a month or more to have a human in that role.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,160
So that is the magnitude of reduced aggregate demand that we're looking for or that we're

169
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
looking at happening.

170
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,320
Now, there is another component of this, which is primary needs, which we'll talk about in

171
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,600
just a moment.

172
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,080
So what this is all leading to is fundamentally new market paradigms.

173
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,120
And so this paradigm shift, this slide is more about some predictions that I have.

174
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,380
So for instance, if we have robots, if we have AI, then perhaps as we're kind of moving

175
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,260
towards a deglobalization and there's trends such as circular economies and farm to table,

176
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,020
I wonder if we're going to see the same thing with manufacturing of goods and also providing

177
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,500
of services.

178
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,740
Because if you can just provide goods and services on demand locally rather than having

179
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,960
long logistic chains.

180
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,900
So for instance, imagine that your theater is running a local version that it just generated

181
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,120
in the cloud rather than waiting for Hollywood.

182
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,940
Likewise, imagine that you go to the Amazon store and instead of some goods that are manufactured

183
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,560
in China, it's just 3D printed in the back.

184
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,480
So this is a little bit more speculative, but we already have some fictional examples

185
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
of this like the replicators and Star Trek.

186
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,400
It's within the realm of possibilities, but I think more eminently what we'll see is

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,620
on demand production of digital goods and digital services such as legal services, entertainment,

188
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,020
music, that sort of thing.

189
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,140
That stuff is already in the pipeline, local manufacturing of physical goods.

190
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,220
That may or may not happen, but I just wanted to point out that we are looking at some of

191
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,540
these kinds of shifts.

192
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,580
Now one thing that could happen is that as the economic landscape changes, we could see

193
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,200
what's called industry narrowing, which is that many companies and many job sectors or

194
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,640
market segments might just go away for good because they're made completely irrelevant.

195
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,800
Those business models are made completely obsolete.

196
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,280
So time will tell, but it has happened before.

197
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,200
An example is you don't really have horse breeders as a major economic thing anymore.

198
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Why?

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,520
Because horses, as an entire industry, were replaced by automobiles over a century ago.

200
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,180
And so while horse care and horse breeding and carriage building and all that fun stuff

201
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,660
was a major industry because horses were used for everything.

202
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,860
Draft horses were used on farms.

203
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,180
They were used for moving goods and services and moving people.

204
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,940
Now that's no longer a thing.

205
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,860
And so we've seen it before.

206
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,380
We will see it again, but it's difficult to predict exactly which industries will fully

207
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,380
collapse and be relegated to a luxury service because there are still horse breeders, but

208
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,380
this is more of old money kind of stuff.

209
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,680
So what are the industries that will survive?

210
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,080
Just off the cuff, here's kind of what I brainstormed as the industries that I think

211
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,720
will probably stick around and be relatively durable.

212
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Again, this is not investing advice.

213
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,600
Personally, I am not invested in any of these.

214
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,680
So take everything that I'm saying here with a gigantic grain of salt.

215
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,280
But first and foremost, raw materials and energy.

216
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
We're going to need steel.

217
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,600
We're going to need concrete and stone.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
We're going to need timber.

219
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,240
We're going to need water, right?

220
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,940
Those kinds of things are based on primary needs.

221
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,780
So that is something that if you're a living, breathing human being, you need food.

222
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
You need shelter.

223
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
You need clothes.

224
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,140
So some of those things are going, the demand for those is going to be persistent, even

225
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,620
if it's fully automated, even if it is done by machines and robots and AI.

226
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,580
Semiconductors, obviously if everything is running on AI, we're going to need chip fabs.

227
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,460
We're going to need memories, CPUs, GPUs, RAM, servers, supercomputers.

228
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,720
That industry is sticking around.

229
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,320
If anything, it's going to be bigger.

230
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,480
It might be the primary industry, honestly, because I also predict that in the long run,

231
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,640
it's just more economically feasible for open source data and open source models.

232
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,520
I just watched the entire Microsoft Ignite keynote speech.

233
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,000
Microsoft is going all in on closed source models like GPT-4.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,640
They're also going all in on open source models.

235
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,840
So they are hedging their bets.

236
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,160
However it pans out, Microsoft and NVIDIA, it's all going to be running on their hardware

237
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,060
and their cloud platforms, whether or not it's produced by open AI, whether or not it's

238
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,220
produced by Meta, or whether it's produced by Carnegie Mellon, or whoever else.

239
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,100
Robotics and automation, if you build the tools that build the tools, you're set.

240
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,940
So there's a meme that goes around that says, during a gold rush, sell pickaxes.

241
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,260
So the ones that sell the pickaxes, the ones that sell the robots that do everything else,

242
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,500
the ones that sell the automation hardware and software that do everything else, they're

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,380
going to be fine.

244
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,880
Fuel tech, so this is going to have to do with water, agriculture, sustainable farming,

245
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,600
solar energy, other renewables, whether it's thorium reactors or molten salt or nuclear

246
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,080
fusion, whatever.

247
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,560
Those things, again, because energy is a primary need, as well as food, I think that those

248
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
industries are going to stick around, which again is why I think people like Bill Gates

249
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,640
are investing in farmland and timberland.

250
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Makes sense to me.

251
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,380
In their shoes, I do the same exact thing.

252
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
And then finally, experience industries.

253
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,020
So as we all transition away from working the nine to five grind, which I can say from

254
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,340
personal experience, yeah, you get rid of the desk job, you get bored and you want

255
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,420
stuff to do.

256
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,140
So that means movie theaters, that means restaurants, that means yoga studios, that

257
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,740
means retreats, vacations, Airbnbs, all kinds of everything around the experience industry

258
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,800
I think is going to be a major, major pillar of the economy moving forward.

259
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,840
But again, it's going to be interesting because technically, film and TV are part of the experience

260
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,360
industry, but the models, the cloud providers that build the models that write the new TV

261
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
shows and movies, those are going to be the ones that stick around.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Netflix, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.

263
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,160
Disney, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.

264
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Now I did look it up before I made this video, Disney did actually assemble like a strike

265
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,300
force, an AI strike force that they're actively exploring every way that they can incorporate

266
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,460
AI into their business.

267
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,580
So I think Disney is probably well positioned to stick around and they're already using

268
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,980
AI for their animatronics, they're already using AI to help with drafting movies.

269
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,060
Maybe they should have used AI for Ant-Man Quantamania or maybe they did use AI and that

270
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,740
was the problem, I don't know.

271
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,460
So what are the industries that I predict are going to go extinct?

272
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,640
Healthcare, I've mentioned this before where when you combine regenerative medicine, rejuvenation

273
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,320
therapies and all the all the advancements that we're going to see from Alpha Fold 2,

274
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,720
Alpha Fold 3 and everything else, I suspect that our relationship with healthcare is going

275
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,520
to be fundamentally and drastically different within five to 10 years.

276
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,840
A lot of people still ask me, like Dave, when are we going to hit longevity escape velocity?

277
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,800
Last year there were three rejuvenation therapies in the pipeline, this year there are 20.

278
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:15,940
The economic incentive to nail rejuvenation therapies is so high and it's getting investment

279
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,380
from everyone from DARPA to like all of Silicon Valley, Google has, you know, Alphabet has

280
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,820
their rejuvenation, their regeneration therapy wing, so it's coming.

281
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,500
The money is there, where the money goes results follow.

282
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,820
The same thing has happened with solar, the same thing has happened with AI, so the money

283
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
is there, it's just a matter of time.

284
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,040
I remember back in 2010 when I first started paying attention to solar and I'm like, oh,

285
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,440
it's ramping up and now a lot of nations and a lot of companies are exceeding their carbon

286
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
neutral targets, obviously that's a contentious field, so I'm not going to get too bogged

287
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,040
down into it, but the point being is that back in 2010, nobody thought that solar would

288
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,680
be where it is today and now it is, likewise the investment is ramping up in regenerative

289
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,980
medicine, so it's coming down the pipeline.

290
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,220
Education is also going to fundamentally change.

291
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,860
A lot of us are already using chat GPT and other tools to learn as fast as we can.

292
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,060
I've actually consulted with a bunch of different startups that are trying to do either tools

293
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,980
for teachers, tools for universities or avatars to teach students.

294
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,820
If you ever watch Star Trek Voyager, you go to the holodeck and you have like a personalized

295
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,720
holodeck program with VR that's entirely possible that students have one-on-one mentoring sessions

296
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,040
with holographic avatars, that would be really cool.

297
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,320
University systems are currently deeply strained and if jobs are going away, then you're not

298
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,240
going to be going to university to get a better job, so then why would you go to university?

299
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,800
That's a conversation for another time, but that is something that some of the students

300
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,240
at Clemson asked.

301
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,060
My short answer was university experience is good if you're going to become a global

302
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:10,740
citizen and you still have a monumental task before you in helping the human species become

303
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,380
a truly global species in a global culture, because we are not right now.

304
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,020
We are very, very fragmented.

305
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,180
Financial automation, now obviously Wall Street and the finance industry and the investment

306
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:29,180
industry, that's not going away, but insurance and a bunch of other things, I honestly suspect

307
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,420
that the margins are going to get too thin on a lot of these industries and it's going

308
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,540
to be radically restructured.

309
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,340
And then finally, as I've been talking about, I do think that our relationship with digital

310
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,940
entertainment is going to fundamentally shift and I think we're going to see a lot of implosions

311
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,460
and a lot of collapses, because again, if you need to pay an A-list celebrity $20 million

312
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:55,460
to make a movie or you could make 200 movies with AI for the same price, guess which one

313
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,520
you're probably going to do just for the sake of economics.

314
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
Real quick plug for my Patreon.

315
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,040
I have an upcoming webinar masterclass on December 8th at 11 a.m. U.S. Eastern.

316
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
I have two tiers on my Patreon.

317
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,520
There's the $5 basic tier, which gets you access to Discord, and then the $50 premium

318
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,040
tier, which gets you access to a bunch more exclusive content, but yeah, so go ahead and

319
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,480
sign up if you're interested and moving right back along into the show.

320
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,060
So I mentioned primary needs, so this is a first principles view of what is it that

321
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
people need?

322
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,500
Because there are 8 billion people on the planet and even if money goes away tomorrow,

323
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,980
even if everything is fully automated, this is an attempt to take a first principles view

324
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,900
of, okay, what is it that people actually need?

325
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,020
Because where there's a need, there's a way.

326
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,740
If there's the biological, the animal impetus to achieve these things, we will figure it

327
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
out.

328
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,960
I've got a little infographic, so there's food, there's housing, there's water, there's

329
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,360
energy, so those are all primary needs.

330
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,000
I think that as the economy pivots, those industries, as I mentioned, are going to be

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,520
the ones that are the most durable.

332
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,400
Power generation, food preparation, production and movement, homes, that sort of thing.

333
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,080
This is why, for instance, many people have said the housing industry is the safest investment

334
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,720
because everyone needs somewhere to live.

335
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,820
Likewise, food is something that everyone needs, but the margins are already really thin on

336
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
food.

337
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,900
But, so this, I think, is going to be, like focusing on a primary needs economic paradigm

338
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,060
is going to be the first phase of the pivot to post-labor economics because people have

339
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,360
talked about universal basic income or universal basic services.

340
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,460
If we see a commensurate price collapse, it's entirely possible that electricity will basically

341
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,840
become free, at least at the scale that most people consume it at.

342
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,520
My power bill that I just paid was $180.

343
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,480
What if that goes down to $18 a month because of hyperabundance of solar and other renewables?

344
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,360
What if water becomes practically free, cleansed, healthy water because of energy hyperabundance?

345
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,080
What if all the knock-on effects of AI and automation makes houses cheaper because the

346
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,120
price of timber goes down and the price of concrete goes down and also then the cost

347
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,740
of building houses goes down because then you can do it with robots?

348
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,460
So again, I think that it is not outside the realm of possibility that the cost of living

349
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,580
within the next five to 10 years could go down by as much as like 10x.

350
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,700
So like, you know, if your cost of living right now is $40,000 a year, you might be

351
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,500
able to have the same standard of living with $4,000 a year in 10 years.

352
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,220
That's kind of what I'm hoping for because that price collapse will offset the reduced

353
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,960
aggregate demand because, yes, people might have less money, but if everything is that

354
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:57,120
much cheaper or even, you know, more like, let's say prices go down 100x, but your income

355
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,000
goes down 10x, you're effectively 10 times wealthier than you were before.

356
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,840
So obviously, if all you have in life is just housing and food and clothes, that's relatively

357
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
boring.

358
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,680
So I then took a look at secondary needs.

359
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,200
So secondary needs are the spice of life.

360
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,740
This is the stuff that makes life interesting and fun and engaging.

361
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,940
And so the categories that I came up with were rich experiences.

362
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,820
So like travel, vacations, peak experiences like concerts and, you know, dance clubs and

363
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,980
that sort of stuff, those are going to be something that is very persistent.

364
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,940
There's going to be a durable demand for that.

365
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,140
Creativity and expression.

366
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,660
So again, as you have more time and you get away from, you know, the office job, I and

367
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,240
many people like me are engaging more and more in creative pursuits.

368
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
I'm writing a novel.

369
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,840
I know lots of people that as soon as they retire, they go back to acting and singing

370
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,200
and that sort of thing.

371
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,700
I know plenty of people who are painters and digital artists.

372
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,280
And so the industries around those, even if those are cottage industries and they're not

373
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:06,440
primary economic drivers, the persistent demand for human creativity and artistic expression

374
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,000
is going to be around as long as there are humans.

375
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Digital stimulation.

376
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,660
So there are many of those, many of us who just want challenges for the sake of challenges.

377
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,220
So even if AI can do everything, you know, people are still going to play chess.

378
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,660
Again, machines are already better than humans at chess.

379
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,980
We still play chess.

380
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,660
People are still going to be programming and coding and doing hackathons.

381
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,900
Yes, even if the AI can do it better, you still want to see, you want to test your

382
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,620
metal against the machine.

383
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,340
So reading for pleasure, those kinds of things.

384
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,180
Obviously not everyone is a nerd like me.

385
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,860
So not everyone is like, you know what, if I don't have to use my brain, I'm not going

386
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
to use my brain.

387
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm just going to go to the beach.

388
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
That's perfectly fine too.

389
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Culture and community is another aspect that I think is going to stick around and actually

390
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
probably be magnified.

391
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,360
So what I mean is walkable cities, green spaces, parks, co-living and co-housing situations,

392
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,280
community centers, religious experiences, whether churches, you know, there's a lot

393
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,200
of talk around the future of ideology, like is Christianity growing or going away?

394
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,020
There's geopolitical tensions between, you know, for instance, Christianity and Islam,

395
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,260
but there's also a resurgence of neo-paganism, you know, witches are all the rage right now.

396
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,420
So that sort of thing.

397
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,780
But then also, you know, there's still talk about the meaning crisis and that sort of

398
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
thing.

399
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,660
And so people are, you know, kind of desperate for that meaning and that connection, particularly

400
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,260
when you think about the fact that we're in the middle of a loneliness epidemic.

401
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,740
So the need for culture, community and spirituality and connection are also going to be persistent

402
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,860
and those are presently underserved needs.

403
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,640
I've been a big fan of the book, The Status Game, by William Store and so one thing that

404
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,200
I realized is, or one question that I get is, okay, well, if you can't make money and

405
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,320
therefore you can't, you know, build up your social status through conspicuous consumption,

406
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
what do we do?

407
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,480
Well, there's lots of other ways to build up status.

408
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,280
You can get famous on YouTube.

409
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,040
You can, you know, go to the gym and get a sexy body.

410
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,720
You can become a chess grandmaster.

411
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,540
There's all kinds of things that you can do.

412
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,660
You can become a musician.

413
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:17,020
Social status throughout history has been largely predicated on other things other than wealth.

414
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,500
Wealth as a social status is a relatively new phenomenon, particularly under capitalism

415
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,340
and neoliberalism, where you incentivize people to accumulate more wealth because against

416
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,620
conspicuous consumption is one of the best ways to signal status.

417
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,100
But there are plenty of other ways to signal status.

418
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,680
Through education, piety, spirituality, intellectual pursuits, physical pursuits like athleticism.

419
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,880
Again, that's why I picked this image of a bunch of attractive young people laying on

420
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
the beach.

421
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Why?

422
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,320
Because part of what's happening in this image is status.

423
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,520
They're signaling their status by literally showing off their bodies is that's one thing

424
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
that people do.

425
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,920
And if you ever go to the gym, there are people that do that, boys and girls, men and women

426
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,440
will show off their bodies at the gym and that's part of why they're doing it is because

427
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
it makes them feel good.

428
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,380
They go to the gym and they're like, I'm shredded, I look really good.

429
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,780
So anyways, I do suspect that as people come to understand this, that a status economy

430
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,620
is going to replace the attention economy.

431
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,060
And we already see this like YouTubers and other influencers that have more subscribers

432
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,100
are like, ah, well, I've got five times as subscribers that you do so therefore I'm better.

433
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,780
So like it's a popularity contest, but that is a proxy for the status contest.

434
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,120
Now this is the biggest thing that scares me is and this is what I actually am really

435
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,240
interested in talking to more people about is forming a new social contract.

436
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,960
So the current social contract is around a three-way relationship between the government.

437
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,200
So we got Uncle Sam here and then we got the corporate fat cats and then we've got ordinary

438
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
people.

439
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,440
So right now, Uncle Sam, the government mediates the relationship between the businesses and

440
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,100
the people, the labor workforce.

441
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,580
But if the demand for labor goes away, then suddenly the government and businesses are

442
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,740
holding all the cards and that's a surefire way to get a dystopian hellscape.

443
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,380
So how do we do that?

444
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,260
How do we navigate and fix it?

445
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,420
First, we need to rebalance power.

446
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,700
This means that we need to shift the priority away from businesses and more towards people

447
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,500
and government, particularly voter power.

448
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,880
And we'll do this through shoring up democratic institutions such as voter reforms, increasing

449
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:41,240
civic engagement, adding new levers of power that citizens have in terms of steering the

450
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,360
government and ensuring that the government serves the people as much if not more than

451
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
businesses.

452
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,080
We'll need some sort of redistribution mechanisms and honestly having some sort of redistribution

453
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,660
behooves the businesses because again, if aggregate consumer demand goes down, that's

454
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
bad for business.

455
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,300
If your customers are all broke, that's no good.

456
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,540
So we'll need to make sure that consumers have money to spend in order to keep the economy

457
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:12,060
going and pretty much some sort of redistribution, whether it's negative income tax or UBI or

458
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,900
universal basic services, we'll need something.

459
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,280
The way that I articulated it mathematically is if wealth and income inequality and gradients

460
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,240
are too steep, then you can't go uphill.

461
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,480
You can't go uphill forever.

462
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,680
And this will also require some kind of regulatory overhaul.

463
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Now there are a lot of tools in the toolbox in terms of fiscal policy and monetary policy

464
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,920
that are already available.

465
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,200
So what I suspect is going to happen is that the establishment is going to do very small

466
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,680
incremental changes across the board.

467
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,740
It's not going to be one big policy, it's going to be dozens if not hundreds of little

468
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:57,980
incremental policy changes on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual basis to adjust slowly because

469
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,340
again, law of unintended consequences.

470
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,300
If you change too many things at once, you might end up making things worse, which would

471
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,060
be bad.

472
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,180
So just as a recap on this whole thing, we're talking at the highest level about knowledge

473
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,300
labor substitution.

474
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,600
The four criteria that I give is better, faster, cheaper, safer.

475
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,640
As machines and AI become better, faster, cheaper and safer than humans at knowledge

476
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,760
work, one, there's no economic incentive to keep humans in those jobs.

477
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,880
But then it could also be considered unethical to keep humans in those jobs.

478
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,400
So for instance, if an AI doctor is better, faster, cheaper and safer than a human doctor,

479
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
who are you going to go to?

480
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,840
You're going to go to the robot doctor because the outcomes are going to be better and it's

481
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,040
going to be cheaper.

482
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,140
In that scenario, it might become unethical to allow humans to continue practicing medicine.

483
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:57,460
Likewise, for driving, once we stick the landing on full self-driving and let's say that automatic

484
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:05,860
cars can drive 10 billion miles per fatality or less, it might become illegal to allow

485
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,540
humans to continue driving except in certain circumstances.

486
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,980
So that's one thing to keep in mind.

487
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,080
Reduced aggregate demand is going to be one of the major economic signals that we're

488
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,520
going to be afraid of because if aggregate consumer demand goes down, the economy falters

489
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,920
so on and so forth.

490
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,040
So we'll need something to shore that up.

491
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Now again, the converse of that is price collapse might offset that.

492
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,880
But that's two very powerful deflationary pressures, which we should expect to see some

493
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,440
deflationary pressure because that's what technology does.

494
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,320
It makes goods and services cheaper, but I don't think we're ready for how much cheaper

495
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,660
some of those goods and services are going to be.

496
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,340
So then I talked about primary needs, which is just first principle, look at yourself

497
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
as an animal.

498
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,020
What is it that you need and what are you willing to work or fight or whatever to get?

499
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,500
That's food, water, clothing, housing, your basic fundamental needs.

500
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,060
Status economy is going to be a big component of how this all shakes out in terms of our

501
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,620
social living, how we live on a day-to-day basis.

502
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,740
Some of these things like some of the goods and services that stick around will be about

503
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,740
status.

504
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,160
When I talk about status economy, I'm talking more about actually how we allocate our personal

505
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,080
time and resources.

506
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
We might spend more time at the gym.

507
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,560
We might spend more time practicing piano, like that sort of stuff, and I'm talking

508
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,960
about myself here.

509
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,760
I was just like, I used to play piano as a kid.

510
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
You know what?

511
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
It might be time for me to pick that up again.

512
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Why?

513
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,400
Because I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at it.

514
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,040
I've completely forgotten it all because it was, I'm not going to say how long ago

515
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
it was.

516
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,720
It was a long time ago.

517
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,800
New social contract.

518
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,780
So negotiating a new social contract, honestly changing the narratives around money and around

519
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,500
democracy is probably the hardest part of all this because as I said, we've got lots

520
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,540
of, we've got lots of tools in the financial toolbox in terms of monetary policy and fiscal

521
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
policy.

522
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,780
However, in America, our narratives around the ownership class, around wealth, around

523
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,460
privilege, around the elites, that is probably going to be the biggest sticking point honestly

524
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,540
because a lot of people are temporarily embarrassed millionaires and so they're like, oh, we'll

525
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,800
protect the millionaire class, protect the corporate class at all costs and it's like,

526
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
they don't need any protection.

527
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,520
They're fine.

528
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,760
So we need to change the focus from the engines of productivity to us and I'm not talking

529
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,480
about radically restructuring the entire economy, but you know, we need to change something.

530
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,360
And then finally, as I already mentioned, deflationary pressures.

531
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,200
So I don't need to rehash that.

532
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Thanks for watching.

533
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,360
I hope you got a lot out of this video.
