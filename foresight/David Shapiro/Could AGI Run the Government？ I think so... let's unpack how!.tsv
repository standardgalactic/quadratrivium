0	8080	AI run the government. So this question actually came from one of my patreon supporters. So thank you spectral Valkyrie for this question
8720	15360	But basically the idea was okay rather than just look at the way things are and look at incremental changes from
15600	22440	Where we're at to a potential future. What if we just take a first principles look at could the AI run the government?
22440	23960	What would that look like?
23960	31440	So before we dive in I just wanted to let you know this video is a little bit longer and it's broken down into three distinct parts
31600	35800	So the first part is we will talk about what is the purpose of government in general?
36360	42320	And that will kind of set the stage because there is quite a bit of debate over what the role of government is or should be
42320	44320	And it's mostly in terms of degrees
44880	49160	So anyways, we'll get into that in just a moment then in the in the middle part
49160	55440	We will talk about what would an AI government actually look like how is that actually going to function?
55440	58440	How would it run and then finally in the last part of the video?
58440	64720	I will make some actual real predictions based on things that I know are happening today and things that are in the works and
65280	69520	So we'll see kind of what what the actual progress should look like
69520	73040	So if any one of these parts doesn't resonate with you feel free to skip ahead
73680	75680	But yeah, let's get right into it
75800	81540	So the first thing that we need to say is okay. What is objectively speaking? What is the outcome?
81680	84760	What is the function that government provides and right now?
85080	92280	There are kind of five key pillars that government provides and there's there the biggest one that's missing is military
92920	98440	but what I will say is that the military can operate as a separate entity from government and in fact in many
98680	105040	In many institutions it kind of does it's technically an extension of the executive branch, but it is also supposed to have
105680	112280	Its own thing. So that is deliberately and distinctly missing. So we're looking more at domestic government
112360	117760	So domestic government focuses on these five key principles. So first is resource management
119400	124960	Regulating public goods and natural resources for sustainability that sort of thing. So land use
126200	128200	Waterways air that sort of stuff
129160	131080	forests, you know
131080	132440	Drilling rights
132440	138560	The second thing is economic management. So this is fiscal and monetary policy. So this has to do with central banks
139440	146880	Regulating the stock market that sort of stuff, you know, again, you're familiar with all these because we argue about it every few years here in America
147280	149280	based on who we want to elect
149400	151400	the third pillar is
151880	156480	Mediation of relationships. So this is facilitating and mediating the relationships between
157320	165000	Citizens nations organizations so on and so forth. And so there's a few ways that these regulations happen or that this this mediation happens
165120	171760	So first is like corporate law. So ensuring that, you know, companies abide by safety regulations that sort of thing
171760	176640	There's also the courts. So like if you have a dispute with someone else, there's criminal court. There's civil court
177040	179040	That sort of thing. There's the Supreme Court
179680	185160	So the court system is as part of this relationship mediation. It's it's there to broker or referee
186120	192440	Relationships between various stakeholders in the government namely citizens businesses and then other nations
192480	196640	So the diplomatic corps the State Department as we call it in America
197200	205560	That is part of the relationship mediation. So the government manages our relationship with say Britain or France or China on our behalf
206640	210680	The fourth thing is that they guarantee and protect and enforce rights
210840	214240	And so there's this is a recent term
214240	218120	So I've been plugging it a lot that I learned positive rights versus negative rights
218360	225560	So a positive right is something that you're entitled to and a negative right is something that you were free from and so for instance our
226360	227720	Constitution
227720	235000	Guarantees that you are entitled to a right to free speech. You are entitled to a jury by your peers. You are entitled to
235960	241160	A certain other things plenty of other things, but then you're also free from
242080	245880	Tyranny, you know free to free from oppression and those sorts of things
246400	250480	And so there's two different kinds of rights and of course there it as I mentioned earlier
251040	256680	It is also a matter of degree because many of your rights are relatively simple
256680	263560	But then we're there's also debate over more complex or comprehensive rights and then finally social organization
263600	265920	And so this is one of the most controversial ones
266680	268680	Especially if you look at the news right now
268680	273560	The state of Texas is all up in arms about abortion rights. So again
274280	276280	talking about social organization
276480	282400	By and large western liberal democracies have decided not to legislate morality
282920	287560	And you can see this by virtue of contrast when you look at the fact that like
288120	289440	There is some
289520	295040	TikTok celebrity who got arrested I think in Saudi Arabia for adultery like we don't do that in the west anymore
295040	301600	We don't say like oh well this woman, you know had sex with someone that she wasn't supposed to so therefore we're gonna put her in morality jail
302320	304000	Right, there was huge
304000	307680	protests that broke out in Iran because a woman was beaten by the morality police
308240	312960	And so by and large western democracies the the role of legislating
313680	315680	morality and social structure
316080	321840	Is contracting however government does still play a role in this and so what I mean by that is
322880	325680	You know what what are legally recognized marriages?
326160	330000	What are the family structures that are legally recognized and so right now
330640	334400	Western liberal democracies have have kind of centered around the nuclear family
334800	338480	Or the the smallest family unit, which is the marriage between a husband and a wife
338880	341840	Whereas in the past there were you know, usually it was
342800	349120	Uh, you know tribal communities or extended families where you'd have a matriarch or a patriarch who kind of managed the whole family
349120	352960	And that was the legal unit and there are still plenty of countries out there where
353680	356960	If not in law then at least in practice that is how things are run
357280	361680	And so the government does have a role in supporting that social organization
362000	368320	Then there's also other aspects of it such as the relationship between the government and the fourth estate, which is journalism
368960	370960	Or or the church as well
371280	374240	So those are kind of the five main pillars of government
374240	378880	Like I said, there are plenty of other things from that list that are missing that is on purpose
378880	381600	But these are kind of the five pillars that I want to look out for this video
382240	383760	so also
383760	391280	As I as I promised a lot of this is controversial and this goes back to even the founding of modern democracy where socrates himself
391840	395040	questioned the the efficiency and wisdom of democracy
395600	397600	so some of his
397680	403040	Critiques were and of course this is back in the days of athens before representative democracy
403680	406640	So most of what he was complaining about was tyranny of the majority
407600	411600	Also, i'm really toasty. So i'm gonna switch clothes. Oh, okay properly dressed now
412320	416800	but yeah, so socrates was concerned about tyranny of the majority
417760	418640	and
418640	420160	there's also
420160	422720	the what we would today call like, you know
423360	425360	The kind of the difference between
425520	429120	Inclusive democracy where everyone gets a say versus
429760	431760	expertise and this is one of the chief
432080	433440	tensions
433440	435680	particularly in america but also in other nations
436400	437680	because
437680	439680	communism like capital c communism
440240	441760	said, oh, well
441760	443920	The citizen shouldn't have a vote because they're all dumb
444640	448640	And so what we're going to do is we're just going to hand the reins to the quote-of-quote experts
449200	452720	And then the experts without any checks and balances are going to get to make decisions
453120	458080	And in soviet russia that led to mass famines because the so-called experts mismanage farms
458480	462800	mismanage the economy and that sort of thing and that by the way still goes on today. There are
463520	468320	I was watching a documentary about how um, there there are places in china that you still can't grow
469520	472880	food because of decades of communist mismanagement
473200	478880	On the other hand, uh, your average citizen is also not necessarily qualified to make decisions
479200	481920	So you you're kind of damned if you do damned if you don't
482320	487200	Now what I wanted to include this slide for was to say that there are flaws with democracy
487680	491520	I would say that there are more egregious flaws particularly with every way that
492080	496880	Communism has been implemented and so I am not a communist. I'm not a socialist even though some of you accuse me of that
497120	500480	I also have people say that I'm a neoconservative. So make up your minds
500480	506480	Make up your minds. I consider myself a pragmatic progressive, but anyways, that's a conversation for another
506960	508960	uh, another topic
509520	510960	So let's move let's move on
510960	516480	But I just wanted to address the elephant in the room and say that yes democracy is does have some fundamental flaws
516800	520480	Going back to the founding of the thing the other component of
521040	527120	That makes government hard is just intrinsic human flaws. And so one example is charismatic leaders
527840	532560	So charismatic manipulators are able to use demagoguery and other things to
533520	537040	you know, kind of get in and and you know wreck things
537840	539520	power seeking behavior
539520	543280	profit motivation plain old ignorance and so basically this all
543920	547120	Speaks to the reason that government is structured as the way that is
547680	549680	because the framers of
550320	554080	modern western liberal democracies basically said, okay, well
554800	560560	Uh, they didn't have the word for it, but they noticed that you know, uh, a non-trivial chunk of the population
561040	565040	is just crazy. Um, whether they're narcissistic, whether they are
565600	568080	um sociopaths, whether they are just
568800	570800	completely saturated with greed
571280	572320	um
572320	575840	So they said, okay, well, we have to know that some people are going to be power seeking
575840	580160	We have to know that some people are going to be manipulative and so on and so forth
580400	585360	And so that's part of the reason that the government is structured the way that it is so that you have checks and balances
585760	588640	So that you have these relief mechanisms that allow you to
589600	595760	You know change up leadership on a regular basis, which in theory should prevent any particular
596320	600080	Uh group or person from accumulating and holding on to too much power
600480	605360	So far so good, but there are some people who very deliberately and explicitly want to upset that balance
605920	608080	um because what happens is
608800	614160	When you allow for the leadership, um at all levels to change up on a regular basis
614560	617120	And you have this kind of as a mechanistic system
617760	618720	um
618720	620720	You prevent that accumulation of power
620880	625520	But also you it's it becomes easier to spot people who are accumulating power
625920	629920	Now, of course here in america, we have a problem of gerontocracy where we have people
630480	634720	Literally serving until their 80s and 90s and in recent cases dying in office
634800	638400	Even though they are not legally competent to take care of themselves
638720	641360	So if someone is not legally competent to take care of themselves
641360	644480	They are certainly not legally competent to run the the the nation
644960	650480	But of course the uh the american system was framed before people were living long enough to have dementia
650960	652960	So
653280	655280	We got some work to do
655600	658320	So that leads us to uh representative democracy
658400	662560	So basically the way that it generally runs today is that we have a division of power
662560	666720	We have a three branch system. So that's legislative judicial and executive branch
667440	671280	The the the judicial branch is obviously like one of the weaker ones
671760	674560	Except for the supreme court, which does kind of set a lot of the tone
675440	676880	We use elected officials
676880	681840	So the elected officials then you know represent our willpower and they appoint
682400	686560	Experts um and then some of the sometimes we do vote on experts. Sometimes we don't
687200	691680	Some officials some offices are appointed by the electorate. Some aren't
692400	696880	But this is all part of the ongoing negotiation and part of the reason that it's so messy is because
697280	700400	We're constantly making little adjustments to the whole structure
701200	707680	Which is good because uh, you know, you look at revolutions of the past and one of the key thing one of the key reasons
708240	712160	why civil wars have happened in the past is because
712880	715280	And not even in the distant past in the recent past
715760	718960	Is because the government is too rigid or too inflexible and does not
719360	725600	Respond to the will of the people and the changing times. And so the the key thing is peaceful transitions
726160	729360	Um, it's not just a matter of representing the will of the people
730080	735040	Because if you wanted to create a government that was purely of the people for the people by the people
735120	737840	It would look different from representative democracy
737920	744880	But really what what what the uh what the framers particularly the other of the american system wanted to achieve was peaceful transition of power
745600	748720	Because when you had monarchy you'd have wars of succession
749440	756720	When you had the you know, basically most of europe being run by a single royal family and all their cousins and second cousins and fifth cousins
757680	762640	You could still end up with major problems. See world war one and world war two
763520	767120	Now obviously america was founded before that but there is oh man
767440	773280	You listen to history like europe was just one constant set of wars for like 500 years
773840	781200	Um, and then as I already mentioned incremental changes part the part of the goal of government is to allow for incremental changes
781760	786240	Um, that is not necessarily steered uh exclusively by a controlling elite
786640	791040	But that the will of the people can make incremental changes to the government itself
791440	795840	Even the founding document, um, such as in our case a constitutional democracy
796640	801280	And so the idea is that this is a gigantic system that is meant to
801920	806480	Allow change but also resist change because you don't want the pendulum to swing too wildly
806560	809360	You don't want to oscillate by correcting and then over correcting
809760	814800	And so these are all the all the things that go into the purpose of government. Why is it here?
814880	816880	Why does it work the way that it does?
816960	823200	So this stands in stark contrast to single party systems such as what we see in china and russia, which they are
823920	827840	Technically democracies because they they run quote-unquote elections
828320	834560	Um, but most the elections are fixed and I think that it's not a controversial thing to say that they are not actually true democracies
834960	837600	Or they are what I would call kind of a pseudo democracy
838320	840320	Where it's got some of the dressings some of the trappings
840800	846960	But you can when you consider that both putin and shijing ping were able to to manipulate the system so that they were lifelong appointees
847280	849280	They basically made themselves kings
850160	855200	So some of the characteristics that you see in single party systems are you get a monolithic structure
856080	862160	That's by definition. The ccp is china china is the ccp. There isn't really any alternative
863040	869760	While there are technically other, you know people that run against putin. They usually fall out of windows or end up getting poisoned
870560	872880	So that's not necessarily a viable strategy there
874000	878800	Part of the way that these regimes maintain control is they become more authoritarian over time
879600	884720	And so that leads to things like information control both russia and china have state-run media
885520	890480	So basically if you see a lack of state-run media that is usually a sign of a healthier democracy
890720	892720	Which we'll talk about in just a second
892880	894480	They do allow liberalization
894480	898960	So this is one of the this is one of the things that kind of gave us hope after the collapse of the soviet union
899280	901280	And after china's great leap forward
901760	904000	Was that they eventually did allow for
904880	909600	Some liberalization of the economy because they wanted the profits, but they didn't liberalize
910160	914640	In terms of civil liberties in terms of voting rights and and government reforms
916400	920480	And there are also pretty interesting cultural and historical roots
921200	927280	As they kind of explain why this happens now you could look at places like japan and germany which did
928080	930080	granted at the barrel at the
930640	934080	Because guns were pointed at them after world war two. They were able to liberalize
935280	941600	Very effectively now Japan still has the imperial family, but they're mostly just token, right?
941680	944800	You know the japanese parliament runs the country
945600	950400	Germany got a did away with everything and now they are you know fully fully liberalized democracy
950800	952800	and so the argument that
953040	957760	That single party systems inevitably emerge in some of these nations for historical and cultural reasons
958080	962240	Doesn't necessarily stand up to scrutiny particularly when you look at the history of japan
963120	967520	But they also had to lose a major war in order to have that that
968240	970240	New democracy forced on them
970480	975680	And of course that set the the tone for the rest of the 20th century and 21st century
976160	979920	Where the western allies basically enforce and export democracy
980560	985440	Onto other nations whether or not they want it which of course, that's what putin and shijin ping are pushing back against now
986160	989840	Actually more explicitly. It's very interesting where they just basically have flatly said like
990400	995360	We don't want your western values now. Do they do do they reflect the will of the people?
995840	1000800	Doesn't sound like it. I've interviewed some people from from other places not russia or china
1001040	1003040	But I interviewed some people from syria
1003200	1008080	And the the idea is that the more that they learn about western democracy the more that they want it
1008400	1010880	Which is the reason that people like
1011600	1018240	Putin and shijin ping need to resist information and need to poison their people against the idea of voting and power
1018240	1019680	but that's
1019680	1023760	That's why there is still ongoing conflict in syria is because
1024400	1028800	People know they've seen greener pastures and they want it and they're going to keep fighting for it
1029680	1032640	The fighting has tamped down, but syria is deeply fragmented right now
1033440	1035040	so anyways
1035040	1040080	That is the by virtue of contrast looking at a single party system or failed democracies
1040880	1046320	Which there are some people that explicitly want to turn America into a single party system into all of you
1046400	1048240	I say stop
1048240	1053760	And then finally there is the the nightmarish central management or totalitarian regimes
1054960	1061760	This is what you see in terms of fascism or old school communism where there wasn't any elections whatsoever
1062480	1064480	farcical or otherwise
1064560	1067520	North korea is is the current kind of prime
1068080	1073680	Example of the the quote-unquote hermit kingdom where it is top-down authoritarian control
1074640	1076640	And they regulate everything
1077120	1082160	Apparently in north korea. They even regulate how much grieving you're supposed to do for the former dead leaders
1082960	1088000	So that's not just a legislating morality. They're they're they're controlling emotions
1088400	1090640	and apparently people have been set sent to like
1091040	1097280	Reeducation camps for not grieving enough in public on their days of remembrance or whatever
1097840	1099840	um these kinds of things they
1100080	1102080	They're necessarily surveillance states
1102320	1109520	Um extreme conformity is required and then and then any breach of conformity is deeply and severely punished
1110160	1111760	Democracy is noisy
1111760	1114720	This is one of the things that I think a lot of people don't understand
1114720	1119840	Which is why I'm going through all this is because all the vitriol all the vicious debates about you know
1119920	1124320	Trump versus biden or you know left versus right or you know, whoever
1125680	1127840	Democracy is is noisy by design
1128720	1134640	When you look at at a at a nation that you know say oh, we're we're perfectly aligned because they quash debate
1135520	1138960	You're not allowed to criticize putin. You're not allowed to criticize
1139520	1143920	Xi Jinping. You're not allowed to criticize the the kim jong-un
1144480	1145520	Um
1145520	1152240	So because of that those nations they appear more orderly they appear quieter. They appear to be
1152960	1159040	Uh more in lockstep. However in america and india and britain and all these other places
1159440	1165920	Where you have really vicious debates you have mud slinging you have you have muck raking you have all kinds of things
1166640	1168640	And that is by design and so
1169200	1172960	When you understand that that the ability to speak up that you know
1172960	1178000	If you really don't like something in the west you can start a youtube channel or a tiktok channel and and
1178480	1182080	Say, you know the president's an idiot and like I have zero fear of that
1182400	1186560	Whereas like could you do that in china in russia in north korea?
1187040	1192640	No, and of course those are just some of the most extreme examples. There are plenty of other oppressive regimes around the world
1193680	1196320	and so because of that because debating is encouraged
1196640	1201520	Because descent is tolerated because we can air our grievances. Now this uh,
1202080	1204080	Allow us for a level of transparency
1204560	1208160	But the flip side of that is that people don't get along all the all the time
1208560	1212480	The fact of the matter is is that you know, you can say things that people disagree with
1212880	1217280	And then you can get into internet debates or you know, choose your favorite talking head
1217360	1220400	Which now I have joined the league of talking heads. So yeah, whatever
1220960	1222000	Um
1222000	1226960	But these are all features. This is a feature not a bug. That is the key thing is that if democracy is noisy
1226960	1229440	That is a sign of a healthy democracy now
1229600	1233840	You can also end up in situations where people kind of naturally agree
1234320	1238720	Um, and so this is this is uh, you know, there was what was it called the era of good feelings?
1239200	1241200	um, where america basically became
1241760	1245120	By a default kind of a single party system for about 20 years
1245440	1249520	But that was just because things were going well and there was nothing really to argue about and of course that is a
1249920	1251920	gross oversimplification
1252320	1254960	But that emerged naturally not by force
1255760	1257760	whereas during
1257840	1261840	Uh contentious times whether there are external threats internal threats
1263120	1265120	Or social upheaval
1265120	1267280	You should expect it to get a little bit nastier
1267520	1272320	But again, that is part of democracy working itself out by having those ongoing debates
1272800	1278720	And having those uh those ongoing dissenting opinions and airing those grievances and talking it out
1279440	1283200	That is part of the process. That is that is that is a sign of things
1283680	1287920	Uh progressing as as intended. So with all that being said
1288960	1291280	What would an ai government look like?
1291920	1297680	Because the thing is when you're when you're looking at all this it's not a matter of
1298160	1303920	Machines just making decisions and enforcing it on us. That's a totalitarian regime, which we don't want
1304400	1306400	what we really want is
1306720	1310640	We want the messiness of what of democracy that we have today
1311040	1314160	Because you know whenever I talk about universal ai values
1314160	1318000	It's like well who gets to decide them and the answer is and this is kind of why I was like
1318400	1320400	I was always confused by that retort
1320560	1326000	Um, but I understand it better is because we do we get we the people get to decide what values
1326320	1330080	We ultimately want to live by now. There's of course
1330080	1332480	There's always a contingent of people who want to enforce
1332960	1336320	Their particular values on everyone because they don't understand
1336880	1340480	Uh the history of democracy or why things are the way they are like for instance
1340480	1344640	Whenever someone says america is a christian nation and we all need to have more christian law
1345040	1348480	That is indistinguishable from muslims who want to impose
1348960	1351680	Sharia law on everyone else. So stop doing that
1352400	1356880	The idea is freedom and equality are the highest principles that we have agreed on
1357680	1361920	And so then it's a matter of creating a container that allows for
1362480	1366320	Different approaches to life now some people do not tolerate
1367040	1371680	Differences they don't tolerate differences of religion or of opinion or values or beliefs
1372080	1376880	And those people are just wrong. That's not how democracy works. That's not how
1377600	1379600	Inclusive tolerant societies work
1380720	1386640	So this thought experiment then is okay, let's just assume that ai has the capacity to run
1387120	1391520	The government let's let's just imagine a year from now when we have a gi and it's
1392080	1397280	And it's performing above human level on all benchmarks. It's in the 99.9th percentile
1398400	1401920	Or higher for like literally every cognitive ability
1402320	1406960	We've got you know advanced robots that can do stuff and the ultimate goal is
1407680	1410320	What if we just removed humans from the government?
1411040	1412240	wholesale
1412240	1417120	Like let's go full monty because this is this is what my patreon supporter was like like no, let's
1417840	1420240	Not beat around the bush. Let's just go full monty and see what
1420800	1425600	Like what would this require what what are the challenges and how would it actually work?
1425760	1429680	So let's dive into some of the components that would make this happen
1430320	1437200	So the first thing that we need to do is use ai whether it's a combination of existing, you know machines and and
1437440	1441760	Databases and stuff combined with large language models combined with deep multimodal models
1442800	1444960	We need to survey the will of the people
1445600	1447600	whatever else is true
1447760	1452240	The one of the chief purposes of government is to reflect the will of the people now
1452720	1456000	Right now the primary way we have to do that is through voting
1456400	1462800	That is the primary mechanism that we have to express our will where it's you know every so often
1463200	1465200	We get to go pick a person
1465280	1472240	Who who we feel represents our desires and beliefs and then we go and hire them via election
1472720	1478240	To go represent our desires our values our beliefs in the process of government
1479040	1485120	But if you remove all humans, then it's not necessarily electing a representative. You have to express your will
1486160	1487520	Some other way
1487520	1491200	Now that doesn't mean that you don't you get rid of voting. Maybe you have more voting
1491840	1493840	But this goes back to socrates complaint
1494160	1498400	Which and I know elan musk is one of the people who said oh direct democracy makes sense
1498640	1504160	It absolutely doesn't you do not want to live in a direct democracy because then you have tyranny of the majority
1504880	1506880	And that can get real bad real fast
1507600	1508720	however
1508720	1510720	by combining
1510720	1514480	You know existing online platforms leveraging new technologies
1515040	1518320	Using large language models and semantic clustering and all sorts of stuff
1518880	1525120	I suspect that we could easily build a platform a democratic platform that very very
1526000	1529120	comprehensively collects and understands the will of the people
1529760	1533120	Um, and then what do you do with that information? We can figure that out later
1533920	1540400	But rather than just picking a person because also remember go back to the slide that I did about fundamental human flaws
1540880	1542880	power seeking avarice
1542960	1544720	plain old ignorance
1544720	1549680	You get rid of those if you get rid of people now you introduce new problems if you replace people with machines
1549840	1556080	But the point is is that if we can directly express our willpower through some mechanism
1557040	1562720	You know maybe with a combination of blockchain voting and artificial intelligence and a few other things
1563280	1569200	Then the then the machine apparatus of government will at least be aware of what we the people want
1569520	1573360	So that's step one. We need something that allows us to
1574000	1576240	Express our will and allows it to be recorded
1576960	1578960	and accurately measured
1578960	1581600	So that then the ai government can then use that
1582960	1588160	Another component of this is ongoing negotiations. So like I said democracy is noisy by design
1588800	1590800	but if you get rid of
1590800	1592560	individual, you know
1592560	1596080	Politicians then you don't have conventions. You don't have town halls
1596640	1599680	So then who are you talking to? Who do you write letters to?
1600400	1602400	and this is again where the
1602880	1604880	collecting the will of the people
1604960	1610960	Is not just about okay. The people have expressed their desire on this particular issue now the machine goes and does it
1611280	1615840	It is an ongoing conversation. It is an ongoing negotiation and renegotiation
1616480	1623120	As the situation changes as our understanding changes as consensus changes and so on and so forth
1623760	1625760	And so part of the of the government
1626160	1632640	What it does today is, you know, the the the white house has their, you know, their press corps and politicians have their
1633120	1634800	public relations managers
1634800	1636800	So we basically need the same thing
1637280	1642160	But with various ai components kind of saying this is what we're doing and this is why and
1642720	1646240	Like here's a here's a chance for feedback. We need to disseminate ideas
1646800	1648400	resources and that sort of stuff
1648480	1654240	Oh, and one thing that I should point out is that I'm not necessarily thinking that one monolithic ai is the right way to go
1654720	1658800	Because from a narrative perspective, that's easier to say like, you know, the ai
1659360	1660880	But really I think that
1660880	1667520	Um, if we were to replace government with ai, it should be probably millions of individual ai agents all working together
1668160	1670160	That are individually transparent
1670160	1672480	Um, hence the swarms that we've been working on
1673120	1676960	Um, anyways, so getting back to the slide, uh, you know
1677040	1679040	There needs to be constant feedback
1679360	1680960	between
1680960	1687360	You know the people and the ai government and as well as, you know, I mentioned consensus, but it's basically
1688240	1689280	debate
1689280	1694000	Discussion negotiation dialogue consensus. Those are all kind of the same thing
1694000	1698240	But it the the the key takeaway is that it needs to be a two-way conversation
1698640	1700640	It's not just a unilateral
1701040	1704800	The will of the people gets expressed and then the ai government goes and does that
1705040	1710080	That's not exactly the way that it works and that's not that's by that's by design. That's not how representative democracy works
1710480	1714480	It's we express our will and then the professional politicians ideally
1714880	1717840	Go and do their best to accommodate that
1718080	1722320	But of course, you know, our politician goes to battle with other politicians and so on and so forth
1722880	1724240	likewise
1724240	1727360	You know, we the people express our will to an ai government
1727680	1733680	And it will do the best that it can to implement that willpower within the constraints within the boundaries of
1734560	1740720	The way that other people, you know, want things to go as well as other higher universal principles such as
1741200	1745680	enshrining, you know equality and freedom above all else above, you know
1745760	1750240	As an example above a religious theocracy another thing that it's going to need is
1750880	1752880	mechanisms for change so
1754320	1755440	as
1755440	1757440	Western liberal democracies work today
1757760	1760240	Incrementalism is the name of the game
1760640	1764480	You can make changes to literally every aspect of the government
1764960	1768000	piece by piece starting with the constitution and there are
1768560	1773440	Mechanisms there that allow for that change, which is why I gave this like little transformer dude
1773760	1777840	Because you know, it's like it looks like a modular robot or whatever. So that's it's supposed to be an allegory
1778560	1781200	But when you have an ai government, you don't want it to be rigid
1781200	1785360	You don't want it to be like, okay, once you implement it once it's that way forever
1785360	1788320	No, you literally want every piece of the stack
1788960	1791200	To be changeable to be plastic
1791920	1797760	And so that means all the models that the agents use the hardware the software and that's just the system itself
1798240	1802480	Then all the policies that the system uses the technology stack that it uses
1802960	1806160	The principles that it abides by so, you know, if you've watched my channel
1806160	1809600	You know that I'm a big fan of like universal declaration of human rights
1809840	1813360	I'm also a big fan of of the heuristic imperatives that I created
1813680	1818080	But those need to be part of what is negotiated that needs to be part of
1818640	1822400	What is changeable now, obviously the core values the core principles
1822880	1826160	You need to be really, you know, darn sure that you want to change those
1826800	1833600	And it's also not necessarily something that you want to direct democracy on because one you might never get it passed
1834560	1836560	But you do want everyone to have a say
1837120	1838960	In the process
1838960	1842320	So that's one thing that I think some people are not familiar with
1842960	1848000	When looking at government systems and it's not necessarily a vote on the outcome
1848080	1852080	It's it's participating in the process of decision making
1852960	1854640	um, but
1854640	1856160	all that aside
1856160	1863040	This ai government system will need ways of changing of modifying of changing the stack of changing
1863520	1864720	uh
1864720	1869280	Everything about it. So there's a couple parts of this because while you want it to be able to change
1869360	1873040	You don't want it to change too quickly. I guess long story short is
1873600	1876560	This is probably one of the hardest parts is kind of what i'm getting at
1877040	1879760	Is creating a system that is modifiable
1880160	1884720	But that is not overly modifiable and that will adapt at the correct pace
1885040	1889920	And who knows maybe that's the kind of policy that ai would be optimized to discover
1890640	1892640	That would be an interesting conversation to have
1893600	1898880	Another thing is that the scope of this ai government needs to expand and contract
1899680	1901680	And so what I mean by that is
1901680	1908000	When america was founded it was a very small government and it has gotten progressively bigger and bigger and bigger over time
1908560	1910240	one of the kind of uh
1910240	1916000	Turns a phrase that was used about a century ago was that the presidency was like a glove that stretched
1916400	1917120	um
1917120	1920560	Around the hand that wore it and it would never contract afterwards
1920720	1925200	And so, you know, you've probably heard debates about executive overreach or presidential overreach
1925840	1931520	Pretty much every president has expanded the office of presidency and it has never really contracted
1933200	1938160	Likewise the u.s government and many other governments have generally gotten bigger over time
1938800	1944880	And we're all very happy when it's like, oh, you know, like obama shut down a dozen agencies or merged a few other ones
1944880	1947280	And it's like yay the government got smaller technically
1948240	1951920	But the role of government has generally expanded with the one
1952720	1954080	exception being
1954080	1958800	Legislating morality, which is one of the one of the places where western governments have
1959360	1962880	Generally ceded that territory back to the people entirely
1963520	1964320	but
1964320	1965680	part of an
1965680	1972560	An idealized ai government is that if the people decide this is not the role of government and vote it out that the
1972880	1976880	The robots will say, okay, we seed this territory. This is now up to you
1978240	1982480	It's up to you to manage this. Um, so like here's another example was
1982960	1988000	Embedded liberalism the transition from there to neoliberalism was basically the free market, right?
1988400	1992320	Everyone's familiar with the principles the kind of our love affair with the free market
1992320	1996480	So that's a that's a second example of the government kind of seeding territory and rather
1997040	2002560	Rather than providing a lot of services directly. It says well, we'll let the free market provide those services and needs
2003040	2004160	um
2004160	2008080	Now if we make a similar decision in the future, let's say for instance
2008160	2013280	We want the you know government to take its paws off of uh roads just as an example
2013520	2018320	Say actually we'll manage that from now on. Who knows maybe there will be technological solutions in the future
2018640	2023120	That allow we the people to manage our own roads without any oversight from the government. I doubt it
2024000	2029920	But just as an example, we do need mechanisms for an ai government to both expand and contract
2030480	2032480	um as it makes sense
2032560	2037920	And and not just on its own accord, but also as a reflection of the will of the people
2038400	2042720	And not just blindly following the will of the people but making good decisions
2043200	2049840	About what ground to seed versus what not to seed and so I need to pause and talk about how
2050720	2052720	Whenever you create an entity
2053200	2059040	It basically kind of wants to grow and this is true of every department and every company. This is true of every company
2059040	2065120	This is true of every politician every government agency is they all just kind of want to be bigger
2065680	2070080	Everything wants to be bigger and the way that it's kind of characterized is like it's like cancer
2070240	2075280	The more you feed it the bigger it grows and so you eventually some things you just kind of have to starve
2075840	2081680	but in an ai government if you actually have one of the policies that it's constantly trying to tune is
2082400	2088480	It could be having part of that ongoing debate or negotiation is how big should this entity be
2088800	2094080	And what I mean by big is how how big should it's scope be how big should its role be how much influence should it have
2094080	2099200	How much power should it have um now you might say well no robot no machine is ever going to
2099840	2101840	Deliberately make the choice to seed power
2102000	2105600	I don't necessarily agree with that because like, you know, you can go on to
2106320	2110880	Have have a discussion with like chat gpt or uh, you know barred or whatever today
2111840	2116000	And it will have a very nuanced opinion about the appropriate size and role of government
2116720	2119680	And because it's dispassionate because it does not have
2120480	2122800	The human flaws of greed and power seeking
2123120	2127440	I actually think that the machines if it made sense and it was the will of the people
2127840	2132080	That they would seed territory that they would seed control if it made sense to
2133760	2138800	The next part is rights and justice and I think this is this is actually what people are most concerned about
2139360	2144080	When we talk about ai government is because the last thing that people want is to lose rights
2144240	2148800	Or they want the last thing that they want is to um end up in a more unjust world
2149600	2151280	and so
2151280	2156320	You would need part of this government system to not just understand human rights
2156960	2162720	And you know a lot of people say oh well, we need to all agree on human rights before we can proceed, which is not true
2163360	2168240	You can come up with an imperfect solution and implement it before it is perfect because it will never be perfect
2168560	2172160	the demand for a perfect definition before proceeding
2172640	2177840	Is a thought-stopping rhetorical thing. So like I don't really respect that opinion anymore
2178400	2182240	Um, especially when you say like well, we already have actually a lot of established
2183280	2187280	Examples about what rights we do value versus the ones that we don't
2187840	2192240	Um, but what we need then is an ai system that can take the reins and say, okay
2192800	2200400	I will ensure that the the the positive and negative rights that you have already agreed upon are um dispassionately enforced and protected
2201120	2202720	And that they're protected
2202720	2208000	And upheld in the way that you intend and then part of that ongoing negotiation is okay
2208560	2216560	Once once an ai government can run, you know can protect the rights and justice of everyone and uh, you know
2216640	2218400	Get rid of human biases
2218400	2220400	overcome machine biases
2220560	2225360	And those sorts of things it will need to be able to to detect its own bias as well by the way
2226320	2233280	But once you get to that point then also those other mechanisms those consensus mechanisms those democratic feedback
2233840	2242560	Mechanisms, that's where the negotiation can it can happen about hey, what rights should be added or removed or modified or whatever
2243440	2245440	Because like when you talk to some people
2245920	2249760	It's really interesting some of the some of the debates that i've had where someone's like well
2250240	2253600	I want the right to live in the country that I want
2254080	2259440	And so then they get upset because they're not able to unilaterally enforce their will on the entire country
2259600	2261600	And they don't understand why that's a bad thing
2262000	2264000	Um, or or why it doesn't work that way
2264240	2270400	So anyways part of that dialogue is something that an ai government could have directly because imagine if you can talk directly to
2271040	2273040	like every ai
2273120	2277120	Agent that is responsible for running the country and it can explain to you why things are the way that they are
2277680	2281600	I think that there would be a lot of people who are a lot happier because also
2281840	2286640	Here's one thing that I that I uh that I kind of perceive when I talk to people about politics
2287280	2290800	And that is that I think that I think that a lot of people just don't understand
2291440	2297680	Why things are the way that they are and why that they're better than they think and they're also trying to project
2298720	2300720	some of their own problems
2300800	2305040	And make it the responsibility of the government when it was never the responsibility of the government and
2306000	2312160	And that's part of the problem and what they actually need to do is recognize that the government creates the environment
2312720	2316240	For them to solve their own problems. And that's kind of what we've decided collectively
2317120	2320800	Is rather than have the government solve all of your problems for you
2321200	2327440	Um, that it creates a healthy environment. Now, obviously I recognize that it absolutely does not work for everyone
2328000	2331520	You could even argue that it doesn't work for most people, which is why people are upset right now
2331760	2336000	Anyways, it's a very nuanced and and difficult thing. But what I'm talking about here is
2336880	2339520	These are some of the problems that will need to be
2340720	2344560	Meaded out or not. That's not necessarily the right turn of phrase
2345040	2347040	But we'll need to be worked out
2347200	2352240	In creating an AI based government. And then finally, I think one of the hardest things is just going to be
2354000	2356800	Gaining citizen buy-in building trust over time
2357680	2361760	So all of these this AI government, it's going to need to be transparent
2361840	2363200	It's going to need to be explainable
2363200	2367760	Which means that any decision that it makes that affects us we need to be able to understand it
2368160	2372480	And this is going to be really difficult to balance against a need for privacy and security
2372960	2376320	Because again, you know, if there's a if there's a hostile foreign power
2376640	2379840	If we're too transparent, it could game our own system against us
2380320	2383360	Those sorts of things so it'll need to be resilient against manipulation
2383760	2387360	We will need to scale up to this if we do get to this point
2388240	2392080	Because we're not going to just rip out the, you know, the venerated, you know
2392560	2397280	United States Congress and replace it with AI next year. Even if we do have AGI next year
2397840	2401280	We will need to work up to this over time through smaller demonstrations
2401680	2403680	We'll need to make sure that people are engaged
2404000	2407520	Because if we do some experiments and people say actually we prefer humans
2408160	2412320	I don't think that it would go that way, especially in the long run. I think that it is in the long run
2412320	2417760	I do think it is inevitable that AI will be at least running most of government if not all of it
2418640	2422960	But if people are not engaged with that idea, then it doesn't matter because it's not going to happen
2423520	2426080	Um, and then of course we'll need to make sure that it is
2426720	2431440	Demonstrated to be reliable over the course of decades. If not centuries, um, just by vert
2431520	2437040	I mean, that's just that's just good sense to make sure that uh, you're not going to throw the baby out with the bath water
2437680	2439360	and then um
2439440	2445520	Another part is even once you have consensus even like let's let's imagine that everything that I outlined works
2445920	2447440	we have
2447440	2449600	Technological mechanisms for getting the will of the people
2450160	2456160	for um, collecting consensus for building consensus around rights and justice and equality and equity and justice
2456720	2459600	and and fairness and freedom and all that stuff
2460240	2462240	Which that alone is a monumental task
2462480	2466640	Even just getting to that part is hard enough and then taking that
2467600	2469600	And implementing it is the next phase
2470400	2474320	Which is why I made this graphic where it's just like it's just this monumental
2474880	2480560	problem that's that would still be before us now even if all that happens
2481200	2486480	And and we have machines if we have because remember part of this thought experiment is that we have agi
2486960	2491040	That is superhuman and capability, which you might say that's actually asi and fine, whatever
2491920	2496720	But imagine that we have machines that are more intelligent than all humans combined so on and so forth
2497200	2499520	If anyone could figure it out, it could be them
2500080	2503760	But one of the problems there is the the if they take our will
2504320	2509040	And then they come up with decisions and mechanisms and policies that we don't understand
2509680	2512880	Then we're not necessarily going to believe it and so this is why I think that
2513360	2515840	That coming to human consensus is one thing
2516560	2520640	But then the machine execution is a whole other that's a whole other ball game
2521040	2523360	That's a whole other kind of worms that is going to be
2524000	2524960	um
2524960	2527520	That's why I said like we're going to have to build up trust over time
2528320	2537040	Is because if we have these machines that have you know an iq of 3000 and they can think abstract thoughts across time and space and multi-dimensional
2537760	2543600	Blah blah blah blah right things that just like even the smartest humans would take centuries to understand if ever
2543920	2550240	Maybe never could understand it will require a tremendous amount of trust to be able to handle the rain to hand the rains over
2550560	2557120	In such a way, which is why I actually suspect that we will probably want some humans involved in government
2557600	2561600	Maybe forever. I don't know. There might there might be a time in the future where
2562320	2568240	It's just proven that humans are um, just fundamentally flawed and either too greedy or too stupid
2568640	2574160	To participate in a government and I mean like centuries from now. This is way too far in the future to really predict
2575040	2581360	But the my point is is that coming to consensus is one thing and then executing on that is an entirely other thing
2582560	2587040	Okay, so the last part of the video. What are the actual predictions that I have starting today?
2587280	2589280	Where are we going to go from here?
2589520	2596320	So the first thing is that we already have ai driving efficiency in government and in government vendors
2596640	2600640	So I've talked to a few people. Um, you know that are connected to me on linkedin
2601040	2605280	They're building tools and services that um help the government run better
2605840	2607920	And so the first thing that we're seeing is just
2608800	2615280	Administrative automation just running paperwork and doing paperwork better and faster and making sure that it actually gets done on time
2616080	2621360	That that has to do with cost efficiency because rather than hiring, you know, 50 employees
2621680	2627040	You just have an ai firm do it for you. Um, it increases the effectiveness of the service
2627200	2631120	It increases the throughput of the government services. And so like
2631840	2637840	This is kind of the first step in building trust that ai can at least do the mundane nitty gritty of running government
2638160	2641520	Um, it's not making decisions right now. It's just processing paperwork
2642400	2648320	Uh, and so this is the very first step in incremental adoption of ai. So
2648960	2650960	Uh baseline automation
2651280	2653280	Great now you might say well
2653760	2657040	But what if when you can do that it just they throw more at it?
2657520	2660800	Um, you know, because that that's that's what's called the lump of labor fallacy
2660800	2665760	Which the idea is that there's a finite amount of work to be done and then once you automate that away then
2666400	2667680	Then it's done forever
2667680	2671600	But that's not how it works actually usually when you have the capacity to do more work
2671840	2675280	You find more work to do because there's latent unmet demand
2675840	2679120	But with the with the progress that ai is making
2679680	2683920	I would not necessarily make the assumption that there is an infinite amount of government work to do
2684160	2687840	And in fact, I can predict that some people would say you actually wouldn't want the government
2688240	2691920	To have an infinite amount of work to do you actually want to get to the point where
2692240	2697440	Literally everything that the that that we the people want the government to do is done and then it can like, you know
2697520	2703680	Take a break or whatever. Um, but right now because of the scarcity of of cognitive labor
2703920	2705440	We can never get to that point
2705520	2709200	So ai will hopefully drive the government to be more efficient
2710080	2714240	To catch up on all the paperwork and start to shrink in terms of human headcount
2714560	2716160	So this is happening
2716160	2718080	It's it's not fully happening today
2718160	2722080	It's starting to happen today where there are people that are serving government
2722800	2727360	In terms of either contractors or implementing certain systems inside the government
2727760	2730400	Obviously the adoption is very slow and methodical
2731120	2735760	But chat gpt is out there and we know that people in the government are using chat gpt at the very least
2736400	2739120	The next thing is and this might already be happening
2739440	2742320	We don't really know because no politician is going to admit it
2742720	2747840	But it's entirely possible that they're using stuff like chat gpt to draft and read legislation
2748480	2755280	Um, basically this means that uh, you know, you can write longer bills, which is not necessarily a good thing
2755680	2758320	Because we don't necessarily want 5000 page
2758800	2761280	Uh bills being introduced every single day
2761840	2767280	Especially if they're being written by ai and then read by ai and humans are out of the loop
2767600	2768960	Eventually that might be the case
2769040	2771280	But we we need to build up to that and trust it
2771680	2777200	But it is eminently possible because you know if you've watched my channel like earlier this year and last year
2777600	2782720	What I would do is I would take like new pieces of legislation or whatever and just feed it to gpt
2782960	2785440	And if i'm doing that, you know that the politicians are too
2786400	2792080	Uh, and so this can accelerate the negotiation and revision of legislation
2792640	2795440	Whether or not that's a good thing is remains to be seen
2795760	2799200	But what it can also do is it can empower us to say, oh, hey
2799760	2802800	Send your out send out your personal agent to go read the bills that are being
2803280	2808880	Proposed or the bills that have been passed and you can say hey actually I have more information and
2809600	2814160	This also goes back to Socrates, which is an informed and educated and empowered electorate
2814640	2817520	Is actually required to have a functioning healthy democracy
2818000	2825040	And so even if some of the aspects of ai participating in the drafting and revision of legislation are problematic
2825440	2832800	The fact that ai can read it infinitely faster than humans and we can say like, okay, which parts do I agree with which parts do I disagree with
2833680	2838880	What are the flaws? What are the general principles here? What are the what does it violate principles?
2839840	2845680	This again, it has to do with streamlining the process of of government of passing legislation
2846640	2851040	And and debating it again remember democracy is noisy by design
2851760	2854880	And so part of that is the debate part of that is the negotiation
2855360	2858480	And this is something that if it's not happening today, which i'm pretty sure it is
2858960	2863440	It is eminently possible and should be and i'm not saying should is a value statement
2863440	2866240	But I mean should be happening soon just as a matter of prediction
2866320	2870160	And then the next phase this is not happening yet
2870720	2875920	But this would be another major milestone, which is the integration of of ai into
2876560	2878320	justice and of course
2878320	2885040	When you look at like preventative policing things it's like, oh, this could go real bad because if if ai is trained on racist data
2885120	2887200	Guess what it becomes racist ai
2887200	2892880	So there's a lot that we need to do however when you look at the administrative aspect where it's just processing paperwork
2893360	2897520	This is the kind of thing where civil attorneys criminal defense attorneys
2898320	2900080	prosecutors
2900080	2902800	Judges they're all probably going to be using ai
2903520	2911360	And if not if not now then soon and so then these these ai tools these ai systems that are going to be integrated into the justice department
2912480	2916480	That will probably expand over time because if they find that it makes their job
2917280	2920400	Easier if it makes their job better if the outcomes are more fair
2920960	2922640	Um, obviously
2922640	2925440	There are probably no regulations around this right now
2925840	2928480	And I can imagine that there are plenty of people in
2929040	2932160	Government in law that are like they're purists that are they're like, no
2932720	2937040	Um, like we will never use this but like the fact of the matter is is I know
2938080	2941360	Several plenty of lawyers who use ai on a regular basis
2941680	2946400	So if lawyers are using it then judges are probably using it then da's are probably using it
2946880	2948080	Everyone's going to be using it
2948080	2955200	So um, then it's a matter of making sure that these systems are safe and robust and that the and that justice is needed out fairly
2956000	2960560	And it becomes increasingly fair over time that it becomes increasingly equitable
2961040	2964880	Over time and reflects the actual values and principles that we have
2965760	2966400	um
2966400	2971280	But part of this transition would be moving away from human biases
2971760	2977680	Overcoming human biases because what if you could have like another layer in the justice department that looks at all the decisions
2978080	2982640	That a judge makes and says actually that's kind of a racist decision or actually that's kind of a sexist decision
2983120	2985280	Maybe we need to you know review that
2985760	2991440	Um, I think it would be great if justice departments had internal review boards. Um that were augmented by ai
2991600	2996080	Why because then I think that um, activist judges could probably be reigned in
2996640	2999600	um, you could also think like what if ai was
3000160	3004640	Was surveilling judges who write warrants because you always hear horror stories
3005040	3007600	Of judges who are right warrants for everything and then you know
3008480	3013680	Homes get swatted and babies get hit with flashbang grenades. That's actually a thing that happens here in america
3014320	3018640	So yeah, like I think that I think that there is an opportunity for ai to
3019120	3022640	Make the justice department more fair now obviously the the flip side of that
3023120	3027040	Is pointing ai and creating a surveillance state that uses ai to police
3027760	3032800	Us but you know, this is the question of who watches the watchers. I think that ai should watch them
3033360	3037680	More than it watches us. I that's that that's the surveillance state that I want to see
3038400	3043280	Where the ai holds government accountable all offices of government more accountable
3043520	3045520	That's kind of what i'm talking about here
3045680	3052720	And the next is the executive branch. So here's joe biden going going bonkers with uh with some, uh ai written legislation
3053200	3059040	Um, which oh by the way, I'm pretty sure that the that the longest executive order that has ever been written
3059360	3063440	Was written in part with ai because and it was about ai go figure
3064080	3071680	Um anyways again because I know I have talked to people in the diplomatic corps in the state department who are using ai
3072400	3074880	It's already happening. So this is not really a prediction
3074960	3082880	But my anticipation is that that usage is going to expand over time and that more and more aspects of the government
3083280	3085280	will be eminently automatable
3085680	3089440	And that uh, we might switch to more of human oversight or human
3090000	3092000	Steering and these ai you know
3092400	3097760	Whether it's ai tools that are passive or ai agents that are semi-autonomous or fully autonomous
3098240	3100880	We'll be responding to the will of humans
3101280	3106560	You know the the the electorate that we empower and who knows maybe a hybrid system is what we're going for
3107040	3112960	Where you know the politicians that we elect then go use ai to do all the debates and it makes them more effective
3113360	3114320	I don't know like I said
3114320	3117520	I kind of anticipate that eventually humans are going to be the main bottleneck
3117840	3120240	And that eventually we're just going to want humans out of government
3120480	3127200	But that decision should be our decision of the people's decision not the ai's decision and not the politicians decision
3127680	3133280	Um anyways, uh, but basically then kind of the the one potential final form
3133840	3136720	Is that the humans are basically just kind of caretakers
3137520	3141280	That the humans that we elect, you know, we might still have a president
3141360	3143360	You know, you know a million years from now
3143840	3145200	Probably not
3145200	3149520	But if we did then the president like their primary job is going to be to implement
3150000	3154240	You know the the will of the people by way of the machines. I don't know. We'll see how it turns out
3155440	3161280	So very finally here's some of the milestones that I kind of anticipate and would be on the lookout for
3161760	3165680	So first adoption in government like I said, there's plenty of evidence that it's already happening
3166160	3170720	And this is year year zero, right? Like chat gbt came out just over a year ago
3170800	3175520	So we're about we're we're technically just started year one of ai
3176160	3180720	The more that ai participates in duck and in in the democratic process
3181200	3187520	The more we will be transitioning naturally towards an ai government. Again, we're already there
3187600	3193840	We're already in the process of transitioning to an ai run government. It's just happening behind the scenes
3193920	3200000	It's not happening transparent transparently, but it's happening organically it is naturally emerging just because
3200480	3203040	ai is a new set of tools and well
3203600	3206240	Humans are humans and they're going to use tools to make their lives easier
3207440	3212320	So that is all happening that and it's just a matter of degrees like I said at the beginning of the video
3212720	3218400	A lot of this is a matter of scope and degrees and uh an organic process over time
3219360	3224720	The so the the very first major milestone will be any offices that are either shuttered
3225120	3230240	Like where where a human officer is no longer needed because the need for them is just replaced by
3230800	3232800	an ai platform or
3233600	3239680	um even more where like a human officer just might be replaced by a collection of ai agents
3240240	3240800	um
3240800	3246880	That is going to be one of the most pivotal milestones that we see and there's probably going to be several ways that this expresses
3247200	3249920	So it it remains to be seen how that will happen
3250240	3256400	But you can imagine quite a few ways that it's like, oh, hey, you know, maybe the fda gets replaced by ai
3256800	3259920	That that's what I mean. Like what if you shut down the entire fda?
3260800	3263120	And replace it with an ai version
3263440	3269040	Like that's the kind of thing that I would be looking for is what is the first office or department that gets either
3269680	3271440	completely reconfigured
3271440	3274240	Or reimagined or shut down due to ai
3274880	3277040	The next one is consensus mechanisms. So
3277760	3279760	Obviously, we pretty much only have voting right now
3280640	3288080	So as ai becomes integrated into those democratic dialogues into those consensus into that polling mechanism
3288480	3290480	That is going to be another major milestone
3290800	3292800	And I think that that's more eminently
3292800	3295280	Possible because just collecting sentiment like
3295920	3302240	You know, few research polls, right? Like they're not they're not part of the government, but they are responsible for collecting sentiment
3303040	3309840	And so what if like they create an ai platform that is better at detecting sentiment and then, you know
3310560	3314880	Government employees and government departments use that as part of their process
3316160	3322640	And so then the the very final major milestone again, because this is this is a matter of human decision is
3323120	3325120	Once the people once the voters
3325600	3327600	sentiment change and once we say actually
3328160	3333760	We're really on board with the idea of getting rid of politicians or shutting down parts of the government and replacing it with ai
3334160	3337280	That's going to be the major tipping point. That's the major milestone
3337680	3340400	Because once the will of the people is that strong
3340880	3346880	I'm not going to say it's inevitable because obviously we should expect politicians to probably fight to maintain the status quo
3346880	3350240	Because that's what they do. Um, but that's also part of their job is to resist
3351040	3352320	change
3352320	3353360	but
3353360	3354560	again
3354560	3359680	If we get to the point where it's like we rewrite the constitution to allow for machines to participate in government
3360000	3363920	Like that would be really cool. So thanks for watching. I hope you got a lot out of this
3364640	3368960	Thanks to spectral valkyrie for suggesting the video topic. Um, have a good one every
