00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Hello everybody, David Shapiro here with another video. So today's video is by popular demand

00:06.960 --> 00:12.320
as we talk more and more about artificial intelligence and the potential of

00:13.200 --> 00:15.840
UBI and AI displacing a lot of jobs.

00:16.840 --> 00:22.880
For some people it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that a lot of people are going to be out of work real soon probably for good.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.080
There's more and more universal basic income experiments going on around the world.

00:30.160 --> 00:36.400
And if you didn't see it, I have another video called post-labor economics, which kind of talks about more of the

00:37.040 --> 00:42.400
macroeconomic aspects of that. But in this case, people really wanted to learn about

00:43.280 --> 00:46.640
UBI on an individual level. So let's get right in.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.920
Just a real quick plug from my Patreon before we get in.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.720
I do have a Patreon and

00:53.280 --> 00:56.000
all the tiers get you into the private discord

00:56.800 --> 00:59.440
where I am often available to chat with people.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.920
There's two Patreon Discord, so there's the premium Patreon Discord

01:04.480 --> 01:09.280
which I prioritize, make sure that I answer all questions that people send me on Patreon if you're in the premium tier.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.040
And I also do have occasional office hours

01:13.760 --> 01:20.160
where we just all kind of get in a voice chat together. And then I do have a higher tier for one-on-one sessions.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
All right, back to the show.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.640
So first let's set the stage.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.440
Imagine this future scenario.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.880
Every American gets $2,000 a month, no questions asked, starting at age 18.

01:33.360 --> 01:39.120
Let's also, for the sake of this thought experiment, assume that health care is either heavily subsidized or

01:40.320 --> 01:45.360
for all intents and purposes free. If you check out my post-labor economics video,

01:45.760 --> 01:52.160
I talk about how AI could lower the cost of lots of things, including health care, by a factor of

01:52.560 --> 01:54.800
100x or 1,000x in the long run.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.280
Let's also assume that the unemployment rate will be about 70%. There are some people calling for more,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
some people calling for less,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.800
but just looking at the number of jobs that are

02:08.880 --> 02:11.360
vulnerable to being automated away with AI today,

02:12.080 --> 02:14.960
my personal estimate is that it's around 70%.

02:16.240 --> 02:24.160
Let's also assume, for the sake of argument that parents get a little bit of UBI per child, but it also tapers per child.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.120
So basically, you don't want to necessarily hand out

02:29.920 --> 02:34.640
as much UBI for every child because that incentivizes some people to just keep having more children.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.080
But on the other hand, you also want to ensure that

02:38.640 --> 02:43.600
you incentivize the behaviors that you want to see. And so one thing that people are concerned about, some people

02:44.240 --> 02:50.560
are concerned about, is population collapse, actually. This is what we're seeing in places like Italy, Japan, North Korea,

02:51.520 --> 02:56.160
and other places where the population is actually already slowly contracting.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.240
And so you basically need to incentivize people to have children. You need to reward them. Right now,

03:02.880 --> 03:07.920
you get tax breaks in the form of dependent tax credit.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.400
So basically, this is kind of like a reverse, or not a reverse tax credit,

03:12.640 --> 03:17.680
but a tax credit in the form of increased income on a monthly basis to help pay for children.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.440
Let's also assume that GDP growth is going to be something like 15%

03:22.160 --> 03:24.480
due to AI automation. So the idea is that

03:25.200 --> 03:29.920
most people aren't working, but the GDP is still growing like crazy. The stock market is growing like crazy.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.080
So corporations and politicians, there's plenty of wealth to go around.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.880
So we're basically assuming that a state exists of economic abundance,

03:39.680 --> 03:43.280
and then also some redistribution. Oh, and there was a question. Someone was asking,

03:43.760 --> 03:49.680
what's the difference between this and socialism? So the difference between this and socialism is

03:49.680 --> 03:55.760
that socialism is about collective ownership or state ownership. So in this case, UBI actually

03:55.760 --> 04:00.640
fits within capitalism and neoliberalism because the state isn't owning anything. The state is just

04:00.640 --> 04:05.760
taxing and redistributing within the existing framework. Another assumption that we're going

04:05.760 --> 04:11.280
to make, and I talked about this again in the post-labor economics video, is we're basically

04:11.280 --> 04:16.400
going to assume that inflation and deflation are going to be modulated by some of these market forces

04:17.680 --> 04:22.240
with things like quantitative easing, tax rates, and that sort of stuff. So we're not going to

04:22.240 --> 04:28.240
address that further in this video. Just assume that prices are stable-ish. Okay, so

04:29.280 --> 04:35.440
absolute just right off the bat. Let's talk about budgeting. You get $2,000 a month. No further

04:35.440 --> 04:40.800
questions asked. The first thing that everyone's thinking is the rent is still way too damn high

04:40.800 --> 04:47.680
for this. My mortgage payment, which is, I bought this house almost 10 years ago, so before things

04:47.680 --> 04:53.920
went absolutely insane, my mortgage payment is about $1,200 a month, which is pretty good.

04:55.120 --> 05:02.320
But that being said, the lowest mortgage payment I ever had was $325 a month for a $65,000 apartment.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.160
So it can be done, obviously, as demand goes up in certain areas, the prices also go up.

05:09.120 --> 05:14.560
But point being is that for most people, these numbers probably sound completely

05:15.120 --> 05:19.600
ridiculous. It's not going to happen again because, again, 10 years ago, the economy

05:19.600 --> 05:25.680
has changed a lot. Inflation, supply and demand has changed. We're facing housing crunches and

05:25.680 --> 05:32.720
recessions and all that kind of stuff. So again, it's like, oh, everyone's heard someone from our

05:32.800 --> 05:39.440
parents or grandparents age like, oh, I put a family through college on a cashier's salary.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.360
Believe me, I am aware that economics change over time. We will address the housing thing in

05:45.360 --> 05:50.480
just a minute. I'm just kind of setting the stage as to saying, OK, we need to figure out a way to

05:50.480 --> 05:57.680
get housing into $600 a month or so for everyone. Cars are another huge, huge expense for Americans.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.400
So these are the two biggest expenses for most people. So, for instance, I have friends that

06:04.400 --> 06:10.960
their car payment is $600 or $700 a month. That's insane. So you combine that with,

06:12.320 --> 06:18.160
let's say I had a $600 car payment on top of a $1,200 mortgage, that's $1,800 a month,

06:18.160 --> 06:22.400
leaving $200 a month for everything else. That's not going to fly. That's not going to work.

06:23.360 --> 06:29.120
Now, that being said, if we can get rent or mortgages back down to $600 a month for most

06:29.120 --> 06:35.360
people, and if we can get rid of cars, that leaves about $1,400 a month for everything else. And

06:35.360 --> 06:42.320
also remember, in this hypothetical scenario, health care is highly subsidized or functionally free

06:42.320 --> 06:48.560
for most people. OK, so housing, biggest expense. Let's talk about housing first, because if we

06:48.640 --> 06:53.840
can get that under control, the whole UBI thing looks a lot more sustainable and feasible for

06:53.840 --> 07:00.880
most people. So the first thing is downsizing. A lot of people are already downsizing. Tiny houses

07:00.880 --> 07:06.080
are all the rage right now. Katrina cottages, that kind of kickstarted it because after Hurricane

07:06.080 --> 07:13.680
Katrina, actually what happened was a few celebrities got together and paid for architects to design

07:14.320 --> 07:20.160
cottages, small houses that were very cheap and easy to build so that people that were affected by

07:20.160 --> 07:28.400
Katrina could recover more quickly. That didn't start the tiny house trend, but that certainly

07:28.400 --> 07:32.320
put it on the map. And people are like, oh, Katrina houses, they're pretty cute. Because again,

07:32.320 --> 07:38.400
they paid for professional architects to make something that was sustainable and appealing,

07:38.400 --> 07:44.480
not just cheap and efficient. So demand for smaller houses is creating new markets. There's

07:45.600 --> 07:50.240
last time I looked up at tiny houses a few years ago, there were not a whole lot of options.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.920
Now there are tiny house kits, there are prefabs, there are all kinds of stuff.

07:55.120 --> 08:01.920
Some of the some of the cheapest DIY like livable tiny houses that I could find were around $4,000,

08:01.920 --> 08:07.760
which is much, much more efficient than a $200,000 house or a $400,000 house.

08:07.760 --> 08:12.240
You can also get prebuilt for around $12,000, and that's, you know, starting price, you can spend

08:12.240 --> 08:18.480
up to $200,000 on a prefab tiny house, which is still cheaper than, you know, a half a million

08:18.480 --> 08:24.560
dollar suburban house. One thing, one of the biggest problems with tiny houses is that

08:24.560 --> 08:31.200
regulations and zoning laws need to be updated. In many municipalities and jurisdictions,

08:31.200 --> 08:35.920
a tiny house is not allowed to be the primary residence. You can have what's called an auxiliary

08:35.920 --> 08:40.160
dwelling unit in many places, which is basically you can put a tiny house in your backyard,

08:40.160 --> 08:46.080
but then you need a regular full-sized house. So my wife and I were about to downsize,

08:46.080 --> 08:51.680
but even in the countryside, the minimum house size that we're allowed to build is 1200 square feet.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.760
So it's smaller than my current house, but it still doesn't qualify as a tiny house. We would

08:55.760 --> 09:00.960
love to have built something smaller, but because of the, because of the county zoning laws,

09:00.960 --> 09:06.720
we're not allowed to build anything smaller. So in order to accommodate a shift to a UBI,

09:06.720 --> 09:10.880
we're going to need different zoning laws or areas that are zoned for tiny houses.

09:11.520 --> 09:17.760
Another option is portable tiny houses such as trailers or van dwelling. Now, lots of people,

09:17.760 --> 09:21.920
you know, there's the van dwelling subreddit. There's plenty of influencers on TikTok and

09:21.920 --> 09:28.800
YouTube and Instagram and everywhere else that either travel or live in a van full-time or whatever.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.800
This is, this is good for some people. It can be very cheap. You can also spend a lot of money

09:35.440 --> 09:40.640
pimping out a van or a bus or whatever. There are challenges associated with this,

09:40.640 --> 09:45.520
such as safety, where do you stay, permanent address. It also requires a vehicle,

09:45.520 --> 09:51.280
which again, vehicles can be really expensive. The last thing is micro apartments. So

09:52.160 --> 09:57.360
not everyone wants to own their own home or their own land. So micro apartments are something that

09:57.440 --> 10:02.800
is an option. They're increasingly popular. But again, there's a lot of regulations,

10:02.800 --> 10:10.080
particularly in America, that prevent us from even building tiny apartments. Usually the smallest

10:10.080 --> 10:15.840
studio apartment you can get is around 400 to 500 square feet, which, you know, there's nothing

10:15.840 --> 10:21.040
wrong with that. But those are often in trendy areas. And so even though it's a small apartment,

10:21.040 --> 10:26.800
they're often very, very expensive. So they're not really optimized for being economical. That

10:26.800 --> 10:34.640
being said, as I mentioned, as the market demand for these things goes up, the pressure for cities

10:34.640 --> 10:41.360
to accommodate that and for the capitalist class, for the corporations to accommodate that will go

10:41.360 --> 10:47.840
up. And again, there's lots of experiments going on, but there hasn't been a new establishment.

10:47.840 --> 10:53.440
And so one thing that I want to talk about is in the context of history, the American suburbs,

10:54.000 --> 11:00.400
those were intentionally designed about 80 years ago. After World War II, as the

11:01.200 --> 11:08.080
nation was beginning to urbanize very quickly, all the regulations and patterns and architectural

11:08.080 --> 11:14.720
designs and municipal layouts, that didn't exist. The modern suburb, the subdivision,

11:14.720 --> 11:20.560
was a new invention. And so the fact that we invented a new way of living within the last

11:20.640 --> 11:26.240
century tells me that we can invent a new way of living again, and it probably won't take that long.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.520
Because where there's a will, there's a way. And certainly, necessity is the mother of all

11:31.520 --> 11:36.720
invention. And we will need to figure out alternative ways of living that are not centered on the

11:36.720 --> 11:42.880
American suburb. Another option other than downsizing is combining households. So this is

11:42.880 --> 11:49.920
called co-living or co-housing. There are successful co-housing and co-living things

11:49.920 --> 11:55.200
around the world. In America, they're usually actually more expensive because of construction

11:55.200 --> 12:03.040
costs, regulations, red tape, and so on and so forth. In many cases, particularly if you look on

12:03.040 --> 12:08.480
Reddit under the co-housing and co-living subreddits, there are plenty of horror stories of very,

12:08.480 --> 12:15.200
very dangerous manipulative people building these communities. So I want to urge caution

12:15.200 --> 12:22.000
before you get involved in any of those kinds of things. Now that being said, there are successful

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
examples in America, but there are more successful examples around the world, particularly in Europe,

12:28.000 --> 12:36.720
in various places. There's eco villages which are focused on sustainability. They're basically like

12:37.040 --> 12:46.000
co-op farms, essentially. Now that being said, there's a lot of rising trends around

12:46.000 --> 12:51.440
co-living in conventional houses. You don't necessarily need a special village or a special

12:51.440 --> 12:56.320
structure, right? Because that's where the red tape and regulation and excess cost comes in.

12:56.320 --> 13:01.200
What a lot of people do is actually just combine finances and live in a larger house.

13:01.920 --> 13:06.880
So there's a trend that started a few years ago called mom-munes, and there's actually

13:06.880 --> 13:13.920
services that can help single moms find each other to join forces, band together, and combine

13:13.920 --> 13:20.880
households. Obviously, not everyone is a single mother, so that model doesn't work for everyone,

13:20.880 --> 13:28.800
but put it this way. Some of my friends in my 20s, they got together and rented a large house,

13:28.800 --> 13:34.480
and so having two or three couples living together, or even just a few friends, you know,

13:34.480 --> 13:39.680
three, four, five friends living together, if you combine those incomes and you end up with

13:39.680 --> 13:46.320
eight or $12,000 per month guaranteed income from universal-based income from combining households,

13:46.320 --> 13:51.840
you can afford a pretty nice house for that. And so this is a pretty simple model,

13:53.360 --> 13:57.360
but what I will say is that finding the right people can be challenging. Certainly,

13:58.160 --> 14:03.440
there are plenty of cases of people having gotten stuck with toxic roommates or destructive

14:04.160 --> 14:08.640
partners or whatever and getting trapped in those situations, so we will need to keep in mind that

14:08.640 --> 14:13.840
some people are going to be better and safer living on their own. Certainly, plenty of people want

14:13.840 --> 14:20.560
to live that way, but that being said, the social advantages that come from joining forces and

14:20.560 --> 14:27.120
banding together, of course, we're on the tail end of the pandemic, in which case a lot of people

14:27.120 --> 14:31.440
actually were kind of forced into that situation. You know, we created our little survival groups,

14:31.440 --> 14:38.640
right? It was like the walking dead, you know, you band together. So anyways, whether you downsize

14:38.640 --> 14:45.200
or join forces or a little bit of both, those are ways that you can drastically reduce housing costs

14:45.200 --> 14:51.440
here in America. Again, the biggest thing is that particularly on the downsizing, we need to update

14:51.520 --> 14:57.040
our zoning laws and regulations to accommodate this, but I have no doubt that the pressure from

14:57.040 --> 15:05.280
people to do this will kind of force the government's hand. All right, so transportation. I mentioned,

15:05.280 --> 15:11.680
you know, cars are really expensive and America is a car culture, so how do we reduce transportation

15:11.680 --> 15:18.640
costs? The first thing is walkable cities. So most cities, I don't know about most, but many

15:18.640 --> 15:25.360
cities in Europe were designed and built and founded long before cars. And so because of that,

15:25.360 --> 15:30.160
walkability is kind of intrinsic to a lot of European cities. However, whoops, come back,

15:30.880 --> 15:38.000
a lot of American cities were designed and built with cars in mind. And so because of that, a lot

15:38.000 --> 15:44.480
of American cities are designed around the car. They actually prioritize and privilege cars over

15:44.560 --> 15:50.320
pedestrians, which is super, super problematic. Now, that being said, there are literally dozens

15:50.320 --> 15:56.560
of major projects going on around the world to experiment with new walkable cities. And then,

15:56.560 --> 16:01.200
of course, there are, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of smaller experiments,

16:02.160 --> 16:08.480
you know, of like urban revitalization. The cities near where I live, all up and down the

16:08.480 --> 16:15.520
east coast in the south, they're building walkable areas, maybe not the entire city is walkable,

16:15.520 --> 16:22.560
but some of it is walkable. And so this focus on green spaces and walkability is rising.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.640
There's a couple of YouTube channels I want to recommend. One is City Beautiful, and the other

16:26.640 --> 16:30.800
is not just bikes. These are really great channels. They're really informative, and they will point

16:30.800 --> 16:35.680
out all of the things wrong with American cities, the things that some American cities get right,

16:35.680 --> 16:41.360
that'll compare American cities with European and Asian cities as well. But for instance,

16:41.360 --> 16:48.800
I've been to Paris, and I was surprised at such a sprawling city. I was at the cathedral on the

16:48.800 --> 16:53.280
hill, Sacre-Cour, which means Sacred Heart, and I know I didn't say it with the right accent.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.680
But it's literally Paris to the horizon. You cannot see outside of the city from the middle of the

16:59.680 --> 17:04.880
city, but you don't need a car in Paris. It's wild. And like as an American, that was the first

17:04.880 --> 17:11.600
time I'd been one in a city that big, but two in a fully walkable city. Some of the metros were

17:11.600 --> 17:15.120
fully automated, which was really cool, because you could go all the way up to the front and look

17:15.120 --> 17:21.520
out the front windows. There's buses, there's light rail, and then of course they have the

17:21.520 --> 17:27.440
TGV, which is the high-speed rail to get outside of the city. Anyways, point being is that there

17:27.440 --> 17:32.880
are lots of these experiments going on. And so for people that want to stay living inside of a city,

17:32.960 --> 17:38.400
if you combine those micro apartments or those co-living situations with walkability,

17:38.400 --> 17:44.240
that will drastically, drastically reduce cost of living for many people. It will take some time

17:44.240 --> 17:49.920
to build this up, especially since we've got so much invested in being a car culture. But ride

17:49.920 --> 17:55.840
sharing and fully automated cars are coming, and I actually forgot to create a slide for this.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.000
But one of the things that a lot of the big auto manufacturers want to do is actually have

18:00.000 --> 18:08.320
fleets of robo taxis. And so rather than owning a car, you'll just use an app to summon a Ford or

18:08.320 --> 18:17.200
a Chevy or a Toyota or whatever. And as competition drives down the price, I think I did a calculation

18:17.200 --> 18:25.360
once that the total annual cost for me, if I were able to switch to a robo taxi based on the

18:25.360 --> 18:31.840
hypothetical rider mile cost, would probably be about $600 a year. And I'm someone who drives

18:31.840 --> 18:39.280
20,000 miles per year. So the possibility of doing ride shares and robo taxis could drastically,

18:39.280 --> 18:45.120
drastically reduce the cost of ownership for automobiles. Or rather, you get rid of the ownership

18:45.120 --> 18:51.840
cost and you just rent in real time. Another thing is if you don't want to live in the city,

18:51.840 --> 18:55.280
because I sure as heck don't want to live in the city, I am not a city boy, I'm a country

18:55.280 --> 19:00.640
boy, is what I call coaster villages. And these are starting to pop up. They're often just called

19:00.640 --> 19:07.040
like tiny house communities or RV communities or whatever. But again, this is one of the things

19:07.040 --> 19:12.480
where zoning laws need to be updated. But fortunately, these experiments are going.

19:12.480 --> 19:17.840
But basically, think of the Shire, think of Hobbiton, but instead of underground houses,

19:17.840 --> 19:27.840
it's tiny houses and Katrina cottages and tag along kind of trailers. Basically, what I anticipate

19:27.840 --> 19:33.920
is going to happen is that in cheap rural land, a lot of that land is going to end up being used

19:33.920 --> 19:41.040
for very, very small, planned, nearly self sufficient, not necessarily fully self sufficient.

19:41.040 --> 19:46.640
I'm not saying an eco village, but rather than having these things planned around cars and

19:46.640 --> 19:53.120
subdivisions, it'll be planned around sustainability. And so what I mean by coaster is someone who

19:53.120 --> 19:57.120
decides, you know what, I'm just going to coast on UBI. I'm going to be happy with that. But I also

19:57.120 --> 20:06.320
want to live in the countryside. You will need things like HOAs because good regulations and

20:06.320 --> 20:12.160
good agreements make good neighbors. And so you will need stuff like HOAs still in some of these

20:12.160 --> 20:16.720
places, but the total cost of living there is going to be much, much lower. Because imagine

20:16.720 --> 20:23.840
if your plot of land and your tiny house is about $40,000 total, right, the mortgage payment on that

20:23.840 --> 20:29.200
is going to be like 80 bucks a month or something like that. Maybe maybe, well, let's say 200 bucks

20:29.200 --> 20:38.640
a month, you can afford that. That's going to be a 10th of your monthly $2,000 income. So between

20:38.640 --> 20:44.320
these two possibilities, walkable cities for those who want the urban living and tiny house

20:44.320 --> 20:50.240
villages out in the countryside, we can probably accommodate a lot of people very efficiently

20:50.240 --> 20:57.040
and very cheaply. Okay, cool. So I think, oh, and also another advantage of these coaster villages

20:57.040 --> 21:03.360
is you don't necessarily need a car. You know, if you live like Bilbo Baggins and Frodo, you just

21:03.360 --> 21:08.720
walk to your neighbors, it's a tiny little village. All right, now one thing that a lot of people ask

21:08.720 --> 21:13.840
is, okay, yeah, but what, you know, what if I still want more money? What if I'm willing to work?

21:13.840 --> 21:19.840
What if I'm able to work? What is, what are the options going to be so that I can still, you know,

21:19.840 --> 21:26.560
make some money and get by? So after doing a lot of research, one thing that I found is that local

21:26.560 --> 21:31.360
goods and services, there's going to be a lot of these that are going to stick around. And this

21:31.360 --> 21:37.440
is because even if a robot can do it, these are these are things that you still prefer a human to

21:37.440 --> 21:43.040
do, and that most humans will be willing to pay another human to do. So the first category is

21:43.040 --> 21:48.720
the health and wellness stuff. So this includes fitness coaches, personal trainers, massage therapists,

21:48.720 --> 21:53.600
that sort of stuff. These are the, these are the kind of things that require a human touch

21:53.600 --> 21:58.960
or human empathy, or at least those are highly preferable. So this will be things like

21:59.760 --> 22:05.040
barbers and dentists and massage therapists, that sort of thing. Education, tutoring,

22:05.040 --> 22:12.240
mentoring and coaching. These are also things that that could be pretty durable against being

22:12.240 --> 22:18.560
automated away. Certainly, some online learning is going to be fully replaced by things like chat

22:18.560 --> 22:25.440
GPT. Excuse me, many students are already using chat GPT for learning and mentoring and tutoring.

22:25.440 --> 22:29.520
And certainly, I mean, even I use that if there's something that I want to learn about, it is one

22:29.520 --> 22:35.840
of the best teaching resources out there, because it's interactive. Now that being said, there are

22:35.840 --> 22:41.200
still going to be plenty of classes and skills that are going to be better taught by a human,

22:41.200 --> 22:46.560
because a human has the same abilities and capacities that you do. So say, for instance,

22:46.560 --> 22:52.240
you go to a painting class or a cooking class, or a carpentry class. Those are the kinds of things

22:52.320 --> 22:57.840
that that you will, you will prefer to pay for a human just for the experience of being with

22:57.840 --> 23:05.600
other people, right? Another thing is going to be experiences such as performances and entertainment,

23:05.600 --> 23:11.680
local music, stage performances, busking, you know, those sorts of things are going to be

23:12.400 --> 23:17.200
pretty resilient, because again, we are a social species. And so we want that connection with

23:17.200 --> 23:23.520
other people. Renfairs, I think, are going to be really popular. And so, you know, you can go set

23:23.520 --> 23:28.080
up your booth and do face painting at a renfair or whatever kind of festival or convention you

23:28.080 --> 23:35.440
want to go to. Caregiving, grooming, and hygiene, these are other things. So whether it is child care

23:35.440 --> 23:41.760
or elder care, or pet care, those kinds of jobs are going to be very resilient against being fully

23:41.760 --> 23:47.040
automated away. Because again, even if you do have a robot that can take care of grandma,

23:47.040 --> 23:53.040
grandma probably would want to see you rather than a robot, unless you don't get along. Maybe

23:53.040 --> 23:59.360
it's better that way. But also like your dog, right? Like my dog hates machines, right? So he

23:59.360 --> 24:06.640
would freak out if a robot showed up to take him for a walk. So, you know, granted, I work at home

24:06.640 --> 24:12.640
all day every day, so I don't need walkers. But some people would. Other domestic services like

24:12.640 --> 24:20.480
gardening, lawn care, cooking, cleaning, growing and sharing food, these are things that will probably

24:20.480 --> 24:27.760
persist as well. Because again, local economies, circular economies, these are rising in popularity.

24:27.760 --> 24:33.840
And then finally, artisan and craftsmen, handmade goods, arts and crafts, these are the kinds of

24:33.840 --> 24:39.680
things that people will really value and cherish. And it's also something that a machine intrinsically

24:39.680 --> 24:46.560
cannot do. In the age where machines can make all kinds of furniture and mass produce it,

24:46.560 --> 24:51.600
we still already have Etsy where you can buy handmade clothing and handmade furniture and

24:51.600 --> 24:58.960
handmade tools. And so the demand is already there. And one thing that can happen of, and yes,

24:58.960 --> 25:04.160
they're more expensive, but these are much higher quality goods. And they're also much more durable.

25:05.360 --> 25:11.280
So again, even if those, even if mass produced goods become cheaper due to AI, there's still

25:11.280 --> 25:17.840
going to be a demand for those high quality handmade, unique goods and arts and crafts.

25:18.800 --> 25:24.400
Now, okay, so that's local goods and services. There's also still going to be online and remote.

25:24.480 --> 25:31.200
So content creators like me, probably going to stick around influencers, streamers, whether it's a

25:31.200 --> 25:36.800
lifestyle blog or travel blog or whatever, I follow, I started following lots of lifestyle

25:36.800 --> 25:42.000
bloggers. Usually they're attractive women, because you know, that's just the pattern.

25:42.880 --> 25:48.320
But I also follow plenty of plenty of guys who like build stuff, or go on adventures, that kind

25:48.320 --> 25:53.200
of thing. And the reason that I think that these are going to stick around is because even if you

25:53.200 --> 25:59.920
have a fully digital avatar, your brain knows that it's fake, right? Some people, of course,

25:59.920 --> 26:06.080
will be plenty entertained by, you know, a digital avatar. But really, as a human,

26:06.080 --> 26:12.320
I want to see another human's experience. I want to learn from that human. I want to empathize

26:12.320 --> 26:18.080
with that person. And so content influence streamers, you know, it's the personality,

26:18.080 --> 26:23.840
it's the realness, the authenticity. Even if there is some performance associated with it,

26:23.840 --> 26:29.920
that's what people really want to connect with. Crowdfunding platforms like Patreon only fans,

26:29.920 --> 26:35.760
plenty of other alternatives are out there. Those are going to stick around. And so basically,

26:35.760 --> 26:40.240
the two ways that you can make money online in the future, I think, are going to be ads and

26:40.240 --> 26:46.160
crowdfunding. There's also white label services like subscription based services. But that's

26:46.160 --> 26:51.360
essentially crowdfunding, right? Like you pay to get in, and then you get access to exclusive

26:51.360 --> 26:57.920
content. Game hosts, coaches, and trainers of various kinds. So one of my Patreon supporters

26:57.920 --> 27:04.080
is actually a professional online coach, and she teaches other coaches. And this is actually a

27:04.080 --> 27:11.520
really, really huge market segment. I had no idea how big it was. But again, having that one on one

27:11.520 --> 27:15.280
time with someone where you can say, Hey, this is what I'm struggling with, because we're humans,

27:15.280 --> 27:19.680
we're always going to be struggling with something, right? But then like game hosts,

27:19.680 --> 27:25.120
there's paid dungeon masters that can host that can run D&D campaigns for you. All kinds of stuff

27:25.120 --> 27:30.800
is possible online that are intrinsically better done if it's a human. That being said, there are

27:30.800 --> 27:36.880
plenty of people working on using GPT technologies to automate, you know, game hosts and that sort

27:36.880 --> 27:41.840
of stuff. So some of this is going to be is going to change. But a lot of these things,

27:41.840 --> 27:48.480
again, people are willing are the demand for the human is high enough that people are going to be

27:48.480 --> 27:56.320
willing to pay for it. Now, on top of making more money on with the UBI, there is also a lot that

27:56.320 --> 28:01.040
you can do to reduce to further reduce costs. Obviously, the biggest things are housing and

28:01.040 --> 28:05.040
transportation, we already talked about how to reduce the cost there. There's a lot of other

28:05.040 --> 28:10.160
stuff that we can do to keep reducing costs in order to make better use of the free time that

28:10.160 --> 28:15.280
we have. So for instance, tool sharing, tool libraries, there's actually, I didn't realize

28:15.280 --> 28:22.000
this, but many county libraries or, you know, city libraries already have tools that you can check out.

28:22.800 --> 28:27.680
And then of course, if the demand for that goes up, then libraries, you know, will continue to do

28:27.680 --> 28:33.120
that. There's also maker spaces that you can join usually with a small fee that give you a space to

28:33.120 --> 28:39.200
build stuff and borrow tools, circular economics, which is, you know, reusing as much as you can,

28:39.200 --> 28:42.560
refurbishing stuff. We're going to talk about refurbishing more in a future slide.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.480
Clothing exchanges, clothing swaps, other good swaps, like one thing that I do is that every

28:50.480 --> 28:55.680
now and then I just, I have a folding card table and I'll put it out by the road and I just will

28:55.680 --> 29:02.080
give stuff away, right? And so by just giving stuff away and sharing, right, you don't even have to

29:02.080 --> 29:08.880
worry about, you know, bartering or exchanging or buying stuff, just giving stuff away and making

29:08.880 --> 29:16.160
use of those essentially community-based donations. Sharing services as well. So say for instance,

29:16.960 --> 29:21.680
you know, you might provide childcare for people in your community, not necessarily for pay,

29:21.680 --> 29:27.120
but in exchange they give you food or something, right? So that goes back to bartering and trading.

29:27.760 --> 29:34.320
DIY skills, repairing things, fixing things, cleaning up, whatever. There's lots and lots

29:34.320 --> 29:41.440
of value that you can get by learning more skills and thus further reducing costs. Caregiving,

29:41.440 --> 29:46.320
domestic stuff, I already mentioned that. Okay, so let's talk about the psychology of this. One

29:46.320 --> 29:51.120
thing that people are concerned about is, yeah, but what do you do for fun? What do you do for

29:51.120 --> 29:56.160
sense of mastery? What do you do for challenge? If I lose my job, you know, how do I have any

29:56.160 --> 30:02.320
sense of self-esteem? So let's talk about the psychology of living under UBI. First, we're

30:02.320 --> 30:07.680
going to talk about what we're going to use frameworks for this. So first, one of the most

30:07.680 --> 30:12.240
famous ones is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. So if you're not familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of

30:12.240 --> 30:17.680
Needs, it is basically just this pyramid, which is color-coded like the food pyramid if you're in

30:17.680 --> 30:25.040
America, but it says you need to satisfy these needs starting from bottom to top. So physiological

30:25.040 --> 30:30.240
needs include air, water, food, shelter, sleep, that sort of stuff. Safety needs, which is about,

30:30.640 --> 30:36.640
are you in physical danger? Do you feel safe at home? Is your environment quiet enough?

30:37.680 --> 30:41.040
Are there any dangerous smells or chemicals or whatever?

30:42.400 --> 30:48.400
Above that, once you have those needs met, the next most fundamental need is love and belonging. So

30:48.400 --> 30:53.840
you need friends, you need family, you need to feel that human connection. And of course, we're

30:53.840 --> 30:58.720
in a loneliness crisis. I think something like 30% of young people today don't have a single

30:59.040 --> 31:04.560
best friend, which is really horrible. And I'm hoping that UBI gives us more free time to connect

31:04.560 --> 31:12.080
with people. Above love and belonging, you need esteem, self-esteem, which is self-respect, status,

31:12.080 --> 31:17.520
recognition, that sort of stuff. And then finally, self-actualization. So this is what a lot of

31:17.520 --> 31:23.120
people are referring to when they worry about, okay, well, if I lose my job, what am I going to do?

31:23.120 --> 31:29.200
I need some kind of self-actualization. And so self-actualization is the impulse to become the

31:29.200 --> 31:36.000
best version of yourself. That is the version to reach your highest level. And so these are

31:36.000 --> 31:42.240
things that are still going to need to be there. And we'll talk about this in future slides in

31:42.240 --> 31:49.680
terms of how can you achieve the best version of yourself? Another framework that I'm a big

31:49.680 --> 31:55.040
fan of is what's called TLC or therapeutic lifestyle changes. This is a model that was

31:55.040 --> 32:00.560
developed by Roger Walsh. And it is an eight-point framework that talks about how do you make a

32:00.560 --> 32:05.680
better life for yourself? So the framework is pretty simple, pretty straightforward. One,

32:05.680 --> 32:11.280
and this is in no particular order, by the way, one spirituality. So being involved in some kind

32:11.280 --> 32:16.640
of spirituality doesn't have to be a megachurch or anything like that. You know, paganism, witchcraft,

32:17.440 --> 32:23.760
neo-hellenism, all kinds of stuff, Norse reconstructionists, lots and lots of spiritual

32:23.760 --> 32:29.760
frameworks are kind of becoming popular, as certainly a lot of us younger people are more

32:29.760 --> 32:36.640
pagan. Giving back, so volunteering and community service is one of the things that, you know,

32:36.640 --> 32:42.400
again, we kind of alluded to this already in terms of cost reduction. But giving back, volunteering,

32:43.120 --> 32:49.120
giving your time is actually a really good way to build up self-esteem. It's deeply satisfying.

32:49.920 --> 32:56.880
Like I said, one thing that I love is just giving stuff away. And if I had more free time and energy,

32:56.880 --> 33:03.120
I would probably volunteer more because I have certain skills. And, you know, honestly, a lot

33:03.120 --> 33:08.160
of the code that I give away, because I publish all of my code under open-source standards,

33:08.880 --> 33:12.560
to me, that is kind of like giving back. And it's very satisfying. I love seeing the little

33:12.560 --> 33:19.360
stars and forks on my GitHub repos. Time and nature, hiking, walking, going to the lake,

33:19.360 --> 33:24.080
whatever. This is really important for your physical and mental health. I go for a walk

33:24.080 --> 33:29.120
pretty much every day, unless the weather is bad or unless I'm sick or too tired.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.840
Recreational activities, we're going to talk a lot about recreational activities

33:33.840 --> 33:38.560
in upcoming slides. Rest and relaxation. If you don't have to go to work, you can spend a lot

33:38.560 --> 33:44.800
more time resting and relaxing. Diet and nutrition. We've talked a lot about how, or we will talk more

33:44.800 --> 33:50.000
about how all the free time that you get from UBI will allow you to do things like gardening,

33:50.000 --> 33:54.880
but also allow you to learn to cook and spend more time cooking. Because a lot of people don't have

33:54.880 --> 34:01.120
time to cook good meals because they're too busy working and resting. And so UBI with additional

34:01.120 --> 34:07.920
free time will help people really improve their diet and nutrition. Seven, exercise and activity.

34:07.920 --> 34:13.760
So this is like exercising for the sake of exercise, which for me, I get that with time and nature

34:13.760 --> 34:18.560
because I go for walks. And I also like to do other things, although I haven't done it as much

34:18.560 --> 34:23.760
lately, hiking, climbing, that sort of stuff, kayaking. Relationships and connection. We already

34:23.760 --> 34:28.800
talked about relationships and connection in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. And also you will see

34:28.800 --> 34:34.320
that relationships and connections, spending time with friends and family is common for all

34:34.320 --> 34:40.000
psychological well-being frameworks. Self-determination theory. This is one of my favorite frameworks

34:40.000 --> 34:45.440
because it is so simple. And it kind of encapsulates a lot, but it's also not a hierarchy. You need

34:45.440 --> 34:51.440
all three of these at all times. And so the idea is that self-determination theory is,

34:51.440 --> 34:57.280
this is what people are intrinsically motivated by. These are the intrinsic psychological needs

34:57.280 --> 35:04.400
of all humans. So first is autonomy or individual liberty. We need to feel like we are in control

35:04.400 --> 35:10.160
of our lives and our fate. This is absolutely critical for all humans. Even humans in

35:10.160 --> 35:15.440
collectivist societies, there's always a tension between individual needs and group needs.

35:16.480 --> 35:21.120
But that's intrinsic to all social species. It's about balancing the self versus the group.

35:21.920 --> 35:27.520
Desire for competence and mastery. So this has to do with Maslow's top hierarchy of needs,

35:27.520 --> 35:33.120
which is self-esteem and self-actualization. So competence and mastery, basically feeling

35:33.120 --> 35:38.320
like you're good at something. One way to measure this is that we thrive with what's called optimal

35:38.320 --> 35:44.080
stress. So optimal stress means that you need some kind of challenge. For instance, people play Elden

35:44.080 --> 35:50.000
Ring. People play Dark Souls. These really frustrating, impossible games that I personally

35:50.080 --> 35:54.400
don't like. But the idea is that you try and fail, and then when you finally succeed,

35:55.120 --> 35:58.800
you feel a sense of mastery. And of course, video games are not the only way to get mastery,

35:58.800 --> 36:02.640
but video games are a good way to get a sense of mastery. And as we'll talk about,

36:02.640 --> 36:08.000
once we talk about hobbies, there are lots and lots of other ways to get that sense of mastery.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.880
Finally, desire for relatedness and connection. As a social species, we are intrinsically

36:12.880 --> 36:17.680
motivated to seek out connection with others. And so by keeping in mind what our intrinsic

36:17.680 --> 36:23.680
base needs are and building a life around that, we can still maintain our psychological well-being

36:23.680 --> 36:28.560
even if we don't have a career, at least a conventional career that we're familiar with.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.240
Okay, as I promised, hobbies, this is the last section of the video. And this is honestly where

36:34.240 --> 36:40.080
I had the most fun. And it made me really realize, I'm looking forward to this. So I'm going to do

36:40.080 --> 36:45.680
everything that I can to help make this future state come to fruition with my YouTube channel

36:45.680 --> 36:51.360
and my open source research. So the first thing, obviously gaming, a lot of you tell me how excited

36:51.360 --> 36:57.200
you are for the possibility of FDVR, which means full dive virtual reality. Everyone knows what

36:57.200 --> 37:03.440
FDVR is, you saw it in the matrix. The idea is that you plug your head in. And as far as you can

37:03.440 --> 37:09.440
tell, it is 100% real. We also explored this with Ready Player One, which had like haptic suits.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.200
I don't know if it's possible, a haptic suit seems like it's probably more possible in the near

37:15.200 --> 37:21.360
term. Full dive VR, such as what you see in the matrix, might not be possible. But you never know.

37:21.360 --> 37:26.400
People are working on brain computer interfaces. So if you can just plug in all the sensory

37:26.400 --> 37:31.200
information directly into your head, maybe it's possible. Anyways, whatever you want to do,

37:31.200 --> 37:35.760
whatever experience you want to have, should hypothetically be possible with FDVR.

37:38.400 --> 37:43.280
Part of gaming is that it can be social, right? Game with friends, whether you're competing online

37:43.280 --> 37:49.200
with friends, or you got a guild or a clan that you've built. You can also do parallel play in

37:49.200 --> 37:54.400
person. So this is what I do with my wife. We heckle each other. While she's playing Assassin's

37:54.400 --> 37:57.840
Creed, I'll be like, Hey, did you know that you're on fire? And she's like, Yes, Dave, I know that I'm

37:57.840 --> 38:03.920
on fire. You know, parallel play is a great thing to do with friends. You can sit around, you know,

38:03.920 --> 38:08.320
I used to do this back in my college days with my buddies, drinking a couple beers, playing Call of

38:08.320 --> 38:13.440
Duty, trolling each other. It can be a really great thing. And I'm glad to see that the younger

38:13.440 --> 38:18.560
generations do this still. My nephew and all of his friends, they play Minecraft together and other

38:18.560 --> 38:25.120
things. There are what I will say is there are some potential downsides. Screen time can be detrimental

38:25.120 --> 38:29.760
to your health. But if you balance it with some of the other things, like in the therapeutic

38:29.760 --> 38:33.760
lifestyle changes, make sure that you go outside, touch grasses, kids are saying these days.

38:34.240 --> 38:41.040
It can also be addictive and isolation is possible. I do suspect that we will see legislation coming

38:41.040 --> 38:46.160
that kind of at least provides warnings for how addictive things are. There's a book that I refer

38:46.160 --> 38:51.840
to often called Liquid Rain, where they talk about how full dive VR could actually be

38:51.840 --> 38:56.480
programmatically addictive, like where it could just stimulate your dopamine. And so you feel

38:56.480 --> 39:00.480
like you're having more fun than you actually are. And then when you're not in the full dive VR,

39:00.720 --> 39:07.040
you could physically crave it and get sick if you don't have it. So we do need to be careful

39:07.040 --> 39:15.120
with creating gaming as a central lifestyle. And another thing is that a gaming world is not

39:15.120 --> 39:18.640
necessarily the real world and most people's brains will keep track of that difference.

39:19.520 --> 39:24.400
And so it might not be good for self actualization. For instance, if you're a gamer,

39:24.400 --> 39:28.720
you might not get the sense that you're reaching your full potential. That being said,

39:28.800 --> 39:32.960
if you're a competitive gamer, maybe that is the way that you reach your full potential.

39:34.240 --> 39:39.600
Making and fixing things. We humans evolved to use our hands. That is why we have so much

39:39.600 --> 39:45.280
dexterity in our hands. We are the tool users. And so one of my best friends from back in the day

39:45.280 --> 39:49.280
is working on rebuilding a thistle. So this is a thistle. It's a small racing boat.

39:50.320 --> 39:56.240
We would be doing this all day every day if we had UBI and no need to work for money.

39:57.200 --> 40:02.400
And because the shop where he's rebuilding his, there's two other ones that are just waiting

40:02.400 --> 40:07.440
for someone to come and fix. And if I had the time, that's what I'd be doing. Why? Because it's

40:07.440 --> 40:12.480
something that my friend does and you can then race it and do competitive stuff. But there's also

40:12.480 --> 40:17.440
skill building, right? The sense of mastery that you get from building something from fixing it

40:17.440 --> 40:22.720
and having that thing that you can show off and use. This is a really great way to get a sense of

40:22.720 --> 40:27.600
mastery. There's plenty of other things that people do. Lots of guys like rebuild mustangs or

40:27.600 --> 40:36.480
corvettes, fixing up old houses and other things. So reusing, refurbishing, fixing, building things.

40:36.480 --> 40:41.280
These are really great ways that also tap into really primal needs for humans.

40:42.480 --> 40:46.560
Some of the things that are really popular today, particularly with young people,

40:46.560 --> 40:52.800
forging, leatherworking, sewing, other carpentry, all of these things revolve around tool use.

40:53.360 --> 40:59.600
And so whatever hobby you pick up, if it uses tools, chances are there's a lot of skills involved,

40:59.600 --> 41:05.200
which can also lead to that sense of mastery. Cooking, I mentioned this earlier. Cooking is one

41:05.200 --> 41:10.000
of the oldest trades, one of the oldest professions out there, and everyone needs to eat. Plus cooking

41:10.000 --> 41:15.280
is a good social activity. My wife and I cook together pretty much every day or at least we

41:15.280 --> 41:20.080
take turns. Some people compulsively cook and feed other people. My sister-in-law is like that.

41:20.080 --> 41:25.440
She loves cooking for people. Point being is that there are a lot of hobbies out there

41:26.080 --> 41:33.440
that center around making or fixing things. Outdoor stuff, hiking, climbing, canoeing, boating,

41:33.440 --> 41:42.160
whatever. There's all kinds of stuff that we could stand to do more of if you had more free time

41:42.160 --> 41:46.000
because you didn't have to work, because you didn't have to be at a desk or at an office

41:46.000 --> 41:52.640
or at the store or whatever. And it's not just fishing. Obviously that's the prototypical example

41:52.640 --> 41:57.280
where a guy gets to retirement age and he decides he's going to go fishing every day.

41:57.280 --> 42:02.880
Not everyone wants to do that. I get it. You could do competitive fishing, but there's also other

42:03.440 --> 42:08.400
kinds of competitive outdoor stuff like cross-country challenges. I ran Tough Mudder almost 10 years

42:08.400 --> 42:14.320
ago, and I was hungover as heck when I ran it. I was not hungover by the end of it. I burned all

42:14.320 --> 42:22.000
that toxins off. Skiing, kayaking, all kinds of really challenging stuff that you can do outside.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.160
A lot of my friends picked up mountain biking, which you could do practically anywhere

42:28.000 --> 42:33.200
during the pandemic. So one thing that I realized when I was making this video is that if we got

42:33.200 --> 42:39.200
UBI tomorrow, I would probably go hike the Appalachian Trail. I love being outside. I love

42:39.200 --> 42:43.040
being in the mountains, and that is something that I want to do. But right now, my brain is like,

42:43.040 --> 42:47.520
well, I'm still got to make YouTube. I still got to do AI stuff. I still have meetings with my

42:47.520 --> 42:52.320
Patreon supporters. So doing the Appalachian Trail is not really an option for me right now,

42:52.320 --> 42:58.640
unless I were to take like three months off, which maybe I should. Anyways, fitness. Fitness is the

42:58.640 --> 43:04.400
most familiar model that a lot of people use to get mastery, whether it's yoga or Pilates or

43:05.120 --> 43:10.640
running or cycling, martial arts, strength training. These are all things that people,

43:11.440 --> 43:17.520
many, many people do, and it can be a little cultish for some people. There's also fitness-based

43:17.520 --> 43:23.440
competitions like Iron Man, American Ninja, that sort of stuff. That being said, there are many,

43:23.840 --> 43:29.120
many, many additional benefits other than just it's something to do.

43:30.480 --> 43:36.960
Better fitness leads to reduced pain, increased health, cognitive benefits, emotional benefits,

43:36.960 --> 43:41.920
plus you get to show off your body. There's lots of people that love being fit just for the sake

43:41.920 --> 43:50.320
of feeling sexy. There are so many people that I knew and have met and where they decided to get fit,

43:51.280 --> 43:58.000
started climbing, started going to the gym, and the transformation that they felt as they felt

43:58.000 --> 44:02.400
better about themselves, about their body, the sense of accomplishment that they get from that

44:02.400 --> 44:08.160
is incredible. It's still not for everyone. So I want to say, okay, even if you have all the options

44:08.160 --> 44:13.840
in the world and you decide that exercise isn't for you, that's fine. Or fitness, exercises for

44:13.840 --> 44:19.440
everyone. Fitness might not be for you. Meetups. So I am a huge fan of meetup.com. I actually

44:19.520 --> 44:26.560
met my now wife at a meetup. We're both writers. So the kinds of tools that are out there. So

44:26.560 --> 44:33.120
meetup.com is there specifically for finding people with the same interests, challenges, or

44:33.120 --> 44:40.160
whatever. So meetup.com, it's free to join. I tell people about it all the time. I think more

44:40.160 --> 44:46.400
people should be on meetup, whether you have a special interest or if you've got something

44:46.400 --> 44:53.680
that you're coping with. There's support groups on meetup. I host a local AI meetup. I'm actually

44:53.680 --> 44:59.040
going to that later today. Let's see. There's intellectual kinds of things. There's chess

44:59.040 --> 45:06.640
clubs. There's spirituality clubs, arts, crafts, photography, all kinds of stuff. Whatever your

45:06.640 --> 45:12.080
interest is, especially if you live in a city, you can find other people that have that same

45:12.560 --> 45:19.920
interest, which is a really great way to get that social connection. But then also,

45:19.920 --> 45:27.280
some of these things can lead to senses of mastery, for instance. All right. So this is life under UBI.

45:28.240 --> 45:33.120
I hope that you got a lot out of this. Like I said, making this video, actually, I kind of

45:33.120 --> 45:39.040
clarified a lot for myself. And it makes me personally a lot more excited for the future.

45:39.040 --> 45:47.520
And personally, this was probably the most fun that I've had in making a video yet. So anyways, cheers.
