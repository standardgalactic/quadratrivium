00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello everybody, David Shapiro here with another video. So today's video is by popular demand

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
as we talk more and more about artificial intelligence and the potential of

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,840
UBI and AI displacing a lot of jobs.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,880
For some people it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that a lot of people are going to be out of work real soon probably for good.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,080
There's more and more universal basic income experiments going on around the world.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,400
And if you didn't see it, I have another video called post-labor economics, which kind of talks about more of the

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,400
macroeconomic aspects of that. But in this case, people really wanted to learn about

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
UBI on an individual level. So let's get right in.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
Just a real quick plug from my Patreon before we get in.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,720
I do have a Patreon and

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
all the tiers get you into the private discord

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
where I am often available to chat with people.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
There's two Patreon Discord, so there's the premium Patreon Discord

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,280
which I prioritize, make sure that I answer all questions that people send me on Patreon if you're in the premium tier.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
And I also do have occasional office hours

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,160
where we just all kind of get in a voice chat together. And then I do have a higher tier for one-on-one sessions.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
All right, back to the show.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
So first let's set the stage.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Imagine this future scenario.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
Every American gets $2,000 a month, no questions asked, starting at age 18.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,120
Let's also, for the sake of this thought experiment, assume that health care is either heavily subsidized or

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,360
for all intents and purposes free. If you check out my post-labor economics video,

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,160
I talk about how AI could lower the cost of lots of things, including health care, by a factor of

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,800
100x or 1,000x in the long run.

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's also assume that the unemployment rate will be about 70%. There are some people calling for more,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
some people calling for less,

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,800
but just looking at the number of jobs that are

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,360
vulnerable to being automated away with AI today,

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,960
my personal estimate is that it's around 70%.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Let's also assume, for the sake of argument that parents get a little bit of UBI per child, but it also tapers per child.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
So basically, you don't want to necessarily hand out

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,640
as much UBI for every child because that incentivizes some people to just keep having more children.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,080
But on the other hand, you also want to ensure that

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,600
you incentivize the behaviors that you want to see. And so one thing that people are concerned about, some people

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,560
are concerned about, is population collapse, actually. This is what we're seeing in places like Italy, Japan, North Korea,

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,160
and other places where the population is actually already slowly contracting.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,240
And so you basically need to incentivize people to have children. You need to reward them. Right now,

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,920
you get tax breaks in the form of dependent tax credit.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
So basically, this is kind of like a reverse, or not a reverse tax credit,

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
but a tax credit in the form of increased income on a monthly basis to help pay for children.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
Let's also assume that GDP growth is going to be something like 15%

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,480
due to AI automation. So the idea is that

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,920
most people aren't working, but the GDP is still growing like crazy. The stock market is growing like crazy.

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
So corporations and politicians, there's plenty of wealth to go around.

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,880
So we're basically assuming that a state exists of economic abundance,

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
and then also some redistribution. Oh, and there was a question. Someone was asking,

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
what's the difference between this and socialism? So the difference between this and socialism is

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,760
that socialism is about collective ownership or state ownership. So in this case, UBI actually

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
fits within capitalism and neoliberalism because the state isn't owning anything. The state is just

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
taxing and redistributing within the existing framework. Another assumption that we're going

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,280
to make, and I talked about this again in the post-labor economics video, is we're basically

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
going to assume that inflation and deflation are going to be modulated by some of these market forces

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
with things like quantitative easing, tax rates, and that sort of stuff. So we're not going to

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,240
address that further in this video. Just assume that prices are stable-ish. Okay, so

55
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,440
absolute just right off the bat. Let's talk about budgeting. You get $2,000 a month. No further

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,800
questions asked. The first thing that everyone's thinking is the rent is still way too damn high

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,680
for this. My mortgage payment, which is, I bought this house almost 10 years ago, so before things

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,920
went absolutely insane, my mortgage payment is about $1,200 a month, which is pretty good.

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,320
But that being said, the lowest mortgage payment I ever had was $325 a month for a $65,000 apartment.

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,160
So it can be done, obviously, as demand goes up in certain areas, the prices also go up.

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
But point being is that for most people, these numbers probably sound completely

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
ridiculous. It's not going to happen again because, again, 10 years ago, the economy

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,680
has changed a lot. Inflation, supply and demand has changed. We're facing housing crunches and

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,720
recessions and all that kind of stuff. So again, it's like, oh, everyone's heard someone from our

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,440
parents or grandparents age like, oh, I put a family through college on a cashier's salary.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,360
Believe me, I am aware that economics change over time. We will address the housing thing in

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,480
just a minute. I'm just kind of setting the stage as to saying, OK, we need to figure out a way to

68
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,680
get housing into $600 a month or so for everyone. Cars are another huge, huge expense for Americans.

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,400
So these are the two biggest expenses for most people. So, for instance, I have friends that

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,960
their car payment is $600 or $700 a month. That's insane. So you combine that with,

71
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,160
let's say I had a $600 car payment on top of a $1,200 mortgage, that's $1,800 a month,

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
leaving $200 a month for everything else. That's not going to fly. That's not going to work.

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Now, that being said, if we can get rent or mortgages back down to $600 a month for most

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,360
people, and if we can get rid of cars, that leaves about $1,400 a month for everything else. And

75
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,320
also remember, in this hypothetical scenario, health care is highly subsidized or functionally free

76
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,560
for most people. OK, so housing, biggest expense. Let's talk about housing first, because if we

77
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,840
can get that under control, the whole UBI thing looks a lot more sustainable and feasible for

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,880
most people. So the first thing is downsizing. A lot of people are already downsizing. Tiny houses

79
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,080
are all the rage right now. Katrina cottages, that kind of kickstarted it because after Hurricane

80
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,680
Katrina, actually what happened was a few celebrities got together and paid for architects to design

81
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,160
cottages, small houses that were very cheap and easy to build so that people that were affected by

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,400
Katrina could recover more quickly. That didn't start the tiny house trend, but that certainly

83
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,320
put it on the map. And people are like, oh, Katrina houses, they're pretty cute. Because again,

84
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,400
they paid for professional architects to make something that was sustainable and appealing,

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,480
not just cheap and efficient. So demand for smaller houses is creating new markets. There's

86
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,240
last time I looked up at tiny houses a few years ago, there were not a whole lot of options.

87
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Now there are tiny house kits, there are prefabs, there are all kinds of stuff.

88
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Some of the some of the cheapest DIY like livable tiny houses that I could find were around $4,000,

89
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,760
which is much, much more efficient than a $200,000 house or a $400,000 house.

90
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,240
You can also get prebuilt for around $12,000, and that's, you know, starting price, you can spend

91
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,480
up to $200,000 on a prefab tiny house, which is still cheaper than, you know, a half a million

92
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,560
dollar suburban house. One thing, one of the biggest problems with tiny houses is that

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,200
regulations and zoning laws need to be updated. In many municipalities and jurisdictions,

94
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,920
a tiny house is not allowed to be the primary residence. You can have what's called an auxiliary

95
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,160
dwelling unit in many places, which is basically you can put a tiny house in your backyard,

96
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,080
but then you need a regular full-sized house. So my wife and I were about to downsize,

97
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
but even in the countryside, the minimum house size that we're allowed to build is 1200 square feet.

98
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
So it's smaller than my current house, but it still doesn't qualify as a tiny house. We would

99
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,960
love to have built something smaller, but because of the, because of the county zoning laws,

100
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,720
we're not allowed to build anything smaller. So in order to accommodate a shift to a UBI,

101
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
we're going to need different zoning laws or areas that are zoned for tiny houses.

102
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,760
Another option is portable tiny houses such as trailers or van dwelling. Now, lots of people,

103
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
you know, there's the van dwelling subreddit. There's plenty of influencers on TikTok and

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,800
YouTube and Instagram and everywhere else that either travel or live in a van full-time or whatever.

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,800
This is, this is good for some people. It can be very cheap. You can also spend a lot of money

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
pimping out a van or a bus or whatever. There are challenges associated with this,

107
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,520
such as safety, where do you stay, permanent address. It also requires a vehicle,

108
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,280
which again, vehicles can be really expensive. The last thing is micro apartments. So

109
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,360
not everyone wants to own their own home or their own land. So micro apartments are something that

110
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,800
is an option. They're increasingly popular. But again, there's a lot of regulations,

111
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,080
particularly in America, that prevent us from even building tiny apartments. Usually the smallest

112
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,840
studio apartment you can get is around 400 to 500 square feet, which, you know, there's nothing

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,040
wrong with that. But those are often in trendy areas. And so even though it's a small apartment,

114
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,800
they're often very, very expensive. So they're not really optimized for being economical. That

115
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,640
being said, as I mentioned, as the market demand for these things goes up, the pressure for cities

116
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,360
to accommodate that and for the capitalist class, for the corporations to accommodate that will go

117
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,840
up. And again, there's lots of experiments going on, but there hasn't been a new establishment.

118
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,440
And so one thing that I want to talk about is in the context of history, the American suburbs,

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,400
those were intentionally designed about 80 years ago. After World War II, as the

120
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,080
nation was beginning to urbanize very quickly, all the regulations and patterns and architectural

121
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,720
designs and municipal layouts, that didn't exist. The modern suburb, the subdivision,

122
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,560
was a new invention. And so the fact that we invented a new way of living within the last

123
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,240
century tells me that we can invent a new way of living again, and it probably won't take that long.

124
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,520
Because where there's a will, there's a way. And certainly, necessity is the mother of all

125
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,720
invention. And we will need to figure out alternative ways of living that are not centered on the

126
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,880
American suburb. Another option other than downsizing is combining households. So this is

127
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,920
called co-living or co-housing. There are successful co-housing and co-living things

128
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,200
around the world. In America, they're usually actually more expensive because of construction

129
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,040
costs, regulations, red tape, and so on and so forth. In many cases, particularly if you look on

130
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
Reddit under the co-housing and co-living subreddits, there are plenty of horror stories of very,

131
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,200
very dangerous manipulative people building these communities. So I want to urge caution

132
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,000
before you get involved in any of those kinds of things. Now that being said, there are successful

133
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
examples in America, but there are more successful examples around the world, particularly in Europe,

134
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,720
in various places. There's eco villages which are focused on sustainability. They're basically like

135
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:46,000
co-op farms, essentially. Now that being said, there's a lot of rising trends around

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,440
co-living in conventional houses. You don't necessarily need a special village or a special

137
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
structure, right? Because that's where the red tape and regulation and excess cost comes in.

138
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
What a lot of people do is actually just combine finances and live in a larger house.

139
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,880
So there's a trend that started a few years ago called mom-munes, and there's actually

140
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,920
services that can help single moms find each other to join forces, band together, and combine

141
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,880
households. Obviously, not everyone is a single mother, so that model doesn't work for everyone,

142
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,800
but put it this way. Some of my friends in my 20s, they got together and rented a large house,

143
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,480
and so having two or three couples living together, or even just a few friends, you know,

144
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,680
three, four, five friends living together, if you combine those incomes and you end up with

145
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,320
eight or $12,000 per month guaranteed income from universal-based income from combining households,

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,840
you can afford a pretty nice house for that. And so this is a pretty simple model,

147
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,360
but what I will say is that finding the right people can be challenging. Certainly,

148
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,440
there are plenty of cases of people having gotten stuck with toxic roommates or destructive

149
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,640
partners or whatever and getting trapped in those situations, so we will need to keep in mind that

150
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,840
some people are going to be better and safer living on their own. Certainly, plenty of people want

151
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,560
to live that way, but that being said, the social advantages that come from joining forces and

152
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,120
banding together, of course, we're on the tail end of the pandemic, in which case a lot of people

153
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
actually were kind of forced into that situation. You know, we created our little survival groups,

154
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,640
right? It was like the walking dead, you know, you band together. So anyways, whether you downsize

155
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,200
or join forces or a little bit of both, those are ways that you can drastically reduce housing costs

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,440
here in America. Again, the biggest thing is that particularly on the downsizing, we need to update

157
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,040
our zoning laws and regulations to accommodate this, but I have no doubt that the pressure from

158
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,280
people to do this will kind of force the government's hand. All right, so transportation. I mentioned,

159
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,680
you know, cars are really expensive and America is a car culture, so how do we reduce transportation

160
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,640
costs? The first thing is walkable cities. So most cities, I don't know about most, but many

161
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,360
cities in Europe were designed and built and founded long before cars. And so because of that,

162
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,160
walkability is kind of intrinsic to a lot of European cities. However, whoops, come back,

163
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,000
a lot of American cities were designed and built with cars in mind. And so because of that, a lot

164
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,480
of American cities are designed around the car. They actually prioritize and privilege cars over

165
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,320
pedestrians, which is super, super problematic. Now, that being said, there are literally dozens

166
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,560
of major projects going on around the world to experiment with new walkable cities. And then,

167
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,200
of course, there are, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of smaller experiments,

168
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,480
you know, of like urban revitalization. The cities near where I live, all up and down the

169
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,520
east coast in the south, they're building walkable areas, maybe not the entire city is walkable,

170
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,560
but some of it is walkable. And so this focus on green spaces and walkability is rising.

171
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,640
There's a couple of YouTube channels I want to recommend. One is City Beautiful, and the other

172
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,800
is not just bikes. These are really great channels. They're really informative, and they will point

173
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
out all of the things wrong with American cities, the things that some American cities get right,

174
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,360
that'll compare American cities with European and Asian cities as well. But for instance,

175
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,800
I've been to Paris, and I was surprised at such a sprawling city. I was at the cathedral on the

176
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,280
hill, Sacre-Cour, which means Sacred Heart, and I know I didn't say it with the right accent.

177
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,680
But it's literally Paris to the horizon. You cannot see outside of the city from the middle of the

178
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,880
city, but you don't need a car in Paris. It's wild. And like as an American, that was the first

179
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,600
time I'd been one in a city that big, but two in a fully walkable city. Some of the metros were

180
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,120
fully automated, which was really cool, because you could go all the way up to the front and look

181
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,520
out the front windows. There's buses, there's light rail, and then of course they have the

182
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,440
TGV, which is the high-speed rail to get outside of the city. Anyways, point being is that there

183
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,880
are lots of these experiments going on. And so for people that want to stay living inside of a city,

184
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,400
if you combine those micro apartments or those co-living situations with walkability,

185
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,240
that will drastically, drastically reduce cost of living for many people. It will take some time

186
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,920
to build this up, especially since we've got so much invested in being a car culture. But ride

187
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,840
sharing and fully automated cars are coming, and I actually forgot to create a slide for this.

188
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
But one of the things that a lot of the big auto manufacturers want to do is actually have

189
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,320
fleets of robo taxis. And so rather than owning a car, you'll just use an app to summon a Ford or

190
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:17,200
a Chevy or a Toyota or whatever. And as competition drives down the price, I think I did a calculation

191
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:25,360
once that the total annual cost for me, if I were able to switch to a robo taxi based on the

192
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,840
hypothetical rider mile cost, would probably be about $600 a year. And I'm someone who drives

193
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,280
20,000 miles per year. So the possibility of doing ride shares and robo taxis could drastically,

194
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,120
drastically reduce the cost of ownership for automobiles. Or rather, you get rid of the ownership

195
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,840
cost and you just rent in real time. Another thing is if you don't want to live in the city,

196
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,280
because I sure as heck don't want to live in the city, I am not a city boy, I'm a country

197
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,640
boy, is what I call coaster villages. And these are starting to pop up. They're often just called

198
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,040
like tiny house communities or RV communities or whatever. But again, this is one of the things

199
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,480
where zoning laws need to be updated. But fortunately, these experiments are going.

200
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,840
But basically, think of the Shire, think of Hobbiton, but instead of underground houses,

201
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:27,840
it's tiny houses and Katrina cottages and tag along kind of trailers. Basically, what I anticipate

202
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,920
is going to happen is that in cheap rural land, a lot of that land is going to end up being used

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:41,040
for very, very small, planned, nearly self sufficient, not necessarily fully self sufficient.

204
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm not saying an eco village, but rather than having these things planned around cars and

205
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,120
subdivisions, it'll be planned around sustainability. And so what I mean by coaster is someone who

206
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
decides, you know what, I'm just going to coast on UBI. I'm going to be happy with that. But I also

207
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:06,320
want to live in the countryside. You will need things like HOAs because good regulations and

208
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,160
good agreements make good neighbors. And so you will need stuff like HOAs still in some of these

209
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,720
places, but the total cost of living there is going to be much, much lower. Because imagine

210
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,840
if your plot of land and your tiny house is about $40,000 total, right, the mortgage payment on that

211
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,200
is going to be like 80 bucks a month or something like that. Maybe maybe, well, let's say 200 bucks

212
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:38,640
a month, you can afford that. That's going to be a 10th of your monthly $2,000 income. So between

213
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,320
these two possibilities, walkable cities for those who want the urban living and tiny house

214
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,240
villages out in the countryside, we can probably accommodate a lot of people very efficiently

215
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,040
and very cheaply. Okay, cool. So I think, oh, and also another advantage of these coaster villages

216
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,360
is you don't necessarily need a car. You know, if you live like Bilbo Baggins and Frodo, you just

217
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,720
walk to your neighbors, it's a tiny little village. All right, now one thing that a lot of people ask

218
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,840
is, okay, yeah, but what, you know, what if I still want more money? What if I'm willing to work?

219
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,840
What if I'm able to work? What is, what are the options going to be so that I can still, you know,

220
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,560
make some money and get by? So after doing a lot of research, one thing that I found is that local

221
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,360
goods and services, there's going to be a lot of these that are going to stick around. And this

222
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,440
is because even if a robot can do it, these are these are things that you still prefer a human to

223
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,040
do, and that most humans will be willing to pay another human to do. So the first category is

224
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,720
the health and wellness stuff. So this includes fitness coaches, personal trainers, massage therapists,

225
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,600
that sort of stuff. These are the, these are the kind of things that require a human touch

226
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,960
or human empathy, or at least those are highly preferable. So this will be things like

227
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,040
barbers and dentists and massage therapists, that sort of thing. Education, tutoring,

228
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:12,240
mentoring and coaching. These are also things that that could be pretty durable against being

229
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,560
automated away. Certainly, some online learning is going to be fully replaced by things like chat

230
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,440
GPT. Excuse me, many students are already using chat GPT for learning and mentoring and tutoring.

231
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,520
And certainly, I mean, even I use that if there's something that I want to learn about, it is one

232
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,840
of the best teaching resources out there, because it's interactive. Now that being said, there are

233
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,200
still going to be plenty of classes and skills that are going to be better taught by a human,

234
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,560
because a human has the same abilities and capacities that you do. So say, for instance,

235
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,240
you go to a painting class or a cooking class, or a carpentry class. Those are the kinds of things

236
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,840
that that you will, you will prefer to pay for a human just for the experience of being with

237
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,600
other people, right? Another thing is going to be experiences such as performances and entertainment,

238
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,680
local music, stage performances, busking, you know, those sorts of things are going to be

239
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,200
pretty resilient, because again, we are a social species. And so we want that connection with

240
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,520
other people. Renfairs, I think, are going to be really popular. And so, you know, you can go set

241
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,080
up your booth and do face painting at a renfair or whatever kind of festival or convention you

242
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,440
want to go to. Caregiving, grooming, and hygiene, these are other things. So whether it is child care

243
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,760
or elder care, or pet care, those kinds of jobs are going to be very resilient against being fully

244
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,040
automated away. Because again, even if you do have a robot that can take care of grandma,

245
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,040
grandma probably would want to see you rather than a robot, unless you don't get along. Maybe

246
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,360
it's better that way. But also like your dog, right? Like my dog hates machines, right? So he

247
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,640
would freak out if a robot showed up to take him for a walk. So, you know, granted, I work at home

248
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,640
all day every day, so I don't need walkers. But some people would. Other domestic services like

249
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:20,480
gardening, lawn care, cooking, cleaning, growing and sharing food, these are things that will probably

250
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,760
persist as well. Because again, local economies, circular economies, these are rising in popularity.

251
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,840
And then finally, artisan and craftsmen, handmade goods, arts and crafts, these are the kinds of

252
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,680
things that people will really value and cherish. And it's also something that a machine intrinsically

253
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,560
cannot do. In the age where machines can make all kinds of furniture and mass produce it,

254
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,600
we still already have Etsy where you can buy handmade clothing and handmade furniture and

255
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,960
handmade tools. And so the demand is already there. And one thing that can happen of, and yes,

256
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,160
they're more expensive, but these are much higher quality goods. And they're also much more durable.

257
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,280
So again, even if those, even if mass produced goods become cheaper due to AI, there's still

258
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,840
going to be a demand for those high quality handmade, unique goods and arts and crafts.

259
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,400
Now, okay, so that's local goods and services. There's also still going to be online and remote.

260
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,200
So content creators like me, probably going to stick around influencers, streamers, whether it's a

261
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,800
lifestyle blog or travel blog or whatever, I follow, I started following lots of lifestyle

262
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,000
bloggers. Usually they're attractive women, because you know, that's just the pattern.

263
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,320
But I also follow plenty of plenty of guys who like build stuff, or go on adventures, that kind

264
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,200
of thing. And the reason that I think that these are going to stick around is because even if you

265
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,920
have a fully digital avatar, your brain knows that it's fake, right? Some people, of course,

266
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,080
will be plenty entertained by, you know, a digital avatar. But really, as a human,

267
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,320
I want to see another human's experience. I want to learn from that human. I want to empathize

268
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,080
with that person. And so content influence streamers, you know, it's the personality,

269
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,840
it's the realness, the authenticity. Even if there is some performance associated with it,

270
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,920
that's what people really want to connect with. Crowdfunding platforms like Patreon only fans,

271
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,760
plenty of other alternatives are out there. Those are going to stick around. And so basically,

272
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,240
the two ways that you can make money online in the future, I think, are going to be ads and

273
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,160
crowdfunding. There's also white label services like subscription based services. But that's

274
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,360
essentially crowdfunding, right? Like you pay to get in, and then you get access to exclusive

275
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,920
content. Game hosts, coaches, and trainers of various kinds. So one of my Patreon supporters

276
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,080
is actually a professional online coach, and she teaches other coaches. And this is actually a

277
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,520
really, really huge market segment. I had no idea how big it was. But again, having that one on one

278
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,280
time with someone where you can say, Hey, this is what I'm struggling with, because we're humans,

279
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,680
we're always going to be struggling with something, right? But then like game hosts,

280
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,120
there's paid dungeon masters that can host that can run D&D campaigns for you. All kinds of stuff

281
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,800
is possible online that are intrinsically better done if it's a human. That being said, there are

282
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,880
plenty of people working on using GPT technologies to automate, you know, game hosts and that sort

283
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,840
of stuff. So some of this is going to be is going to change. But a lot of these things,

284
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,480
again, people are willing are the demand for the human is high enough that people are going to be

285
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,320
willing to pay for it. Now, on top of making more money on with the UBI, there is also a lot that

286
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,040
you can do to reduce to further reduce costs. Obviously, the biggest things are housing and

287
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
transportation, we already talked about how to reduce the cost there. There's a lot of other

288
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,160
stuff that we can do to keep reducing costs in order to make better use of the free time that

289
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,280
we have. So for instance, tool sharing, tool libraries, there's actually, I didn't realize

290
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,000
this, but many county libraries or, you know, city libraries already have tools that you can check out.

291
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,680
And then of course, if the demand for that goes up, then libraries, you know, will continue to do

292
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,120
that. There's also maker spaces that you can join usually with a small fee that give you a space to

293
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,200
build stuff and borrow tools, circular economics, which is, you know, reusing as much as you can,

294
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,560
refurbishing stuff. We're going to talk about refurbishing more in a future slide.

295
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,480
Clothing exchanges, clothing swaps, other good swaps, like one thing that I do is that every

296
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,680
now and then I just, I have a folding card table and I'll put it out by the road and I just will

297
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,080
give stuff away, right? And so by just giving stuff away and sharing, right, you don't even have to

298
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,880
worry about, you know, bartering or exchanging or buying stuff, just giving stuff away and making

299
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,160
use of those essentially community-based donations. Sharing services as well. So say for instance,

300
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,680
you know, you might provide childcare for people in your community, not necessarily for pay,

301
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,120
but in exchange they give you food or something, right? So that goes back to bartering and trading.

302
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,320
DIY skills, repairing things, fixing things, cleaning up, whatever. There's lots and lots

303
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,440
of value that you can get by learning more skills and thus further reducing costs. Caregiving,

304
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,320
domestic stuff, I already mentioned that. Okay, so let's talk about the psychology of this. One

305
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,120
thing that people are concerned about is, yeah, but what do you do for fun? What do you do for

306
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,160
sense of mastery? What do you do for challenge? If I lose my job, you know, how do I have any

307
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,320
sense of self-esteem? So let's talk about the psychology of living under UBI. First, we're

308
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,680
going to talk about what we're going to use frameworks for this. So first, one of the most

309
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,240
famous ones is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. So if you're not familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of

310
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,680
Needs, it is basically just this pyramid, which is color-coded like the food pyramid if you're in

311
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:25,040
America, but it says you need to satisfy these needs starting from bottom to top. So physiological

312
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,240
needs include air, water, food, shelter, sleep, that sort of stuff. Safety needs, which is about,

313
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,640
are you in physical danger? Do you feel safe at home? Is your environment quiet enough?

314
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,040
Are there any dangerous smells or chemicals or whatever?

315
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Above that, once you have those needs met, the next most fundamental need is love and belonging. So

316
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,840
you need friends, you need family, you need to feel that human connection. And of course, we're

317
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,720
in a loneliness crisis. I think something like 30% of young people today don't have a single

318
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,560
best friend, which is really horrible. And I'm hoping that UBI gives us more free time to connect

319
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:12,080
with people. Above love and belonging, you need esteem, self-esteem, which is self-respect, status,

320
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,520
recognition, that sort of stuff. And then finally, self-actualization. So this is what a lot of

321
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,120
people are referring to when they worry about, okay, well, if I lose my job, what am I going to do?

322
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,200
I need some kind of self-actualization. And so self-actualization is the impulse to become the

323
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,000
best version of yourself. That is the version to reach your highest level. And so these are

324
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,240
things that are still going to need to be there. And we'll talk about this in future slides in

325
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,680
terms of how can you achieve the best version of yourself? Another framework that I'm a big

326
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,040
fan of is what's called TLC or therapeutic lifestyle changes. This is a model that was

327
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,560
developed by Roger Walsh. And it is an eight-point framework that talks about how do you make a

328
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,680
better life for yourself? So the framework is pretty simple, pretty straightforward. One,

329
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,280
and this is in no particular order, by the way, one spirituality. So being involved in some kind

330
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,640
of spirituality doesn't have to be a megachurch or anything like that. You know, paganism, witchcraft,

331
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,760
neo-hellenism, all kinds of stuff, Norse reconstructionists, lots and lots of spiritual

332
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,760
frameworks are kind of becoming popular, as certainly a lot of us younger people are more

333
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,640
pagan. Giving back, so volunteering and community service is one of the things that, you know,

334
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,400
again, we kind of alluded to this already in terms of cost reduction. But giving back, volunteering,

335
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,120
giving your time is actually a really good way to build up self-esteem. It's deeply satisfying.

336
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,880
Like I said, one thing that I love is just giving stuff away. And if I had more free time and energy,

337
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,120
I would probably volunteer more because I have certain skills. And, you know, honestly, a lot

338
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,160
of the code that I give away, because I publish all of my code under open-source standards,

339
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,560
to me, that is kind of like giving back. And it's very satisfying. I love seeing the little

340
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,360
stars and forks on my GitHub repos. Time and nature, hiking, walking, going to the lake,

341
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,080
whatever. This is really important for your physical and mental health. I go for a walk

342
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,120
pretty much every day, unless the weather is bad or unless I'm sick or too tired.

343
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,840
Recreational activities, we're going to talk a lot about recreational activities

344
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,560
in upcoming slides. Rest and relaxation. If you don't have to go to work, you can spend a lot

345
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,800
more time resting and relaxing. Diet and nutrition. We've talked a lot about how, or we will talk more

346
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,000
about how all the free time that you get from UBI will allow you to do things like gardening,

347
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,880
but also allow you to learn to cook and spend more time cooking. Because a lot of people don't have

348
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,120
time to cook good meals because they're too busy working and resting. And so UBI with additional

349
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,920
free time will help people really improve their diet and nutrition. Seven, exercise and activity.

350
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,760
So this is like exercising for the sake of exercise, which for me, I get that with time and nature

351
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
because I go for walks. And I also like to do other things, although I haven't done it as much

352
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,760
lately, hiking, climbing, that sort of stuff, kayaking. Relationships and connection. We already

353
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
talked about relationships and connection in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. And also you will see

354
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,320
that relationships and connections, spending time with friends and family is common for all

355
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,000
psychological well-being frameworks. Self-determination theory. This is one of my favorite frameworks

356
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,440
because it is so simple. And it kind of encapsulates a lot, but it's also not a hierarchy. You need

357
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,440
all three of these at all times. And so the idea is that self-determination theory is,

358
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,280
this is what people are intrinsically motivated by. These are the intrinsic psychological needs

359
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,400
of all humans. So first is autonomy or individual liberty. We need to feel like we are in control

360
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,160
of our lives and our fate. This is absolutely critical for all humans. Even humans in

361
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,440
collectivist societies, there's always a tension between individual needs and group needs.

362
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,120
But that's intrinsic to all social species. It's about balancing the self versus the group.

363
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,520
Desire for competence and mastery. So this has to do with Maslow's top hierarchy of needs,

364
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,120
which is self-esteem and self-actualization. So competence and mastery, basically feeling

365
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,320
like you're good at something. One way to measure this is that we thrive with what's called optimal

366
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,080
stress. So optimal stress means that you need some kind of challenge. For instance, people play Elden

367
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:50,000
Ring. People play Dark Souls. These really frustrating, impossible games that I personally

368
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,400
don't like. But the idea is that you try and fail, and then when you finally succeed,

369
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,800
you feel a sense of mastery. And of course, video games are not the only way to get mastery,

370
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,640
but video games are a good way to get a sense of mastery. And as we'll talk about,

371
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,000
once we talk about hobbies, there are lots and lots of other ways to get that sense of mastery.

372
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,880
Finally, desire for relatedness and connection. As a social species, we are intrinsically

373
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,680
motivated to seek out connection with others. And so by keeping in mind what our intrinsic

374
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,680
base needs are and building a life around that, we can still maintain our psychological well-being

375
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,560
even if we don't have a career, at least a conventional career that we're familiar with.

376
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,240
Okay, as I promised, hobbies, this is the last section of the video. And this is honestly where

377
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,080
I had the most fun. And it made me really realize, I'm looking forward to this. So I'm going to do

378
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,680
everything that I can to help make this future state come to fruition with my YouTube channel

379
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,360
and my open source research. So the first thing, obviously gaming, a lot of you tell me how excited

380
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,200
you are for the possibility of FDVR, which means full dive virtual reality. Everyone knows what

381
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,440
FDVR is, you saw it in the matrix. The idea is that you plug your head in. And as far as you can

382
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,440
tell, it is 100% real. We also explored this with Ready Player One, which had like haptic suits.

383
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't know if it's possible, a haptic suit seems like it's probably more possible in the near

384
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,360
term. Full dive VR, such as what you see in the matrix, might not be possible. But you never know.

385
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,400
People are working on brain computer interfaces. So if you can just plug in all the sensory

386
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,200
information directly into your head, maybe it's possible. Anyways, whatever you want to do,

387
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,760
whatever experience you want to have, should hypothetically be possible with FDVR.

388
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,280
Part of gaming is that it can be social, right? Game with friends, whether you're competing online

389
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,200
with friends, or you got a guild or a clan that you've built. You can also do parallel play in

390
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,400
person. So this is what I do with my wife. We heckle each other. While she's playing Assassin's

391
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,840
Creed, I'll be like, Hey, did you know that you're on fire? And she's like, Yes, Dave, I know that I'm

392
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,920
on fire. You know, parallel play is a great thing to do with friends. You can sit around, you know,

393
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,320
I used to do this back in my college days with my buddies, drinking a couple beers, playing Call of

394
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,440
Duty, trolling each other. It can be a really great thing. And I'm glad to see that the younger

395
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,560
generations do this still. My nephew and all of his friends, they play Minecraft together and other

396
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,120
things. There are what I will say is there are some potential downsides. Screen time can be detrimental

397
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,760
to your health. But if you balance it with some of the other things, like in the therapeutic

398
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,760
lifestyle changes, make sure that you go outside, touch grasses, kids are saying these days.

399
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,040
It can also be addictive and isolation is possible. I do suspect that we will see legislation coming

400
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,160
that kind of at least provides warnings for how addictive things are. There's a book that I refer

401
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,840
to often called Liquid Rain, where they talk about how full dive VR could actually be

402
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,480
programmatically addictive, like where it could just stimulate your dopamine. And so you feel

403
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,480
like you're having more fun than you actually are. And then when you're not in the full dive VR,

404
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,040
you could physically crave it and get sick if you don't have it. So we do need to be careful

405
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,120
with creating gaming as a central lifestyle. And another thing is that a gaming world is not

406
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,640
necessarily the real world and most people's brains will keep track of that difference.

407
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,400
And so it might not be good for self actualization. For instance, if you're a gamer,

408
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,720
you might not get the sense that you're reaching your full potential. That being said,

409
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,960
if you're a competitive gamer, maybe that is the way that you reach your full potential.

410
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,600
Making and fixing things. We humans evolved to use our hands. That is why we have so much

411
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,280
dexterity in our hands. We are the tool users. And so one of my best friends from back in the day

412
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,280
is working on rebuilding a thistle. So this is a thistle. It's a small racing boat.

413
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,240
We would be doing this all day every day if we had UBI and no need to work for money.

414
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,400
And because the shop where he's rebuilding his, there's two other ones that are just waiting

415
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,440
for someone to come and fix. And if I had the time, that's what I'd be doing. Why? Because it's

416
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,480
something that my friend does and you can then race it and do competitive stuff. But there's also

417
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,440
skill building, right? The sense of mastery that you get from building something from fixing it

418
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,720
and having that thing that you can show off and use. This is a really great way to get a sense of

419
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,600
mastery. There's plenty of other things that people do. Lots of guys like rebuild mustangs or

420
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:36,480
corvettes, fixing up old houses and other things. So reusing, refurbishing, fixing, building things.

421
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,280
These are really great ways that also tap into really primal needs for humans.

422
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,560
Some of the things that are really popular today, particularly with young people,

423
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,800
forging, leatherworking, sewing, other carpentry, all of these things revolve around tool use.

424
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,600
And so whatever hobby you pick up, if it uses tools, chances are there's a lot of skills involved,

425
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,200
which can also lead to that sense of mastery. Cooking, I mentioned this earlier. Cooking is one

426
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,000
of the oldest trades, one of the oldest professions out there, and everyone needs to eat. Plus cooking

427
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,280
is a good social activity. My wife and I cook together pretty much every day or at least we

428
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,080
take turns. Some people compulsively cook and feed other people. My sister-in-law is like that.

429
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,440
She loves cooking for people. Point being is that there are a lot of hobbies out there

430
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:33,440
that center around making or fixing things. Outdoor stuff, hiking, climbing, canoeing, boating,

431
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:42,160
whatever. There's all kinds of stuff that we could stand to do more of if you had more free time

432
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,000
because you didn't have to work, because you didn't have to be at a desk or at an office

433
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,640
or at the store or whatever. And it's not just fishing. Obviously that's the prototypical example

434
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,280
where a guy gets to retirement age and he decides he's going to go fishing every day.

435
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,880
Not everyone wants to do that. I get it. You could do competitive fishing, but there's also other

436
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,400
kinds of competitive outdoor stuff like cross-country challenges. I ran Tough Mudder almost 10 years

437
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,320
ago, and I was hungover as heck when I ran it. I was not hungover by the end of it. I burned all

438
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,000
that toxins off. Skiing, kayaking, all kinds of really challenging stuff that you can do outside.

439
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,160
A lot of my friends picked up mountain biking, which you could do practically anywhere

440
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,200
during the pandemic. So one thing that I realized when I was making this video is that if we got

441
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,200
UBI tomorrow, I would probably go hike the Appalachian Trail. I love being outside. I love

442
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,040
being in the mountains, and that is something that I want to do. But right now, my brain is like,

443
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,520
well, I'm still got to make YouTube. I still got to do AI stuff. I still have meetings with my

444
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,320
Patreon supporters. So doing the Appalachian Trail is not really an option for me right now,

445
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,640
unless I were to take like three months off, which maybe I should. Anyways, fitness. Fitness is the

446
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,400
most familiar model that a lot of people use to get mastery, whether it's yoga or Pilates or

447
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,640
running or cycling, martial arts, strength training. These are all things that people,

448
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,520
many, many people do, and it can be a little cultish for some people. There's also fitness-based

449
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,440
competitions like Iron Man, American Ninja, that sort of stuff. That being said, there are many,

450
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,120
many, many additional benefits other than just it's something to do.

451
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,960
Better fitness leads to reduced pain, increased health, cognitive benefits, emotional benefits,

452
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,920
plus you get to show off your body. There's lots of people that love being fit just for the sake

453
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:50,320
of feeling sexy. There are so many people that I knew and have met and where they decided to get fit,

454
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,000
started climbing, started going to the gym, and the transformation that they felt as they felt

455
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,400
better about themselves, about their body, the sense of accomplishment that they get from that

456
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,160
is incredible. It's still not for everyone. So I want to say, okay, even if you have all the options

457
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,840
in the world and you decide that exercise isn't for you, that's fine. Or fitness, exercises for

458
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,440
everyone. Fitness might not be for you. Meetups. So I am a huge fan of meetup.com. I actually

459
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,560
met my now wife at a meetup. We're both writers. So the kinds of tools that are out there. So

460
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,120
meetup.com is there specifically for finding people with the same interests, challenges, or

461
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:40,160
whatever. So meetup.com, it's free to join. I tell people about it all the time. I think more

462
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,400
people should be on meetup, whether you have a special interest or if you've got something

463
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,680
that you're coping with. There's support groups on meetup. I host a local AI meetup. I'm actually

464
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,040
going to that later today. Let's see. There's intellectual kinds of things. There's chess

465
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,640
clubs. There's spirituality clubs, arts, crafts, photography, all kinds of stuff. Whatever your

466
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,080
interest is, especially if you live in a city, you can find other people that have that same

467
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,920
interest, which is a really great way to get that social connection. But then also,

468
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:27,280
some of these things can lead to senses of mastery, for instance. All right. So this is life under UBI.

469
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,120
I hope that you got a lot out of this. Like I said, making this video, actually, I kind of

470
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:39,040
clarified a lot for myself. And it makes me personally a lot more excited for the future.

471
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:47,520
And personally, this was probably the most fun that I've had in making a video yet. So anyways, cheers.
