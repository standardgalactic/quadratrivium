00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
I gave a talk last night to a bunch of students at Clemson University, and as often happens

00:05.360 --> 00:11.440
when you talk to a bunch of really sharp young people with good questions, it spawned a lot

00:11.440 --> 00:14.400
of thoughts and robust discussions.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.840
And so what I wanted to do was share some of the insights from that conversation that

00:18.840 --> 00:24.200
I had and give you a little bit of updates in terms of kind of my current thinking on

00:24.200 --> 00:25.560
post-labor economics.

00:25.560 --> 00:32.800
So the overarching questions that people ask are, if we are heading for an AI revolution,

00:32.800 --> 00:37.560
a cognitive labor revolution, how is the economy going to work after everyone loses

00:37.560 --> 00:42.080
their jobs, what industries will survive, and which ones will collapse?

00:42.080 --> 00:46.900
So we're going to unpack this from an individual level as well as an aggregate level looking

00:46.900 --> 00:49.320
at the economy as a whole.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.960
So if you're new to this channel or you're new to this concept, post-labor economics

00:52.960 --> 00:59.520
is a new economic paradigm that I personally predict is going to be coming, where the very

00:59.520 --> 01:04.080
short version is, if you no longer need human labor, what else changes?

01:04.080 --> 01:09.280
If the combination of AI, quantum computing, robots, and other automation replaces the

01:09.280 --> 01:13.880
need for human labor, then obviously a lot of things change.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.960
This means that we'll have to fundamentally renegotiate our relationship with labor,

01:17.960 --> 01:22.200
with work, with money, with businesses, and so on and so forth.

01:22.200 --> 01:29.240
So as AI ramps up very quickly, it's gaining new capabilities literally on a weekly basis,

01:29.240 --> 01:31.080
sometimes on a daily basis.

01:31.080 --> 01:37.140
We are heading towards a hyperabundance of cognitive labor, of knowledge work.

01:37.140 --> 01:41.760
In the third industrial revolution, we had a revolution of internet and computers.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.200
So communication accelerated, number crunching accelerated, but by and large automation was

01:47.200 --> 01:51.400
still relegated to manufacturing processes.

01:51.400 --> 02:00.840
Now with this rise of artificial intelligence, we're looking at what's called labor substitution,

02:00.840 --> 02:06.720
in which case you have machines that are able to do new kinds of automation.

02:06.720 --> 02:12.000
We're able to not just automate manufacturing jobs, we're able to automate knowledge work.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.040
And so this is going to drastically disrupt the employment landscape.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.400
And of course, the prevailing wisdom is that technology always creates new jobs.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.380
This isn't necessarily true.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.680
What technology does is it lowers costs, which we will also talk about later in this video.

02:27.680 --> 02:34.360
But when you lower costs, that frees up capital and time and energy and money to be used elsewhere,

02:34.360 --> 02:40.480
which then creates new sectors of demands, new total addressable markets, which then

02:40.480 --> 02:41.920
translates to new jobs.

02:41.920 --> 02:46.800
So there's actually several degrees of separation between technologies and jobs growth.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.600
However, if those new markets are also addressable by the machines that we're building, that's

02:51.600 --> 02:54.780
not necessarily going to translate to human jobs.

02:54.780 --> 02:57.640
So with all that being said, how is this going to work?

02:57.640 --> 02:58.640
How is this going to look?

02:58.640 --> 03:03.280
So what I'm going to present is not necessarily a complete picture because the idea of post-labor

03:03.280 --> 03:06.040
economics is still evolving.

03:06.040 --> 03:11.840
But I think it is a worthwhile and necessary conversation to have moving forward, particularly

03:11.840 --> 03:14.000
as AI ramps up.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
So prima facie of benefits.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.040
Just at first glance, there's obviously a lot of benefits to having a ramp up of AI,

03:22.040 --> 03:24.280
otherwise we wouldn't be doing it.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.400
Number one, productivity surge.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.120
If you have better machines, more intelligent computers, better language models, and increasingly

03:32.120 --> 03:35.240
advanced AI, you get productivity benefits.

03:35.240 --> 03:39.900
This has already been empirically proven, where, for instance, Microsoft just had their

03:39.900 --> 03:46.420
Ignite keynote speech, where developers that use co-pilots are 55% more productive.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.580
In some cases, depending on the task, you can be 200% more productive.

03:50.580 --> 03:56.460
And based on the work that I'm doing, I think that before too long, we're just going to

03:56.460 --> 04:00.340
replace human labor altogether in some domains, and it's going to be just completely taken

04:00.340 --> 04:01.980
over by machines.

04:01.980 --> 04:06.700
So an old school example of this is think about telephone operators.

04:06.700 --> 04:13.780
Telephone operators were entirely substituted by automatic telephone routing machines.

04:13.780 --> 04:18.260
Likewise, I think that a lot of coding and a lot of other computer-centric jobs are going

04:18.260 --> 04:23.700
to be just fully automated away before too long, and the speed of productivity is going

04:23.700 --> 04:24.900
to go up.

04:24.900 --> 04:29.300
That's a good thing, but it also has knock-on effects and consequences.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.620
Scientific acceleration.

04:30.620 --> 04:37.500
So as I've produced some tools in the past about reading and summarizing papers, and

04:37.500 --> 04:42.780
now, of course, we have chatbots that have 100,000 token windows, you can stuff a whole

04:42.780 --> 04:48.620
bunch of scientific papers into these, there's also better AI-based tools to search for papers.

04:48.620 --> 04:53.660
So pretty much every scientist that I've talked to is now using AI to accelerate their work.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.380
Now obviously, it's not doing primary science on its own.

04:56.380 --> 05:01.020
This is helping with things like literature reviews and then drafting manuscripts, but

05:01.020 --> 05:02.900
still it's helping.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.780
And then you look at the contribution that labs such as DeepMind are doing, where they're

05:06.780 --> 05:11.580
actually creating fundamentally new step changes in what is scientifically capable with tools

05:11.580 --> 05:12.580
like AlphaFold.

05:12.580 --> 05:18.660
So if you're not familiar with AlphaFold, this is an AI model that allows you to accurately

05:18.660 --> 05:23.340
predict the ways that proteins will fold, which has greatly accelerated drug discovery

05:23.340 --> 05:26.580
and other kinds of biomedical research.

05:26.580 --> 05:31.260
There's also creativity is being drastically impacted now.

05:31.260 --> 05:36.980
We're just starting to see the first full-scale productions of text to video.

05:36.980 --> 05:41.300
And I don't remember who, but someone just predicted that the first 90-minute Hollywood

05:41.300 --> 05:44.580
feature film will be created within the next year.

05:44.580 --> 05:49.260
And so that also has profound implications, because if it becomes infinitely cheaper to

05:49.260 --> 05:55.220
make a Hollywood blockbuster film, that's going to disrupt Disney, Hollywood, Netflix.

05:55.220 --> 06:02.140
It's going to disrupt the celebrity culture and also just the way that we consume digital

06:02.140 --> 06:03.220
entertainment.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.900
So that is going to be profoundly disruptive.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.420
But again, on the surface, it's a good thing because then it's like, okay, well, we get

06:09.420 --> 06:13.860
more entertainment and it's cheaper and faster and more personalized.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.140
We can also scale problem solving.

06:16.260 --> 06:21.100
Basically, if you've watched some of my recent videos about agents and agent swarms, once

06:21.100 --> 06:26.940
you can instantiate one good AI model, you can instantiate billions of copies of that

06:26.940 --> 06:28.660
AI model.

06:28.660 --> 06:33.100
That is cognitive labor that is scalable in a way that is not scalable with humans.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.100
And this is something that I talk about when I talk about the automation paradox is because

06:37.100 --> 06:42.460
until you get that final automation engine online, nothing really happens.

06:42.460 --> 06:48.180
But then, so 0% of the work gets done until the very end and then it's done and then 100%

06:48.180 --> 06:50.860
of the work gets done very quickly.

06:50.860 --> 06:54.620
And then, of course, this will also have knock-on effects in terms like education and many other

06:54.620 --> 06:57.220
industries that we'll unpack later in this video.

06:57.220 --> 07:00.860
One thing that I predict is going to happen is what I call price collapse.

07:00.860 --> 07:06.580
So this is not rocket science, but as we're already seeing, for instance, all the graphics

07:06.580 --> 07:11.260
in this slide deck were generated in a few seconds with AI.

07:11.260 --> 07:15.480
So rather than paying a graphic designer hundreds if not thousands of dollars per video, it

07:15.480 --> 07:20.420
literally cost me a few cents with Dolly and Mid Journey to make the graphics.

07:20.420 --> 07:26.540
So that is a price collapse of a factor of hundreds if not tens of thousands of times

07:26.540 --> 07:28.980
cheaper and faster to do it.

07:28.980 --> 07:33.300
You can expect the same kinds of price collapses for all kinds of services.

07:33.300 --> 07:38.540
As I just mentioned, once we nail text to video, that means a 90-minute Hollywood blockbuster

07:38.540 --> 07:44.900
instead of costing $100 million is going to cost $10,000 if that may be less.

07:44.900 --> 07:50.820
Legal services, financial services, all kinds of things, medical services, health care.

07:50.820 --> 07:55.620
The knock-on effects are very difficult to overstate because we don't really have a

07:55.620 --> 07:56.620
mental model.

07:56.620 --> 08:03.020
We don't have personal experience when entire job sectors and labor markets are drastically

08:03.020 --> 08:09.620
disrupted, not by 10% or 50%, but by 10,000% or a million percent cheaper.

08:09.620 --> 08:14.140
We just don't have a way of comprehending the economic effects that that has.

08:14.140 --> 08:18.500
Now even in industries where AI does not directly impact it.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.940
So for instance, AI can't necessarily make steel move faster in ships.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.420
AI can't make trees grow faster.

08:25.420 --> 08:30.600
However, by removing human labor from it, you can still drastically reduce the cost

08:30.600 --> 08:37.660
of primary goods and services like coal, steel, timber, stone, asphalt, concrete, those

08:37.660 --> 08:38.940
sorts of things.

08:38.940 --> 08:44.760
And so even then, some of the costs can be reduced and avoided, not 100%, but we're

08:44.760 --> 08:50.700
going to have this really interesting economic paradigm where some things, primary resources

08:50.700 --> 08:55.520
like land, are going to mostly hold their value, but other goods and services are going

08:55.520 --> 08:57.440
to basically be free.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.860
And this is why I think that billionaires like Bill Gates are buying up forest land

09:00.860 --> 09:05.100
and farmland, because they're reading the writing on the wall saying, don't invest in

09:05.100 --> 09:11.460
financial industries, don't invest in healthcare, don't invest in X, Y, and Z, instead invest

09:11.460 --> 09:14.140
in things that are going to stick around.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.820
And I'll talk about industries that I predict are going to stick around.

09:16.820 --> 09:20.520
Now one thing I need to caution is this is not investing advice.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.900
This is not financial advice.

09:21.900 --> 09:27.720
This is just me reading the tea leaves in what I see and my interpretation of the investing

09:27.720 --> 09:30.240
behavior of others.

09:30.240 --> 09:35.720
In no means is this a recommendation, because I could be completely and fundamentally wrong

09:35.720 --> 09:37.600
about all of this.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.760
So you have been thoroughly warned.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
Another component of this whole trend is reduced aggregate demand.

09:44.760 --> 09:50.280
So one of the students that I gave the talk to asked a really phenomenal question about,

09:50.280 --> 09:56.980
if, for instance, we all start losing our jobs, then we, the consumers, have less money

09:56.980 --> 09:59.860
and in aggregate we will have less demand.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.220
So this is going to impact what business is actually produced.

10:03.220 --> 10:07.260
Because if we have less demand, businesses are going to be less incentivized to produce

10:07.260 --> 10:11.100
goods and services for us, because, well, you don't try and sell something to people

10:11.100 --> 10:12.820
that don't have money.

10:12.820 --> 10:17.260
And so this is actually one of the biggest questions that I see all the time on the comments

10:17.260 --> 10:22.320
as well, is if we don't have money to spend, how is the economy going to work?

10:22.320 --> 10:28.360
So I'm not going to fully address this in this video, but citizens, civilians, we're

10:28.360 --> 10:29.800
not the only consumers.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.240
There's also business to business transactions as well as business to government transactions,

10:34.240 --> 10:41.800
which I think the bulk of the economy is going to shift to being B2B and B2G or public sector

10:41.800 --> 10:43.840
expenditures.

10:43.840 --> 10:49.340
Now there are also some primary demands that all civilians have, and we'll talk about that

10:49.340 --> 10:54.140
in just a second, but I did need to address that reduced aggregate demand is probably

10:54.140 --> 10:58.620
one of the biggest risk factors that we'll see in terms of the economy stalling if and

10:58.620 --> 11:01.900
when we see unemployment rates rising sharply.

11:01.900 --> 11:06.900
Because again, you know, if you go from a six-figure job or even a $50,000 job and you

11:06.900 --> 11:11.820
end up stuck on unemployment benefits or a universal basic income and your income is

11:11.820 --> 11:19.880
reduced to $20,000 a year, that is, you have substantially less market power, purchasing

11:19.880 --> 11:22.880
power in the economy as an actor.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.360
And so this is really going to fundamentally disrupt the economy.

11:26.360 --> 11:31.800
Again, it remains to be seen if this happens, but there have been some recent reports, very

11:31.800 --> 11:37.880
alarming reports showing that AI, such as ChatGPT, are already disrupting a very broad

11:37.900 --> 11:42.620
spectrum of industries and some in very unexpected ways.

11:42.620 --> 11:49.620
So I've told this story before, but one of my former clients told me a story where once

11:49.620 --> 11:57.120
the data analytics tool came out with ChatGPT, it replaced an entire bioinformatic statistician,

11:57.120 --> 12:00.620
which that's a job that you need a master's degree or a PhD to do.

12:00.620 --> 12:07.180
And so then suddenly this tool that costs $20 a month dislocates a job, a human-paying

12:07.200 --> 12:11.800
job that would have cost $8,000 a month or more to have a human in that role.

12:11.800 --> 12:17.160
So that is the magnitude of reduced aggregate demand that we're looking for or that we're

12:17.160 --> 12:18.160
looking at happening.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.320
Now, there is another component of this, which is primary needs, which we'll talk about in

12:23.320 --> 12:24.600
just a moment.

12:24.600 --> 12:30.080
So what this is all leading to is fundamentally new market paradigms.

12:30.080 --> 12:35.120
And so this paradigm shift, this slide is more about some predictions that I have.

12:35.120 --> 12:41.380
So for instance, if we have robots, if we have AI, then perhaps as we're kind of moving

12:41.380 --> 12:47.260
towards a deglobalization and there's trends such as circular economies and farm to table,

12:47.260 --> 12:53.020
I wonder if we're going to see the same thing with manufacturing of goods and also providing

12:53.020 --> 12:54.500
of services.

12:54.500 --> 12:59.740
Because if you can just provide goods and services on demand locally rather than having

12:59.740 --> 13:01.960
long logistic chains.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.900
So for instance, imagine that your theater is running a local version that it just generated

13:06.900 --> 13:10.120
in the cloud rather than waiting for Hollywood.

13:10.120 --> 13:14.940
Likewise, imagine that you go to the Amazon store and instead of some goods that are manufactured

13:14.940 --> 13:17.560
in China, it's just 3D printed in the back.

13:17.560 --> 13:22.480
So this is a little bit more speculative, but we already have some fictional examples

13:22.480 --> 13:25.600
of this like the replicators and Star Trek.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.400
It's within the realm of possibilities, but I think more eminently what we'll see is

13:29.400 --> 13:35.620
on demand production of digital goods and digital services such as legal services, entertainment,

13:35.620 --> 13:37.020
music, that sort of thing.

13:37.020 --> 13:42.140
That stuff is already in the pipeline, local manufacturing of physical goods.

13:42.140 --> 13:46.220
That may or may not happen, but I just wanted to point out that we are looking at some of

13:46.220 --> 13:48.540
these kinds of shifts.

13:48.540 --> 13:53.580
Now one thing that could happen is that as the economic landscape changes, we could see

13:53.580 --> 14:00.200
what's called industry narrowing, which is that many companies and many job sectors or

14:00.200 --> 14:05.640
market segments might just go away for good because they're made completely irrelevant.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.800
Those business models are made completely obsolete.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.280
So time will tell, but it has happened before.

14:12.280 --> 14:17.200
An example is you don't really have horse breeders as a major economic thing anymore.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.200
Why?

14:18.200 --> 14:23.520
Because horses, as an entire industry, were replaced by automobiles over a century ago.

14:23.520 --> 14:28.180
And so while horse care and horse breeding and carriage building and all that fun stuff

14:28.180 --> 14:31.660
was a major industry because horses were used for everything.

14:31.660 --> 14:32.860
Draft horses were used on farms.

14:32.860 --> 14:36.180
They were used for moving goods and services and moving people.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.940
Now that's no longer a thing.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.860
And so we've seen it before.

14:39.860 --> 14:44.380
We will see it again, but it's difficult to predict exactly which industries will fully

14:44.380 --> 14:49.380
collapse and be relegated to a luxury service because there are still horse breeders, but

14:49.380 --> 14:52.380
this is more of old money kind of stuff.

14:52.380 --> 14:55.680
So what are the industries that will survive?

14:55.680 --> 15:00.080
Just off the cuff, here's kind of what I brainstormed as the industries that I think

15:00.080 --> 15:03.720
will probably stick around and be relatively durable.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.720
Again, this is not investing advice.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.600
Personally, I am not invested in any of these.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.680
So take everything that I'm saying here with a gigantic grain of salt.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.280
But first and foremost, raw materials and energy.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.280
We're going to need steel.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.600
We're going to need concrete and stone.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.960
We're going to need timber.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.240
We're going to need water, right?

15:21.260 --> 15:23.940
Those kinds of things are based on primary needs.

15:23.940 --> 15:27.780
So that is something that if you're a living, breathing human being, you need food.

15:27.780 --> 15:28.780
You need shelter.

15:28.780 --> 15:29.780
You need clothes.

15:29.780 --> 15:34.140
So some of those things are going, the demand for those is going to be persistent, even

15:34.140 --> 15:39.620
if it's fully automated, even if it is done by machines and robots and AI.

15:39.620 --> 15:43.580
Semiconductors, obviously if everything is running on AI, we're going to need chip fabs.

15:43.580 --> 15:48.460
We're going to need memories, CPUs, GPUs, RAM, servers, supercomputers.

15:48.460 --> 15:49.720
That industry is sticking around.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.320
If anything, it's going to be bigger.

15:51.320 --> 15:56.480
It might be the primary industry, honestly, because I also predict that in the long run,

15:56.480 --> 16:00.640
it's just more economically feasible for open source data and open source models.

16:00.640 --> 16:04.520
I just watched the entire Microsoft Ignite keynote speech.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.000
Microsoft is going all in on closed source models like GPT-4.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.640
They're also going all in on open source models.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.840
So they are hedging their bets.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.160
However it pans out, Microsoft and NVIDIA, it's all going to be running on their hardware

16:18.220 --> 16:22.060
and their cloud platforms, whether or not it's produced by open AI, whether or not it's

16:22.060 --> 16:27.220
produced by Meta, or whether it's produced by Carnegie Mellon, or whoever else.

16:27.220 --> 16:32.100
Robotics and automation, if you build the tools that build the tools, you're set.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.940
So there's a meme that goes around that says, during a gold rush, sell pickaxes.

16:35.940 --> 16:41.260
So the ones that sell the pickaxes, the ones that sell the robots that do everything else,

16:41.260 --> 16:44.500
the ones that sell the automation hardware and software that do everything else, they're

16:44.500 --> 16:46.380
going to be fine.

16:46.400 --> 16:51.880
Fuel tech, so this is going to have to do with water, agriculture, sustainable farming,

16:51.880 --> 16:58.600
solar energy, other renewables, whether it's thorium reactors or molten salt or nuclear

16:58.600 --> 17:00.080
fusion, whatever.

17:00.080 --> 17:06.560
Those things, again, because energy is a primary need, as well as food, I think that those

17:06.560 --> 17:09.560
industries are going to stick around, which again is why I think people like Bill Gates

17:09.560 --> 17:12.640
are investing in farmland and timberland.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Makes sense to me.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.380
In their shoes, I do the same exact thing.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.380
And then finally, experience industries.

17:18.380 --> 17:25.020
So as we all transition away from working the nine to five grind, which I can say from

17:25.020 --> 17:29.340
personal experience, yeah, you get rid of the desk job, you get bored and you want

17:29.340 --> 17:30.420
stuff to do.

17:30.420 --> 17:34.140
So that means movie theaters, that means restaurants, that means yoga studios, that

17:34.140 --> 17:40.740
means retreats, vacations, Airbnbs, all kinds of everything around the experience industry

17:40.740 --> 17:46.800
I think is going to be a major, major pillar of the economy moving forward.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.840
But again, it's going to be interesting because technically, film and TV are part of the experience

17:51.840 --> 17:57.360
industry, but the models, the cloud providers that build the models that write the new TV

17:57.360 --> 18:00.000
shows and movies, those are going to be the ones that stick around.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.800
Netflix, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.160
Disney, if they don't pivot, they're not going to stick around.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.320
Now I did look it up before I made this video, Disney did actually assemble like a strike

18:09.340 --> 18:14.300
force, an AI strike force that they're actively exploring every way that they can incorporate

18:14.300 --> 18:16.460
AI into their business.

18:16.460 --> 18:21.580
So I think Disney is probably well positioned to stick around and they're already using

18:21.580 --> 18:27.980
AI for their animatronics, they're already using AI to help with drafting movies.

18:27.980 --> 18:32.060
Maybe they should have used AI for Ant-Man Quantamania or maybe they did use AI and that

18:32.060 --> 18:34.740
was the problem, I don't know.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.460
So what are the industries that I predict are going to go extinct?

18:38.460 --> 18:43.640
Healthcare, I've mentioned this before where when you combine regenerative medicine, rejuvenation

18:43.640 --> 18:48.320
therapies and all the all the advancements that we're going to see from Alpha Fold 2,

18:48.320 --> 18:52.720
Alpha Fold 3 and everything else, I suspect that our relationship with healthcare is going

18:52.720 --> 18:56.520
to be fundamentally and drastically different within five to 10 years.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.840
A lot of people still ask me, like Dave, when are we going to hit longevity escape velocity?

19:00.840 --> 19:06.800
Last year there were three rejuvenation therapies in the pipeline, this year there are 20.

19:06.800 --> 19:15.940
The economic incentive to nail rejuvenation therapies is so high and it's getting investment

19:15.940 --> 19:21.380
from everyone from DARPA to like all of Silicon Valley, Google has, you know, Alphabet has

19:21.380 --> 19:26.820
their rejuvenation, their regeneration therapy wing, so it's coming.

19:26.820 --> 19:30.500
The money is there, where the money goes results follow.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.820
The same thing has happened with solar, the same thing has happened with AI, so the money

19:34.840 --> 19:36.800
is there, it's just a matter of time.

19:36.800 --> 19:42.040
I remember back in 2010 when I first started paying attention to solar and I'm like, oh,

19:42.040 --> 19:47.440
it's ramping up and now a lot of nations and a lot of companies are exceeding their carbon

19:47.440 --> 19:52.000
neutral targets, obviously that's a contentious field, so I'm not going to get too bogged

19:52.000 --> 19:58.040
down into it, but the point being is that back in 2010, nobody thought that solar would

19:58.040 --> 20:02.680
be where it is today and now it is, likewise the investment is ramping up in regenerative

20:02.860 --> 20:06.980
medicine, so it's coming down the pipeline.

20:06.980 --> 20:10.220
Education is also going to fundamentally change.

20:10.220 --> 20:14.860
A lot of us are already using chat GPT and other tools to learn as fast as we can.

20:14.860 --> 20:20.060
I've actually consulted with a bunch of different startups that are trying to do either tools

20:20.060 --> 20:25.980
for teachers, tools for universities or avatars to teach students.

20:25.980 --> 20:30.820
If you ever watch Star Trek Voyager, you go to the holodeck and you have like a personalized

20:30.840 --> 20:37.720
holodeck program with VR that's entirely possible that students have one-on-one mentoring sessions

20:37.720 --> 20:43.040
with holographic avatars, that would be really cool.

20:43.040 --> 20:49.320
University systems are currently deeply strained and if jobs are going away, then you're not

20:49.320 --> 20:53.240
going to be going to university to get a better job, so then why would you go to university?

20:53.240 --> 20:56.800
That's a conversation for another time, but that is something that some of the students

20:56.800 --> 20:59.240
at Clemson asked.

20:59.260 --> 21:04.060
My short answer was university experience is good if you're going to become a global

21:04.060 --> 21:10.740
citizen and you still have a monumental task before you in helping the human species become

21:10.740 --> 21:14.380
a truly global species in a global culture, because we are not right now.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.020
We are very, very fragmented.

21:17.020 --> 21:22.180
Financial automation, now obviously Wall Street and the finance industry and the investment

21:22.180 --> 21:29.180
industry, that's not going away, but insurance and a bunch of other things, I honestly suspect

21:29.260 --> 21:33.420
that the margins are going to get too thin on a lot of these industries and it's going

21:33.420 --> 21:35.540
to be radically restructured.

21:35.540 --> 21:40.340
And then finally, as I've been talking about, I do think that our relationship with digital

21:40.340 --> 21:43.940
entertainment is going to fundamentally shift and I think we're going to see a lot of implosions

21:43.940 --> 21:48.460
and a lot of collapses, because again, if you need to pay an A-list celebrity $20 million

21:48.460 --> 21:55.460
to make a movie or you could make 200 movies with AI for the same price, guess which one

21:55.480 --> 21:59.520
you're probably going to do just for the sake of economics.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.840
Real quick plug for my Patreon.

22:01.840 --> 22:08.040
I have an upcoming webinar masterclass on December 8th at 11 a.m. U.S. Eastern.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.560
I have two tiers on my Patreon.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.520
There's the $5 basic tier, which gets you access to Discord, and then the $50 premium

22:13.520 --> 22:19.040
tier, which gets you access to a bunch more exclusive content, but yeah, so go ahead and

22:19.040 --> 22:24.480
sign up if you're interested and moving right back along into the show.

22:24.500 --> 22:30.060
So I mentioned primary needs, so this is a first principles view of what is it that

22:30.060 --> 22:31.060
people need?

22:31.060 --> 22:36.500
Because there are 8 billion people on the planet and even if money goes away tomorrow,

22:36.500 --> 22:41.980
even if everything is fully automated, this is an attempt to take a first principles view

22:41.980 --> 22:44.900
of, okay, what is it that people actually need?

22:44.900 --> 22:47.020
Because where there's a need, there's a way.

22:47.020 --> 22:52.740
If there's the biological, the animal impetus to achieve these things, we will figure it

22:52.740 --> 22:53.740
out.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.960
I've got a little infographic, so there's food, there's housing, there's water, there's

22:57.960 --> 23:01.360
energy, so those are all primary needs.

23:01.360 --> 23:06.000
I think that as the economy pivots, those industries, as I mentioned, are going to be

23:06.000 --> 23:08.520
the ones that are the most durable.

23:08.520 --> 23:14.400
Power generation, food preparation, production and movement, homes, that sort of thing.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.080
This is why, for instance, many people have said the housing industry is the safest investment

23:19.080 --> 23:20.720
because everyone needs somewhere to live.

23:20.740 --> 23:24.820
Likewise, food is something that everyone needs, but the margins are already really thin on

23:24.820 --> 23:25.820
food.

23:25.820 --> 23:31.900
But, so this, I think, is going to be, like focusing on a primary needs economic paradigm

23:31.900 --> 23:37.060
is going to be the first phase of the pivot to post-labor economics because people have

23:37.060 --> 23:41.360
talked about universal basic income or universal basic services.

23:41.360 --> 23:48.460
If we see a commensurate price collapse, it's entirely possible that electricity will basically

23:48.460 --> 23:52.840
become free, at least at the scale that most people consume it at.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.520
My power bill that I just paid was $180.

23:55.520 --> 24:00.480
What if that goes down to $18 a month because of hyperabundance of solar and other renewables?

24:00.480 --> 24:08.360
What if water becomes practically free, cleansed, healthy water because of energy hyperabundance?

24:08.360 --> 24:13.080
What if all the knock-on effects of AI and automation makes houses cheaper because the

24:13.080 --> 24:18.120
price of timber goes down and the price of concrete goes down and also then the cost

24:18.120 --> 24:21.740
of building houses goes down because then you can do it with robots?

24:21.740 --> 24:27.460
So again, I think that it is not outside the realm of possibility that the cost of living

24:27.460 --> 24:31.580
within the next five to 10 years could go down by as much as like 10x.

24:31.580 --> 24:35.700
So like, you know, if your cost of living right now is $40,000 a year, you might be

24:35.700 --> 24:40.500
able to have the same standard of living with $4,000 a year in 10 years.

24:40.500 --> 24:46.220
That's kind of what I'm hoping for because that price collapse will offset the reduced

24:46.220 --> 24:49.960
aggregate demand because, yes, people might have less money, but if everything is that

24:49.960 --> 24:57.120
much cheaper or even, you know, more like, let's say prices go down 100x, but your income

24:57.120 --> 25:02.000
goes down 10x, you're effectively 10 times wealthier than you were before.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.840
So obviously, if all you have in life is just housing and food and clothes, that's relatively

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
boring.

25:09.840 --> 25:13.680
So I then took a look at secondary needs.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.200
So secondary needs are the spice of life.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.740
This is the stuff that makes life interesting and fun and engaging.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.940
And so the categories that I came up with were rich experiences.

25:22.940 --> 25:28.820
So like travel, vacations, peak experiences like concerts and, you know, dance clubs and

25:28.820 --> 25:32.980
that sort of stuff, those are going to be something that is very persistent.

25:32.980 --> 25:35.940
There's going to be a durable demand for that.

25:35.940 --> 25:37.140
Creativity and expression.

25:37.140 --> 25:42.660
So again, as you have more time and you get away from, you know, the office job, I and

25:42.660 --> 25:46.240
many people like me are engaging more and more in creative pursuits.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.240
I'm writing a novel.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.840
I know lots of people that as soon as they retire, they go back to acting and singing

25:50.840 --> 25:52.200
and that sort of thing.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.700
I know plenty of people who are painters and digital artists.

25:55.700 --> 25:59.280
And so the industries around those, even if those are cottage industries and they're not

25:59.280 --> 26:06.440
primary economic drivers, the persistent demand for human creativity and artistic expression

26:06.440 --> 26:10.000
is going to be around as long as there are humans.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Digital stimulation.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.660
So there are many of those, many of us who just want challenges for the sake of challenges.

26:15.660 --> 26:20.220
So even if AI can do everything, you know, people are still going to play chess.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.660
Again, machines are already better than humans at chess.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.980
We still play chess.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.660
People are still going to be programming and coding and doing hackathons.

26:26.660 --> 26:29.900
Yes, even if the AI can do it better, you still want to see, you want to test your

26:29.900 --> 26:32.620
metal against the machine.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.340
So reading for pleasure, those kinds of things.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.180
Obviously not everyone is a nerd like me.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.860
So not everyone is like, you know what, if I don't have to use my brain, I'm not going

26:39.880 --> 26:40.880
to use my brain.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.880
I'm just going to go to the beach.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
That's perfectly fine too.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.720
Culture and community is another aspect that I think is going to stick around and actually

26:47.720 --> 26:49.400
probably be magnified.

26:49.400 --> 26:56.360
So what I mean is walkable cities, green spaces, parks, co-living and co-housing situations,

26:56.360 --> 27:02.280
community centers, religious experiences, whether churches, you know, there's a lot

27:02.280 --> 27:08.200
of talk around the future of ideology, like is Christianity growing or going away?

27:08.200 --> 27:12.020
There's geopolitical tensions between, you know, for instance, Christianity and Islam,

27:12.020 --> 27:18.260
but there's also a resurgence of neo-paganism, you know, witches are all the rage right now.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.420
So that sort of thing.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.780
But then also, you know, there's still talk about the meaning crisis and that sort of

27:22.780 --> 27:23.780
thing.

27:23.780 --> 27:27.660
And so people are, you know, kind of desperate for that meaning and that connection, particularly

27:27.660 --> 27:31.260
when you think about the fact that we're in the middle of a loneliness epidemic.

27:31.260 --> 27:35.740
So the need for culture, community and spirituality and connection are also going to be persistent

27:35.740 --> 27:37.860
and those are presently underserved needs.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.640
I've been a big fan of the book, The Status Game, by William Store and so one thing that

27:42.640 --> 27:49.200
I realized is, or one question that I get is, okay, well, if you can't make money and

27:49.200 --> 27:54.320
therefore you can't, you know, build up your social status through conspicuous consumption,

27:54.320 --> 27:55.320
what do we do?

27:55.320 --> 27:58.480
Well, there's lots of other ways to build up status.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.280
You can get famous on YouTube.

28:00.280 --> 28:04.040
You can, you know, go to the gym and get a sexy body.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.720
You can become a chess grandmaster.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.540
There's all kinds of things that you can do.

28:08.540 --> 28:10.660
You can become a musician.

28:10.660 --> 28:17.020
Social status throughout history has been largely predicated on other things other than wealth.

28:17.020 --> 28:22.500
Wealth as a social status is a relatively new phenomenon, particularly under capitalism

28:22.500 --> 28:27.340
and neoliberalism, where you incentivize people to accumulate more wealth because against

28:27.340 --> 28:30.620
conspicuous consumption is one of the best ways to signal status.

28:30.620 --> 28:34.100
But there are plenty of other ways to signal status.

28:34.100 --> 28:40.680
Through education, piety, spirituality, intellectual pursuits, physical pursuits like athleticism.

28:40.680 --> 28:44.880
Again, that's why I picked this image of a bunch of attractive young people laying on

28:44.880 --> 28:45.880
the beach.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.880
Why?

28:46.880 --> 28:49.320
Because part of what's happening in this image is status.

28:49.320 --> 28:53.520
They're signaling their status by literally showing off their bodies is that's one thing

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
that people do.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.920
And if you ever go to the gym, there are people that do that, boys and girls, men and women

28:57.920 --> 29:01.440
will show off their bodies at the gym and that's part of why they're doing it is because

29:01.440 --> 29:02.440
it makes them feel good.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.380
They go to the gym and they're like, I'm shredded, I look really good.

29:06.380 --> 29:12.780
So anyways, I do suspect that as people come to understand this, that a status economy

29:12.780 --> 29:15.620
is going to replace the attention economy.

29:15.620 --> 29:20.060
And we already see this like YouTubers and other influencers that have more subscribers

29:20.060 --> 29:24.100
are like, ah, well, I've got five times as subscribers that you do so therefore I'm better.

29:24.100 --> 29:29.780
So like it's a popularity contest, but that is a proxy for the status contest.

29:29.780 --> 29:35.120
Now this is the biggest thing that scares me is and this is what I actually am really

29:35.120 --> 29:39.240
interested in talking to more people about is forming a new social contract.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.960
So the current social contract is around a three-way relationship between the government.

29:43.960 --> 29:48.200
So we got Uncle Sam here and then we got the corporate fat cats and then we've got ordinary

29:48.200 --> 29:50.200
people.

29:50.200 --> 29:57.440
So right now, Uncle Sam, the government mediates the relationship between the businesses and

29:57.440 --> 30:00.100
the people, the labor workforce.

30:00.100 --> 30:04.580
But if the demand for labor goes away, then suddenly the government and businesses are

30:04.580 --> 30:09.740
holding all the cards and that's a surefire way to get a dystopian hellscape.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.380
So how do we do that?

30:11.380 --> 30:13.260
How do we navigate and fix it?

30:13.260 --> 30:16.420
First, we need to rebalance power.

30:16.420 --> 30:22.700
This means that we need to shift the priority away from businesses and more towards people

30:22.700 --> 30:26.500
and government, particularly voter power.

30:26.500 --> 30:32.880
And we'll do this through shoring up democratic institutions such as voter reforms, increasing

30:32.880 --> 30:41.240
civic engagement, adding new levers of power that citizens have in terms of steering the

30:41.240 --> 30:46.360
government and ensuring that the government serves the people as much if not more than

30:46.360 --> 30:47.360
businesses.

30:47.360 --> 30:52.080
We'll need some sort of redistribution mechanisms and honestly having some sort of redistribution

30:52.080 --> 30:57.660
behooves the businesses because again, if aggregate consumer demand goes down, that's

30:57.660 --> 30:59.660
bad for business.

30:59.660 --> 31:02.300
If your customers are all broke, that's no good.

31:02.300 --> 31:06.540
So we'll need to make sure that consumers have money to spend in order to keep the economy

31:06.540 --> 31:12.060
going and pretty much some sort of redistribution, whether it's negative income tax or UBI or

31:12.060 --> 31:16.900
universal basic services, we'll need something.

31:16.900 --> 31:22.280
The way that I articulated it mathematically is if wealth and income inequality and gradients

31:22.280 --> 31:25.240
are too steep, then you can't go uphill.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.480
You can't go uphill forever.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.680
And this will also require some kind of regulatory overhaul.

31:30.680 --> 31:35.080
Now there are a lot of tools in the toolbox in terms of fiscal policy and monetary policy

31:35.080 --> 31:36.920
that are already available.

31:36.920 --> 31:42.200
So what I suspect is going to happen is that the establishment is going to do very small

31:42.200 --> 31:44.680
incremental changes across the board.

31:44.680 --> 31:49.740
It's not going to be one big policy, it's going to be dozens if not hundreds of little

31:49.740 --> 31:57.980
incremental policy changes on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual basis to adjust slowly because

31:57.980 --> 32:00.340
again, law of unintended consequences.

32:00.340 --> 32:05.300
If you change too many things at once, you might end up making things worse, which would

32:05.300 --> 32:07.060
be bad.

32:07.060 --> 32:12.180
So just as a recap on this whole thing, we're talking at the highest level about knowledge

32:12.180 --> 32:14.300
labor substitution.

32:14.320 --> 32:18.600
The four criteria that I give is better, faster, cheaper, safer.

32:18.600 --> 32:22.640
As machines and AI become better, faster, cheaper and safer than humans at knowledge

32:22.640 --> 32:27.760
work, one, there's no economic incentive to keep humans in those jobs.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.880
But then it could also be considered unethical to keep humans in those jobs.

32:31.880 --> 32:38.400
So for instance, if an AI doctor is better, faster, cheaper and safer than a human doctor,

32:38.400 --> 32:39.400
who are you going to go to?

32:39.400 --> 32:41.840
You're going to go to the robot doctor because the outcomes are going to be better and it's

32:41.840 --> 32:44.040
going to be cheaper.

32:44.040 --> 32:49.140
In that scenario, it might become unethical to allow humans to continue practicing medicine.

32:49.140 --> 32:57.460
Likewise, for driving, once we stick the landing on full self-driving and let's say that automatic

32:57.460 --> 33:05.860
cars can drive 10 billion miles per fatality or less, it might become illegal to allow

33:05.860 --> 33:09.540
humans to continue driving except in certain circumstances.

33:09.540 --> 33:11.980
So that's one thing to keep in mind.

33:11.980 --> 33:16.080
Reduced aggregate demand is going to be one of the major economic signals that we're

33:16.080 --> 33:20.520
going to be afraid of because if aggregate consumer demand goes down, the economy falters

33:20.520 --> 33:21.920
so on and so forth.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.040
So we'll need something to shore that up.

33:24.040 --> 33:29.360
Now again, the converse of that is price collapse might offset that.

33:29.360 --> 33:33.880
But that's two very powerful deflationary pressures, which we should expect to see some

33:33.880 --> 33:36.440
deflationary pressure because that's what technology does.

33:36.440 --> 33:40.320
It makes goods and services cheaper, but I don't think we're ready for how much cheaper

33:40.320 --> 33:42.660
some of those goods and services are going to be.

33:42.660 --> 33:47.340
So then I talked about primary needs, which is just first principle, look at yourself

33:47.340 --> 33:48.340
as an animal.

33:48.340 --> 33:53.020
What is it that you need and what are you willing to work or fight or whatever to get?

33:53.020 --> 33:57.500
That's food, water, clothing, housing, your basic fundamental needs.

33:57.500 --> 34:02.060
Status economy is going to be a big component of how this all shakes out in terms of our

34:02.060 --> 34:05.620
social living, how we live on a day-to-day basis.

34:05.620 --> 34:08.740
Some of these things like some of the goods and services that stick around will be about

34:08.740 --> 34:09.740
status.

34:09.960 --> 34:14.160
When I talk about status economy, I'm talking more about actually how we allocate our personal

34:14.160 --> 34:16.080
time and resources.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.480
We might spend more time at the gym.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.560
We might spend more time practicing piano, like that sort of stuff, and I'm talking

34:20.560 --> 34:21.960
about myself here.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.760
I was just like, I used to play piano as a kid.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
You know what?

34:24.760 --> 34:26.080
It might be time for me to pick that up again.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.080
Why?

34:27.080 --> 34:28.400
Because I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at it.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.040
I've completely forgotten it all because it was, I'm not going to say how long ago

34:32.040 --> 34:33.040
it was.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.720
It was a long time ago.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.800
New social contract.

34:35.820 --> 34:40.780
So negotiating a new social contract, honestly changing the narratives around money and around

34:40.780 --> 34:45.500
democracy is probably the hardest part of all this because as I said, we've got lots

34:45.500 --> 34:50.540
of, we've got lots of tools in the financial toolbox in terms of monetary policy and fiscal

34:50.540 --> 34:51.540
policy.

34:51.540 --> 34:55.780
However, in America, our narratives around the ownership class, around wealth, around

34:55.780 --> 35:00.460
privilege, around the elites, that is probably going to be the biggest sticking point honestly

35:00.460 --> 35:04.540
because a lot of people are temporarily embarrassed millionaires and so they're like, oh, we'll

35:04.560 --> 35:08.800
protect the millionaire class, protect the corporate class at all costs and it's like,

35:08.800 --> 35:09.960
they don't need any protection.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.520
They're fine.

35:11.520 --> 35:16.760
So we need to change the focus from the engines of productivity to us and I'm not talking

35:16.760 --> 35:22.480
about radically restructuring the entire economy, but you know, we need to change something.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.360
And then finally, as I already mentioned, deflationary pressures.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.200
So I don't need to rehash that.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.200
Thanks for watching.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.360
I hope you got a lot out of this video.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.880
Like, subscribe, so on and so forth.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.880
I'll see you next time.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.320
Cheers.
