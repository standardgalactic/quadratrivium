0	5000	Want to see an out-of-this-world true detective story?
5000	8000	Well, sharpen your wits and hop on your magic carpet.
8000	11000	You've got one, you know. Your imagination.
11000	13000	Your imagination.
31000	33000	Phantom invaders from outer space.
33000	35000	Master keys to nuclear magic.
35000	39000	Adventure, discovery, the greatest 50 years in the history of mankind.
39000	41000	But how do we package all that into a show?
41000	44000	It's very simple. We ask you're a magic screen.
44000	47000	I have. But when it's blank up here, it's blank up...
48000	50000	The magic screen.
50000	51000	Boing.
51000	53000	Maybe it isn't so blank up here.
58000	61000	Come on, magic screen, come up with something.
62000	66000	Here we are back in Mysteryland, ladies and gentlemen and men.
66000	68000	Oh, man, have we got excitement.
68000	70000	Great night, great night.
70000	74000	Everybody's got a detective story, candidate, egg in the Christie,
74000	77000	Earl Stanley Gardner, Dorothy Sears.
77000	80000	Everybody's got a candidate as the crowd mills around the famous
80000	83000	Academy of Detection Arts and Sciences.
83000	86000	And no wonder, being voted on tonight is the award.
86000	92000	The Edgar, it's called, for the best detective story of the first half of the 20th century.
92000	94000	Best detective story.
95000	97000	Ed, any word from the judges yet?
97000	98000	Take it away, Ed.
98000	100000	You can just barely see the judges.
100000	102000	Boy, are they sweating.
102000	103000	There they are.
103000	105000	This is an absolute bore.
106000	107000	These writers.
108000	112000	Mystery is mystery. On the first page, I know who did it.
112000	113000	Who done it.
114000	117000	You all recognize the chairman, Edgar Allen Poe,
117000	120000	whose murders in the room or won the first Edgar.
120000	122000	Nevermore, nevermore.
123000	125000	To his right, Charles Dickens,
125000	128000	who gave us one of the strangest detective stories ever penned.
128000	131000	The unfinished mystery of Edwin Drude,
131000	135000	and on the chairman's left is Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.
136000	139000	In that golden skull you see on the table,
139000	142000	that's the winner's prize, the coveted Edgar.
142000	143000	Of course.
143000	145000	That's it, that's us.
145000	148000	Gentlemen, what are you doing?
148000	151000	Most honorable judges, we have an entry for you.
151000	153000	Another entry, aren't we?
153000	154000	What's he talking about?
154000	156000	The contest is closed.
156000	160000	Well, how can it be when we've got the greatest detective story of the last 50 years?
160000	163000	The strange case of the cosmic rays.
163000	166000	A strange case of the cosmic rays.
166000	168000	An excellent title.
168000	172000	You realize, of course, the detective story has certain requirements.
172000	178000	Analysis, deduction, seemingly insignificant clues.
178000	179000	Great.
179000	182000	Our story begins with a clue so insignificant, Mr. Poe,
182000	185000	it wasn't even noticed for a hundred years or more.
185000	187000	The detective story is literature.
187000	189000	It must have scope.
189000	191000	Ha ha, scope, he says.
191000	193000	Jim, roll three.
193000	196000	Where the cosmic ray cases help to revolutionize the modern world.
196000	198000	Look, have a look.
200000	203000	Atomic power plants for the future.
204000	206000	Atomic subs.
206000	208000	Atomic planes.
209000	211000	Radioactive drug stores.
217000	219000	Isotopes for medicine.
219000	222000	And hold on to your hats.
229000	231000	How's that for scope?
231000	233000	Well, gentlemen, do we qualify?
233000	234000	Theodore?
234000	236000	No.
236000	239000	Science is for me a big bore.
239000	241000	A big bore?
241000	244000	Wait, do you realize that just while you were speaking,
244000	248000	the criminal in our case fired 20 atomic bullets through your head?
248000	250000	Good.
250000	253000	All's in the head I like.
253000	257000	And you traced this criminal through that tiny clue you spoke of?
257000	258000	Yes.
258000	260000	The story begins as an ordinary theft.
260000	263000	Theft from this simple electrical common instrument
263000	266000	that's been in use to detect radiation for generations.
266000	270000	It's just an airtight jar with an insulated metal rod
270000	273000	from one end of which hang two pieces of gold leaf.
273000	276000	Now, normally, they hang straight down.
276000	278000	Thank you, boy.
278000	282000	As every school kid knows, when an electric charge is put on the rod,
282000	285000	so the leaves become charged.
285000	289000	Now, as to the detection powers of the electroscope.
289000	294000	When radiation is from this piece of uranium, for instance, enters the jar,
294000	297000	the air inside is broken up into charged fragments,
297000	301000	some of which neutralize the charge on the leaves and cause them to fall.
301000	305000	And the stronger the radiation, the faster they fall.
305000	308000	What is this, a school room?
308000	310000	Where is the mystery?
310000	314000	Well, the mystery is that when a charged electroscope was put on the rod,
314000	316000	a charged electroscope was put aside.
316000	318000	When no known radiation was around,
318000	323000	the gold leaves mysteriously lost their charge and collapsed anyway.
323000	327000	The tiny clue, so, is leaking a little electricity.
327000	329000	That's a bank robbery?
329000	331000	That's just how science thought of it.
331000	333000	Bank robbery.
333000	335000	Roll for it.
335000	338000	Now, imagine the charged electroscope as a kind of bank
338000	340000	and the known radiations as thieves.
340000	342000	Bank robbers.
342000	344000	Yeah, there you are.
344000	348000	Depositors putting their hard-earned electrons into savings accounts.
348000	350000	Wait a minute.
350000	352000	That's no depositor there.
352000	355000	That's Miss Ultraviolet Ray.
355000	359000	She's one of the slyest of our robbers.
359000	362000	Lift the electrons right off your back.
362000	366000	Drop off and have a jolt sometime.
366000	369000	Don't you do it.
369000	372000	There's a distant cousin of Violet's over there, Gamma Ray.
372000	376000	Ordinary walls don't mean a thing to him.
376000	380000	Wow, here comes a real tough bunch in from the hideout.
380000	382000	The Uranium Gang.
382000	386000	Those hombres have been in and out of the Calibou so often they go by numbers.
386000	389000	234, 235 and 238.
389000	392000	Oh, 235's not carrying what I think he is.
392000	397000	You know, those boys are the atom bomb boys.
397000	399000	Help! Help!
399000	404000	Help! Sheriff! Robbery! Help!
404000	408000	They went that way!
408000	410000	Put on more guards.
410000	413000	This fevery has got to stop.
413000	415000	Rebuild the bank.
415000	417000	Put lead walls around it.
417000	419000	Nine feet thick.
419000	424000	So with nine feet around it, the Electroscope Bank became the fourth nox of science.
424000	429000	Not one of our robbers was sly enough like Ultra Violet.
433000	435000	Hey, thank you.
435000	438000	Or persistent enough like Gold Gamma.
441000	443000	Hey, thank you.
443000	447000	Or powerful enough like the numbers boys to break in.
455000	461000	No more breaking into my bank.
461000	463000	Help! Help!
463000	465000	Wait a minute. What's wrong now?
465000	468000	Mr. President, another robbery!
471000	475000	Brother, somebody has broken in.
475000	479000	Must be a phantom bandit.
479000	481000	A phantom bandit?
481000	485000	Get the town marshal, get the army, the navy, call out the Marines.
485000	488000	He must be caught.
496000	499000	That is literature.
499000	503000	Um, well, it's...
503000	510000	The point we're trying to make, gentlemen, is that just a few inches of lead would shield any Electroscope from all known radiations.
510000	513000	Even from the most powerful X-rays.
513000	520000	But this new radiation, why even lead walls nine feet thick, couldn't keep it from crashing through and collapsing the leaves.
520000	526000	That meant that some unknown super powerful ghostly radiation was loose in the world.
526000	528000	Where did this phantom come from?
528000	533000	The first guess was that it came from some new radioactive element in the earth.
533000	535000	But how to prove this?
535000	539000	A Jesuit physicist, Theodor Wolf, thought he had a way.
540000	558000	The Father Wolf reasoned, if the phantom radiation came from the earth, the higher you got in the air, the weaker it would be, and the slower it would discharge the leaves of an electroscope.
558000	562000	In 1910, the good father went to the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
562000	569000	He charged his electroscope, and then carefully measured how long it took the unknown radiation to steal the charge from the leaves.
574000	580000	Then he climbed and climbed and climbed, and at the top, a thousand feet above the earth, he recharged his electroscope.
580000	586000	Now, if the unknown radiation came from the earth, his electroscope should have discharged more slowly.
586000	590000	But it didn't. If anything, it discharged faster.
593000	600000	Father Wolf didn't know it, but his legwork was the start of one of the greatest chases in the history of science.
600000	611000	Other investigators, including Victor Francis Hess, decided that the Eiffel Tower just wasn't high enough, so in 1912, Hess borrowed a balloon from the Austrian Army.
611000	621000	Then he rose past Father Wolf's thousand feet, past 5,000, 10,000, 13, 14, 15,000 feet.
621000	628000	There, he charged his electroscope again, and he found that its leaves collapsed twice as fast as they did on the ground.
628000	634000	At 3 miles up, the ghostly radiation, instead of becoming weaker, was twice as strong.
636000	643000	This really threw the science-dicks for a loop. The phantom thief couldn't possibly come from the earth, so where did he come from?
643000	647000	What?!
649000	655000	Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, we're on the air. All the networks. Who gets the Edgar?
655000	659000	We are not ready yet. Put on a commercial. Go! Get out!
662000	668000	Your bandit is the sort of flying creature, then. A kind of atmospheric Batman?
668000	674000	That was the next guess, that the strange radiation originated somewhere in our own atmosphere.
674000	679000	The argument was settled when a famous American scientist, Robert A. Milliken, took up the chase.
679000	692000	Assisted by Ira Bowen, now director of the Palomar and Mount Wilson Observatories, Milliken built an electroscope that would time and record the discharge rate of the leaves and then charge them again automatically.
692000	700000	This is kind of an automatic mechanical bloodhound. Milliken's talkative bloodhounds, reporting back from balloons 50,000 feet above the plains of Texas.
705000	708000	And from the deep waters of two California mountain lakes.
712000	718000	Proved, beyond a doubt, that the rays could not originate in our own atmosphere.
718000	721000	But where were the rays coming from, then? The sun?
721000	722000	No.
722000	727000	Is bullets coming? It's easy. Mars.
727000	735000	No. The rays weren't coming from the sun, the moon, a planet, or any single star. Tell them why, doc.
735000	739000	Well, because observers on every part of the world reported the most curious thing.
739000	747000	The ghostly radiation was the same by night as by day, hitting each spot of the Earth continuously, with equal force from every direction.
748000	751000	They which meant they couldn't be coming from any single source.
751000	758000	And so the amazed detectives were confronted with super, super rays whose hideout was the biggest ever imagined.
758000	761000	The great open spaces of the entire universe.
761000	767000	As in Milliken, recognizing the extraordinary nature of these rays, christened them cosmic rays.
767000	769000	What?
773000	775000	He's becoming interesting.
775000	777000	What a pity.
777000	781000	Real phantoms, and out where no one will ever see them.
781000	785000	One needn't see a criminal to know him, Charles.
785000	794000	His dossier, fingerprints, footprints, methods of operation, mental quirks, often provide police with a more accurate picture than do the eyes.
794000	797000	A dossier on a ray?
797000	802000	That's exactly what the science detectives were trying to fill in.
802000	804000	A dossier.
804000	809000	Now, they'd already discovered the criminal's hideout, merely the whole universe.
809000	813000	All right then, how about physical characteristics?
813000	816000	Well, radiation can be either waves or particles.
816000	824000	Were the rays waves, weightless energy like ordinary sunlight, or solid particles of matter, tiny atomic bullets?
824000	831000	To find the answer to that one, in 1929, two German science detectives, Walter Bota and Werner Cole-Hurster,
831000	834000	rigged up a sort of a cosmic mousetrap.
834000	835000	Mousetrap?
835000	840000	I'll give you a quick version of the heart at least of their famous experiment with this modern equipment.
840000	844000	You mean how they found out whether cosmic rays were solid particles or waves?
844000	845000	That's right.
845000	847000	This I gotta see.
847000	850000	Now this is a bank of Geiger counters.
850000	856000	The two Germans knew that when electromagnetic waves like X-rays, ultraviolet rays, or gamma rays,
856000	864000	waves go through a Geiger counter, only about one in fifty of the waves going through could make the counter click.
864000	865000	One in fifty?
865000	866000	That's right.
866000	873000	While solid particles of matter, electrons, for instance, would make the counter click every time one went through.
873000	876000	Particles out click waves fifty to one.
876000	878000	That's just in one counter.
878000	882000	Well, by putting two banks of counters, one above the other, like this,
882000	889000	and wiring them so that waves of particles have to go through both counters before they can produce a click,
889000	891000	they had the answer.
891000	893000	They did?
893000	894000	Well, figure it out.
894000	900000	Waves with a fifty to one chance of causing a click in one counter, fifty to one,
900000	907000	have about a twenty-five hundred to one chance if they have to actuate two counters before they produce the click.
907000	910000	Worse than the daily double.
910000	917000	While solid particles, particles going through both counters, produce a click each time one goes through.
917000	920000	Okay, particles have it by twenty-five hundred to one.
920000	923000	But where does the mouse trap part come in?
923000	929000	Oh, the mouse trap is this thick slab of lead that's slipped in between the two counters.
929000	937000	So, now this lead is thick enough to trap all stray earthly radiation and stop it from reaching the lower counters.
937000	942000	But the hard-hitting cosmic rays go through it like a bullet through a cracker.
942000	952000	I'll switch on the mouse trap, and you can determine for yourselves if the cosmic rays smashing down into this room right now are waves or particles.
952000	960000	Remember, occasional clicking, waves, steady clicking, particles.
971000	973000	Particles? Amazing.
973000	981000	Yes, particles. What you are hearing are actual cosmic ray bullets, the same bullets that crash into all of us.
981000	983000	First rate detection.
983000	986000	And a second entry for the dossier.
986000	991000	The invader from outer space is a particle.
991000	998000	These particles is like breadcrumbs, dandruff, or vat.
998000	1002000	No, something far more fundamental than dandruff.
1002000	1008000	By particles, they meant the incredibly tiny bricks of matter that make up all atoms.
1008000	1013000	Ceiling wax, habitges, kings.
1013000	1017000	They're all built in three fundamental building blocks.
1017000	1021000	The lightest of which is the electron with a negative charge.
1021000	1025000	About 2,000 times heavier is the proton with a positive charge.
1025000	1029000	About the same weight as the proton is the neutron with no charge.
1029000	1032000	Electron, proton, neutron.
1032000	1037000	But which of these trons was the criminal from outer space? That was the question.
1037000	1041000	With only three suspects, it should have been easy to pin down the culprit.
1041000	1042000	Quite easy, yes.
1042000	1045000	Might have been. If a complication hadn't arisen.
1045000	1049000	Ah, a complication. Good construction, Phaedoc.
1049000	1056000	What if you found out, Mr. Poe, that the particles discharging electroscopes and making these Geiger counters click
1056000	1060000	were not the cosmic invaders from outer space at all?
1060000	1064000	What if you found out that they were the henchmen of the criminal?
1064000	1065000	Henchmen?
1065000	1067000	Well, maybe involuntary henchmen.
1067000	1069000	They're really called secondaries.
1069000	1074000	They're bits of air atoms shattered by the primary invaders as they crash into our atmosphere.
1074000	1076000	Which is a villain of your story.
1076000	1080000	I assure you, readers have no such trouble identifying my villains.
1080000	1083000	Take Fagan, for example, in all of a twist.
1083000	1087000	If you'll think of the character you're about to see as Fagan, maybe I can straighten you out.
1087000	1088000	Look out, Tom.
1088000	1091000	Now there you see the earth and its cloak of atmosphere.
1091000	1093000	A constant rain of cosmic particles.
1093000	1098000	Millions and millions and millions of them every second falls on the atmosphere.
1098000	1101000	Now let's take one particle and follow it down in slow motion.
1101000	1103000	And that is Fagan?
1103000	1105000	That's right. That's Fagan.
1105000	1107000	He's entering the earth's atmosphere now.
1107000	1110000	Those round things he's passing are air atoms.
1110000	1113000	The closer you get to earth, the more there are.
1113000	1115000	Now he's bound to hit one pretty quick.
1115000	1117000	Watch what happens when he does.
1117000	1118000	There.
1119000	1122000	Got a bad temper, Fagan has.
1122000	1124000	See those little guys taking it on the lam?
1124000	1127000	Those are the secondaries we were talking about.
1127000	1129000	Dozens of them.
1131000	1135000	Bits of air atoms kicked into violent action by a primary.
1135000	1138000	Ah, I see it now.
1138000	1141000	The primary culprit from outer space is Fagan.
1141000	1145000	And the secondaries from our own air are his henchmen.
1145000	1147000	You see, Fedor?
1147000	1149000	I see nothing.
1149000	1150000	Oh.
1150000	1151000	Right.
1151000	1153000	And another item for the dossier.
1153000	1156000	Ah, Fagan's dossier.
1156000	1159000	His MO, method of operation.
1159000	1161000	He works through henchmen.
1161000	1163000	This becomes interesting.
1163000	1166000	A mastermind operating through pawns.
1166000	1168000	Well, hardly pawns, Mr. Poe.
1168000	1172000	The henchmen themselves were soon found to be incredibly powerful,
1172000	1175000	possessing enormous energy and speed.
1175000	1177000	Additional entries for the dossier?
1177000	1180000	Uh, yeah, for the henchmen's dossier.
1182000	1187000	Because now the science detectives found they needed a second dossier.
1187000	1191000	And where do you think they got their entries for the henchmen's dossier?
1191000	1196000	Well, it seems that the henchmen leave footprints.
1196000	1198000	Footprints?
1198000	1203000	And they were detected by a, by a honey of a device, a cloud chamber.
1203000	1205000	Cloud chamber?
1205000	1209000	See here, Mr. Scientist, are you trying to tell us
1209000	1214000	that invisible cosmic criminals leave visible footprints
1214000	1217000	that perhaps even we might see?
1217000	1218000	Yes.
1218000	1220000	Sure you can.
1220000	1221000	Anybody can see them.
1221000	1222000	Right in his own kitchen.
1222000	1224000	Soft light, Doc.
1225000	1228000	Any kid can make this kind of a two-bit cloud chamber.
1228000	1230000	Look.
1230000	1232000	First you take a piece of dry ice.
1232000	1235000	Then a large-mouthed jar.
1235000	1238000	Set the jar on top of the dry ice.
1238000	1242000	Now, it's well to put a piece of black cloth in the bottom of the jar
1242000	1244000	so you can see the tracks better.
1244000	1248000	Now, take a piece of cardboard
1248000	1250000	and saturate it with alcohol.
1250000	1252000	Any kind of alcohol will do.
1252000	1256000	This that I'm using is just ordinary rubbing alcohol.
1256000	1261000	Now, take a hot iron.
1261000	1263000	Weak.
1263000	1266000	Heat on top, cold on the bottom.
1266000	1271000	Now you wait a few moments for the alcohol vapor to cool and settle.
1271000	1276000	Now, let's flash a light through that.
1276000	1280000	And...
1280000	1284000	There you are.
1284000	1286000	Cosmic ray footprints.
1286000	1288000	You can't see the actual flying particles,
1288000	1293000	but you can see their tracks.
1293000	1298000	Much as invisible high-flying jets leave their visible vapor trails,
1298000	1307000	celestial footprints which reveal the jet speed, height and direction.
1307000	1309000	Incredible.
1309000	1312000	Oh, I must do these trick for Tolstoy.
1312000	1314000	It will kill him.
1314000	1317000	I can't wait to try it on Will Shakespeare.
1317000	1319000	But it's my trick. I got it back.
1319000	1323000	Fascinating. But the vapor tracks all look alike.
1323000	1328000	How could the detectives tell which henchmen left which footprints?
1328000	1329000	Oh, yes, indeed, yes, yes.
1329000	1331000	Good question, Mr. Poe. White stock.
1331000	1334000	And the answer was simple but fascinating.
1334000	1336000	A U-magnet.
1336000	1338000	The kind kids pick up nails with.
1338000	1342000	As you probably know, Mr. Poe, between the poles of a magnet,
1342000	1345000	there's a magnetic field as indicated by these lines of force.
1345000	1350000	Now, the detectives knew that when a charged particle enters a magnetic field,
1350000	1356000	its path is bent by the field and bent at right angles to the lines of force.
1356000	1360000	Now, it's bent to the left if its charge is negative,
1360000	1363000	and it's bent to the right if its charge is positive.
1363000	1366000	Well, these scientific detectives reason,
1366000	1369000	if they were to put a cloud chamber,
1369000	1373000	this is a tiny model of a cloud chamber,
1373000	1377000	in the middle of a very powerful magnetic field,
1377000	1379000	the footprints would curve.
1379000	1383000	Exactly, Mr. Poe. The cosmic ray henchmen shooting through the cloud chamber
1383000	1385000	would leave curved footprints.
1385000	1394000	Then, by placing a camera here and photographing these cloud tracks,
1394000	1397000	the detectives had an ingenious way of identifying the henchmen
1397000	1401000	by analyzing their curved footprints.
1401000	1403000	This I like.
1403000	1408000	Now, for instance, as you'll see in these actual cloud chamber pictures,
1408000	1415000	this particle had a negative charge because its track curves to the left.
1415000	1419000	This track curves to the right so its charge was positive.
1419000	1422000	These are pictures of the actual henchmen, aren't they?
1422000	1425000	Not of the particles themselves, but of their vapor trails.
1425000	1428000	The footprints they leave behind in the cloud chamber
1428000	1432000	as they're pulled to the right or to the left by the strong magnets
1432000	1434000	outside the cloud chamber.
1434000	1437000	When the detectives began photographing the henchmen's footprints
1437000	1439000	in their elaborate cloud chambers,
1439000	1442000	now equipped with an ingenious triggering system
1442000	1446000	invented by PMS Blackett of England,
1446000	1449000	GPS Occhiellini of Italy,
1449000	1452000	measuring the amount of bending and the thickness of the tracks,
1452000	1455000	they discovered some astounding things.
1455000	1459000	The henchmen were traveling at unheard of speeds.
1459000	1462000	Speed. Wow.
1462000	1466000	Finally, from studies of thousands of cloud chamber photographs,
1466000	1468000	the henchmen were identified.
1468000	1471000	And who do you think they turned out to be?
1471000	1473000	Our old pals.
1473000	1478000	Electron, proton, neutron.
1478000	1481000	Those three building blocks of the universe.
1481000	1484000	Flying bricks of actual matter.
1484000	1486000	Just imagine, yes.
1486000	1490000	But remember, these energy-packed babies were only the henchmen.
1490000	1494000	Think what superpower Boss Man Fagan himself must have.
1494000	1496000	But who was this master criminal?
1496000	1498000	Yes, who?
1498000	1500000	That was the brain twister.
1500000	1503000	The sleuths had identified the gang, but not the leader.
1503000	1505000	But since he operated way up high,
1505000	1508000	there was a connection of air laid between them and Fagan.
1508000	1510000	How to get to him?
1510000	1512000	I'll give you eight to five. You'll never guess how they trapped him.
1512000	1514000	A woman, maybe?
1514000	1516000	Um...
1516000	1519000	Yeah, sort of a mother.
1519000	1523000	To put the finger on Fagan, they used Mother Earth.
1523000	1526000	Now, just one prokliata minuta.
1526000	1528000	Yes, Mr. Dostoevsky.
1528000	1531000	They actually did use the Earth to find out if Fagan was armed.
1531000	1533000	Mr. Dostoevsky carried an electric charge.
1533000	1536000	It was just a chunk of neutral matter.
1536000	1538000	Lights, please.
1540000	1545000	Now, this is a model of the Earth with its atmospheric shell.
1545000	1548000	This is the vast magnetic field of the Earth.
1548000	1551000	These wires represent the lines of magnetic force.
1551000	1555000	Now, the Earth's field, like any other magnetic field,
1555000	1558000	can bend the path of charged particles that move through it,
1558000	1560000	but not of neutral particles.
1560000	1565000	For instance, a neutral particle coming from outer space.
1565000	1567000	This is the solid particle.
1567000	1569000	This trailing tubes its track.
1569000	1572000	Now, this neutral particle, having no charge,
1572000	1576000	will shoot through to the Earth's atmosphere in a straight line,
1576000	1579000	as if there were no magnetic field at all.
1579000	1583000	So, if the space Fagans were neutral solid particles,
1583000	1586000	they'd be unaffected by the magnetic field,
1586000	1590000	and they'd crash into our atmosphere and ocean equally all around the globe.
1590000	1595000	And since each Fagan would create the same average number of henchmen,
1595000	1600000	the resulting henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth below.
1600000	1603000	Ah, yes. You see, if Fagan were neutral,
1603000	1606000	the henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth.
1606000	1608000	Eh, Charles, please.
1608000	1610000	I have ears. I can hear.
1610000	1611000	My big apartment.
1611000	1615000	Now, let's see what happens if Fagan is charged.
1615000	1618000	Ah, yes. Let's see what happens if Fagan is charged, yes.
1618000	1620000	If the incoming particles were charged,
1620000	1626000	now, let's let these little red balls and red tubes represent the charged particles in their paths.
1626000	1630000	If the particles coming in from outer space are charged particles,
1630000	1636000	their paths would be bent by the field, as you can see by these few examples here.
1636000	1642000	The degree of bending is greatest where the particles come in at right angles to the lines of force,
1642000	1644000	as they do here about the equator.
1644000	1647000	As a result, and this is a key point,
1647000	1653000	many of the particles coming in near the equator would have their paths bent so much
1653000	1656000	that they'd missed the shell of the atmosphere completely.
1656000	1659000	Look at this one, for instance, coming in at this angle,
1659000	1662000	being so strongly, radically bent that it's gone out
1662000	1665000	and hasn't come at all near our Earth's atmosphere.
1665000	1667000	So, to this one, coming in this direction,
1667000	1671000	and steaming out here again without ever getting near the atmosphere.
1671000	1676000	While at the poles, charge particles would be bent very little, if at all,
1676000	1679000	because they come in parallel to the lines of force.
1679000	1682000	Look at these, how straight the paths are,
1682000	1686000	compared to the curved paths of those near the equator.
1686000	1688000	So, if the Fagans were charged,
1688000	1693000	more of them would smash into our atmosphere at the poles than at the equator,
1693000	1699000	kicking more henchmen into action beneath them at the poles than at the equator.
1699000	1704000	And this so-called latitude effect could be measured by counting the number of collision pieces
1704000	1710000	that rain down on us at various latitudes at the bottom of our air ocean.
1710000	1712000	Lights, please.
1712000	1717000	Ah, the more henchmen below, the more Fagans above.
1717000	1719000	Excellent reasoning.
1719000	1722000	The reasoning was simple compared to the legwork.
1723000	1727000	For Operation Compa henchmen, the cap and gown private eyes
1727000	1730000	didn't just cover one street, one city, one county.
1730000	1734000	They blanketed the whole globe from pole to pole,
1734000	1737000	from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
1752000	1768000	Music
1768000	1772000	Sifted and evaluated, the data from this global legwork,
1772000	1774000	not counting the professorial bunions,
1774000	1779000	plainly showed that for every hundred henchmen particles hitting the earth at the poles,
1780000	1782000	only 87 struck at the equator.
1782000	1787000	Now that meant there were more Fagans at the poles than at the equator.
1787000	1790000	There was a latitude effect.
1790000	1794000	And that could only mean that at least some of the space invaders were charged.
1794000	1796000	The detectives were closing in.
1796000	1799000	The master crook was armed with an electric charge.
1799000	1802000	That means Fagans couldn't be a neutron.
1802000	1805000	Right, Mr. Poe, a neutron has no charge.
1805000	1808000	Then he must be a proton or an electron.
1808000	1812000	One hundred roubles, says Fagans, is a proton.
1812000	1816000	Covered with two pounds, my friend, I say he's an electron.
1816000	1817000	Three pounds.
1817000	1818000	It takes three pounds.
1818000	1819000	Two theta, two.
1819000	1822000	Well, well, well, we'll soon know.
1822000	1827000	Now, Dr. Research, was Fagans charge positive or negative?
1827000	1828000	Yes, sir.
1828000	1832000	And wait till you hear how the learned hawkshaws solved that problem.
1832000	1835000	And with the earth again, go ahead, Doc.
1835000	1839000	Let's turn over our globe in its magnetic field
1839000	1843000	so that we're looking down on the south pole.
1843000	1848000	Now we already know that an incoming particle with a positive charge
1848000	1851000	would be bent to the right by the magnetic field
1851000	1854000	or to the left if it had a negative charge.
1854000	1858000	Well then, an Italian physicist Bruno Rossi
1858000	1861000	reasoned that if the cosmic rays were positive,
1861000	1866000	the earth's magnetic field would cause a majority of them to strike from the west,
1866000	1870000	smashing more henchmen into us from the west.
1870000	1875000	While if they were negative, a majority would strike us from the east.
1875000	1879000	And bingo, the missing clue came in from Mexico.
1879000	1881000	Yes, where three investigators,
1881000	1885000	Arthur Compton, T.H. Johnson, and Luis Alvarez,
1885000	1890000	reported conclusively more henchmen came in from the west.
1890000	1895000	That could only mean that at least some of the cosmic invaders carried a positive charge.
1895000	1898000	Vagan's charge was positive.
1898000	1899000	Mystery's clearing up, huh?
1899000	1900000	Clearing up?
1900000	1903000	It's like daylight is mystery for children.
1903000	1904000	Of course your story's over.
1904000	1908000	Of your three fundamental building blocks, electron, proton, neutron,
1908000	1910000	only one was positively charged.
1910000	1914000	Please, let me crush these excuse-the-expression starry tellers.
1914000	1917000	Now, you got neutron, no charge.
1917000	1921000	Electron negative, proton positive.
1921000	1923000	So, Vagan is proton.
1923000	1924000	Give me the money.
1924000	1925000	Not so fast, sir.
1925000	1926000	Why not?
1926000	1927000	No, wait a minute.
1927000	1929000	Wait, wait a minute.
1929000	1932000	Show him the positron still, doc.
1932000	1934000	Positron stills?
1934000	1938000	This is a photograph of a cosmic ray track taken in a cloud chamber
1938000	1945000	on the 2nd of August, 1932, by Professor Carl Anderson at Caltech.
1945000	1949000	Now, the light curve track seems to match the footprint of an electron.
1949000	1953000	But instead of curving to the left in the cloud chamber's magnetic field,
1953000	1958000	as a respectable electron should, this strange particle curved to the right.
1958000	1961000	His umpty-dumpty photograph, maybe.
1961000	1963000	Upside down.
1963000	1964000	Uh-uh.
1964000	1967000	That's one of the most famous photographs in science, Dost.
1967000	1969000	He got Anderson a Nobel Prize.
1969000	1974000	The first picture of the tracks of a hitherto unknown particle of matter,
1974000	1976000	a positive electron.
1976000	1978000	A particle.
1978000	1980000	Positively charged.
1980000	1983000	Why couldn't that be Fagan, Dosty, instead of your proton?
1983000	1985000	I move we reject the entry.
1985000	1987000	Second emotion.
1987000	1989000	Why, Mr. Poe?
1989000	1992000	By introducing a new suspect at this late date,
1992000	1995000	you have violated a cardinal rule of the detective story.
1995000	1997000	Yeah, it's cheating. It's my money.
1997000	2000000	But think of the impact of this discovery, Edgar.
2000000	2004000	It's as if your detective Dupin, searching for a human criminal,
2004000	2007000	ran across an unknown species of man.
2007000	2008000	It's astounding.
2008000	2009000	He's cheating.
2009000	2012000	A brand new kind of matter has been discovered.
2012000	2013000	Yes.
2013000	2017000	And a fourth henchman for Fagan.
2017000	2019000	The positron.
2019000	2020000	Bah!
2020000	2023000	What difference positron, proton, pimpelton?
2023000	2024000	This is useful?
2024000	2028000	His big doings about little nattings.
2028000	2030000	Now, wait a minute, Dosty.
2030000	2034000	Out of little nattings like this have come the big doings of science.
2034000	2039000	Newton wondering why an apple hit his hair.
2039000	2044000	Out of that came the law of gravitation.
2044000	2049000	Renton, in trying to figure out why his photographic plates got fogged,
2049000	2051000	came up with x-rays.
2051000	2055000	Oh.
2055000	2060000	Maxwell, tinkering with some tricky equations,
2060000	2063000	came up with a key to television.
2063000	2070000	And this chase after little particles is the key for something big?
2070000	2075000	Just about the biggest something man ever ran into, Mr. Dostoevsky.
2075000	2077000	Nuclear force.
2077000	2078000	Nuclear force?
2078000	2084000	That's big.
2084000	2085000	Nuclear force.
2085000	2087000	We've heard rumors about that.
2087000	2090000	Exactly what is meant by force.
2090000	2092000	That's a large order, Mr. Poe.
2092000	2095000	If I could answer that, I'd be ten Einstein's rolled in one.
2095000	2100000	But in general, by force, science means a strange, almost mystic quality
2100000	2102000	of power possessed by matter.
2102000	2105000	It manifests itself in three ways.
2105000	2112000	Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear force.
2112000	2114000	Oh yes, you see the three, yes.
2114000	2120000	Now in a sense, a force can be likened to an army.
2120000	2123000	Force exerts its power through individual units,
2123000	2127000	just as an army does through its individual units or soldiers.
2127000	2133000	With gravity, the force that holds the whirling planets in their orbits,
2133000	2137000	the smallest individual unit, the soldier that does this planet holding,
2137000	2140000	is said by some scientists to be the graviton.
2140000	2144000	Graviton has never been pinned down or observed in any way.
2144000	2146000	Now if we focus down to just one atom.
2146000	2149000	Not large bodies, but just one atom.
2149000	2151000	Helium, for instance.
2151000	2154000	Another force takes over.
2154000	2156000	Electromagnetic force.
2156000	2160000	Now this second force keeps the atomic solar system from flying apart.
2160000	2162000	And the electromagnetic soldier?
2162000	2164000	That's called a photon.
2164000	2170000	And unlike the graviton, this photon has been measured and directly observed.
2170000	2174000	Now if we go deep into the heart of the atom, into its nucleus,
2174000	2178000	we come to the third and most sensational force.
2178000	2180000	Nuclear force.
2180000	2185000	That's the force that holds the protons and neutrons locked in the tiny nucleus.
2185000	2189000	The awesome force man is now unlocking for his own use.
2194000	2200000	The force which will surely change the way of life for every man, woman and child on Earth.
2200000	2202000	And the soldier?
2202000	2204000	The soldier that does the holding of nuclear force?
2204000	2207000	That dramatically enough came out of the cosmic ray chase,
2207000	2209000	out of tracking down Fagan's henchmen.
2209000	2211000	Here's the way it happened.
2211000	2214000	And boy, this really rocked the science world.
2214000	2220000	In Japan in 1935, at Osaka University, a genius named Hideki Yukawa
2220000	2226000	sat alone with a pencil and a piece of paper, and he came up with a most amazing prediction.
2226000	2231000	He said that the soldier, the unit of this terrific new force, would appear, believe it or not,
2231000	2235000	as a small particle, a piece of actual matter.
2235000	2239000	He calculated it would be about 200 times heavier than the electron,
2239000	2245000	and get this, would live about a millionth of a second, then poof, it would disappear, die.
2245000	2249000	Well, this was just too deep even for the hybrows.
2249000	2253000	Yukawa's prediction dropped like a feather in the scientific pond.
2253000	2256000	But meanwhile, the cosmic ray chase was still going on.
2256000	2262000	Since the discovery of the positron, the scientific working stiffs were photographing cloud chamber tracks around the clock
2262000	2266000	to see if there were more new particles among Fagan's henchmen.
2266000	2269000	Well, up popped the devil.
2269000	2277000	Seth Netemire and Carl Anderson of Caltech and J.C. Street and E.C. Stevenson of Harvard
2277000	2280000	all came up with a new track at about the same time.
2280000	2282000	Uh, what is it?
2282000	2284000	A real oddball.
2284000	2288000	The track of a particle more than 200 times heavier than an electron,
2288000	2293000	and which, if you please, lives only a millionth of a second or so.
2293000	2295000	Yukawa's prediction.
2295000	2297000	Is nuclear soldier play of course?
2297000	2299000	No, doggoneit.
2299000	2305000	This strange new particle called a mumeison just didn't behave as Yukawa said it should.
2305000	2308000	It wasn't quite the nuclear soldier he predicted.
2308000	2312000	There was a bit of disappointment on Yukawa's prophetic face.
2312000	2315000	But there was no disappointment in the particle department.
2315000	2323000	The bug-eyed cosmic ray detectives realized that they'd stumbled onto another brand new piece of matter that no one ever dreamed existed.
2323000	2329000	And another henchman for Fagan's rogues gallery, the mumeison.
2329000	2333000	Then some ten years later came the happy ending, happy for the Japanese wizard.
2333000	2338000	It came from the developing tanks of a laboratory in the University of Bristol, England.
2338000	2344000	On photographic plates exposed on the tops of the Bolivian Andes and the French Pyrenees,
2344000	2349000	three astonished cosmic ray hunters, an Englishman, C.F. Powell,
2349000	2354000	an Italian, GPS Occhialini, and a Brazilian, C.M. Lattice,
2354000	2358000	ran across the track of a quite similar but heavier mason.
2358000	2362000	Eureka, this was it. This soldier did obey orders.
2362000	2367000	This newer particle, it's called a pi-mason, did seem to fit Yukawa's equations.
2367000	2372000	His amazing prediction came true, and he was awarded a Nobel Prize for it.
2372000	2375000	Now, Mr. Poe, I think I can answer your question.
2375000	2383000	Most people believe that the unit of nuclear force, the tremendously powerful soldier that holds the heart of the atom together,
2383000	2385000	is the pi-mason.
2385000	2387000	Mmm, pi-mason, yes.
2387000	2391000	And a sixth Fagan henchman got his name on the police blotter.
2391000	2394000	The pi-mason.
2394000	2399000	But weren't the detectives a bit confused by all these odd henchmen of Fagans?
2399000	2401000	Yes, I should think they would be, yes.
2401000	2404000	Confused? They were bewitched, bothered, and bewildered.
2404000	2408000	Yes, and they still are. Think of it. As late as 1932,
2408000	2413000	science had the universe all neatly wrapped up in three little basic packages,
2413000	2418000	electron, proton, neutron.
2418000	2422000	Just 25 years later, in 1957,
2422000	2427000	the number of separate and distinct particles of matter had jumped to at least 20,
2427000	2430000	including two really out-of-this-world babies,
2430000	2434000	the neutrino, a kind of ghost particle that leaves no footprints,
2434000	2437000	yet apparently zips through lead as if it were butter,
2437000	2439000	and the newly discovered antiproton,
2439000	2444000	which some people think is one of the building blocks of an unseen world,
2444000	2449000	a sort of left-handed world of matter matching the right-handed world we live in.
2449000	2455000	Yes, not to mention k-masons, tau-masons, hyperons, v-particles.
2458000	2461000	Observable deluge.
2461000	2465000	And no one knows how many more henchmen are going to show up,
2465000	2467000	or what they're going to mean.
2467000	2469000	They're crying for a-
2469000	2473000	for a Moses to lead them out of the wilderness of nuclear particles.
2473000	2475000	I say proton.
2475000	2478000	Yes, uh, yes. Well, what about the detective story?
2478000	2480000	What about Fagan? Oh, yes, yes.
2480000	2482000	Oh, they nailed Fagan, all right.
2482000	2485000	To do it, they went right up through the air ocean and took his picture.
2485000	2486000	His picture?
2486000	2488000	Well, perhaps impression is a better word.
2488000	2491000	Okay, doc. Impression.
2491000	2494000	With this new detection gadget,
2494000	2497000	it's a cosmic ray emulsion plate.
2497000	2500000	It's very much like an ordinary photographic plate, only it's more sensitive,
2500000	2503000	and it's got a much thicker coating of silver bromide.
2503000	2507000	Now, the aim of the science detectives was to get a flash of old Fagan on here
2507000	2510000	before he smashed into our air atoms.
2510000	2513000	Well, obviously, that meant going very high indeed,
2513000	2515000	way up almost to the top of our atmosphere,
2515000	2518000	where the population of air atoms is very scarce.
2518000	2523000	With these lightweight plates and a new kind of balloon named the Skyhook,
2523000	2525000	they did the trick.
2525000	2531000	Skyhooks quite easily carry instruments up to 140,000 feet or more
2531000	2533000	and can stay up there for several days,
2533000	2537000	during which time police switchboards buzz with flying saucer reports.
2537000	2539000	Ah, but it's with rockets.
2539000	2543000	Did we really take instruments up into Fagan's home territory?
2544000	2550000	Up to 150 miles,
2550000	2555000	up to where the emulsion plate is face-to-face with Fagan himself.
2555000	2557000	From dozens of rocket flights,
2563000	2567000	from literally hundreds of balloon launchings all over the world,
2573000	2576000	up to 150,000 feet.
2590000	2593000	A pretty clear picture of the master criminal
2593000	2597000	began to emerge after a king-sized chase of over 50 years.
2597000	2599000	Here's what Fagan looks like,
2599000	2601000	rather what his trail looks like,
2601000	2605000	as he smashes through the silver bromide on the photographic plate.
2605000	2608000	And this is what happens when Fagan hits one of the silver atoms
2608000	2610000	square on the nucleus.
2610000	2613000	Wait for wait, he's got the biggest sock in the universe.
2613000	2616000	The first to actually mug Fagan were some Chicago detectives.
2616000	2619000	Yes, a group of physicists headed by Marcel Schein.
2619000	2623000	From microscopic examinations of the tracks left in their emulsions,
2623000	2625000	they announced that most of the Fagans,
2625000	2628000	the primary rays from outer space, were protons.
2628000	2631000	Naked hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons.
2631000	2634000	Protons! I was right! Give me the money!
2634000	2636000	No, Fagan, not so fast!
2636000	2639000	Order! Order! Order!
2639000	2642000	Doctor, search me! I was right, no?
2642000	2645000	Only partially right, Mr. Dostoevsky.
2645000	2649000	In 1948, physicists from the universities of Minnesota and Rochester
2649000	2651000	found other primary tracks.
2651000	2655000	Too heavy, too highly charged to beat protons.
2655000	2659000	And the most numerous of these were made by naked helium atoms.
2665000	2669000	And in addition, the tracks of still heavier atoms were found.
2669000	2673000	In other words, the Fagans are really atoms, common familiar atoms,
2673000	2678000	stripped of their electrons and hurtling through space at unholy speeds.
2678000	2680000	Atomic bullets from beyond the beyond,
2680000	2683000	crashing into us with almost the speed of light.
2683000	2686000	And when he says crash, he means crash.
2686000	2689000	These cosmic ray babies crack into us
2689000	2693000	with energies of more than a million, billion electron volts.
2693000	2697000	More than five million times as strong as an A-bomb atom.
2697000	2699000	That's our space boy, Fagan.
2699000	2701000	And his identity?
2701000	2704000	Naked atom.
2704000	2707000	Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
2707000	2709000	My money.
2709000	2712000	But no more amazing than the detectives who tracked him down.
2712000	2715000	Are they going to say they actually know where he comes from?
2715000	2718000	Well, they've got one pretty good idea. Tell them about it, Doc.
2718000	2722000	Well, many scientists now think the cosmic Fagans are being spawned
2722000	2725000	continuously in our own galaxy, in the Milky Way.
2728000	2731000	They believe that all stars, including our own sun,
2731000	2735000	are constantly casting off particles into space through surface explosions.
2735000	2739000	And that these cast-off star particles, zillions and zillions of them,
2739000	2742000	gradually acquire their cosmic speeds and energies
2742000	2745000	by being bounced back and forth between galactic clouds.
2745000	2747000	Galactic clouds?
2747000	2752000	Yes. Our own Milky Way, which looks something like our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda,
2752000	2756000	contains not only billions of stars that spiral around,
2756000	2762000	but also millions of truly enormous galactic clouds composed of dust and gas.
2763000	2770000	These galactic clouds float and swirl through the Milky Way in all directions.
2774000	2778000	Sometimes they look black, and they obscure the stars behind them.
2780000	2784000	These swirling clouds apparently create gigantic magnetic fields.
2785000	2790000	The late Enrico Fermi, one of the great pioneers of modern science,
2790000	2793000	the Fermi suggested that within our Milky Way,
2793000	2798000	gargantuan badminton games go on, which the players of these huge magnetic fields,
2798000	2803000	and the birds are tiny, naked atoms which have been shot into space from erupting stars.
2803000	2807000	And the atoms are naked because the star heat is so intense
2807000	2810000	that atoms can't hang onto their satellites.
2810000	2814000	When such an atom is exploded into space from a star,
2814000	2818000	it will eventually collide with a magnetic field and bounce off.
2824000	2828000	It will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.
2828000	2831000	And years later, it runs into another space,
2831000	2837000	and it will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.
2838000	2841000	And years later, it runs into another gigantic field,
2841000	2843000	and is sent shooting off in another direction.
2847000	2852000	After a million years or so of this being batted back and forth,
2852000	2856000	these atoms, they're our phagans, and remember their numbers countless,
2856000	2859000	are kicked up to almost the speed of light,
2859000	2862000	and sent hurtling through our Milky Way in all directions.
2863000	2867000	The tiny dot which is our Earth moving through space
2867000	2871000	sails through this myriad of shooting particles,
2871000	2875000	and a tiny fraction of them crash into us as cosmic rays.
2877000	2880000	Gentlemen, do you realize what this means?
2880000	2886000	The phagans bombarding us from outer space are pieces of matter from billions of stars.
2886000	2891000	And since these space bullets are the same atomic particles we have on Earth,
2891000	2895000	that means the stars are made of the same stuff we're made of.
2895000	2901000	A part of the eggs you had for breakfast this morning could have come from Orion,
2901000	2904000	or from the Big Dipper.
2904000	2908000	And some of the carbon in this young lady's shining red hair
2908000	2915000	might once upon a time have been stardust from an exploded supernova,
2915000	2918000	or from the Southern Cross.
2918000	2922000	Why, you could almost say that in tracking down phagans,
2922000	2928000	the science detectives uncovered material proof of the oneness of the whole great cosmos.
2928000	2933000	Mr. Scientist, for eyebrows this could be exciting, maybe,
2933000	2938000	but what is meaning for common people who work, love, hate?
2938000	2941000	Yes, yes. What is the meaning for ordinary mortals?
2941000	2945000	Oh, a very big meaning indeed, Mr. Dostoevsky.
2945000	2950000	It's possible that how people work, love, hate has been,
2950000	2954000	and is even now being affected by cosmic rays.
2954000	2959000	It's possible that in the millions and billions of years they've been bombarding the Earth,
2959000	2964000	these cosmic space bullets could be partly responsible for evolution,
2964000	2970000	by causing mutations, sudden changes, as they smash into our reproductive genes.
2970000	2971000	My word.
2971000	2975000	Why, Dostoevsky, it's conceivable that your enormous writing talent
2975000	2978000	could be traced to some well-directed cosmic ray
2978000	2981000	hitting your great-grandfather in just the right gene.
2981000	2984000	My writing? Cosmic rays?
2984000	2988000	Do you realize what this would mean philosophically, Edgar?
2988000	2992000	The changes in living things may be controlled by the stars.
2992000	2994000	And still more significant, Mr. Dickens?
2994000	2995000	Yes.
2995000	2999000	Someday, out of the strange case of the cosmic rays,
2999000	3002000	out of this out-of-the-world detective story,
3002000	3006000	may come the answer to the great riddle of what makes the universe tick.
3007000	3009000	Well, gentlemen, how about it?
3009000	3011000	Do we get the Edgar?
3011000	3012000	Charles.
3012000	3013000	Yes, yes.
3013000	3014000	I make my vote now.
3014000	3015000	Yeah, I know.
3015000	3016000	Yet.
3016000	3018000	No, no, not yet.
3018000	3019000	Science is for people.
3019000	3021000	I thought it was just for long-hands.
3021000	3024000	I vote yes.
3024000	3025000	You do?
3025000	3026000	Yes.
3026000	3029000	A truly remarkable story.
3029000	3031000	Did you hear that?
3031000	3035000	An epic adventure of the human spirit, the mind of man,
3035000	3038000	daring to explore the unknown reaches of the heavens,
3038000	3043000	just to track down these tiny particles of star dust,
3043000	3045000	so packed with primal power,
3045000	3048000	they come winging with the speed of light,
3048000	3053000	celestial messengers from out where the morning stars sing together.
3053000	3056000	Good line, Charles. He's excellent poetry.
3056000	3057000	Yes, yes.
3057000	3059000	But what is the message they bring?
3059000	3060000	And why?
3060000	3061000	Huh?
3061000	3062000	What?
3062000	3066000	Gentlemen, we thank you for a saga of brilliant scientific accomplishment.
3066000	3069000	But as a detective story, and that's what we're judging,
3069000	3074000	as a detective story, your tale has a fundamental weakness.
3074000	3075000	Motive.
3075000	3076000	Motive.
3076000	3079000	Fedor, they've established no motive for their cosmic fagans.
3079000	3080000	But, Edgar.
3080000	3082000	Why do they bombard the earth?
3082000	3085000	Edgar, if they knew motive for cosmic rays,
3085000	3088000	they'd have answer to great mystery of creation itself.
3088000	3089000	I vote yes.
3089000	3091000	I vote no.
3091000	3092000	Their story's unfinished.
3092000	3093000	Charles.
3093000	3094000	You vote yes.
3094000	3095000	No?
3095000	3097000	You know, I'm reminded of Isaac Newton.
3097000	3099000	He's reminded. It's a good story.
3099000	3101000	Just a moment, Fedor. Just a moment, Fedor.
3101000	3103000	I haven't finished.
3103000	3107000	I'm reminded of Isaac Newton, perhaps the greatest scientific mind that ever lived,
3107000	3112000	and how he humbly described his monumental discoveries as,
3112000	3116000	now and then, finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell,
3116000	3119000	while the great ocean of truth lay before me.
3119000	3120000	Pebbles.
3120000	3121000	Pebbles.
3121000	3126000	Well, that great ocean of truth still lies undiscovered before you.
3126000	3129000	Briefly, Charles, how do you vote?
3129000	3134000	I vote we invite these gentlemen to come back in 50 years
3134000	3138000	to tell us what new chapters they've added to their cosmic tale.
3138000	3140000	Ah, excellent, Charles.
3140000	3141000	Most excellent.
3141000	3143000	And who will write these new chapters?
3143000	3146000	The young.
3146000	3152000	The inheritors of all the knowledge and culture of the ages.
3152000	3156000	Of all the dreams and hopes of those who went before us.
3156000	3159000	What an exciting time to be young.
3159000	3163000	Yes, and what a glorious opportunity to add demand's history
3163000	3167000	to harness these nuclear fires for man's use,
3167000	3169000	to accept the challenge of creation,
3169000	3174000	and to use the gifts God gave us to explore the grandest of all frontiers,
3174000	3176000	the universe.
3176000	3181000	But the more we know of creation, the closer we get to the creator.
3181000	3185000	Three cheers for Stardust.
3216000	3220000	The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program
