1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Want to see an out-of-this-world true detective story?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, sharpen your wits and hop on your magic carpet.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You've got one, you know. Your imagination.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your imagination.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Phantom invaders from outer space.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Master keys to nuclear magic.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Adventure, discovery, the greatest 50 years in the history of mankind.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But how do we package all that into a show?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's very simple. We ask you're a magic screen.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I have. But when it's blank up here, it's blank up...

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The magic screen.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Boing.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Maybe it isn't so blank up here.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on, magic screen, come up with something.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here we are back in Mysteryland, ladies and gentlemen and men.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, man, have we got excitement.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Great night, great night.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everybody's got a detective story, candidate, egg in the Christie,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Earl Stanley Gardner, Dorothy Sears.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Everybody's got a candidate as the crowd mills around the famous

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Academy of Detection Arts and Sciences.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And no wonder, being voted on tonight is the award.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Edgar, it's called, for the best detective story of the first half of the 20th century.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Best detective story.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ed, any word from the judges yet?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Take it away, Ed.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can just barely see the judges.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Boy, are they sweating.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There they are.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is an absolute bore.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These writers.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mystery is mystery. On the first page, I know who did it.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Who done it.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You all recognize the chairman, Edgar Allen Poe,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
whose murders in the room or won the first Edgar.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nevermore, nevermore.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To his right, Charles Dickens,

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
who gave us one of the strangest detective stories ever penned.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The unfinished mystery of Edwin Drude,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and on the chairman's left is Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In that golden skull you see on the table,

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that's the winner's prize, the coveted Edgar.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Of course.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's it, that's us.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Gentlemen, what are you doing?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Most honorable judges, we have an entry for you.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Another entry, aren't we?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's he talking about?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The contest is closed.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, how can it be when we've got the greatest detective story of the last 50 years?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The strange case of the cosmic rays.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A strange case of the cosmic rays.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
An excellent title.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You realize, of course, the detective story has certain requirements.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Analysis, deduction, seemingly insignificant clues.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Great.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our story begins with a clue so insignificant, Mr. Poe,

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
it wasn't even noticed for a hundred years or more.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The detective story is literature.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It must have scope.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ha ha, scope, he says.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Jim, roll three.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where the cosmic ray cases help to revolutionize the modern world.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Look, have a look.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Atomic power plants for the future.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Atomic subs.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Atomic planes.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Radioactive drug stores.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Isotopes for medicine.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And hold on to your hats.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How's that for scope?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, gentlemen, do we qualify?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Theodore?

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Science is for me a big bore.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A big bore?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait, do you realize that just while you were speaking,

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the criminal in our case fired 20 atomic bullets through your head?

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Good.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All's in the head I like.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And you traced this criminal through that tiny clue you spoke of?

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The story begins as an ordinary theft.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Theft from this simple electrical common instrument

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that's been in use to detect radiation for generations.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just an airtight jar with an insulated metal rod

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
from one end of which hang two pieces of gold leaf.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now, normally, they hang straight down.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you, boy.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As every school kid knows, when an electric charge is put on the rod,

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
so the leaves become charged.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now, as to the detection powers of the electroscope.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When radiation is from this piece of uranium, for instance, enters the jar,

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the air inside is broken up into charged fragments,

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
some of which neutralize the charge on the leaves and cause them to fall.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And the stronger the radiation, the faster they fall.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What is this, a school room?

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Where is the mystery?

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, the mystery is that when a charged electroscope was put on the rod,

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
a charged electroscope was put aside.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When no known radiation was around,

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the gold leaves mysteriously lost their charge and collapsed anyway.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The tiny clue, so, is leaking a little electricity.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's a bank robbery?

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's just how science thought of it.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bank robbery.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Roll for it.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now, imagine the charged electroscope as a kind of bank

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and the known radiations as thieves.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bank robbers.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, there you are.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Depositors putting their hard-earned electrons into savings accounts.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's no depositor there.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's Miss Ultraviolet Ray.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She's one of the slyest of our robbers.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lift the electrons right off your back.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Drop off and have a jolt sometime.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't you do it.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's a distant cousin of Violet's over there, Gamma Ray.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ordinary walls don't mean a thing to him.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wow, here comes a real tough bunch in from the hideout.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The Uranium Gang.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Those hombres have been in and out of the Calibou so often they go by numbers.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
234, 235 and 238.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, 235's not carrying what I think he is.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, those boys are the atom bomb boys.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Help! Help!

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Help! Sheriff! Robbery! Help!

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They went that way!

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Put on more guards.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This fevery has got to stop.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rebuild the bank.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Put lead walls around it.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Nine feet thick.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So with nine feet around it, the Electroscope Bank became the fourth nox of science.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Not one of our robbers was sly enough like Ultra Violet.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey, thank you.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or persistent enough like Gold Gamma.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hey, thank you.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Or powerful enough like the numbers boys to break in.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No more breaking into my bank.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Help! Help!

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wait a minute. What's wrong now?

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. President, another robbery!

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Brother, somebody has broken in.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Must be a phantom bandit.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A phantom bandit?

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Get the town marshal, get the army, the navy, call out the Marines.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He must be caught.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That is literature.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Um, well, it's...

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The point we're trying to make, gentlemen, is that just a few inches of lead would shield any Electroscope from all known radiations.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Even from the most powerful X-rays.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But this new radiation, why even lead walls nine feet thick, couldn't keep it from crashing through and collapsing the leaves.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That meant that some unknown super powerful ghostly radiation was loose in the world.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Where did this phantom come from?

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The first guess was that it came from some new radioactive element in the earth.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But how to prove this?

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A Jesuit physicist, Theodor Wolf, thought he had a way.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The Father Wolf reasoned, if the phantom radiation came from the earth, the higher you got in the air, the weaker it would be, and the slower it would discharge the leaves of an electroscope.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In 1910, the good father went to the foot of the Eiffel Tower.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He charged his electroscope, and then carefully measured how long it took the unknown radiation to steal the charge from the leaves.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then he climbed and climbed and climbed, and at the top, a thousand feet above the earth, he recharged his electroscope.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, if the unknown radiation came from the earth, his electroscope should have discharged more slowly.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But it didn't. If anything, it discharged faster.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Father Wolf didn't know it, but his legwork was the start of one of the greatest chases in the history of science.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Other investigators, including Victor Francis Hess, decided that the Eiffel Tower just wasn't high enough, so in 1912, Hess borrowed a balloon from the Austrian Army.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then he rose past Father Wolf's thousand feet, past 5,000, 10,000, 13, 14, 15,000 feet.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There, he charged his electroscope again, and he found that its leaves collapsed twice as fast as they did on the ground.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
At 3 miles up, the ghostly radiation, instead of becoming weaker, was twice as strong.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This really threw the science-dicks for a loop. The phantom thief couldn't possibly come from the earth, so where did he come from?

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What?!

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, we're on the air. All the networks. Who gets the Edgar?

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We are not ready yet. Put on a commercial. Go! Get out!

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Your bandit is the sort of flying creature, then. A kind of atmospheric Batman?

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That was the next guess, that the strange radiation originated somewhere in our own atmosphere.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The argument was settled when a famous American scientist, Robert A. Milliken, took up the chase.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Assisted by Ira Bowen, now director of the Palomar and Mount Wilson Observatories, Milliken built an electroscope that would time and record the discharge rate of the leaves and then charge them again automatically.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is kind of an automatic mechanical bloodhound. Milliken's talkative bloodhounds, reporting back from balloons 50,000 feet above the plains of Texas.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And from the deep waters of two California mountain lakes.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Proved, beyond a doubt, that the rays could not originate in our own atmosphere.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But where were the rays coming from, then? The sun?

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is bullets coming? It's easy. Mars.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No. The rays weren't coming from the sun, the moon, a planet, or any single star. Tell them why, doc.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, because observers on every part of the world reported the most curious thing.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The ghostly radiation was the same by night as by day, hitting each spot of the Earth continuously, with equal force from every direction.

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They which meant they couldn't be coming from any single source.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And so the amazed detectives were confronted with super, super rays whose hideout was the biggest ever imagined.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The great open spaces of the entire universe.

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
As in Milliken, recognizing the extraordinary nature of these rays, christened them cosmic rays.

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What?

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He's becoming interesting.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What a pity.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Real phantoms, and out where no one will ever see them.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
One needn't see a criminal to know him, Charles.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
His dossier, fingerprints, footprints, methods of operation, mental quirks, often provide police with a more accurate picture than do the eyes.

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A dossier on a ray?

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's exactly what the science detectives were trying to fill in.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A dossier.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Now, they'd already discovered the criminal's hideout, merely the whole universe.

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
All right then, how about physical characteristics?

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, radiation can be either waves or particles.

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Were the rays waves, weightless energy like ordinary sunlight, or solid particles of matter, tiny atomic bullets?

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
To find the answer to that one, in 1929, two German science detectives, Walter Bota and Werner Cole-Hurster,

207
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
rigged up a sort of a cosmic mousetrap.

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Mousetrap?

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll give you a quick version of the heart at least of their famous experiment with this modern equipment.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You mean how they found out whether cosmic rays were solid particles or waves?

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This I gotta see.

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Now this is a bank of Geiger counters.

214
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The two Germans knew that when electromagnetic waves like X-rays, ultraviolet rays, or gamma rays,

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
waves go through a Geiger counter, only about one in fifty of the waves going through could make the counter click.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
One in fifty?

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
While solid particles of matter, electrons, for instance, would make the counter click every time one went through.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Particles out click waves fifty to one.

220
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's just in one counter.

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, by putting two banks of counters, one above the other, like this,

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and wiring them so that waves of particles have to go through both counters before they can produce a click,

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
they had the answer.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They did?

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, figure it out.

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Waves with a fifty to one chance of causing a click in one counter, fifty to one,

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
have about a twenty-five hundred to one chance if they have to actuate two counters before they produce the click.

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Worse than the daily double.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
While solid particles, particles going through both counters, produce a click each time one goes through.

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay, particles have it by twenty-five hundred to one.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But where does the mouse trap part come in?

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, the mouse trap is this thick slab of lead that's slipped in between the two counters.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, now this lead is thick enough to trap all stray earthly radiation and stop it from reaching the lower counters.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But the hard-hitting cosmic rays go through it like a bullet through a cracker.

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll switch on the mouse trap, and you can determine for yourselves if the cosmic rays smashing down into this room right now are waves or particles.

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Remember, occasional clicking, waves, steady clicking, particles.

237
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Particles? Amazing.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes, particles. What you are hearing are actual cosmic ray bullets, the same bullets that crash into all of us.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
First rate detection.

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And a second entry for the dossier.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The invader from outer space is a particle.

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
These particles is like breadcrumbs, dandruff, or vat.

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, something far more fundamental than dandruff.

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
By particles, they meant the incredibly tiny bricks of matter that make up all atoms.

245
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Ceiling wax, habitges, kings.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're all built in three fundamental building blocks.

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The lightest of which is the electron with a negative charge.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
About 2,000 times heavier is the proton with a positive charge.

249
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
About the same weight as the proton is the neutron with no charge.

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Electron, proton, neutron.

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But which of these trons was the criminal from outer space? That was the question.

252
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
With only three suspects, it should have been easy to pin down the culprit.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Quite easy, yes.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Might have been. If a complication hadn't arisen.

255
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Ah, a complication. Good construction, Phaedoc.

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What if you found out, Mr. Poe, that the particles discharging electroscopes and making these Geiger counters click

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
were not the cosmic invaders from outer space at all?

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What if you found out that they were the henchmen of the criminal?

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Henchmen?

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, maybe involuntary henchmen.

261
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They're really called secondaries.

262
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They're bits of air atoms shattered by the primary invaders as they crash into our atmosphere.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Which is a villain of your story.

264
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I assure you, readers have no such trouble identifying my villains.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Take Fagan, for example, in all of a twist.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If you'll think of the character you're about to see as Fagan, maybe I can straighten you out.

267
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Look out, Tom.

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Now there you see the earth and its cloak of atmosphere.

269
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
A constant rain of cosmic particles.

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Millions and millions and millions of them every second falls on the atmosphere.

271
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Now let's take one particle and follow it down in slow motion.

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And that is Fagan?

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's right. That's Fagan.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He's entering the earth's atmosphere now.

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Those round things he's passing are air atoms.

276
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The closer you get to earth, the more there are.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Now he's bound to hit one pretty quick.

278
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Watch what happens when he does.

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There.

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Got a bad temper, Fagan has.

281
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
See those little guys taking it on the lam?

282
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Those are the secondaries we were talking about.

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Dozens of them.

284
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Bits of air atoms kicked into violent action by a primary.

285
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Ah, I see it now.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The primary culprit from outer space is Fagan.

287
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And the secondaries from our own air are his henchmen.

288
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You see, Fedor?

289
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I see nothing.

290
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh.

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Right.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And another item for the dossier.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Ah, Fagan's dossier.

294
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
His MO, method of operation.

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He works through henchmen.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This becomes interesting.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A mastermind operating through pawns.

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Well, hardly pawns, Mr. Poe.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The henchmen themselves were soon found to be incredibly powerful,

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
possessing enormous energy and speed.

301
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Additional entries for the dossier?

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Uh, yeah, for the henchmen's dossier.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because now the science detectives found they needed a second dossier.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And where do you think they got their entries for the henchmen's dossier?

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, it seems that the henchmen leave footprints.

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Footprints?

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And they were detected by a, by a honey of a device, a cloud chamber.

308
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Cloud chamber?

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
See here, Mr. Scientist, are you trying to tell us

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that invisible cosmic criminals leave visible footprints

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that perhaps even we might see?

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Sure you can.

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Anybody can see them.

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Right in his own kitchen.

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Soft light, Doc.

317
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Any kid can make this kind of a two-bit cloud chamber.

318
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Look.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
First you take a piece of dry ice.

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Then a large-mouthed jar.

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Set the jar on top of the dry ice.

322
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Now, it's well to put a piece of black cloth in the bottom of the jar

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
so you can see the tracks better.

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Now, take a piece of cardboard

325
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and saturate it with alcohol.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Any kind of alcohol will do.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This that I'm using is just ordinary rubbing alcohol.

328
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Now, take a hot iron.

329
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Weak.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Heat on top, cold on the bottom.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Now you wait a few moments for the alcohol vapor to cool and settle.

332
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Now, let's flash a light through that.

333
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And...

334
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There you are.

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Cosmic ray footprints.

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You can't see the actual flying particles,

337
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but you can see their tracks.

338
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Much as invisible high-flying jets leave their visible vapor trails,

339
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
celestial footprints which reveal the jet speed, height and direction.

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Incredible.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, I must do these trick for Tolstoy.

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It will kill him.

343
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I can't wait to try it on Will Shakespeare.

344
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But it's my trick. I got it back.

345
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fascinating. But the vapor tracks all look alike.

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How could the detectives tell which henchmen left which footprints?

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, yes, indeed, yes, yes.

348
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Good question, Mr. Poe. White stock.

349
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And the answer was simple but fascinating.

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A U-magnet.

351
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The kind kids pick up nails with.

352
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
As you probably know, Mr. Poe, between the poles of a magnet,

353
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
there's a magnetic field as indicated by these lines of force.

354
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Now, the detectives knew that when a charged particle enters a magnetic field,

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
its path is bent by the field and bent at right angles to the lines of force.

356
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Now, it's bent to the left if its charge is negative,

357
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and it's bent to the right if its charge is positive.

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, these scientific detectives reason,

359
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
if they were to put a cloud chamber,

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
this is a tiny model of a cloud chamber,

361
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
in the middle of a very powerful magnetic field,

362
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
the footprints would curve.

363
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Exactly, Mr. Poe. The cosmic ray henchmen shooting through the cloud chamber

364
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
would leave curved footprints.

365
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Then, by placing a camera here and photographing these cloud tracks,

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the detectives had an ingenious way of identifying the henchmen

367
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
by analyzing their curved footprints.

368
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This I like.

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Now, for instance, as you'll see in these actual cloud chamber pictures,

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
this particle had a negative charge because its track curves to the left.

371
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This track curves to the right so its charge was positive.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
These are pictures of the actual henchmen, aren't they?

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Not of the particles themselves, but of their vapor trails.

374
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The footprints they leave behind in the cloud chamber

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
as they're pulled to the right or to the left by the strong magnets

376
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
outside the cloud chamber.

377
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
When the detectives began photographing the henchmen's footprints

378
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in their elaborate cloud chambers,

379
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
now equipped with an ingenious triggering system

380
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
invented by PMS Blackett of England,

381
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
GPS Occhiellini of Italy,

382
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
measuring the amount of bending and the thickness of the tracks,

383
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
they discovered some astounding things.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The henchmen were traveling at unheard of speeds.

385
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Speed. Wow.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Finally, from studies of thousands of cloud chamber photographs,

387
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the henchmen were identified.

388
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And who do you think they turned out to be?

389
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Our old pals.

390
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Electron, proton, neutron.

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Those three building blocks of the universe.

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Flying bricks of actual matter.

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Just imagine, yes.

394
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But remember, these energy-packed babies were only the henchmen.

395
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Think what superpower Boss Man Fagan himself must have.

396
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But who was this master criminal?

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes, who?

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That was the brain twister.

399
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The sleuths had identified the gang, but not the leader.

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But since he operated way up high,

401
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
there was a connection of air laid between them and Fagan.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How to get to him?

403
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll give you eight to five. You'll never guess how they trapped him.

404
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
A woman, maybe?

405
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Um...

406
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, sort of a mother.

407
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
To put the finger on Fagan, they used Mother Earth.

408
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Now, just one prokliata minuta.

409
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes, Mr. Dostoevsky.

410
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They actually did use the Earth to find out if Fagan was armed.

411
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Mr. Dostoevsky carried an electric charge.

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It was just a chunk of neutral matter.

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Lights, please.

414
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Now, this is a model of the Earth with its atmospheric shell.

415
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is the vast magnetic field of the Earth.

416
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
These wires represent the lines of magnetic force.

417
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Now, the Earth's field, like any other magnetic field,

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
can bend the path of charged particles that move through it,

419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but not of neutral particles.

420
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
For instance, a neutral particle coming from outer space.

421
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
This is the solid particle.

422
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This trailing tubes its track.

423
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Now, this neutral particle, having no charge,

424
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
will shoot through to the Earth's atmosphere in a straight line,

425
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
as if there were no magnetic field at all.

426
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So, if the space Fagans were neutral solid particles,

427
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
they'd be unaffected by the magnetic field,

428
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and they'd crash into our atmosphere and ocean equally all around the globe.

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And since each Fagan would create the same average number of henchmen,

430
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the resulting henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth below.

431
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Ah, yes. You see, if Fagan were neutral,

432
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth.

433
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Eh, Charles, please.

434
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I have ears. I can hear.

435
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
My big apartment.

436
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Now, let's see what happens if Fagan is charged.

437
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ah, yes. Let's see what happens if Fagan is charged, yes.

438
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If the incoming particles were charged,

439
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
now, let's let these little red balls and red tubes represent the charged particles in their paths.

440
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
If the particles coming in from outer space are charged particles,

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
their paths would be bent by the field, as you can see by these few examples here.

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The degree of bending is greatest where the particles come in at right angles to the lines of force,

443
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
as they do here about the equator.

444
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
As a result, and this is a key point,

445
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
many of the particles coming in near the equator would have their paths bent so much

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that they'd missed the shell of the atmosphere completely.

447
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Look at this one, for instance, coming in at this angle,

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
being so strongly, radically bent that it's gone out

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and hasn't come at all near our Earth's atmosphere.

450
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So, to this one, coming in this direction,

451
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and steaming out here again without ever getting near the atmosphere.

452
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
While at the poles, charge particles would be bent very little, if at all,

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
because they come in parallel to the lines of force.

454
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Look at these, how straight the paths are,

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
compared to the curved paths of those near the equator.

456
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So, if the Fagans were charged,

457
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
more of them would smash into our atmosphere at the poles than at the equator,

458
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
kicking more henchmen into action beneath them at the poles than at the equator.

459
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And this so-called latitude effect could be measured by counting the number of collision pieces

460
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
that rain down on us at various latitudes at the bottom of our air ocean.

461
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Lights, please.

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Ah, the more henchmen below, the more Fagans above.

463
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Excellent reasoning.

464
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The reasoning was simple compared to the legwork.

465
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
For Operation Compa henchmen, the cap and gown private eyes

466
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
didn't just cover one street, one city, one county.

467
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They blanketed the whole globe from pole to pole,

468
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.

469
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Music

470
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Sifted and evaluated, the data from this global legwork,

471
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
not counting the professorial bunions,

472
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
plainly showed that for every hundred henchmen particles hitting the earth at the poles,

473
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
only 87 struck at the equator.

474
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Now that meant there were more Fagans at the poles than at the equator.

475
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
There was a latitude effect.

476
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And that could only mean that at least some of the space invaders were charged.

477
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The detectives were closing in.

478
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The master crook was armed with an electric charge.

479
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That means Fagans couldn't be a neutron.

480
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Right, Mr. Poe, a neutron has no charge.

481
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Then he must be a proton or an electron.

482
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
One hundred roubles, says Fagans, is a proton.

483
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Covered with two pounds, my friend, I say he's an electron.

484
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Three pounds.

485
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It takes three pounds.

486
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Two theta, two.

487
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, well, well, we'll soon know.

488
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Now, Dr. Research, was Fagans charge positive or negative?

489
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, sir.

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And wait till you hear how the learned hawkshaws solved that problem.

491
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And with the earth again, go ahead, Doc.

492
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Let's turn over our globe in its magnetic field

493
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
so that we're looking down on the south pole.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now we already know that an incoming particle with a positive charge

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
would be bent to the right by the magnetic field

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
or to the left if it had a negative charge.

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well then, an Italian physicist Bruno Rossi

498
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
reasoned that if the cosmic rays were positive,

499
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the earth's magnetic field would cause a majority of them to strike from the west,

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
smashing more henchmen into us from the west.

501
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
While if they were negative, a majority would strike us from the east.

502
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And bingo, the missing clue came in from Mexico.

503
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yes, where three investigators,

504
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Arthur Compton, T.H. Johnson, and Luis Alvarez,

505
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
reported conclusively more henchmen came in from the west.

506
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That could only mean that at least some of the cosmic invaders carried a positive charge.

507
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Vagan's charge was positive.

508
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Mystery's clearing up, huh?

509
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Clearing up?

510
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's like daylight is mystery for children.

511
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Of course your story's over.

512
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Of your three fundamental building blocks, electron, proton, neutron,

513
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
only one was positively charged.

514
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Please, let me crush these excuse-the-expression starry tellers.

515
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Now, you got neutron, no charge.

516
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Electron negative, proton positive.

517
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So, Vagan is proton.

518
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Give me the money.

519
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Not so fast, sir.

520
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why not?

521
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No, wait a minute.

522
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Wait, wait a minute.

523
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Show him the positron still, doc.

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Positron stills?

525
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This is a photograph of a cosmic ray track taken in a cloud chamber

526
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
on the 2nd of August, 1932, by Professor Carl Anderson at Caltech.

527
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Now, the light curve track seems to match the footprint of an electron.

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But instead of curving to the left in the cloud chamber's magnetic field,

529
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
as a respectable electron should, this strange particle curved to the right.

530
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
His umpty-dumpty photograph, maybe.

531
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Upside down.

532
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Uh-uh.

533
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's one of the most famous photographs in science, Dost.

534
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He got Anderson a Nobel Prize.

535
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The first picture of the tracks of a hitherto unknown particle of matter,

536
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
a positive electron.

537
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
A particle.

538
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Positively charged.

539
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Why couldn't that be Fagan, Dosty, instead of your proton?

540
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I move we reject the entry.

541
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Second emotion.

542
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Why, Mr. Poe?

543
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
By introducing a new suspect at this late date,

544
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
you have violated a cardinal rule of the detective story.

545
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, it's cheating. It's my money.

546
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But think of the impact of this discovery, Edgar.

547
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's as if your detective Dupin, searching for a human criminal,

548
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
ran across an unknown species of man.

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's astounding.

550
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He's cheating.

551
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
A brand new kind of matter has been discovered.

552
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes.

553
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And a fourth henchman for Fagan.

554
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The positron.

555
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Bah!

556
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What difference positron, proton, pimpelton?

557
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is useful?

558
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
His big doings about little nattings.

559
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Now, wait a minute, Dosty.

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Out of little nattings like this have come the big doings of science.

561
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Newton wondering why an apple hit his hair.

562
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Out of that came the law of gravitation.

563
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Renton, in trying to figure out why his photographic plates got fogged,

564
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
came up with x-rays.

565
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh.

566
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Maxwell, tinkering with some tricky equations,

567
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
came up with a key to television.

568
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And this chase after little particles is the key for something big?

569
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Just about the biggest something man ever ran into, Mr. Dostoevsky.

570
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Nuclear force.

571
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Nuclear force?

572
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's big.

573
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Nuclear force.

574
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We've heard rumors about that.

575
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Exactly what is meant by force.

576
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's a large order, Mr. Poe.

577
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
If I could answer that, I'd be ten Einstein's rolled in one.

578
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But in general, by force, science means a strange, almost mystic quality

579
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
of power possessed by matter.

580
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It manifests itself in three ways.

581
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear force.

582
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh yes, you see the three, yes.

583
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Now in a sense, a force can be likened to an army.

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Force exerts its power through individual units,

585
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
just as an army does through its individual units or soldiers.

586
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
With gravity, the force that holds the whirling planets in their orbits,

587
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
the smallest individual unit, the soldier that does this planet holding,

588
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
is said by some scientists to be the graviton.

589
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Graviton has never been pinned down or observed in any way.

590
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Now if we focus down to just one atom.

591
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Not large bodies, but just one atom.

592
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Helium, for instance.

593
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Another force takes over.

594
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Electromagnetic force.

595
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Now this second force keeps the atomic solar system from flying apart.

596
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And the electromagnetic soldier?

597
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That's called a photon.

598
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And unlike the graviton, this photon has been measured and directly observed.

599
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Now if we go deep into the heart of the atom, into its nucleus,

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
we come to the third and most sensational force.

601
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Nuclear force.

602
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's the force that holds the protons and neutrons locked in the tiny nucleus.

603
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The awesome force man is now unlocking for his own use.

604
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The force which will surely change the way of life for every man, woman and child on Earth.

605
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And the soldier?

606
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The soldier that does the holding of nuclear force?

607
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That dramatically enough came out of the cosmic ray chase,

608
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
out of tracking down Fagan's henchmen.

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Here's the way it happened.

610
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And boy, this really rocked the science world.

611
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In Japan in 1935, at Osaka University, a genius named Hideki Yukawa

612
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
sat alone with a pencil and a piece of paper, and he came up with a most amazing prediction.

613
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
He said that the soldier, the unit of this terrific new force, would appear, believe it or not,

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
as a small particle, a piece of actual matter.

615
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
He calculated it would be about 200 times heavier than the electron,

616
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and get this, would live about a millionth of a second, then poof, it would disappear, die.

617
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, this was just too deep even for the hybrows.

618
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yukawa's prediction dropped like a feather in the scientific pond.

619
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But meanwhile, the cosmic ray chase was still going on.

620
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Since the discovery of the positron, the scientific working stiffs were photographing cloud chamber tracks around the clock

621
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to see if there were more new particles among Fagan's henchmen.

622
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, up popped the devil.

623
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Seth Netemire and Carl Anderson of Caltech and J.C. Street and E.C. Stevenson of Harvard

624
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
all came up with a new track at about the same time.

625
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Uh, what is it?

626
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A real oddball.

627
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The track of a particle more than 200 times heavier than an electron,

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and which, if you please, lives only a millionth of a second or so.

629
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yukawa's prediction.

630
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Is nuclear soldier play of course?

631
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
No, doggoneit.

632
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This strange new particle called a mumeison just didn't behave as Yukawa said it should.

633
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It wasn't quite the nuclear soldier he predicted.

634
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
There was a bit of disappointment on Yukawa's prophetic face.

635
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But there was no disappointment in the particle department.

636
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The bug-eyed cosmic ray detectives realized that they'd stumbled onto another brand new piece of matter that no one ever dreamed existed.

637
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And another henchman for Fagan's rogues gallery, the mumeison.

638
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Then some ten years later came the happy ending, happy for the Japanese wizard.

639
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It came from the developing tanks of a laboratory in the University of Bristol, England.

640
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
On photographic plates exposed on the tops of the Bolivian Andes and the French Pyrenees,

641
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
three astonished cosmic ray hunters, an Englishman, C.F. Powell,

642
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
an Italian, GPS Occhialini, and a Brazilian, C.M. Lattice,

643
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
ran across the track of a quite similar but heavier mason.

644
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Eureka, this was it. This soldier did obey orders.

645
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This newer particle, it's called a pi-mason, did seem to fit Yukawa's equations.

646
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
His amazing prediction came true, and he was awarded a Nobel Prize for it.

647
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Now, Mr. Poe, I think I can answer your question.

648
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Most people believe that the unit of nuclear force, the tremendously powerful soldier that holds the heart of the atom together,

649
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
is the pi-mason.

650
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Mmm, pi-mason, yes.

651
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And a sixth Fagan henchman got his name on the police blotter.

652
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The pi-mason.

653
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But weren't the detectives a bit confused by all these odd henchmen of Fagans?

654
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yes, I should think they would be, yes.

655
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Confused? They were bewitched, bothered, and bewildered.

656
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes, and they still are. Think of it. As late as 1932,

657
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
science had the universe all neatly wrapped up in three little basic packages,

658
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
electron, proton, neutron.

659
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Just 25 years later, in 1957,

660
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
the number of separate and distinct particles of matter had jumped to at least 20,

661
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
including two really out-of-this-world babies,

662
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
the neutrino, a kind of ghost particle that leaves no footprints,

663
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
yet apparently zips through lead as if it were butter,

664
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and the newly discovered antiproton,

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
which some people think is one of the building blocks of an unseen world,

666
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
a sort of left-handed world of matter matching the right-handed world we live in.

667
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yes, not to mention k-masons, tau-masons, hyperons, v-particles.

668
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Observable deluge.

669
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And no one knows how many more henchmen are going to show up,

670
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
or what they're going to mean.

671
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They're crying for a-

672
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
for a Moses to lead them out of the wilderness of nuclear particles.

673
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I say proton.

674
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes, uh, yes. Well, what about the detective story?

675
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What about Fagan? Oh, yes, yes.

676
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh, they nailed Fagan, all right.

677
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
To do it, they went right up through the air ocean and took his picture.

678
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
His picture?

679
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, perhaps impression is a better word.

680
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay, doc. Impression.

681
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
With this new detection gadget,

682
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
it's a cosmic ray emulsion plate.

683
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's very much like an ordinary photographic plate, only it's more sensitive,

684
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and it's got a much thicker coating of silver bromide.

685
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Now, the aim of the science detectives was to get a flash of old Fagan on here

686
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
before he smashed into our air atoms.

687
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, obviously, that meant going very high indeed,

688
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
way up almost to the top of our atmosphere,

689
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
where the population of air atoms is very scarce.

690
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
With these lightweight plates and a new kind of balloon named the Skyhook,

691
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
they did the trick.

692
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Skyhooks quite easily carry instruments up to 140,000 feet or more

693
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and can stay up there for several days,

694
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
during which time police switchboards buzz with flying saucer reports.

695
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Ah, but it's with rockets.

696
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Did we really take instruments up into Fagan's home territory?

697
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Up to 150 miles,

698
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
up to where the emulsion plate is face-to-face with Fagan himself.

699
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
From dozens of rocket flights,

700
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
from literally hundreds of balloon launchings all over the world,

701
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
up to 150,000 feet.

702
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
A pretty clear picture of the master criminal

703
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
began to emerge after a king-sized chase of over 50 years.

704
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Here's what Fagan looks like,

705
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
rather what his trail looks like,

706
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
as he smashes through the silver bromide on the photographic plate.

707
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And this is what happens when Fagan hits one of the silver atoms

708
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
square on the nucleus.

709
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Wait for wait, he's got the biggest sock in the universe.

710
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The first to actually mug Fagan were some Chicago detectives.

711
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yes, a group of physicists headed by Marcel Schein.

712
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
From microscopic examinations of the tracks left in their emulsions,

713
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
they announced that most of the Fagans,

714
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the primary rays from outer space, were protons.

715
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Naked hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons.

716
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Protons! I was right! Give me the money!

717
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No, Fagan, not so fast!

718
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Order! Order! Order!

719
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Doctor, search me! I was right, no?

720
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Only partially right, Mr. Dostoevsky.

721
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
In 1948, physicists from the universities of Minnesota and Rochester

722
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
found other primary tracks.

723
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Too heavy, too highly charged to beat protons.

724
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And the most numerous of these were made by naked helium atoms.

725
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And in addition, the tracks of still heavier atoms were found.

726
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
In other words, the Fagans are really atoms, common familiar atoms,

727
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
stripped of their electrons and hurtling through space at unholy speeds.

728
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Atomic bullets from beyond the beyond,

729
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
crashing into us with almost the speed of light.

730
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And when he says crash, he means crash.

731
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
These cosmic ray babies crack into us

732
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
with energies of more than a million, billion electron volts.

733
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
More than five million times as strong as an A-bomb atom.

734
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's our space boy, Fagan.

735
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And his identity?

736
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Naked atom.

737
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

738
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
My money.

739
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But no more amazing than the detectives who tracked him down.

740
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Are they going to say they actually know where he comes from?

741
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well, they've got one pretty good idea. Tell them about it, Doc.

742
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Well, many scientists now think the cosmic Fagans are being spawned

743
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
continuously in our own galaxy, in the Milky Way.

744
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They believe that all stars, including our own sun,

745
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
are constantly casting off particles into space through surface explosions.

746
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And that these cast-off star particles, zillions and zillions of them,

747
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
gradually acquire their cosmic speeds and energies

748
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
by being bounced back and forth between galactic clouds.

749
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Galactic clouds?

750
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yes. Our own Milky Way, which looks something like our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda,

751
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
contains not only billions of stars that spiral around,

752
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
but also millions of truly enormous galactic clouds composed of dust and gas.

753
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
These galactic clouds float and swirl through the Milky Way in all directions.

754
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Sometimes they look black, and they obscure the stars behind them.

755
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
These swirling clouds apparently create gigantic magnetic fields.

756
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The late Enrico Fermi, one of the great pioneers of modern science,

757
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the Fermi suggested that within our Milky Way,

758
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
gargantuan badminton games go on, which the players of these huge magnetic fields,

759
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and the birds are tiny, naked atoms which have been shot into space from erupting stars.

760
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And the atoms are naked because the star heat is so intense

761
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
that atoms can't hang onto their satellites.

762
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
When such an atom is exploded into space from a star,

763
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
it will eventually collide with a magnetic field and bounce off.

764
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.

765
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And years later, it runs into another space,

766
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and it will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.

767
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And years later, it runs into another gigantic field,

768
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
and is sent shooting off in another direction.

769
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
After a million years or so of this being batted back and forth,

770
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
these atoms, they're our phagans, and remember their numbers countless,

771
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
are kicked up to almost the speed of light,

772
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and sent hurtling through our Milky Way in all directions.

773
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The tiny dot which is our Earth moving through space

774
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
sails through this myriad of shooting particles,

775
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and a tiny fraction of them crash into us as cosmic rays.

776
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Gentlemen, do you realize what this means?

777
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The phagans bombarding us from outer space are pieces of matter from billions of stars.

778
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And since these space bullets are the same atomic particles we have on Earth,

779
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
that means the stars are made of the same stuff we're made of.

780
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
A part of the eggs you had for breakfast this morning could have come from Orion,

781
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
or from the Big Dipper.

782
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And some of the carbon in this young lady's shining red hair

783
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
might once upon a time have been stardust from an exploded supernova,

784
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
or from the Southern Cross.

785
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Why, you could almost say that in tracking down phagans,

786
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
the science detectives uncovered material proof of the oneness of the whole great cosmos.

787
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Mr. Scientist, for eyebrows this could be exciting, maybe,

788
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
but what is meaning for common people who work, love, hate?

789
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes, yes. What is the meaning for ordinary mortals?

790
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh, a very big meaning indeed, Mr. Dostoevsky.

791
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's possible that how people work, love, hate has been,

792
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and is even now being affected by cosmic rays.

793
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's possible that in the millions and billions of years they've been bombarding the Earth,

794
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
these cosmic space bullets could be partly responsible for evolution,

795
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
by causing mutations, sudden changes, as they smash into our reproductive genes.

796
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
My word.

797
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Why, Dostoevsky, it's conceivable that your enormous writing talent

798
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
could be traced to some well-directed cosmic ray

799
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
hitting your great-grandfather in just the right gene.

800
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
My writing? Cosmic rays?

801
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Do you realize what this would mean philosophically, Edgar?

802
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The changes in living things may be controlled by the stars.

803
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And still more significant, Mr. Dickens?

804
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes.

805
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Someday, out of the strange case of the cosmic rays,

806
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
out of this out-of-the-world detective story,

807
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
may come the answer to the great riddle of what makes the universe tick.

808
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Well, gentlemen, how about it?

809
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Do we get the Edgar?

810
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Charles.

811
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yes, yes.

812
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I make my vote now.

813
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, I know.

814
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yet.

815
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
No, no, not yet.

816
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Science is for people.

817
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I thought it was just for long-hands.

818
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I vote yes.

819
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You do?

820
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yes.

821
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
A truly remarkable story.

822
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Did you hear that?

823
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
An epic adventure of the human spirit, the mind of man,

824
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
daring to explore the unknown reaches of the heavens,

825
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
just to track down these tiny particles of star dust,

826
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
so packed with primal power,

827
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
they come winging with the speed of light,

828
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
celestial messengers from out where the morning stars sing together.

829
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Good line, Charles. He's excellent poetry.

830
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes, yes.

831
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But what is the message they bring?

832
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And why?

833
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Huh?

834
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What?

835
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Gentlemen, we thank you for a saga of brilliant scientific accomplishment.

836
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But as a detective story, and that's what we're judging,

837
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
as a detective story, your tale has a fundamental weakness.

838
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Motive.

839
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Motive.

840
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Fedor, they've established no motive for their cosmic fagans.

841
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
But, Edgar.

842
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Why do they bombard the earth?

843
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Edgar, if they knew motive for cosmic rays,

844
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
they'd have answer to great mystery of creation itself.

845
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I vote yes.

846
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I vote no.

847
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Their story's unfinished.

848
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Charles.

849
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
You vote yes.

850
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
No?

851
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You know, I'm reminded of Isaac Newton.

852
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
He's reminded. It's a good story.

853
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Just a moment, Fedor. Just a moment, Fedor.

854
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I haven't finished.

855
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm reminded of Isaac Newton, perhaps the greatest scientific mind that ever lived,

856
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and how he humbly described his monumental discoveries as,

857
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
now and then, finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell,

858
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
while the great ocean of truth lay before me.

859
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Pebbles.

860
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Pebbles.

861
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Well, that great ocean of truth still lies undiscovered before you.

862
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Briefly, Charles, how do you vote?

863
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I vote we invite these gentlemen to come back in 50 years

864
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
to tell us what new chapters they've added to their cosmic tale.

865
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Ah, excellent, Charles.

866
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Most excellent.

867
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And who will write these new chapters?

868
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The young.

869
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The inheritors of all the knowledge and culture of the ages.

870
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Of all the dreams and hopes of those who went before us.

871
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
What an exciting time to be young.

872
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yes, and what a glorious opportunity to add demand's history

873
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
to harness these nuclear fires for man's use,

874
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to accept the challenge of creation,

875
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and to use the gifts God gave us to explore the grandest of all frontiers,

876
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the universe.

877
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But the more we know of creation, the closer we get to the creator.

878
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Three cheers for Stardust.

879
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program

880
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
in its series of shows on sites.

881
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We wish to express our gratitude to the distinguished Board of Advisors

882
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
who guide the choice and treatment of scientific matter for the series.

883
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Biology and genetics.

884
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Medicine.

885
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Bacteriology and botany.

886
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Chemistry.

887
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Geophysics.

888
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Physics.

889
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Anthropology.

890
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Mathematics.

891
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Engineering.

892
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
For the program you have just seen,

893
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
our thanks to the special advisors who have suggested and checked the scientific material.

894
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
The Bell Telephone System is indebted to all these men and to many institutions.

895
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
For the generous support they have given this venture

896
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
in public education through entertainment.
