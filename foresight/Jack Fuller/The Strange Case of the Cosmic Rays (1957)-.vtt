00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Want to see an out-of-this-world true detective story?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Well, sharpen your wits and hop on your magic carpet.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
You've got one, you know. Your imagination.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Your imagination.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Phantom invaders from outer space.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Master keys to nuclear magic.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Adventure, discovery, the greatest 50 years in the history of mankind.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
But how do we package all that into a show?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
It's very simple. We ask you're a magic screen.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I have. But when it's blank up here, it's blank up...

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
The magic screen.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Boing.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Maybe it isn't so blank up here.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Come on, magic screen, come up with something.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Here we are back in Mysteryland, ladies and gentlemen and men.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, man, have we got excitement.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Great night, great night.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Everybody's got a detective story, candidate, egg in the Christie,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Earl Stanley Gardner, Dorothy Sears.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Everybody's got a candidate as the crowd mills around the famous

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Academy of Detection Arts and Sciences.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And no wonder, being voted on tonight is the award.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
The Edgar, it's called, for the best detective story of the first half of the 20th century.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Best detective story.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Ed, any word from the judges yet?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Take it away, Ed.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
You can just barely see the judges.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Boy, are they sweating.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
There they are.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
This is an absolute bore.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
These writers.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Mystery is mystery. On the first page, I know who did it.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Who done it.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
You all recognize the chairman, Edgar Allen Poe,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
whose murders in the room or won the first Edgar.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Nevermore, nevermore.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
To his right, Charles Dickens,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
who gave us one of the strangest detective stories ever penned.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
The unfinished mystery of Edwin Drude,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
and on the chairman's left is Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
In that golden skull you see on the table,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
that's the winner's prize, the coveted Edgar.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Of course.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
That's it, that's us.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Gentlemen, what are you doing?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Most honorable judges, we have an entry for you.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Another entry, aren't we?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
What's he talking about?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
The contest is closed.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, how can it be when we've got the greatest detective story of the last 50 years?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
The strange case of the cosmic rays.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
A strange case of the cosmic rays.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
An excellent title.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
You realize, of course, the detective story has certain requirements.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Analysis, deduction, seemingly insignificant clues.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Great.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Our story begins with a clue so insignificant, Mr. Poe,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
it wasn't even noticed for a hundred years or more.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The detective story is literature.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It must have scope.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Ha ha, scope, he says.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Jim, roll three.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Where the cosmic ray cases help to revolutionize the modern world.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Look, have a look.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Atomic power plants for the future.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Atomic subs.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Atomic planes.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Radioactive drug stores.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Isotopes for medicine.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And hold on to your hats.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
How's that for scope?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, gentlemen, do we qualify?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Theodore?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
No.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Science is for me a big bore.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
A big bore?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Wait, do you realize that just while you were speaking,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
the criminal in our case fired 20 atomic bullets through your head?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Good.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
All's in the head I like.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And you traced this criminal through that tiny clue you spoke of?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
The story begins as an ordinary theft.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Theft from this simple electrical common instrument

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
that's been in use to detect radiation for generations.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
It's just an airtight jar with an insulated metal rod

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
from one end of which hang two pieces of gold leaf.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Now, normally, they hang straight down.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Thank you, boy.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
As every school kid knows, when an electric charge is put on the rod,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
so the leaves become charged.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Now, as to the detection powers of the electroscope.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
When radiation is from this piece of uranium, for instance, enters the jar,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
the air inside is broken up into charged fragments,

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
some of which neutralize the charge on the leaves and cause them to fall.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
And the stronger the radiation, the faster they fall.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
What is this, a school room?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Where is the mystery?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, the mystery is that when a charged electroscope was put on the rod,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
a charged electroscope was put aside.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
When no known radiation was around,

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
the gold leaves mysteriously lost their charge and collapsed anyway.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
The tiny clue, so, is leaking a little electricity.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
That's a bank robbery?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
That's just how science thought of it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Bank robbery.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Roll for it.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Now, imagine the charged electroscope as a kind of bank

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
and the known radiations as thieves.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Bank robbers.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, there you are.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Depositors putting their hard-earned electrons into savings accounts.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Wait a minute.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
That's no depositor there.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
That's Miss Ultraviolet Ray.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
She's one of the slyest of our robbers.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Lift the electrons right off your back.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Drop off and have a jolt sometime.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Don't you do it.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
There's a distant cousin of Violet's over there, Gamma Ray.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Ordinary walls don't mean a thing to him.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Wow, here comes a real tough bunch in from the hideout.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The Uranium Gang.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Those hombres have been in and out of the Calibou so often they go by numbers.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
234, 235 and 238.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, 235's not carrying what I think he is.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
You know, those boys are the atom bomb boys.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Help! Help!

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Help! Sheriff! Robbery! Help!

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
They went that way!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Put on more guards.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
This fevery has got to stop.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Rebuild the bank.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Put lead walls around it.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Nine feet thick.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
So with nine feet around it, the Electroscope Bank became the fourth nox of science.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Not one of our robbers was sly enough like Ultra Violet.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Hey, thank you.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Or persistent enough like Gold Gamma.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Hey, thank you.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Or powerful enough like the numbers boys to break in.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
No more breaking into my bank.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Help! Help!

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Wait a minute. What's wrong now?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Mr. President, another robbery!

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Brother, somebody has broken in.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Must be a phantom bandit.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
A phantom bandit?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Get the town marshal, get the army, the navy, call out the Marines.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
He must be caught.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
That is literature.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Um, well, it's...

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
The point we're trying to make, gentlemen, is that just a few inches of lead would shield any Electroscope from all known radiations.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Even from the most powerful X-rays.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
But this new radiation, why even lead walls nine feet thick, couldn't keep it from crashing through and collapsing the leaves.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
That meant that some unknown super powerful ghostly radiation was loose in the world.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Where did this phantom come from?

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
The first guess was that it came from some new radioactive element in the earth.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But how to prove this?

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
A Jesuit physicist, Theodor Wolf, thought he had a way.

09:00.000 --> 09:18.000
The Father Wolf reasoned, if the phantom radiation came from the earth, the higher you got in the air, the weaker it would be, and the slower it would discharge the leaves of an electroscope.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
In 1910, the good father went to the foot of the Eiffel Tower.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
He charged his electroscope, and then carefully measured how long it took the unknown radiation to steal the charge from the leaves.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
Then he climbed and climbed and climbed, and at the top, a thousand feet above the earth, he recharged his electroscope.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
Now, if the unknown radiation came from the earth, his electroscope should have discharged more slowly.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
But it didn't. If anything, it discharged faster.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
Father Wolf didn't know it, but his legwork was the start of one of the greatest chases in the history of science.

10:00.000 --> 10:11.000
Other investigators, including Victor Francis Hess, decided that the Eiffel Tower just wasn't high enough, so in 1912, Hess borrowed a balloon from the Austrian Army.

10:11.000 --> 10:21.000
Then he rose past Father Wolf's thousand feet, past 5,000, 10,000, 13, 14, 15,000 feet.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
There, he charged his electroscope again, and he found that its leaves collapsed twice as fast as they did on the ground.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
At 3 miles up, the ghostly radiation, instead of becoming weaker, was twice as strong.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
This really threw the science-dicks for a loop. The phantom thief couldn't possibly come from the earth, so where did he come from?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
What?!

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, we're on the air. All the networks. Who gets the Edgar?

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
We are not ready yet. Put on a commercial. Go! Get out!

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Your bandit is the sort of flying creature, then. A kind of atmospheric Batman?

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
That was the next guess, that the strange radiation originated somewhere in our own atmosphere.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
The argument was settled when a famous American scientist, Robert A. Milliken, took up the chase.

11:19.000 --> 11:32.000
Assisted by Ira Bowen, now director of the Palomar and Mount Wilson Observatories, Milliken built an electroscope that would time and record the discharge rate of the leaves and then charge them again automatically.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
This is kind of an automatic mechanical bloodhound. Milliken's talkative bloodhounds, reporting back from balloons 50,000 feet above the plains of Texas.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And from the deep waters of two California mountain lakes.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
Proved, beyond a doubt, that the rays could not originate in our own atmosphere.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
But where were the rays coming from, then? The sun?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
No.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Is bullets coming? It's easy. Mars.

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
No. The rays weren't coming from the sun, the moon, a planet, or any single star. Tell them why, doc.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, because observers on every part of the world reported the most curious thing.

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
The ghostly radiation was the same by night as by day, hitting each spot of the Earth continuously, with equal force from every direction.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
They which meant they couldn't be coming from any single source.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
And so the amazed detectives were confronted with super, super rays whose hideout was the biggest ever imagined.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
The great open spaces of the entire universe.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
As in Milliken, recognizing the extraordinary nature of these rays, christened them cosmic rays.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
What?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
He's becoming interesting.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
What a pity.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Real phantoms, and out where no one will ever see them.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
One needn't see a criminal to know him, Charles.

13:05.000 --> 13:14.000
His dossier, fingerprints, footprints, methods of operation, mental quirks, often provide police with a more accurate picture than do the eyes.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
A dossier on a ray?

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
That's exactly what the science detectives were trying to fill in.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
A dossier.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Now, they'd already discovered the criminal's hideout, merely the whole universe.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
All right then, how about physical characteristics?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, radiation can be either waves or particles.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
Were the rays waves, weightless energy like ordinary sunlight, or solid particles of matter, tiny atomic bullets?

13:44.000 --> 13:51.000
To find the answer to that one, in 1929, two German science detectives, Walter Bota and Werner Cole-Hurster,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
rigged up a sort of a cosmic mousetrap.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Mousetrap?

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
I'll give you a quick version of the heart at least of their famous experiment with this modern equipment.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
You mean how they found out whether cosmic rays were solid particles or waves?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's right.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
This I gotta see.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Now this is a bank of Geiger counters.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
The two Germans knew that when electromagnetic waves like X-rays, ultraviolet rays, or gamma rays,

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
waves go through a Geiger counter, only about one in fifty of the waves going through could make the counter click.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
One in fifty?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
That's right.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
While solid particles of matter, electrons, for instance, would make the counter click every time one went through.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Particles out click waves fifty to one.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
That's just in one counter.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, by putting two banks of counters, one above the other, like this,

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
and wiring them so that waves of particles have to go through both counters before they can produce a click,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
they had the answer.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
They did?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Well, figure it out.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
Waves with a fifty to one chance of causing a click in one counter, fifty to one,

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
have about a twenty-five hundred to one chance if they have to actuate two counters before they produce the click.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Worse than the daily double.

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
While solid particles, particles going through both counters, produce a click each time one goes through.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Okay, particles have it by twenty-five hundred to one.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
But where does the mouse trap part come in?

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, the mouse trap is this thick slab of lead that's slipped in between the two counters.

15:29.000 --> 15:37.000
So, now this lead is thick enough to trap all stray earthly radiation and stop it from reaching the lower counters.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
But the hard-hitting cosmic rays go through it like a bullet through a cracker.

15:42.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll switch on the mouse trap, and you can determine for yourselves if the cosmic rays smashing down into this room right now are waves or particles.

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
Remember, occasional clicking, waves, steady clicking, particles.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Particles? Amazing.

16:13.000 --> 16:21.000
Yes, particles. What you are hearing are actual cosmic ray bullets, the same bullets that crash into all of us.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
First rate detection.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
And a second entry for the dossier.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
The invader from outer space is a particle.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
These particles is like breadcrumbs, dandruff, or vat.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
No, something far more fundamental than dandruff.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
By particles, they meant the incredibly tiny bricks of matter that make up all atoms.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Ceiling wax, habitges, kings.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
They're all built in three fundamental building blocks.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
The lightest of which is the electron with a negative charge.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
About 2,000 times heavier is the proton with a positive charge.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
About the same weight as the proton is the neutron with no charge.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Electron, proton, neutron.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
But which of these trons was the criminal from outer space? That was the question.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
With only three suspects, it should have been easy to pin down the culprit.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Quite easy, yes.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Might have been. If a complication hadn't arisen.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Ah, a complication. Good construction, Phaedoc.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
What if you found out, Mr. Poe, that the particles discharging electroscopes and making these Geiger counters click

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
were not the cosmic invaders from outer space at all?

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
What if you found out that they were the henchmen of the criminal?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Henchmen?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, maybe involuntary henchmen.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
They're really called secondaries.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
They're bits of air atoms shattered by the primary invaders as they crash into our atmosphere.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Which is a villain of your story.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
I assure you, readers have no such trouble identifying my villains.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Take Fagan, for example, in all of a twist.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
If you'll think of the character you're about to see as Fagan, maybe I can straighten you out.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Look out, Tom.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Now there you see the earth and its cloak of atmosphere.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
A constant rain of cosmic particles.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Millions and millions and millions of them every second falls on the atmosphere.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Now let's take one particle and follow it down in slow motion.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
And that is Fagan?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That's right. That's Fagan.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
He's entering the earth's atmosphere now.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Those round things he's passing are air atoms.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The closer you get to earth, the more there are.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Now he's bound to hit one pretty quick.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Watch what happens when he does.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
There.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Got a bad temper, Fagan has.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
See those little guys taking it on the lam?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Those are the secondaries we were talking about.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Dozens of them.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
Bits of air atoms kicked into violent action by a primary.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Ah, I see it now.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
The primary culprit from outer space is Fagan.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
And the secondaries from our own air are his henchmen.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You see, Fedor?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I see nothing.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Right.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And another item for the dossier.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Ah, Fagan's dossier.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
His MO, method of operation.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
He works through henchmen.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This becomes interesting.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
A mastermind operating through pawns.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Well, hardly pawns, Mr. Poe.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
The henchmen themselves were soon found to be incredibly powerful,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
possessing enormous energy and speed.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Additional entries for the dossier?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Uh, yeah, for the henchmen's dossier.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Because now the science detectives found they needed a second dossier.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
And where do you think they got their entries for the henchmen's dossier?

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, it seems that the henchmen leave footprints.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Footprints?

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
And they were detected by a, by a honey of a device, a cloud chamber.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Cloud chamber?

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
See here, Mr. Scientist, are you trying to tell us

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
that invisible cosmic criminals leave visible footprints

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
that perhaps even we might see?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Sure you can.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Anybody can see them.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Right in his own kitchen.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Soft light, Doc.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Any kid can make this kind of a two-bit cloud chamber.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Look.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
First you take a piece of dry ice.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Then a large-mouthed jar.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Set the jar on top of the dry ice.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Now, it's well to put a piece of black cloth in the bottom of the jar

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
so you can see the tracks better.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Now, take a piece of cardboard

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and saturate it with alcohol.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Any kind of alcohol will do.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
This that I'm using is just ordinary rubbing alcohol.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Now, take a hot iron.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Weak.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Heat on top, cold on the bottom.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Now you wait a few moments for the alcohol vapor to cool and settle.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
Now, let's flash a light through that.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And...

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
There you are.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Cosmic ray footprints.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
You can't see the actual flying particles,

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
but you can see their tracks.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Much as invisible high-flying jets leave their visible vapor trails,

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
celestial footprints which reveal the jet speed, height and direction.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Incredible.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, I must do these trick for Tolstoy.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
It will kill him.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I can't wait to try it on Will Shakespeare.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But it's my trick. I got it back.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Fascinating. But the vapor tracks all look alike.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
How could the detectives tell which henchmen left which footprints?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh, yes, indeed, yes, yes.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Good question, Mr. Poe. White stock.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And the answer was simple but fascinating.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
A U-magnet.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
The kind kids pick up nails with.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
As you probably know, Mr. Poe, between the poles of a magnet,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
there's a magnetic field as indicated by these lines of force.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Now, the detectives knew that when a charged particle enters a magnetic field,

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
its path is bent by the field and bent at right angles to the lines of force.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Now, it's bent to the left if its charge is negative,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
and it's bent to the right if its charge is positive.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Well, these scientific detectives reason,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
if they were to put a cloud chamber,

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
this is a tiny model of a cloud chamber,

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
in the middle of a very powerful magnetic field,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
the footprints would curve.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Exactly, Mr. Poe. The cosmic ray henchmen shooting through the cloud chamber

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
would leave curved footprints.

23:05.000 --> 23:14.000
Then, by placing a camera here and photographing these cloud tracks,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
the detectives had an ingenious way of identifying the henchmen

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
by analyzing their curved footprints.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
This I like.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
Now, for instance, as you'll see in these actual cloud chamber pictures,

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
this particle had a negative charge because its track curves to the left.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
This track curves to the right so its charge was positive.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
These are pictures of the actual henchmen, aren't they?

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Not of the particles themselves, but of their vapor trails.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
The footprints they leave behind in the cloud chamber

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
as they're pulled to the right or to the left by the strong magnets

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
outside the cloud chamber.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
When the detectives began photographing the henchmen's footprints

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
in their elaborate cloud chambers,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
now equipped with an ingenious triggering system

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
invented by PMS Blackett of England,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
GPS Occhiellini of Italy,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
measuring the amount of bending and the thickness of the tracks,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
they discovered some astounding things.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
The henchmen were traveling at unheard of speeds.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Speed. Wow.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Finally, from studies of thousands of cloud chamber photographs,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
the henchmen were identified.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
And who do you think they turned out to be?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Our old pals.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
Electron, proton, neutron.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Those three building blocks of the universe.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Flying bricks of actual matter.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Just imagine, yes.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
But remember, these energy-packed babies were only the henchmen.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
Think what superpower Boss Man Fagan himself must have.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
But who was this master criminal?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes, who?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That was the brain twister.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
The sleuths had identified the gang, but not the leader.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But since he operated way up high,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
there was a connection of air laid between them and Fagan.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
How to get to him?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I'll give you eight to five. You'll never guess how they trapped him.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
A woman, maybe?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Um...

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, sort of a mother.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
To put the finger on Fagan, they used Mother Earth.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Now, just one prokliata minuta.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Yes, Mr. Dostoevsky.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
They actually did use the Earth to find out if Fagan was armed.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Mr. Dostoevsky carried an electric charge.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
It was just a chunk of neutral matter.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Lights, please.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
Now, this is a model of the Earth with its atmospheric shell.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
This is the vast magnetic field of the Earth.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
These wires represent the lines of magnetic force.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Now, the Earth's field, like any other magnetic field,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
can bend the path of charged particles that move through it,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
but not of neutral particles.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
For instance, a neutral particle coming from outer space.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
This is the solid particle.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
This trailing tubes its track.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Now, this neutral particle, having no charge,

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
will shoot through to the Earth's atmosphere in a straight line,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
as if there were no magnetic field at all.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
So, if the space Fagans were neutral solid particles,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
they'd be unaffected by the magnetic field,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
and they'd crash into our atmosphere and ocean equally all around the globe.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
And since each Fagan would create the same average number of henchmen,

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
the resulting henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth below.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Ah, yes. You see, if Fagan were neutral,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
the henchmen would rain down evenly over the whole Earth.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Eh, Charles, please.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I have ears. I can hear.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
My big apartment.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Now, let's see what happens if Fagan is charged.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Ah, yes. Let's see what happens if Fagan is charged, yes.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
If the incoming particles were charged,

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
now, let's let these little red balls and red tubes represent the charged particles in their paths.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
If the particles coming in from outer space are charged particles,

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
their paths would be bent by the field, as you can see by these few examples here.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
The degree of bending is greatest where the particles come in at right angles to the lines of force,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
as they do here about the equator.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
As a result, and this is a key point,

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
many of the particles coming in near the equator would have their paths bent so much

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
that they'd missed the shell of the atmosphere completely.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Look at this one, for instance, coming in at this angle,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
being so strongly, radically bent that it's gone out

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and hasn't come at all near our Earth's atmosphere.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So, to this one, coming in this direction,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
and steaming out here again without ever getting near the atmosphere.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
While at the poles, charge particles would be bent very little, if at all,

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
because they come in parallel to the lines of force.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Look at these, how straight the paths are,

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
compared to the curved paths of those near the equator.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So, if the Fagans were charged,

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
more of them would smash into our atmosphere at the poles than at the equator,

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
kicking more henchmen into action beneath them at the poles than at the equator.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
And this so-called latitude effect could be measured by counting the number of collision pieces

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
that rain down on us at various latitudes at the bottom of our air ocean.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Lights, please.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
Ah, the more henchmen below, the more Fagans above.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Excellent reasoning.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
The reasoning was simple compared to the legwork.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
For Operation Compa henchmen, the cap and gown private eyes

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
didn't just cover one street, one city, one county.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
They blanketed the whole globe from pole to pole,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.

29:12.000 --> 29:28.000
Music

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Sifted and evaluated, the data from this global legwork,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
not counting the professorial bunions,

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
plainly showed that for every hundred henchmen particles hitting the earth at the poles,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
only 87 struck at the equator.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
Now that meant there were more Fagans at the poles than at the equator.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
There was a latitude effect.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
And that could only mean that at least some of the space invaders were charged.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
The detectives were closing in.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
The master crook was armed with an electric charge.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
That means Fagans couldn't be a neutron.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Right, Mr. Poe, a neutron has no charge.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Then he must be a proton or an electron.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
One hundred roubles, says Fagans, is a proton.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Covered with two pounds, my friend, I say he's an electron.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Three pounds.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
It takes three pounds.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Two theta, two.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Well, well, well, we'll soon know.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
Now, Dr. Research, was Fagans charge positive or negative?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yes, sir.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
And wait till you hear how the learned hawkshaws solved that problem.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
And with the earth again, go ahead, Doc.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
Let's turn over our globe in its magnetic field

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
so that we're looking down on the south pole.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
Now we already know that an incoming particle with a positive charge

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
would be bent to the right by the magnetic field

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
or to the left if it had a negative charge.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Well then, an Italian physicist Bruno Rossi

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
reasoned that if the cosmic rays were positive,

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
the earth's magnetic field would cause a majority of them to strike from the west,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
smashing more henchmen into us from the west.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
While if they were negative, a majority would strike us from the east.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
And bingo, the missing clue came in from Mexico.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Yes, where three investigators,

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Arthur Compton, T.H. Johnson, and Luis Alvarez,

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
reported conclusively more henchmen came in from the west.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
That could only mean that at least some of the cosmic invaders carried a positive charge.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Vagan's charge was positive.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Mystery's clearing up, huh?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Clearing up?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
It's like daylight is mystery for children.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Of course your story's over.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Of your three fundamental building blocks, electron, proton, neutron,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
only one was positively charged.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
Please, let me crush these excuse-the-expression starry tellers.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Now, you got neutron, no charge.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Electron negative, proton positive.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
So, Vagan is proton.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Give me the money.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Not so fast, sir.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Why not?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
No, wait a minute.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Wait, wait a minute.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Show him the positron still, doc.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Positron stills?

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
This is a photograph of a cosmic ray track taken in a cloud chamber

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
on the 2nd of August, 1932, by Professor Carl Anderson at Caltech.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Now, the light curve track seems to match the footprint of an electron.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
But instead of curving to the left in the cloud chamber's magnetic field,

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
as a respectable electron should, this strange particle curved to the right.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
His umpty-dumpty photograph, maybe.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Upside down.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Uh-uh.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
That's one of the most famous photographs in science, Dost.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
He got Anderson a Nobel Prize.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
The first picture of the tracks of a hitherto unknown particle of matter,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
a positive electron.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
A particle.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Positively charged.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Why couldn't that be Fagan, Dosty, instead of your proton?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I move we reject the entry.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Second emotion.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Why, Mr. Poe?

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
By introducing a new suspect at this late date,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
you have violated a cardinal rule of the detective story.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, it's cheating. It's my money.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
But think of the impact of this discovery, Edgar.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
It's as if your detective Dupin, searching for a human criminal,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
ran across an unknown species of man.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
It's astounding.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
He's cheating.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
A brand new kind of matter has been discovered.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Yes.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And a fourth henchman for Fagan.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
The positron.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Bah!

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
What difference positron, proton, pimpelton?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
This is useful?

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
His big doings about little nattings.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Now, wait a minute, Dosty.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Out of little nattings like this have come the big doings of science.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
Newton wondering why an apple hit his hair.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
Out of that came the law of gravitation.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
Renton, in trying to figure out why his photographic plates got fogged,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
came up with x-rays.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Oh.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Maxwell, tinkering with some tricky equations,

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
came up with a key to television.

34:23.000 --> 34:30.000
And this chase after little particles is the key for something big?

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
Just about the biggest something man ever ran into, Mr. Dostoevsky.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Nuclear force.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Nuclear force?

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
That's big.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Nuclear force.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
We've heard rumors about that.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Exactly what is meant by force.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
That's a large order, Mr. Poe.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
If I could answer that, I'd be ten Einstein's rolled in one.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
But in general, by force, science means a strange, almost mystic quality

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
of power possessed by matter.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
It manifests itself in three ways.

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear force.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Oh yes, you see the three, yes.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
Now in a sense, a force can be likened to an army.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Force exerts its power through individual units,

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
just as an army does through its individual units or soldiers.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
With gravity, the force that holds the whirling planets in their orbits,

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
the smallest individual unit, the soldier that does this planet holding,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
is said by some scientists to be the graviton.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
Graviton has never been pinned down or observed in any way.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Now if we focus down to just one atom.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Not large bodies, but just one atom.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Helium, for instance.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Another force takes over.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Electromagnetic force.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
Now this second force keeps the atomic solar system from flying apart.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And the electromagnetic soldier?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
That's called a photon.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
And unlike the graviton, this photon has been measured and directly observed.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Now if we go deep into the heart of the atom, into its nucleus,

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
we come to the third and most sensational force.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Nuclear force.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
That's the force that holds the protons and neutrons locked in the tiny nucleus.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
The awesome force man is now unlocking for his own use.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
The force which will surely change the way of life for every man, woman and child on Earth.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
And the soldier?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
The soldier that does the holding of nuclear force?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
That dramatically enough came out of the cosmic ray chase,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
out of tracking down Fagan's henchmen.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Here's the way it happened.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
And boy, this really rocked the science world.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
In Japan in 1935, at Osaka University, a genius named Hideki Yukawa

37:00.000 --> 37:06.000
sat alone with a pencil and a piece of paper, and he came up with a most amazing prediction.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
He said that the soldier, the unit of this terrific new force, would appear, believe it or not,

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
as a small particle, a piece of actual matter.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
He calculated it would be about 200 times heavier than the electron,

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
and get this, would live about a millionth of a second, then poof, it would disappear, die.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
Well, this was just too deep even for the hybrows.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Yukawa's prediction dropped like a feather in the scientific pond.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
But meanwhile, the cosmic ray chase was still going on.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
Since the discovery of the positron, the scientific working stiffs were photographing cloud chamber tracks around the clock

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
to see if there were more new particles among Fagan's henchmen.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, up popped the devil.

37:49.000 --> 37:57.000
Seth Netemire and Carl Anderson of Caltech and J.C. Street and E.C. Stevenson of Harvard

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
all came up with a new track at about the same time.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Uh, what is it?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
A real oddball.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
The track of a particle more than 200 times heavier than an electron,

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
and which, if you please, lives only a millionth of a second or so.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Yukawa's prediction.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Is nuclear soldier play of course?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
No, doggoneit.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
This strange new particle called a mumeison just didn't behave as Yukawa said it should.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
It wasn't quite the nuclear soldier he predicted.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
There was a bit of disappointment on Yukawa's prophetic face.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
But there was no disappointment in the particle department.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
The bug-eyed cosmic ray detectives realized that they'd stumbled onto another brand new piece of matter that no one ever dreamed existed.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
And another henchman for Fagan's rogues gallery, the mumeison.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Then some ten years later came the happy ending, happy for the Japanese wizard.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
It came from the developing tanks of a laboratory in the University of Bristol, England.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
On photographic plates exposed on the tops of the Bolivian Andes and the French Pyrenees,

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
three astonished cosmic ray hunters, an Englishman, C.F. Powell,

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
an Italian, GPS Occhialini, and a Brazilian, C.M. Lattice,

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
ran across the track of a quite similar but heavier mason.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Eureka, this was it. This soldier did obey orders.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
This newer particle, it's called a pi-mason, did seem to fit Yukawa's equations.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
His amazing prediction came true, and he was awarded a Nobel Prize for it.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Now, Mr. Poe, I think I can answer your question.

39:35.000 --> 39:43.000
Most people believe that the unit of nuclear force, the tremendously powerful soldier that holds the heart of the atom together,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
is the pi-mason.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Mmm, pi-mason, yes.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
And a sixth Fagan henchman got his name on the police blotter.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
The pi-mason.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
But weren't the detectives a bit confused by all these odd henchmen of Fagans?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Yes, I should think they would be, yes.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Confused? They were bewitched, bothered, and bewildered.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
Yes, and they still are. Think of it. As late as 1932,

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
science had the universe all neatly wrapped up in three little basic packages,

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
electron, proton, neutron.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
Just 25 years later, in 1957,

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
the number of separate and distinct particles of matter had jumped to at least 20,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
including two really out-of-this-world babies,

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
the neutrino, a kind of ghost particle that leaves no footprints,

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
yet apparently zips through lead as if it were butter,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
and the newly discovered antiproton,

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
which some people think is one of the building blocks of an unseen world,

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
a sort of left-handed world of matter matching the right-handed world we live in.

40:49.000 --> 40:55.000
Yes, not to mention k-masons, tau-masons, hyperons, v-particles.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Observable deluge.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
And no one knows how many more henchmen are going to show up,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
or what they're going to mean.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
They're crying for a-

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
for a Moses to lead them out of the wilderness of nuclear particles.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I say proton.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Yes, uh, yes. Well, what about the detective story?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
What about Fagan? Oh, yes, yes.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Oh, they nailed Fagan, all right.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
To do it, they went right up through the air ocean and took his picture.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
His picture?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Well, perhaps impression is a better word.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Okay, doc. Impression.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
With this new detection gadget,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
it's a cosmic ray emulsion plate.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
It's very much like an ordinary photographic plate, only it's more sensitive,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
and it's got a much thicker coating of silver bromide.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Now, the aim of the science detectives was to get a flash of old Fagan on here

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
before he smashed into our air atoms.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Well, obviously, that meant going very high indeed,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
way up almost to the top of our atmosphere,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
where the population of air atoms is very scarce.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
With these lightweight plates and a new kind of balloon named the Skyhook,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
they did the trick.

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
Skyhooks quite easily carry instruments up to 140,000 feet or more

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and can stay up there for several days,

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
during which time police switchboards buzz with flying saucer reports.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Ah, but it's with rockets.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Did we really take instruments up into Fagan's home territory?

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
Up to 150 miles,

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
up to where the emulsion plate is face-to-face with Fagan himself.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
From dozens of rocket flights,

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
from literally hundreds of balloon launchings all over the world,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
up to 150,000 feet.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
A pretty clear picture of the master criminal

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
began to emerge after a king-sized chase of over 50 years.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Here's what Fagan looks like,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
rather what his trail looks like,

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
as he smashes through the silver bromide on the photographic plate.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And this is what happens when Fagan hits one of the silver atoms

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
square on the nucleus.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Wait for wait, he's got the biggest sock in the universe.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
The first to actually mug Fagan were some Chicago detectives.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
Yes, a group of physicists headed by Marcel Schein.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
From microscopic examinations of the tracks left in their emulsions,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
they announced that most of the Fagans,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
the primary rays from outer space, were protons.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Naked hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
Protons! I was right! Give me the money!

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
No, Fagan, not so fast!

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
Order! Order! Order!

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Doctor, search me! I was right, no?

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Only partially right, Mr. Dostoevsky.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
In 1948, physicists from the universities of Minnesota and Rochester

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
found other primary tracks.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Too heavy, too highly charged to beat protons.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
And the most numerous of these were made by naked helium atoms.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
And in addition, the tracks of still heavier atoms were found.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
In other words, the Fagans are really atoms, common familiar atoms,

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
stripped of their electrons and hurtling through space at unholy speeds.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Atomic bullets from beyond the beyond,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
crashing into us with almost the speed of light.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
And when he says crash, he means crash.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
These cosmic ray babies crack into us

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
with energies of more than a million, billion electron volts.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
More than five million times as strong as an A-bomb atom.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
That's our space boy, Fagan.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And his identity?

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Naked atom.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
My money.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
But no more amazing than the detectives who tracked him down.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Are they going to say they actually know where he comes from?

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Well, they've got one pretty good idea. Tell them about it, Doc.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Well, many scientists now think the cosmic Fagans are being spawned

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
continuously in our own galaxy, in the Milky Way.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
They believe that all stars, including our own sun,

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
are constantly casting off particles into space through surface explosions.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
And that these cast-off star particles, zillions and zillions of them,

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
gradually acquire their cosmic speeds and energies

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
by being bounced back and forth between galactic clouds.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Galactic clouds?

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
Yes. Our own Milky Way, which looks something like our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda,

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
contains not only billions of stars that spiral around,

45:56.000 --> 46:02.000
but also millions of truly enormous galactic clouds composed of dust and gas.

46:03.000 --> 46:10.000
These galactic clouds float and swirl through the Milky Way in all directions.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
Sometimes they look black, and they obscure the stars behind them.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
These swirling clouds apparently create gigantic magnetic fields.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
The late Enrico Fermi, one of the great pioneers of modern science,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
the Fermi suggested that within our Milky Way,

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
gargantuan badminton games go on, which the players of these huge magnetic fields,

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
and the birds are tiny, naked atoms which have been shot into space from erupting stars.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
And the atoms are naked because the star heat is so intense

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
that atoms can't hang onto their satellites.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
When such an atom is exploded into space from a star,

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
it will eventually collide with a magnetic field and bounce off.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
It will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
And years later, it runs into another space,

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
and it will bounce off with more speed if the field is moving toward it.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
And years later, it runs into another gigantic field,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
and is sent shooting off in another direction.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
After a million years or so of this being batted back and forth,

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
these atoms, they're our phagans, and remember their numbers countless,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
are kicked up to almost the speed of light,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
and sent hurtling through our Milky Way in all directions.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
The tiny dot which is our Earth moving through space

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
sails through this myriad of shooting particles,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
and a tiny fraction of them crash into us as cosmic rays.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Gentlemen, do you realize what this means?

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
The phagans bombarding us from outer space are pieces of matter from billions of stars.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
And since these space bullets are the same atomic particles we have on Earth,

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
that means the stars are made of the same stuff we're made of.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
A part of the eggs you had for breakfast this morning could have come from Orion,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
or from the Big Dipper.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
And some of the carbon in this young lady's shining red hair

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
might once upon a time have been stardust from an exploded supernova,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
or from the Southern Cross.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Why, you could almost say that in tracking down phagans,

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
the science detectives uncovered material proof of the oneness of the whole great cosmos.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
Mr. Scientist, for eyebrows this could be exciting, maybe,

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
but what is meaning for common people who work, love, hate?

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Yes, yes. What is the meaning for ordinary mortals?

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Oh, a very big meaning indeed, Mr. Dostoevsky.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
It's possible that how people work, love, hate has been,

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
and is even now being affected by cosmic rays.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
It's possible that in the millions and billions of years they've been bombarding the Earth,

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
these cosmic space bullets could be partly responsible for evolution,

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
by causing mutations, sudden changes, as they smash into our reproductive genes.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
My word.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
Why, Dostoevsky, it's conceivable that your enormous writing talent

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
could be traced to some well-directed cosmic ray

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
hitting your great-grandfather in just the right gene.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
My writing? Cosmic rays?

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Do you realize what this would mean philosophically, Edgar?

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
The changes in living things may be controlled by the stars.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And still more significant, Mr. Dickens?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Yes.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
Someday, out of the strange case of the cosmic rays,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
out of this out-of-the-world detective story,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
may come the answer to the great riddle of what makes the universe tick.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Well, gentlemen, how about it?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Do we get the Edgar?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Charles.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Yes, yes.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
I make my vote now.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah, I know.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Yet.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
No, no, not yet.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Science is for people.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I thought it was just for long-hands.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
I vote yes.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
You do?

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Yes.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
A truly remarkable story.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Did you hear that?

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
An epic adventure of the human spirit, the mind of man,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
daring to explore the unknown reaches of the heavens,

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
just to track down these tiny particles of star dust,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
so packed with primal power,

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
they come winging with the speed of light,

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
celestial messengers from out where the morning stars sing together.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Good line, Charles. He's excellent poetry.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Yes, yes.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
But what is the message they bring?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
And why?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Huh?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
What?

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
Gentlemen, we thank you for a saga of brilliant scientific accomplishment.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
But as a detective story, and that's what we're judging,

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
as a detective story, your tale has a fundamental weakness.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Motive.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Motive.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Fedor, they've established no motive for their cosmic fagans.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
But, Edgar.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Why do they bombard the earth?

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Edgar, if they knew motive for cosmic rays,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
they'd have answer to great mystery of creation itself.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
I vote yes.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I vote no.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Their story's unfinished.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Charles.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
You vote yes.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
No?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
You know, I'm reminded of Isaac Newton.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
He's reminded. It's a good story.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Just a moment, Fedor. Just a moment, Fedor.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I haven't finished.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm reminded of Isaac Newton, perhaps the greatest scientific mind that ever lived,

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
and how he humbly described his monumental discoveries as,

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
now and then, finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell,

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
while the great ocean of truth lay before me.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Pebbles.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Pebbles.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
Well, that great ocean of truth still lies undiscovered before you.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Briefly, Charles, how do you vote?

52:09.000 --> 52:14.000
I vote we invite these gentlemen to come back in 50 years

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
to tell us what new chapters they've added to their cosmic tale.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Ah, excellent, Charles.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Most excellent.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And who will write these new chapters?

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
The young.

52:26.000 --> 52:32.000
The inheritors of all the knowledge and culture of the ages.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
Of all the dreams and hopes of those who went before us.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
What an exciting time to be young.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
Yes, and what a glorious opportunity to add demand's history

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
to harness these nuclear fires for man's use,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
to accept the challenge of creation,

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
and to use the gifts God gave us to explore the grandest of all frontiers,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
the universe.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
But the more we know of creation, the closer we get to the creator.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Three cheers for Stardust.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
in its series of shows on sites.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
We wish to express our gratitude to the distinguished Board of Advisors

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
who guide the choice and treatment of scientific matter for the series.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Biology and genetics.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Medicine.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Bacteriology and botany.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Chemistry.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Geophysics.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
Physics.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Anthropology.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Mathematics.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Engineering.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
For the program you have just seen,

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
our thanks to the special advisors who have suggested and checked the scientific material.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
The Bell Telephone System is indebted to all these men and to many institutions.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
For the generous support they have given this venture

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
in public education through entertainment.
