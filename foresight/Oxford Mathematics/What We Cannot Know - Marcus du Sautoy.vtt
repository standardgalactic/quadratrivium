Fe oedd ci'n byw ddifweud demen nhw – i wge achievement arall y gweithgaredd dros yma,

00:25.540 --> 00:35.540
So, it's kind of exciting that, you know, you've getting a little advance glimpse of what I've been up to for the last three years in writing this book.

00:35.540 --> 00:43.540
The catalyst for this book was partly the fact that I took over this new job from Richard Dawkins,

00:43.540 --> 00:46.540
the professor for the public understanding of science,

00:46.540 --> 01:00.020
The title always makes me laugh somehow because there is a kind of expectation with this professorship that maybe I know the whole of science and that I am here to explain it to the public.

01:02.540 --> 01:09.020
Quite a few journalists seem to have this impression as well because when I first got this job I would get these phone calls from people.

01:09.020 --> 01:16.020
Wrth i ddim yn gwneud o'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad deilio'r cyfnoddiad yn ymddiad yng nghymru.

01:16.020 --> 01:19.020
Mae'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru yn ymddiad yng nghymru.

01:19.020 --> 01:22.020
Yn cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad yn ymddiad yng Nghymru.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.020
Felly, ychydig yn ymddiad yng Nghymru?

01:23.020 --> 01:25.020
Felly, ymddiad yng nghymru?

01:25.020 --> 01:28.020
Felly, boedd yn gwneud hynny yn eu ddweud.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.020
Felly, rydyn ni eisiau yn siŵr ymddiad.

01:31.020 --> 01:39.020
I'm really embarrassed to admit. You can look me up on Wikipedia, but you can look a lot of things up on Wikipedia actually.

01:39.020 --> 01:45.020
So I quickly went online, pulled up telomeres, read quickly through what a telomere was,

01:45.020 --> 01:50.020
and then confidently told this journalist that the pieces at the end of the DNA,

01:50.020 --> 01:54.020
which control how long a piece of DNA will last.

01:54.020 --> 02:00.020
So I realised this is kind of crazy. There's no way I can be expected to know it all.

02:01.020 --> 02:08.020
But actually it began to make me think, is it possible at any point in history that scientists,

02:08.020 --> 02:14.020
scientists might know it all? Could we answer everything? Could we know everything?

02:14.020 --> 02:18.020
And so that was partly the sort of inspiration for this journey,

02:18.020 --> 02:27.020
was to see whether there are any problems in science that by their very nature we will never be able to solve.

02:27.020 --> 02:31.020
So actually the books are divided up into seven edges of knowledge,

02:31.020 --> 02:36.020
which kind of took me on this journey outside of my own area of mathematics into different regions.

02:36.020 --> 02:40.020
And I'm going to take you through a few of these stories.

02:40.020 --> 02:44.020
But I think that kind of desire to know is absolutely basic.

02:44.020 --> 02:50.020
And it is extraordinary how much we have discovered, or the news stories coming out each week.

02:50.020 --> 02:54.020
I mean, I think since I took over this job, the sort of things we discovered,

02:54.020 --> 02:59.020
we managed to land a kind of spaceship the size of a washing machine on the side of a comet.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.020
Absolutely extraordinary.

03:00.020 --> 03:05.020
We've got robots that we've programmed to develop their own language that we as humans can't understand.

03:05.020 --> 03:09.020
We have to interact with the robots to be able to understand that language.

03:09.020 --> 03:13.020
We've sequenced the DNA of a 50,000-year-old cave girl

03:13.020 --> 03:17.020
and repaired the pancreas using stem cells of a diabetic patient.

03:17.020 --> 03:22.020
I mean, this catalogue of things that we've achieved and the things we've discovered is extraordinary.

03:22.020 --> 03:27.020
And I think that basic desire to know is almost as basic as a desire to reproduce.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.020
And here's Aristotle, the beginning of metaphysics.

03:30.020 --> 03:34.020
He says, everyone by nature desires to know.

03:34.020 --> 03:40.020
In fact, I did a little research and the word to know is actually one of only about 100

03:40.020 --> 03:44.020
which have a universal translation across all languages.

03:44.020 --> 03:49.020
Not even the word eat is necessarily clearly translatable into each language.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.020
So an incredibly basic desire.

03:52.020 --> 03:59.020
But it's always dangerous at any point in history to declare you will never know something.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.020
And I've kept in mind on my journey throughout the last three years

04:02.020 --> 04:04.020
trying to find out those things that we cannot know.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.020
A few stories.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.020
One in particular is this guy, Auguste Comte,

04:08.020 --> 04:11.020
who in the middle of the 19th century declared,

04:11.020 --> 04:16.020
we shall never be able to study by any method the chemical composition of stars.

04:17.020 --> 04:20.020
Now at the time, that seemed completely fair.

04:20.020 --> 04:23.020
I mean, how on earth are we ever going to visit a star to dig a bit out

04:23.020 --> 04:25.020
and actually find out what it's made of?

04:25.020 --> 04:30.020
But of course, a few decades later, we knew exactly what stars are made out of.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.020
Why? Because we don't necessarily have to go and visit the star.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.020
The star is visiting us every night.

04:35.020 --> 04:40.020
The light coming from the star is telling us what the star is made of.

04:40.020 --> 04:45.020
So it's always dangerous and I'm sort of very clear that, you know,

04:45.020 --> 04:48.020
I'm not sure whether I've got any definitive answers here about things

04:48.020 --> 04:50.020
that you can absolutely say you can't know.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.020
But that was the journey to try and understand

04:53.020 --> 04:57.020
whether maybe you can articulate that there are things that you will never know.

04:57.020 --> 05:03.020
Of course, the desire to know about the unknowable isn't restricted to science.

05:03.020 --> 05:06.020
I mean, there's a very famous example of a politician

05:06.020 --> 05:12.020
who got into quite a scrambled mess trying to describe his theory of knowledge.

05:12.020 --> 05:17.020
Here he goes, Donald Rumsfeld trying to explain about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq

05:17.020 --> 05:19.020
and whether they were there or not.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.020
To clear, there are known knowns.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.020
There are things that we know that we know.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.020
We also know there are known unknowns.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.020
That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.

05:29.020 --> 05:34.020
But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know.

05:35.020 --> 05:40.020
Now, actually, Donald Rumsfeld got awarded the Foot in the Mouth Award

05:40.020 --> 05:43.020
by the Plain English-speaking Society for this statement,

05:43.020 --> 05:45.020
but I actually think it's very unfair,

05:45.020 --> 05:49.020
because I think this is a wonderful statement about states of knowledge.

05:49.020 --> 05:53.020
The unknown unknowns, those are those black swan events.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.020
I can't tell you about the unknown unknowns else they'd be known.

05:56.020 --> 05:59.020
I'm going to try and tell you about the known unknowns,

05:59.020 --> 06:02.020
whether we can know what those unknowns are.

06:02.020 --> 06:05.020
There's another category here that I think he missed, though,

06:05.020 --> 06:08.020
which I think is very interesting when it comes to a politician,

06:08.020 --> 06:11.020
which is, of course, the unknown knowns,

06:11.020 --> 06:14.020
which Slavoj Žižek actually pointed out,

06:14.020 --> 06:17.020
was those Freudian things that you actually know,

06:17.020 --> 06:19.020
but you don't deny that you know them,

06:19.020 --> 06:21.020
but they come out and somehow,

06:21.020 --> 06:26.020
and I think probably those are the most relevant to a politician as the unknown knowns.

06:26.020 --> 06:33.020
So this journey to try and find the unknown unknowns,

06:33.020 --> 06:36.020
I wanted to try and apply my mathematical mind

06:36.020 --> 06:38.020
to see whether I could articulate

06:38.020 --> 06:42.020
whether there were any questions in the science.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.020
Another inspiration for this book

06:44.020 --> 06:48.020
actually came from the person that I took over this job,

06:48.020 --> 06:51.020
as a Somoni Professor for the Public Understanding of Science,

06:51.020 --> 06:54.020
because my predecessor was Richard Dawkins.

06:54.020 --> 06:57.020
Now, you, of course, know that Richard spent a lot of time

06:57.020 --> 07:00.020
not just talking about biology and evolution,

07:00.020 --> 07:02.020
but also about God.

07:02.020 --> 07:07.020
His God Delusion book was probably one of his most popular books.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.020
So I kind of braced myself when I took over this job

07:11.020 --> 07:14.020
for getting a lot of questions, not about telomeres,

07:14.020 --> 07:18.020
but about what my beliefs about religion were and God's were.

07:18.020 --> 07:23.020
Now, I was quite keen to just create a sort of distance between me and Richard.

07:23.020 --> 07:26.020
There were very different things scientifically.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.020
So I kind of prepared this response to journalists

07:29.020 --> 07:31.020
who would phone up and say,

07:31.020 --> 07:33.020
what are your religious beliefs?

07:33.020 --> 07:36.020
I would tell them I'm a deeply religious man.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.020
My religion happens to be the arsenal.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.020
I have faith every year,

07:42.020 --> 07:45.020
and it's been tested once again

07:45.020 --> 07:48.020
that next season we will win the premiership.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.020
I go to my temple every Saturday or Sunday,

07:51.020 --> 07:53.020
this weekend it will be Sunday.

07:53.020 --> 07:56.020
I sing songs to my idols and I worship them.

07:56.020 --> 07:59.020
And so I hoped that this would kind of bat away

07:59.020 --> 08:01.020
these questions about religion.

08:01.020 --> 08:04.020
But some of these journalists were very persistent.

08:04.020 --> 08:07.020
So I remember one instance on,

08:07.020 --> 08:11.020
it was a Sunday morning on BBC Northern Ireland Radio.

08:11.020 --> 08:14.020
There was a programme about philosophy and religion,

08:14.020 --> 08:17.020
and I said I'm quite happy to talk about philosophy and science and things like that,

08:17.020 --> 08:19.020
but I really don't want to talk about religion.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.020
Of course, as soon as we got on air,

08:21.020 --> 08:23.020
that went out the window and he was like,

08:23.020 --> 08:26.020
some artist, do you believe in God?

08:26.020 --> 08:28.020
He wasn't from India, sorry.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.020
I would stop doing that.

08:31.020 --> 08:34.020
So he just kept on pressing me,

08:34.020 --> 08:37.020
and it became quite an aggressive interview

08:37.020 --> 08:40.020
to the point that as a mathematician you see,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.020
if you're asking me whether something exists,

08:42.020 --> 08:45.020
actually we spend a lot of time at the Math Institute here

08:45.020 --> 08:47.020
proving things exist,

08:47.020 --> 08:49.020
maybe without being able to know what they look like,

08:49.020 --> 08:51.020
but we can prove that they exist,

08:51.020 --> 08:53.020
or often we prove that things don't exist.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.020
Andrew Wild, who this building is named after,

08:56.020 --> 08:59.020
proved that there aren't solutions to Fermat's occasions.

08:59.020 --> 09:02.020
He had a way to prove these things do not exist.

09:02.020 --> 09:05.020
So I said, OK, I'm quite happy to engage in this.

09:05.020 --> 09:08.020
If you give me a definition that I can start to engage

09:08.020 --> 09:10.020
my mathematical mind with.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.020
So he said, ah, well, God,

09:12.020 --> 09:15.020
that's something which transcends human understanding.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.020
Ah, you've just played me out of the game.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.020
I mean, how can I engage with that?

09:21.020 --> 09:23.020
So it seemed to me, so I got brave.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.020
I said, well, how can we stop with the debate with that?

09:26.020 --> 09:29.020
But actually, that definition sort of stuck in my mind,

09:29.020 --> 09:31.020
as quite an intriguing one.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.020
So as the years went on,

09:33.020 --> 09:36.020
and I sort of decided to engage a little bit more perhaps

09:36.020 --> 09:39.020
with this kind of the bridge between science and religion,

09:39.020 --> 09:42.020
I began to think about that as a definition.

09:42.020 --> 09:45.020
But what about the definition of God being the things

09:45.020 --> 09:47.020
that we cannot understand,

09:47.020 --> 09:50.020
the things that we cannot know, the things which transcend us?

09:50.020 --> 09:55.020
So can I apply my scientific mind to what that God would be like?

09:55.020 --> 09:58.020
And I talked to a philosopher in my college, in New College,

09:58.020 --> 10:01.020
Stephen Mulhall, just before I was doing an event

10:01.020 --> 10:03.020
with a chief rabbi actually about,

10:03.020 --> 10:06.020
he's got a wonderful book called Science and Religion,

10:06.020 --> 10:08.020
The Great Partnership.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.020
And he referred me to this guy Herbert McCabe,

10:10.020 --> 10:14.020
and here in Oxford, who actually a Marxist theologian.

10:14.020 --> 10:17.020
Get that, you know, that's quite a cool title.

10:17.020 --> 10:20.020
But he's got quite a lot of crazy articles

10:20.020 --> 10:22.020
about Christian kind of traditions and things,

10:22.020 --> 10:26.020
but he had this one article which Stephen Mulhall referred me to,

10:26.020 --> 10:28.020
and in there he says,

10:28.020 --> 10:30.020
to assert the existence of God is to claim

10:30.020 --> 10:34.020
that there is an unanswered question about the universe.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.020
So I thought that's quite an interesting definition,

10:37.020 --> 10:39.020
and I sort of, through the book,

10:39.020 --> 10:41.020
I run with sort of just exploring a little bit about

10:41.020 --> 10:45.020
what sort of idea that is as a God.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.020
Herbert McCabe says, you know, religion basically committed

10:48.020 --> 10:53.020
iconoclism by giving this very abstract high concept

10:53.020 --> 10:55.020
too many properties it just didn't have.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.020
And of course as kids that's what we get introduced to,

10:57.020 --> 11:01.020
all the silly things, and then we sort of discard that.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.020
So I sort of wanted to have a perhaps a more nuanced engagement

11:05.020 --> 11:07.020
with this question by defining something

11:07.020 --> 11:09.020
of abstract like this.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.020
Now there is this term, the God of the gaps,

11:11.020 --> 11:13.020
which you may have heard of,

11:13.020 --> 11:15.020
but that's actually used by religious people

11:15.020 --> 11:17.020
as a kind of negative thing.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.020
A lot of religious people will say,

11:19.020 --> 11:21.020
no, you're meant to attempt to know God,

11:21.020 --> 11:23.020
so actually the God of the gaps is something

11:23.020 --> 11:26.020
that they sort of use as a kind of negative statement.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.020
But I want to try and reclaim that maybe

11:28.020 --> 11:30.020
and just explore through this book

11:30.020 --> 11:32.020
and a little bit with you now

11:32.020 --> 11:34.020
as we go through these attempts

11:34.020 --> 11:36.020
to find out what is it that could transcend

11:36.020 --> 11:40.020
our understanding forever.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.020
So as I said, the book is divided up

11:42.020 --> 11:44.020
into these seven edges of knowledge,

11:44.020 --> 11:46.020
seven areas that I've sort of explored,

11:46.020 --> 11:48.020
which go from trying to understand

11:48.020 --> 11:51.020
the nature of the universe, is it infinite,

11:51.020 --> 11:53.020
whether we can infinitely divide matter,

11:53.020 --> 11:56.020
what's going on inside our brain.

11:56.020 --> 11:58.020
So I'm going to take you on a little tour

11:58.020 --> 12:00.020
of a few of these to give you a sort of feel

12:00.020 --> 12:02.020
for what might be unknowable

12:02.020 --> 12:05.020
and whether we can know that sort of thing.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.020
I think one of the ultimate symbols

12:07.020 --> 12:11.020
of the unknowable is in fact the dice.

12:11.020 --> 12:14.020
A dice would not make a fun game

12:14.020 --> 12:16.020
if you could actually predict

12:16.020 --> 12:18.020
what this was going to do next.

12:18.020 --> 12:20.020
So the first edge that I explored

12:20.020 --> 12:23.020
is about the nature of the future.

12:23.020 --> 12:26.020
Can we predict the future?

12:26.020 --> 12:28.020
And in fact mathematics at its heart

12:28.020 --> 12:30.020
is very much trying to do that.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.020
I'll call a mathematician a pattern-searcher.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.020
What we do is look at patterns in the past

12:34.020 --> 12:36.020
and try and use those to extrapolate

12:36.020 --> 12:39.020
to understand patterns into the future.

12:39.020 --> 12:42.020
So how powerful is my language of mathematics

12:42.020 --> 12:45.020
in being able to predict what is going to happen next?

12:45.020 --> 12:47.020
So actually each of the edges is accompanied

12:47.020 --> 12:49.020
by an object which kind of sparks

12:49.020 --> 12:51.020
my journey into the unknown.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.020
So the object for this particular edge

12:54.020 --> 12:56.020
is the casino dice.

12:56.020 --> 12:58.020
And this is in fact a casino dice

12:58.020 --> 13:01.020
that I picked up when I was in Vegas.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.020
I was trying to use my maths to make a lot of money

13:04.020 --> 13:06.020
and I've lost so much money

13:06.020 --> 13:08.020
but they let me keep the dice.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.020
That's nice of them.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.020
Now it's a thing of beauty.

13:12.020 --> 13:14.020
You can come and look at it afterwards.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.020
Because it has to be incredibly fair,

13:17.020 --> 13:20.020
it's a pretty much perfect cube.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.020
The edges are just beautifully sharp

13:22.020 --> 13:26.020
and the paint has the same density,

13:26.020 --> 13:28.020
the acetate, it's really...

13:28.020 --> 13:30.020
It is a thing of beauty

13:30.020 --> 13:32.020
and it also is something that I absolutely hate.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.020
Because I cannot...

13:34.020 --> 13:36.020
My desire to do mathematics was partly

13:36.020 --> 13:38.020
about wanting to know, with 100% certainty

13:38.020 --> 13:40.020
that something was true.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
And here was this thing

13:42.020 --> 13:44.020
which when I roll it, I just don't know

13:44.020 --> 13:46.020
what I got to one that time.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.020
I might be able to...

13:48.020 --> 13:50.020
I've got the equations for this thing

13:50.020 --> 13:52.020
but how can I tell what it's going to do next?

13:52.020 --> 13:54.020
So that was a kind of challenge.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.020
Actually maybe if I worked hard enough

13:56.020 --> 13:58.020
I could know what this was going to do.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.020
And I guess the hero on my journey

14:00.020 --> 14:02.020
to try and use mathematics

14:02.020 --> 14:04.020
to be able to predict the future

14:04.020 --> 14:06.020
is Isaac Newton.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.020
Because Isaac Newton came up

14:08.020 --> 14:10.020
with the laws of motion, the physical laws of motion,

14:10.020 --> 14:12.020
the idea of calculus.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.020
He showed us how the universe can be controlled.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.020
We can predict when an eclipse is going to happen.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.020
We were able to predict that Mercury

14:18.020 --> 14:20.020
was going to go across the sun just recently.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.020
And that's all thanks to

14:22.020 --> 14:24.020
this revolution that Newton started.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.020
Which kind of revealed

14:26.020 --> 14:28.020
that the universe may be

14:28.020 --> 14:30.020
a kind of clockwork universe

14:30.020 --> 14:32.020
controlled by these equations.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.020
If you know how things are set up,

14:34.020 --> 14:36.020
you run the equations, you can know

14:36.020 --> 14:38.020
what's going to happen into the future.

14:38.020 --> 14:40.020
Well, if Newton is my hero,

14:40.020 --> 14:42.020
my nemesis in this whole desire

14:42.020 --> 14:44.020
to know the future is this guy here,

14:44.020 --> 14:46.020
Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician

14:46.020 --> 14:48.020
who at the beginning of the 20th century

14:48.020 --> 14:50.020
said, yeah, well,

14:50.020 --> 14:52.020
universe may be controlled by equations.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.020
It may be that

14:54.020 --> 14:56.020
if you know the absolute start-up

14:56.020 --> 14:58.020
of any system you run the equations,

14:58.020 --> 15:00.020
you'll know exactly what's going to happen in the future.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.020
But he said, unfortunately,

15:02.020 --> 15:04.020
you're never going to have that complete knowledge

15:04.020 --> 15:06.020
of how a system is set up.

15:06.020 --> 15:08.020
Because there's always a little bit of error.

15:08.020 --> 15:10.020
If you're measuring how the solar system is set up,

15:10.020 --> 15:12.020
then how can you be sure

15:12.020 --> 15:14.020
that you've got the 50th decimal place right?

15:14.020 --> 15:16.020
And what Poincaré showed

15:16.020 --> 15:18.020
is that just a very small change

15:18.020 --> 15:20.020
in maybe the 50th decimal place

15:20.020 --> 15:22.020
may cause a dramatically different outcome.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.020
Now, one of my favourite examples

15:24.020 --> 15:26.020
of chaos in motion,

15:26.020 --> 15:28.020
and this is an illustration

15:28.020 --> 15:30.020
that even something very simple

15:30.020 --> 15:32.020
can have a very difficult

15:32.020 --> 15:34.020
future to try and predict.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.020
So this is a pendulum.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.020
Now, a pendulum is generally something so simple

15:38.020 --> 15:40.020
and predictable, we use it to keep track of time.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.020
But this is a slightly different pendulum.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.020
So this is what I call a double pendulum.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.020
So it's jointed,

15:46.020 --> 15:48.020
so it's a little bit like a leg.

15:48.020 --> 15:50.020
So it's just two metal pieces here.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.020
So the, you know,

15:52.020 --> 15:54.020
it's a very simple geometric description

15:54.020 --> 15:56.020
and the equations are equally quite simple.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.020
But being able to predict

15:58.020 --> 16:00.020
the behaviour of this thing

16:00.020 --> 16:02.020
is almost impossible.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.020
So let's set this off.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.020
And...

16:06.020 --> 16:08.020
You see, why are you laughing?

16:08.020 --> 16:10.020
Because it's so hilariously funny

16:10.020 --> 16:12.020
that you can't predict it.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.020
It's very interesting.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.020
It always makes me laugh.

16:16.020 --> 16:18.020
I've had a little notch there,

16:18.020 --> 16:20.020
so the point is I'm going to try and repeat that behaviour.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.020
I'm going to try and start it off

16:22.020 --> 16:24.020
in exactly the same starting position.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.020
Then it's...

16:26.020 --> 16:28.020
Wow!

16:28.020 --> 16:30.020
It's a completely different behaviour that time.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.020
I think I've tightened it a little bit too fast

16:32.020 --> 16:34.020
because it's...

16:34.020 --> 16:36.020
Let's do a big one here.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.020
This is my favourite desktop toy.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.020
I can play with this for absolutely hours.

16:42.020 --> 16:44.020
But it sort of illustrates

16:44.020 --> 16:46.020
that even very simple systems

16:46.020 --> 16:48.020
you make a very small change to the conditions

16:48.020 --> 16:50.020
and it can go in a completely different direction.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.020
And this is the signature of something called chaos.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.020
Another of my favourite desktop toys

16:54.020 --> 16:56.020
is this one here.

16:56.020 --> 16:58.020
I use this to make all my decisions about life.

16:58.020 --> 17:00.020
So you can see it has

17:00.020 --> 17:02.020
different options.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.020
Ask a friend, try again, no way.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.020
Definitely maybe yes.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.020
And what you do is...

17:08.020 --> 17:10.020
I'll show you the little video of this.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.020
So this is one set up in a lab.

17:12.020 --> 17:14.020
You start this thing off and try to predict this.

17:14.020 --> 17:16.020
So I'm going to ask it,

17:16.020 --> 17:18.020
shall I go to have a beer in the pub

17:18.020 --> 17:20.020
after this lecture?

17:20.020 --> 17:22.020
Let's see...

17:22.020 --> 17:24.020
Oh, definitely!

17:24.020 --> 17:26.020
Oh great, so that's good. Excellent.

17:26.020 --> 17:28.020
I think I've...

17:28.020 --> 17:30.020
It always says definitely when I ask it about the beer.

17:30.020 --> 17:32.020
It's really great. Thanks.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.020
But you can see from this that

17:34.020 --> 17:36.020
just if I run that again,

17:36.020 --> 17:38.020
trying to see beforehand

17:38.020 --> 17:40.020
which magnet that's going to end up in.

17:40.020 --> 17:42.020
So there are three magnets here

17:42.020 --> 17:44.020
and the thing is just being pulled around.

17:44.020 --> 17:46.020
It's a bit like an asteroid flying around three planets

17:46.020 --> 17:48.020
and which planet is it going to hit

17:48.020 --> 17:50.020
will eventually go for this one here.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.020
And here's three computer simulations

17:52.020 --> 17:54.020
I did where I actually just changed

17:54.020 --> 17:56.020
something like the sixth decimal place

17:56.020 --> 17:58.020
of the coordinate where the pendulum

17:58.020 --> 18:00.020
started.

18:00.020 --> 18:02.020
And you can see...

18:02.020 --> 18:04.020
So I've coloured the magnets up now.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.020
So I've got blue magnet, a yellow magnet

18:06.020 --> 18:08.020
and just a very small change

18:08.020 --> 18:10.020
caused a completely different behaviour,

18:10.020 --> 18:12.020
a different path, different planet

18:12.020 --> 18:14.020
that the asteroid hit.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.020
And here is a computer simulation

18:16.020 --> 18:18.020
which tells you, helps you to predict

18:18.020 --> 18:20.020
maybe

18:20.020 --> 18:22.020
where the pendulum is going to end up.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.020
So there are some regions which are very predictable.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.020
So if you're close to the yellow magnet

18:26.020 --> 18:28.020
so the idea is if you start the pendulum

18:28.020 --> 18:30.020
off

18:30.020 --> 18:32.020
over a particular point

18:32.020 --> 18:34.020
you look at the colour under that point

18:34.020 --> 18:36.020
where the pendulum is going to end up.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.020
So if I start near a yellow magnet

18:38.020 --> 18:40.020
then the thing just wobbles about

18:40.020 --> 18:42.020
and goes back to the yellow magnet.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.020
But there are other regions

18:44.020 --> 18:46.020
which are a little bit further away.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.020
So here's a very large swath of red.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.020
You start there, it'll swing out

18:50.020 --> 18:52.020
but will then end up at the red magnet.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.020
So small changes are not going to be

18:54.020 --> 18:56.020
cause any dramatic difference

18:56.020 --> 18:58.020
in where the magnet will end up.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.020
But I was starting that magnet

19:00.020 --> 19:02.020
in the top left-hand corner

19:02.020 --> 19:04.020
in this region you have what's called a fractal.

19:04.020 --> 19:06.020
So this is a shape

19:06.020 --> 19:08.020
which has infinite complexity.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.020
So as I zoom in on it, it never simplifies.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.020
It never becomes a single colour.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.020
So it means that

19:14.020 --> 19:16.020
however

19:16.020 --> 19:18.020
accurately I try and measure this thing

19:18.020 --> 19:20.020
just a few more decimal places

19:20.020 --> 19:22.020
can kick it quite easily

19:22.020 --> 19:24.020
from going from the yellow to the red magnet.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.020
So this is saying that

19:26.020 --> 19:28.020
unless I have complete

19:28.020 --> 19:30.020
description of how the universe

19:30.020 --> 19:32.020
is set up, I cannot know the future

19:32.020 --> 19:34.020
in this region. Just a small change

19:34.020 --> 19:36.020
in a decimal place will cause a completely

19:36.020 --> 19:38.020
different outcome to happen.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.020
Now I also

19:40.020 --> 19:42.020
was accompanied on my journey into

19:42.020 --> 19:44.020
these edges of knowledge

19:44.020 --> 19:46.020
by a few experts.

19:46.020 --> 19:48.020
I chose a lot of areas I'm not expert at all

19:48.020 --> 19:50.020
and it's very much was a learning curve for me some of this.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.020
And in this chapter

19:52.020 --> 19:54.020
about chaos I actually chose

19:54.020 --> 19:56.020
a colleague of ours here

19:56.020 --> 19:58.020
in Oxford. This is Bob May

19:58.020 --> 20:00.020
Lord May as he's there.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.020
And he actually discovered

20:02.020 --> 20:04.020
this idea of chaos theory

20:04.020 --> 20:06.020
affects so much of what we're trying

20:06.020 --> 20:08.020
to predict about the future. The reason

20:08.020 --> 20:10.020
that I wasn't sure whether it was going to be a monsoon

20:10.020 --> 20:12.020
out there, I mean yesterday

20:12.020 --> 20:14.020
we had monsoons kind of weather hitting us

20:14.020 --> 20:16.020
being able to predict the weather

20:16.020 --> 20:18.020
five days in advance is impossible

20:18.020 --> 20:20.020
because just a very small change

20:20.020 --> 20:22.020
in some of those measurements of the wind speed

20:22.020 --> 20:24.020
temperature can cause within five days

20:24.020 --> 20:26.020
things to go dramatically different.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.020
Now the planets too

20:28.020 --> 20:30.020
are very sensitive but on a

20:30.020 --> 20:32.020
fortunately on a longer scale than five days.

20:32.020 --> 20:34.020
I mean we're talking sort of five billion years

20:34.020 --> 20:36.020
a very small change can actually cause

20:36.020 --> 20:38.020
the solar system to do something completely different.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.020
But Bob May has

20:40.020 --> 20:42.020
discovered that not only in

20:42.020 --> 20:44.020
these kind of physical systems but also in

20:44.020 --> 20:46.020
biology as well. He's a mathematical

20:46.020 --> 20:48.020
biologist. He discovered that

20:48.020 --> 20:50.020
trying to keep track of population dynamics

20:50.020 --> 20:52.020
is also controlled by chaotic

20:52.020 --> 20:54.020
equations. So just a very

20:54.020 --> 20:56.020
small change you put in one extra animal

20:56.020 --> 20:58.020
and the dynamics can be completely different.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.020
You can have the whole system collapsing

21:00.020 --> 21:02.020
whilst without that animal you can have

21:02.020 --> 21:04.020
a very healthy

21:04.020 --> 21:06.020
pack of animals the next year.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.020
And in fact now he's working

21:08.020 --> 21:10.020
he's a cross-party member in the House of Lords

21:10.020 --> 21:12.020
and he spends a lot of time

21:12.020 --> 21:14.020
actually working on the banking crisis

21:14.020 --> 21:16.020
and trying to understand whether that was an example

21:16.020 --> 21:18.020
of a chaotic behaviour.

21:18.020 --> 21:20.020
And sure enough

21:20.020 --> 21:22.020
people in economics there are regions

21:22.020 --> 21:24.020
like those yellow regions where things are very predictable

21:24.020 --> 21:26.020
and then it can go

21:26.020 --> 21:28.020
into very strange unpredictable regions.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.020
And he said this to me whilst we were talking

21:30.020 --> 21:32.020
I went to him and had lunch with him at the House of Lords

21:32.020 --> 21:34.020
and he said not only in research

21:34.020 --> 21:36.020
but in the everyday world of politics and economics

21:36.020 --> 21:38.020
it would be better off if more people

21:38.020 --> 21:40.020
realised that simple systems do not

21:40.020 --> 21:42.020
necessarily possess simple

21:42.020 --> 21:44.020
dynamic properties.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.020
And I asked him how are you getting on

21:46.020 --> 21:48.020
in trying to persuade your fellow

21:48.020 --> 21:50.020
politicians about the importance of knowing

21:50.020 --> 21:52.020
about chaos theory.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.020
And he said Marcus there are just egos here

21:54.020 --> 21:56.020
nobody's interested in what I said

21:56.020 --> 21:58.020
it's just they're all interested in their careers

21:58.020 --> 22:00.020
so he was very down on that.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.020
But I think that is one of the important things

22:02.020 --> 22:04.020
when you're trying to do policy

22:04.020 --> 22:06.020
is knowing when you can be confident

22:06.020 --> 22:08.020
about what's going to happen next.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.020
I'm not saying that mathematics is completely useless

22:10.020 --> 22:12.020
we've been able to land that spaceship

22:12.020 --> 22:14.020
on the side of a comet because

22:14.020 --> 22:16.020
of Newton's equations.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.020
But it's also important to know

22:18.020 --> 22:20.020
maybe in the top left hand corner

22:20.020 --> 22:22.020
of that fractally picture

22:22.020 --> 22:24.020
where now you can say you can't know.

22:24.020 --> 22:26.020
So it's almost as important to know

22:26.020 --> 22:28.020
when you can't know as to know

22:28.020 --> 22:30.020
when you can know because then you can be

22:30.020 --> 22:32.020
conservative and hunker down and kind

22:32.020 --> 22:34.020
of avoid

22:34.020 --> 22:36.020
the mess that might emerge.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.020
So I came back to my dice and I was

22:38.020 --> 22:40.020
very interested okay well what about this

22:40.020 --> 22:42.020
is this just chaotic

22:42.020 --> 22:44.020
or if I knew this

22:44.020 --> 22:46.020
to a certain amount of detail could I actually

22:46.020 --> 22:48.020
predict what it was going to do next.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.020
I have the laws of motion which control

22:50.020 --> 22:52.020
how this falls, how it hits the table

22:52.020 --> 22:54.020
and I

22:54.020 --> 22:56.020
actually discovered a recent piece

22:56.020 --> 22:58.020
of research done by four Hungarians

22:58.020 --> 23:00.020
which revealed that actually this is more

23:00.020 --> 23:02.020
predictable than I thought it was going to be.

23:02.020 --> 23:04.020
So what they've done is

23:04.020 --> 23:06.020
I mean I had that picture with the three magnets

23:06.020 --> 23:08.020
which I had three colours for

23:08.020 --> 23:10.020
so now we've got six sides

23:10.020 --> 23:12.020
and so we've got six colours to keep track of

23:12.020 --> 23:14.020
so we can draw a picture of how we start

23:14.020 --> 23:16.020
off a dice and what

23:16.020 --> 23:18.020
what that effect will have

23:18.020 --> 23:20.020
on the outcome, which coloured face will it

23:20.020 --> 23:22.020
land on and it turns out that

23:22.020 --> 23:24.020
if the table that you're throwing it on

23:24.020 --> 23:26.020
is

23:26.020 --> 23:28.020
that dissipates quite a lot of energy

23:28.020 --> 23:30.020
so it's sort of when it falls the energy

23:30.020 --> 23:32.020
kind of gets sucked out of it so like a carpet

23:32.020 --> 23:34.020
for example then actually

23:34.020 --> 23:36.020
the behaviour of this is described

23:36.020 --> 23:38.020
by the picture in the top left

23:38.020 --> 23:40.020
hand corner so actually

23:40.020 --> 23:42.020
if the energy is being dissipated so if I throw

23:42.020 --> 23:44.020
this on the floor here

23:44.020 --> 23:46.020
it doesn't bounce very much

23:46.020 --> 23:48.020
and actually it turns out

23:48.020 --> 23:50.020
that we don't have this fractal quality

23:50.020 --> 23:52.020
there's sways of yellow

23:52.020 --> 23:54.020
sways of green, sways of blue

23:54.020 --> 23:56.020
and so a small change is not going to change

23:56.020 --> 23:58.020
where that dice is going to land up

23:58.020 --> 24:00.020
so here's a tip do you want to know which way it's going to land

24:00.020 --> 24:02.020
what you need to look at is the bottom

24:02.020 --> 24:04.020
number because it's more likely to land

24:04.020 --> 24:06.020
when you throw it like that

24:06.020 --> 24:08.020
on the bottom number

24:08.020 --> 24:10.020
in fact I had a one on the bottom and it came up one

24:10.020 --> 24:12.020
so there you are, quids in

24:12.020 --> 24:14.020
but if you think about it

24:14.020 --> 24:16.020
at the craps table in the

24:18.020 --> 24:20.020
you've got to sort of felt on there

24:20.020 --> 24:22.020
it's dissipating some sort of energy

24:22.020 --> 24:24.020
but here this is very hard this table

24:24.020 --> 24:26.020
so as you move through here

24:26.020 --> 24:28.020
the rigidity of the table is increasing

24:28.020 --> 24:30.020
and so it's losing less energy as you go through

24:30.020 --> 24:32.020
so let's try and do that again

24:32.020 --> 24:34.020
so down in here we get a very fractal region

24:34.020 --> 24:36.020
so now a very small change

24:36.020 --> 24:38.020
so

24:38.020 --> 24:40.020
so it landed a four

24:40.020 --> 24:42.020
whilst I had the one on the bottom

24:42.020 --> 24:44.020
at that time

24:44.020 --> 24:46.020
so it depends on the circumstances

24:46.020 --> 24:48.020
but there are regions where I can

24:48.020 --> 24:50.020
know what this dice is going to do next

24:50.020 --> 24:52.020
and actually that's kind of your

24:52.020 --> 24:54.020
one thought is

24:54.020 --> 24:56.020
I've sort of brought up on the universe is controlled

24:56.020 --> 24:58.020
by equations and if you know the complete setup

24:58.020 --> 25:00.020
you should be able to know exactly

25:00.020 --> 25:02.020
what's going to happen next

25:02.020 --> 25:04.020
of course we may not know the complete setup

25:04.020 --> 25:06.020
of the universe

25:06.020 --> 25:08.020
a small change means that you might lose a lot of

25:08.020 --> 25:10.020
knowledge about what's happening next

25:10.020 --> 25:12.020
but in fact there's part of science which says

25:12.020 --> 25:14.020
even if you know the complete setup

25:14.020 --> 25:16.020
of the universe

25:16.020 --> 25:18.020
there are still certain circumstances

25:18.020 --> 25:20.020
where there's no way you're going to know

25:20.020 --> 25:22.020
what's going to happen next

25:22.020 --> 25:24.020
and one of them is

25:24.020 --> 25:26.020
the chapter that I explored

25:26.020 --> 25:28.020
next

25:28.020 --> 25:30.020
was trying to predict the behaviour

25:30.020 --> 25:32.020
of a pot of uranium

25:32.020 --> 25:34.020
on the internet

25:34.020 --> 25:36.020
so this pot of uranium

25:36.020 --> 25:38.020
I audited it over the internet

25:38.020 --> 25:40.020
and I'm assured it's

25:44.020 --> 25:46.020
I'm assured that it's completely safe

25:46.020 --> 25:48.020
but the instructions say

25:48.020 --> 25:50.020
don't eat it

25:50.020 --> 25:52.020
but this actually

25:52.020 --> 25:54.020
at its heart

25:54.020 --> 25:56.020
is the question of when this

25:56.020 --> 25:58.020
is going to radiate

25:58.020 --> 26:00.020
at the side it says

26:00.020 --> 26:02.020
it's going to emit 984

26:02.020 --> 26:04.020
counts of radiation

26:04.020 --> 26:06.020
so if you have a Geiger counter

26:06.020 --> 26:08.020
you get 984 counts per minute

26:08.020 --> 26:10.020
so it's got some sort of

26:10.020 --> 26:12.020
estimate of what it's going to do

26:12.020 --> 26:14.020
but that's only an approximate estimate

26:14.020 --> 26:16.020
so it says over a minute

26:16.020 --> 26:18.020
on average that's what you'll get

26:18.020 --> 26:20.020
what it can't tell me is

26:20.020 --> 26:22.020
when it's going to emit an alpha particle

26:22.020 --> 26:24.020
for example

26:24.020 --> 26:26.020
and the extraordinary thing is

26:26.020 --> 26:28.020
the current state of physics says

26:28.020 --> 26:30.020
how the universe is

26:30.020 --> 26:32.020
that there is no mechanism

26:32.020 --> 26:34.020
nothing that we can do

26:34.020 --> 26:36.020
which is going to tell us

26:36.020 --> 26:38.020
when this uranium is going to emit

26:38.020 --> 26:40.020
it's next particle

26:40.020 --> 26:42.020
that this we say is random

26:42.020 --> 26:44.020
but that's actually just an expression

26:44.020 --> 26:46.020
of our lack of knowledge of the startup

26:46.020 --> 26:48.020
this seems to be something

26:48.020 --> 26:50.020
which the physics says is genuinely random

26:50.020 --> 26:52.020
and actually the person at the heart

26:52.020 --> 26:54.020
of trying to explain what this bit of uranium

26:54.020 --> 26:56.020
is doing, why it's emitting at particular points

26:56.020 --> 26:58.020
this is a picture of Heisenberg

26:58.020 --> 27:00.020
I'm trying to embrace and love Heisenberg

27:00.020 --> 27:02.020
but he's another person I don't really like

27:02.020 --> 27:04.020
and this equation

27:04.020 --> 27:06.020
so you've probably heard of this thing

27:06.020 --> 27:08.020
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

27:08.020 --> 27:10.020
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

27:10.020 --> 27:12.020
almost embeds the idea that

27:12.020 --> 27:14.020
there are things you cannot know

27:14.020 --> 27:16.020
that you will never be able to know

27:16.020 --> 27:18.020
about a physical system

27:18.020 --> 27:20.020
and it's not a vague wishy-washy

27:20.020 --> 27:22.020
thing about cats and Schrodinger

27:22.020 --> 27:24.020
it's actually a very explicit mathematical formula

27:24.020 --> 27:26.020
and follows out of the mathematics

27:26.020 --> 27:28.020
so these two terms here

27:28.020 --> 27:30.020
delta x and delta p

27:30.020 --> 27:32.020
this is about a position and momentum

27:32.020 --> 27:34.020
so basically

27:34.020 --> 27:36.020
these two things are kind of paired up

27:36.020 --> 27:38.020
and the more knowledge you get

27:38.020 --> 27:40.020
about the position of something

27:40.020 --> 27:42.020
the less you know about the potential momentum

27:42.020 --> 27:44.020
the momentum you remember

27:44.020 --> 27:46.020
is how something is travelling

27:46.020 --> 27:48.020
it involves the speed of the thing

27:48.020 --> 27:50.020
and in fact

27:50.020 --> 27:52.020
I've got to tell you one of my favourite jokes

27:52.020 --> 27:54.020
Heisenberg is storming down the autobahn

27:54.020 --> 27:56.020
in Germany and the police

27:56.020 --> 27:58.020
pull him over and they get him

27:58.020 --> 28:00.020
out of the car and say

28:00.020 --> 28:02.020
sir do you know how fast you were going

28:02.020 --> 28:04.020
there's no but I know exactly where I was

28:04.020 --> 28:06.020
now that's good

28:06.020 --> 28:08.020
a good sign that you're all laughing

28:08.020 --> 28:10.020
because if anyone who didn't laugh

28:10.020 --> 28:12.020
and I now have to explain the joke a little bit

28:12.020 --> 28:14.020
is that there's a trade-off here

28:14.020 --> 28:16.020
and this is what this equation says

28:16.020 --> 28:18.020
the more I know about

28:18.020 --> 28:20.020
the position of something

28:20.020 --> 28:22.020
that's the delta x is controlling

28:22.020 --> 28:24.020
what the error is so the more I know

28:24.020 --> 28:26.020
about it and the smaller the error

28:26.020 --> 28:28.020
in order to make this equation true

28:28.020 --> 28:30.020
the momentum has to increase

28:30.020 --> 28:32.020
the uncertainty

28:32.020 --> 28:34.020
in the momentum has to increase

28:34.020 --> 28:36.020
the knowledge I have of the momentum

28:36.020 --> 28:38.020
I lose knowledge about it

28:38.020 --> 28:40.020
and actually it's perfectly summed up

28:40.020 --> 28:42.020
in some of these lovely experiments

28:42.020 --> 28:44.020
now you might have heard about this thing

28:44.020 --> 28:46.020
called the double slit experiment

28:46.020 --> 28:48.020
where you send an electron through

28:48.020 --> 28:50.020
and it doesn't really decide

28:50.020 --> 28:52.020
it seems to go through both slits at the same time

28:52.020 --> 28:54.020
and actually this thing about uncertainty

28:54.020 --> 28:56.020
is even revealed with just one single slit

28:56.020 --> 28:58.020
so all I'm going to do

28:58.020 --> 29:00.020
is to take my uranium off in a very far distance

29:00.020 --> 29:02.020
so that's going to be my particle gun

29:02.020 --> 29:04.020
I'm going to have say

29:04.020 --> 29:06.020
an alpha particle shooting out of here

29:06.020 --> 29:08.020
and I've got this a large distance away

29:08.020 --> 29:10.020
I've got a screen

29:10.020 --> 29:12.020
with a slit in it

29:12.020 --> 29:14.020
and it means that if a particle passes through there

29:14.020 --> 29:16.020
then there can be

29:16.020 --> 29:18.020
no momentum in the up-down direction

29:18.020 --> 29:20.020
because any momentum in the up-down direction

29:20.020 --> 29:22.020
would push it off

29:22.020 --> 29:24.020
and it would hit the screen and not go through

29:24.020 --> 29:26.020
so if any particle that goes through

29:26.020 --> 29:28.020
that slit

29:28.020 --> 29:30.020
I know has almost

29:30.020 --> 29:32.020
zero momentum

29:32.020 --> 29:34.020
in the vertical position

29:34.020 --> 29:36.020
because that's the only way

29:36.020 --> 29:38.020
if it had any momentum it would not go through that slit

29:38.020 --> 29:40.020
because the distance I've made very large

29:40.020 --> 29:42.020
but as soon as it goes through that slit

29:42.020 --> 29:44.020
I also have now gained

29:44.020 --> 29:46.020
a very tight knowledge

29:46.020 --> 29:48.020
about where that particle is

29:48.020 --> 29:50.020
because it's gone through that slit

29:50.020 --> 29:52.020
so I seem to have got the trade-off

29:52.020 --> 29:54.020
I know exactly the momentum

29:54.020 --> 29:56.020
and I know exactly the position of this thing

29:56.020 --> 29:58.020
but as soon as I know the position

29:58.020 --> 30:00.020
it causes a sudden uncertainty to occur

30:00.020 --> 30:02.020
in the momentum

30:02.020 --> 30:04.020
so sunny this thing gains momentum

30:04.020 --> 30:06.020
when it didn't have it before

30:06.020 --> 30:08.020
and the uncertainty is expressed here

30:08.020 --> 30:10.020
so this is actually experimental data

30:10.020 --> 30:12.020
where they took particles

30:12.020 --> 30:14.020
the smaller the slit

30:14.020 --> 30:16.020
the more information I have

30:16.020 --> 30:18.020
about where that particle is

30:18.020 --> 30:20.020
which means there must be a larger trade-off

30:20.020 --> 30:22.020
in the spread of momentum

30:22.020 --> 30:24.020
and you can see this

30:24.020 --> 30:26.020
the narrower slit is the bottom

30:26.020 --> 30:28.020
graph and then suddenly the momentum is spread

30:28.020 --> 30:30.020
all over the place so where the particle arrives

30:30.020 --> 30:32.020
on the screen could be in a wide

30:32.020 --> 30:34.020
range of possible values

30:34.020 --> 30:36.020
but as I lose information about

30:36.020 --> 30:38.020
position by widening the slit

30:38.020 --> 30:40.020
the momentum comes back in again

30:40.020 --> 30:42.020
and I have more information about the momentum

30:42.020 --> 30:44.020
now this is absolutely extraordinary

30:44.020 --> 30:46.020
it kind of says that I can't know

30:46.020 --> 30:48.020
these two things together

30:48.020 --> 30:50.020
but actually

30:50.020 --> 30:52.020
some physicists have started to interpret this

30:52.020 --> 30:54.020
and saying actually this is a mistaken language

30:54.020 --> 30:56.020
that actually

30:56.020 --> 30:58.020
these particles don't have

30:58.020 --> 31:00.020
a momentum and a position

31:00.020 --> 31:02.020
we're so hooked on the way Newton thought about the world

31:02.020 --> 31:04.020
we just think yes

31:04.020 --> 31:06.020
you've got this electron, it's got some position

31:06.020 --> 31:08.020
it is somewhere

31:08.020 --> 31:10.020
in the momentum and you use that to try and make predictions

31:10.020 --> 31:12.020
but physicists now say

31:12.020 --> 31:14.020
no you shouldn't think of it like that

31:14.020 --> 31:16.020
it's a wrong language

31:16.020 --> 31:18.020
so often some of these kind of unknowns

31:18.020 --> 31:20.020
turn out to be just that we aren't able to use language properly

31:20.020 --> 31:22.020
and so

31:22.020 --> 31:24.020
people now think that you should say

31:24.020 --> 31:26.020
well that electron doesn't have

31:26.020 --> 31:28.020
a position

31:28.020 --> 31:30.020
an identifiable position until you observe

31:30.020 --> 31:32.020
where it is and so we have this scene now

31:32.020 --> 31:34.020
called a quantum wave

31:34.020 --> 31:36.020
which actually describes the probability

31:36.020 --> 31:38.020
that where you'll find that electron

31:38.020 --> 31:40.020
should you

31:40.020 --> 31:42.020
or that particle, alpha particle

31:42.020 --> 31:44.020
should you want to observe it

31:44.020 --> 31:46.020
so you should think of this thing as not having a position

31:46.020 --> 31:48.020
it's got a sort of probabilistic position

31:48.020 --> 31:50.020
spread out over space

31:50.020 --> 31:52.020
the peaks of this wave function

31:52.020 --> 31:54.020
tell you it's more likely to be there

31:54.020 --> 31:56.020
the troughs tell you it's less likely to be there

31:56.020 --> 31:58.020
and this is all you can know

31:58.020 --> 32:00.020
and you can't know where that

32:00.020 --> 32:02.020
where that electron is going to be

32:02.020 --> 32:04.020
more dramatically you can't know

32:04.020 --> 32:06.020
when you observe it

32:06.020 --> 32:08.020
where it's going to be

32:08.020 --> 32:10.020
it could be in any of these kind of peaks

32:10.020 --> 32:12.020
or even in the troughs as well

32:12.020 --> 32:14.020
and so quantum physics at the moment

32:14.020 --> 32:16.020
has at its heart this belief

32:16.020 --> 32:18.020
that it doesn't matter what you do

32:18.020 --> 32:20.020
you will not be able to know and predict

32:20.020 --> 32:22.020
and you can run the experiment over and over again

32:22.020 --> 32:24.020
and you'll get different answers

32:24.020 --> 32:26.020
with the same setup

32:26.020 --> 32:28.020
if you could ever start the thing in the same way

32:28.020 --> 32:30.020
and actually this is responsible for the uranium

32:30.020 --> 32:32.020
emitting particles

32:32.020 --> 32:34.020
you know a lot about the momentum

32:34.020 --> 32:36.020
of the things inside the nucleus of this uranium

32:36.020 --> 32:38.020
which causes an uncertainty in the position

32:38.020 --> 32:40.020
such that at some points

32:40.020 --> 32:42.020
suddenly the particle would say

32:42.020 --> 32:44.020
hey I seem to be outside the nucleus

32:44.020 --> 32:46.020
I'm not inside it anymore and it goes flying off

32:46.020 --> 32:48.020
so this is actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

32:48.020 --> 32:50.020
helps to understand

32:50.020 --> 32:52.020
why this thing is actually emitting particles

32:54.020 --> 32:56.020
now there are some people who just believe

32:56.020 --> 32:58.020
this can't be how the universe is really behaving

32:58.020 --> 33:00.020
surely this just can't be random

33:00.020 --> 33:02.020
about what this is doing

33:02.020 --> 33:04.020
and there must be some mechanism

33:04.020 --> 33:06.020
for deciding ok it might look probabilistic

33:06.020 --> 33:08.020
the same as the dice

33:08.020 --> 33:10.020
the best things we had to predict the dice

33:10.020 --> 33:12.020
is probability but we know that there are laws of physics

33:12.020 --> 33:14.020
controlling what that dice is going to do

33:14.020 --> 33:16.020
and one of those who really believed

33:16.020 --> 33:18.020
this just can't be the answer

33:18.020 --> 33:20.020
was Einstein and Einstein had this famous quote

33:20.020 --> 33:22.020
quantum mechanics is very impressive

33:22.020 --> 33:24.020
and it certainly is

33:24.020 --> 33:26.020
it's one of the most well tested theories

33:26.020 --> 33:28.020
we have on the scientific books

33:28.020 --> 33:30.020
it was such accuracy that

33:30.020 --> 33:32.020
we know we're on to something

33:32.020 --> 33:34.020
but an inner voice tells me

33:34.020 --> 33:36.020
that it is not yet the real thing

33:36.020 --> 33:38.020
the theory produces a good deal

33:38.020 --> 33:40.020
but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the old one

33:40.020 --> 33:42.020
I am at all events convinced

33:42.020 --> 33:44.020
that he does not play dice

33:44.020 --> 33:46.020
and I think

33:46.020 --> 33:48.020
maybe it's the mathematician in me

33:48.020 --> 33:50.020
I also

33:50.020 --> 33:52.020
I'm still with Einstein with this

33:52.020 --> 33:54.020
that surely we will come

33:54.020 --> 33:56.020
to a point where we have a new theory

33:56.020 --> 33:58.020
a new Einstein that tells us something

33:58.020 --> 34:00.020
about the mechanism which is going on

34:00.020 --> 34:02.020
which is controlling this

34:02.020 --> 34:04.020
but we know that the mechanism is going to be really

34:04.020 --> 34:06.020
freaky

34:06.020 --> 34:08.020
we know this thing called entanglement

34:08.020 --> 34:10.020
which shows us that any mechanism

34:10.020 --> 34:12.020
there can't be a little internal clock in there

34:12.020 --> 34:14.020
which is just saying now you're spitting out

34:14.020 --> 34:16.020
now you're not whenever you look

34:16.020 --> 34:18.020
this system if it is there

34:18.020 --> 34:20.020
we know must be spread across the whole

34:20.020 --> 34:22.020
of the universe which is controlling

34:22.020 --> 34:24.020
what this thing is doing

34:24.020 --> 34:26.020
now I mentioned right at the beginning

34:26.020 --> 34:28.020
that part of this exploration was about this idea

34:28.020 --> 34:30.020
of God being the things that we cannot know

34:30.020 --> 34:32.020
so here is something that apparently

34:32.020 --> 34:34.020
we are not able to know

34:34.020 --> 34:36.020
when this thing is going to spit out

34:36.020 --> 34:38.020
a bit of its nucleus

34:38.020 --> 34:40.020
so the

34:40.020 --> 34:42.020
actually the person I took on my journey

34:42.020 --> 34:44.020
to this edge of knowledge

34:44.020 --> 34:46.020
is a quantum physicist

34:46.020 --> 34:48.020
but he's also a priest

34:48.020 --> 34:50.020
so this is John Polkinghorn

34:50.020 --> 34:52.020
he likes to call himself a vegetarian butcher

34:52.020 --> 34:54.020
how can somebody be a quantum physicist

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
and also a priest at the same time

34:56.020 --> 34:58.020
John Polkinghorn he has incredibly good credentials

34:58.020 --> 35:00.020
he's trained with Dirac

35:00.020 --> 35:02.020
in Cambridge then went and trained with Feynman

35:02.020 --> 35:04.020
he made great discoveries

35:04.020 --> 35:06.020
about quarks

35:06.020 --> 35:08.020
and then halfway through

35:08.020 --> 35:10.020
his scientific life

35:10.020 --> 35:12.020
he then decided that he wanted to be ordained

35:12.020 --> 35:14.020
so I was very intrigued to talk to him

35:14.020 --> 35:16.020
about how

35:16.020 --> 35:18.020
does he believe

35:18.020 --> 35:20.020
his God works in the world

35:20.020 --> 35:22.020
because there are a lot of religious scientists

35:22.020 --> 35:24.020
and I must say although I believe in the arsenal

35:24.020 --> 35:26.020
I am an atheist at heart

35:26.020 --> 35:28.020
and I will declare that

35:28.020 --> 35:30.020
but there are quite a lot of religious scientists

35:30.020 --> 35:32.020
but they divide into two groups

35:32.020 --> 35:34.020
and one are the Daists

35:34.020 --> 35:36.020
and one are the Theists

35:36.020 --> 35:38.020
the Daists say okay look

35:38.020 --> 35:40.020
I don't know where this universe came from

35:40.020 --> 35:42.020
I don't know what started it

35:42.020 --> 35:44.020
or what created it but once it's been created

35:44.020 --> 35:46.020
there's no okay I'm going to call that God

35:46.020 --> 35:48.020
because I really don't know what it is

35:48.020 --> 35:50.020
but after that

35:50.020 --> 35:52.020
basically the laws of physics take over

35:52.020 --> 35:54.020
and the whole thing is now something I can talk about

35:54.020 --> 35:56.020
and so they don't think God

35:56.020 --> 35:58.020
acts in this world in any sort of meaningful way

35:58.020 --> 36:00.020
but John Paul Kinghorn is a theist

36:00.020 --> 36:02.020
and he really believes

36:02.020 --> 36:04.020
whatever this thing God is

36:04.020 --> 36:06.020
that it acts in the world

36:06.020 --> 36:08.020
and so I was trying to press him

36:08.020 --> 36:10.020
okay well how, you're a scientist

36:10.020 --> 36:12.020
how is he acting in the world

36:12.020 --> 36:14.020
how is this thing it acting in the world

36:14.020 --> 36:16.020
and you know we're thinking of it as the unknowns

36:16.020 --> 36:18.020
so that's very interesting

36:18.020 --> 36:20.020
so here we have an unknown quantum physics

36:20.020 --> 36:22.020
I don't know when this particle

36:22.020 --> 36:24.020
is going to emit or where

36:24.020 --> 36:26.020
I'm going to find a particle

36:26.020 --> 36:28.020
is that an unknown that can have influence in the world

36:28.020 --> 36:30.020
well yes it can

36:30.020 --> 36:32.020
I mean whether it has any sort of

36:32.020 --> 36:34.020
belief

36:34.020 --> 36:36.020
whether there's any sort of meaning

36:36.020 --> 36:38.020
to what that action is

36:38.020 --> 36:40.020
so I was intrigued you know are you going to say

36:40.020 --> 36:42.020
maybe your God is using quantum physics

36:42.020 --> 36:44.020
so it can make a decision

36:44.020 --> 36:46.020
that the electron here and here

36:46.020 --> 36:48.020
and that might actually have a dramatic effect

36:48.020 --> 36:50.020
on the universe because chaos says that

36:50.020 --> 36:52.020
small changes can have big effects

36:52.020 --> 36:54.020
so I thought he was going to say yes

36:54.020 --> 36:56.020
quantum physics perfect place my God

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
to act in the world

36:58.020 --> 37:00.020
but he wasn't going to buy that a toy

37:00.020 --> 37:02.020
so no no no because that really depends

37:02.020 --> 37:04.020
all of these

37:04.020 --> 37:06.020
observations

37:06.020 --> 37:08.020
decisions about where the electron is going to be

37:08.020 --> 37:10.020
depend on an observation

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
it depends on interacting with the thing

37:12.020 --> 37:14.020
my wave function

37:14.020 --> 37:16.020
a deterministic wave function

37:16.020 --> 37:18.020
and actually we're all part of a system

37:18.020 --> 37:20.020
so surely what is an observation anyway

37:20.020 --> 37:22.020
surely we're all just part of some huge great big universal wave function

37:22.020 --> 37:24.020
so he wasn't into using

37:24.020 --> 37:26.020
quantum physics as the way that his God

37:26.020 --> 37:28.020
was acting in the world

37:28.020 --> 37:30.020
so I said okay well how are you doing this

37:30.020 --> 37:32.020
how is it doing it

37:32.020 --> 37:34.020
and he actually went back to chaos theory

37:34.020 --> 37:36.020
intriguingly so his theory is that

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
as humans we can never know

37:38.020 --> 37:40.020
the setup of a system

37:40.020 --> 37:42.020
with complete accuracy

37:42.020 --> 37:44.020
there will always be decimal places

37:44.020 --> 37:46.020
which we don't know about

37:46.020 --> 37:48.020
and he believes that that's where

37:48.020 --> 37:50.020
a God could act and tinker with things

37:50.020 --> 37:52.020
and change things so it could be different

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
as the thing evolves

37:54.020 --> 37:56.020
actually Newton used to think this as well

37:56.020 --> 37:58.020
and Leibniz who was his great competitor

37:58.020 --> 38:00.020
over the calculus just said that's totally ridiculous

38:00.020 --> 38:02.020
why on earth would he have to tinker

38:02.020 --> 38:04.020
why because he just set the whole thing up

38:04.020 --> 38:06.020
and let it go running in the way that it was meant to

38:06.020 --> 38:08.020
at the beginning

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
so he knew exactly what was going to happen anyway

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020
so

38:12.020 --> 38:14.020
it was a kind of intriguing journey

38:14.020 --> 38:16.020
talking to him about how would you use

38:16.020 --> 38:18.020
science to kind of

38:18.020 --> 38:20.020
marry up with your theistic beliefs

38:20.020 --> 38:22.020
in a God acting in the world

38:22.020 --> 38:24.020
but the interesting thing is that I went into this journey

38:24.020 --> 38:26.020
is that one of that reason

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
that a lot of the scientific religious people

38:28.020 --> 38:30.020
who are daest to say okay I don't know

38:30.020 --> 38:32.020
where all of this came from

38:32.020 --> 38:34.020
let's call that creator

38:34.020 --> 38:36.020
a God and then I'm just going to do science

38:36.020 --> 38:38.020
and so that unknown

38:38.020 --> 38:40.020
because it is you know we don't know

38:40.020 --> 38:42.020
where it all came from

38:42.020 --> 38:44.020
but actually this Heisenberg uncertainty principle

38:44.020 --> 38:46.020
gives us a chance to actually see

38:46.020 --> 38:48.020
where this stuff came from

38:48.020 --> 38:50.020
because okay where did my pot of uranium come from

38:50.020 --> 38:52.020
well I went on Amazon

38:52.020 --> 38:54.020
so I bought it on Amazon

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
so that's its first source

38:56.020 --> 38:58.020
and actually it's amazing kind of reviews

38:58.020 --> 39:00.020
you can find on Amazon

39:00.020 --> 39:02.020
so glad five stars

39:02.020 --> 39:04.020
so glad I don't have to buy this from the Libyans

39:04.020 --> 39:06.020
in the parking lot at the mall anymore

39:06.020 --> 39:08.020
there were some others complaining

39:08.020 --> 39:10.020
about the fact that the thing had disappeared

39:10.020 --> 39:12.020
you know gone down by half

39:12.020 --> 39:14.020
he was so good

39:14.020 --> 39:16.020
you're laughing and I don't have to explain about half-lifes

39:16.020 --> 39:18.020
oh that's so good

39:18.020 --> 39:20.020
anyway so yeah

39:20.020 --> 39:22.020
but if I trace this back okay

39:22.020 --> 39:24.020
as I talked to somebody on Tuesday about this

39:24.020 --> 39:26.020
and he said he was a miner

39:26.020 --> 39:28.020
and he said well it's clear it came from a mine

39:28.020 --> 39:30.020
okay yeah but where did it come from

39:30.020 --> 39:32.020
before the mine and you trace it back

39:32.020 --> 39:34.020
so it was made in a star

39:34.020 --> 39:36.020
the most amazing thing you know how stars make all of these extraordinary

39:36.020 --> 39:38.020
atoms

39:38.020 --> 39:40.020
but what about before that so we trace it back

39:40.020 --> 39:42.020
where did all of this stuff come from

39:42.020 --> 39:44.020
and it turns out that actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

39:44.020 --> 39:46.020
might be

39:46.020 --> 39:48.020
the equation

39:48.020 --> 39:50.020
which helps us to get something from nothing

39:50.020 --> 39:52.020
this is one of the big unsolved questions

39:52.020 --> 39:54.020
why is there something

39:54.020 --> 39:56.020
rather than nothing

39:56.020 --> 39:58.020
and actually if you've got two things

39:58.020 --> 40:00.020
that things get measurements get paired up

40:00.020 --> 40:02.020
if it sort of matters what order I do it in

40:02.020 --> 40:04.020
so a measuring position and momentum

40:04.020 --> 40:06.020
somehow it matters what order I do

40:06.020 --> 40:08.020
and they get combined in an uncertainty principle

40:08.020 --> 40:10.020
but there's another uncertainty principle

40:10.020 --> 40:12.020
which combines energy and time

40:12.020 --> 40:14.020
so this is expressed here

40:14.020 --> 40:16.020
so any increase in the amount

40:16.020 --> 40:18.020
if you want to narrow in on a little window of time

40:18.020 --> 40:20.020
the energy within that window

40:20.020 --> 40:22.020
becomes less certain

40:22.020 --> 40:24.020
so if you've got a region where there's nothing going on there

40:24.020 --> 40:26.020
so you've got no energy

40:26.020 --> 40:28.020
but actually if you decrease the window of time

40:28.020 --> 40:30.020
that means that the energy uncertainty

40:30.020 --> 40:32.020
must increase and so nothing might suddenly become

40:32.020 --> 40:34.020
a little bit of something

40:34.020 --> 40:36.020
a little bit of error

40:36.020 --> 40:38.020
and of course Einstein said

40:38.020 --> 40:40.020
energy equals mc2

40:40.020 --> 40:42.020
energy is equivalent to mass

40:42.020 --> 40:44.020
so you've got mass inside here

40:44.020 --> 40:46.020
so as we look in a little window

40:46.020 --> 40:48.020
actually we can suddenly get these quantum fluctuations

40:48.020 --> 40:50.020
where nothing can suddenly give rise

40:50.020 --> 40:52.020
to matter

40:52.020 --> 40:54.020
and this is actually

40:54.020 --> 40:56.020
you may know what Stephen Hawking

40:56.020 --> 40:58.020
is famous for

40:58.020 --> 41:00.020
he's famous for predicting that black holes

41:00.020 --> 41:02.020
another place actually where we seem to lose information

41:02.020 --> 41:04.020
if you go past the horizon

41:04.020 --> 41:06.020
of a black hole inside

41:06.020 --> 41:08.020
we seem to not be able to know what is going on inside a black hole

41:08.020 --> 41:10.020
because information can't get out

41:10.020 --> 41:12.020
one theory has it

41:12.020 --> 41:14.020
but Hawking thinks there may be a way things can get out

41:14.020 --> 41:16.020
and it's because of the uncertainty principle

41:16.020 --> 41:18.020
at the horizon is that

41:18.020 --> 41:20.020
although there's nothing there

41:20.020 --> 41:22.020
every now and again

41:22.020 --> 41:24.020
this quantum fluctuation can cause a particle

41:24.020 --> 41:26.020
an antiparticle to appear out of nothing

41:26.020 --> 41:28.020
it's a bit like taking the equation 0

41:28.020 --> 41:30.020
equals 1 minus 1

41:30.020 --> 41:32.020
so you can have nothing and then suddenly get 1

41:32.020 --> 41:34.020
and minus 1 and that antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole

41:34.020 --> 41:36.020
makes it a little bit smaller

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
and the particle gets emitted out

41:38.020 --> 41:40.020
so we believe in this thing Hawking radiation

41:40.020 --> 41:42.020
we haven't measured it yet which is why he hasn't got

41:42.020 --> 41:44.020
a Nobel Prize yet but when we do measure it

41:44.020 --> 41:46.020
he will because this is a way that

41:46.020 --> 41:48.020
black holes will actually kind of evaporate

41:48.020 --> 41:50.020
and may give back information

41:50.020 --> 41:52.020
we think that there's

41:52.020 --> 41:54.020
something called the information paradox

41:54.020 --> 41:56.020
that black holes may be somewhere where we lose information

41:56.020 --> 41:58.020
but actually this leaking

41:58.020 --> 42:00.020
according to this equation

42:00.020 --> 42:02.020
equation might be a way of us getting back information

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
but here is an equation

42:04.020 --> 42:06.020
which then gives us a way of getting uranium out of nothing

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
now you might say

42:08.020 --> 42:10.020
well yeah but that isn't really nothing because you've got space there

42:10.020 --> 42:12.020
space just vacuum

42:12.020 --> 42:14.020
isn't nothing it's a three dimensional

42:14.020 --> 42:16.020
space and so that is something still

42:16.020 --> 42:18.020
and as a mathematician I certainly

42:18.020 --> 42:20.020
believe that it is a something

42:20.020 --> 42:22.020
so that isn't really nothing so where did that something

42:22.020 --> 42:24.020
where did that empty space

42:24.020 --> 42:26.020
where did that empty geometry come from

42:26.020 --> 42:28.020
but even now as we push

42:28.020 --> 42:30.020
one of the big mysteries is how to equate

42:30.020 --> 42:32.020
relativity and quantum physics

42:32.020 --> 42:34.020
and the idea of quantum gravity

42:34.020 --> 42:36.020
fluctuations in quantum gravity

42:36.020 --> 42:38.020
mean that even space itself

42:38.020 --> 42:40.020
might emerge as a fluctuation

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
out of genuinely something which is nothing

42:42.020 --> 42:44.020
so actually

42:44.020 --> 42:46.020
it might be that our desire

42:46.020 --> 42:48.020
for some creator

42:48.020 --> 42:50.020
is well actually the creator is just mathematics

42:50.020 --> 42:52.020
mathematics is outside of time

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
it's been there forever will be there forever

42:54.020 --> 42:56.020
and this is a way of just

42:56.020 --> 42:58.020
blowing something into those equations

42:58.020 --> 43:00.020
and then you get something out of nothing

43:00.020 --> 43:02.020
so you know often they say God is a mathematician

43:02.020 --> 43:04.020
I would reverse that and say no no mathematics

43:04.020 --> 43:06.020
is the God which started all of this

43:06.020 --> 43:08.020
so that's a couple of the

43:08.020 --> 43:10.020
unknowns so

43:10.020 --> 43:12.020
let me just give you a little guide

43:12.020 --> 43:14.020
through a couple more and then I'll show you one of my

43:14.020 --> 43:16.020
so let's see

43:16.020 --> 43:18.020
one of the other ones is I

43:18.020 --> 43:20.020
dig down into my uranium and ask

43:20.020 --> 43:22.020
how far can you go can you infinitely divide uranium

43:22.020 --> 43:24.020
if you go inside it that atom

43:24.020 --> 43:26.020
is made out of electrons and quarks

43:26.020 --> 43:28.020
we think that's the bottom layer but

43:28.020 --> 43:30.020
how do we know that and we'll maybe

43:30.020 --> 43:32.020
we thought atoms were the bottom layer

43:32.020 --> 43:34.020
so that one's

43:34.020 --> 43:36.020
we might keep on dividing space

43:36.020 --> 43:38.020
although we think there's a little quantized space

43:38.020 --> 43:40.020
beyond which you can't divide anything

43:40.020 --> 43:42.020
what about going out is the universe infinite

43:42.020 --> 43:44.020
if it is could we ever know that

43:44.020 --> 43:46.020
so that's one of my other edges

43:46.020 --> 43:48.020
time

43:48.020 --> 43:50.020
what about time itself

43:50.020 --> 43:52.020
so you know we think time

43:52.020 --> 43:54.020
had a beginning the big bang

43:54.020 --> 43:56.020
but can we talk about what happened before

43:56.020 --> 43:58.020
the big bang

43:58.020 --> 44:00.020
now I was brought up in this department

44:00.020 --> 44:02.020
on the kind of idea you can't

44:02.020 --> 44:04.020
it doesn't make sense because you need time

44:04.020 --> 44:06.020
to say before and so if there wasn't

44:06.020 --> 44:08.020
any time you can't say before

44:08.020 --> 44:10.020
that's really clever

44:10.020 --> 44:12.020
I like that and they would always go

44:12.020 --> 44:14.020
yeah so what's north of the north pole

44:14.020 --> 44:16.020
and you go yeah I get that

44:16.020 --> 44:18.020
there's kind of nothing there

44:18.020 --> 44:20.020
but actually people are beginning to wonder

44:20.020 --> 44:22.020
that maybe you can talk about time before the big bang

44:22.020 --> 44:24.020
the weird thing is that time

44:24.020 --> 44:26.020
it's time infinite

44:26.020 --> 44:28.020
is it going to go on forever

44:28.020 --> 44:30.020
when it turns out that it may also run out

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
at the other end as well which is kind of frightening

44:32.020 --> 44:34.020
so time may

44:34.020 --> 44:36.020
we know we're all finite

44:36.020 --> 44:38.020
but what if the universe is finite

44:38.020 --> 44:40.020
that's pretty frightening

44:40.020 --> 44:42.020
and it turns out that everything's kind of decaying

44:42.020 --> 44:44.020
like these black holes and all we'll be left with

44:44.020 --> 44:46.020
is photons and gravitons

44:46.020 --> 44:48.020
and photons and gravitons have no sense of time

44:48.020 --> 44:50.020
and so time will disappear

44:50.020 --> 44:52.020
they won't be able to measure things

44:52.020 --> 44:54.020
but actually this seemed deeply depressing

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
so I went and talked to Roger Penrose

44:56.020 --> 44:58.020
who's my journeyman on this journey into time

44:58.020 --> 45:00.020
and he's come up with a lovely

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
positive way of viewing this

45:02.020 --> 45:04.020
that then you can rescale the universe

45:04.020 --> 45:06.020
because you've lost a sense of time

45:06.020 --> 45:08.020
and that will be the beginning of a new eon

45:08.020 --> 45:10.020
and a new big bang

45:10.020 --> 45:12.020
so it was more hopeful, I love Roger

45:12.020 --> 45:14.020
and I love Roger as well because he changed his mind

45:14.020 --> 45:16.020
he was one of these people I was brought up on

45:16.020 --> 45:18.020
who said you can't talk about time before the big bang

45:18.020 --> 45:20.020
and now he's changed his mind

45:20.020 --> 45:22.020
I love that in a scientist

45:22.020 --> 45:24.020
so I'm going to take you

45:24.020 --> 45:26.020
actually into a journey

45:26.020 --> 45:28.020
I'll talk for another

45:28.020 --> 45:30.020
I'll talk quarter two

45:30.020 --> 45:32.020
because I wasn't allowed to start

45:32.020 --> 45:34.020
if that's okay

45:34.020 --> 45:36.020
because I do want to take you into this edge

45:36.020 --> 45:38.020
to see me outside my comfort zone

45:38.020 --> 45:40.020
which is the question

45:40.020 --> 45:42.020
about what's happening inside your head

45:42.020 --> 45:44.020
it's called the hard problem of consciousness

45:44.020 --> 45:46.020
you're all sitting there

45:46.020 --> 45:48.020
and you're all doing

45:48.020 --> 45:50.020
most of you doing a pretty good impression

45:50.020 --> 45:52.020
of a conscious being

45:52.020 --> 45:54.020
I can see some of you sort of

45:54.020 --> 45:56.020
fair enough it's very sunny

45:56.020 --> 45:58.020
but you know I do believe that most of you

45:58.020 --> 46:00.020
are having a conscious experience

46:00.020 --> 46:02.020
but is that conscious experience

46:02.020 --> 46:04.020
anything like the conscious experience I'm having

46:04.020 --> 46:06.020
how can I ever know

46:06.020 --> 46:08.020
that you really are conscious

46:08.020 --> 46:10.020
or maybe you've just sent an avatar down here

46:10.020 --> 46:12.020
and you know

46:12.020 --> 46:14.020
you're doing such a good impression

46:14.020 --> 46:16.020
and so actually the

46:16.020 --> 46:18.020
objects I took on my journey

46:18.020 --> 46:20.020
into the hard problem of consciousness

46:20.020 --> 46:22.020
is in fact

46:22.020 --> 46:24.020
well it's a chatbot app

46:24.020 --> 46:26.020
that I downloaded onto my smartphone

46:26.020 --> 46:28.020
so I think it's a really interesting question

46:28.020 --> 46:30.020
when will my smartphone become conscious

46:30.020 --> 46:32.020
and could I ever know that

46:32.020 --> 46:34.020
maybe it already is

46:34.020 --> 46:36.020
so

46:36.020 --> 46:38.020
it's perfectly encapsulated in this kind of touring

46:38.020 --> 46:40.020
question

46:40.020 --> 46:42.020
the problem of

46:42.020 --> 46:44.020
talking to a machine

46:44.020 --> 46:46.020
and determining at what point you say

46:46.020 --> 46:48.020
this thing is conscious

46:48.020 --> 46:50.020
so I actually did a little experiment with this

46:50.020 --> 46:52.020
it's called Cleverbot you can download it for free

46:52.020 --> 46:54.020
and you have a conversation with it

46:54.020 --> 46:56.020
and you sort of try to think

46:56.020 --> 46:58.020
whether is it somebody on the other end typing these things in or not

46:58.020 --> 47:00.020
so here's a little exercise for you

47:00.020 --> 47:02.020
I asked a few questions

47:02.020 --> 47:04.020
I asked questions of Cleverbot

47:04.020 --> 47:06.020
and I also did this a bit earlier

47:06.020 --> 47:08.020
and I asked some questions of my son

47:08.020 --> 47:10.020
my son's doing physics in Bristol at the moment

47:10.020 --> 47:12.020
he's 20 years old just to give you some context

47:12.020 --> 47:14.020
so I asked them both questions

47:14.020 --> 47:16.020
and I want you to listen to the questions

47:16.020 --> 47:18.020
and think can you work out which one is the machine

47:18.020 --> 47:20.020
and which one is my son

47:20.020 --> 47:22.020
so we kicked off with

47:22.020 --> 47:24.020
do you have a girlfriend

47:24.020 --> 47:26.020
so response A came back

47:26.020 --> 47:28.020
do you want me to have a girlfriend

47:28.020 --> 47:30.020
response B came back

47:30.020 --> 47:32.020
mind your own business

47:32.020 --> 47:34.020
so is that the machine

47:34.020 --> 47:36.020
and the machine of course learns

47:36.020 --> 47:38.020
it's an example of machine learning

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
because every conversation you have with it

47:40.020 --> 47:42.020
is banked and becomes a conversation

47:42.020 --> 47:44.020
it will have with somebody else

47:44.020 --> 47:46.020
okay the next one what is your dream

47:46.020 --> 47:48.020
so response A was my dream is to become a famous poet

47:48.020 --> 47:50.020
response B

47:50.020 --> 47:52.020
to make lots of money

47:52.020 --> 47:54.020
who was going to want to do that one

47:54.020 --> 47:56.020
yes my son was born in the Thatcheride Age

47:56.020 --> 47:58.020
question 3

47:58.020 --> 48:00.020
are you conscious

48:00.020 --> 48:02.020
now both of these responses are intriguing

48:02.020 --> 48:04.020
because they played on this idea of Descartes

48:04.020 --> 48:06.020
I think therefore I am

48:06.020 --> 48:08.020
so response A was if I wasn't

48:08.020 --> 48:10.020
I don't think I

48:10.020 --> 48:12.020
it was quite convoluted

48:12.020 --> 48:14.020
but this one is Descartes' response

48:14.020 --> 48:16.020
which says the only thing I can be certain of

48:16.020 --> 48:18.020
and this goes

48:18.020 --> 48:20.020
one of the topics of this book is

48:20.020 --> 48:22.020
how can you know anything

48:22.020 --> 48:24.020
and Descartes said the only thing I can be sure of

48:24.020 --> 48:26.020
is that I am conscious

48:26.020 --> 48:28.020
so there you are

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
which one of those is a machine

48:30.020 --> 48:32.020
and which one is my son

48:32.020 --> 48:34.020
and if we got the machine better

48:34.020 --> 48:36.020
how can we ever know whether it was having a conscious world

48:36.020 --> 48:38.020
of course some of you may be synesthetic

48:38.020 --> 48:40.020
anyone's synesthetic here

48:40.020 --> 48:42.020
yes there's a finger going up at the back there

48:42.020 --> 48:44.020
what are you synesthetic with

48:44.020 --> 48:46.020
numbers and colours

48:46.020 --> 48:48.020
my wife is similarly synesthetic like this

48:48.020 --> 48:50.020
and so they are having a genuinely different conscious experience

48:50.020 --> 48:52.020
because when they see a number

48:52.020 --> 48:54.020
it gets coloured up

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
I did some wonderful work

48:56.020 --> 48:58.020
with a piece of Messien

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
Messien was synesthetic with sound and colour

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
so when he listened to music

49:02.020 --> 49:04.020
his music it was full of colour

49:04.020 --> 49:06.020
so we know that people do have genuinely

49:06.020 --> 49:08.020
different responses

49:08.020 --> 49:10.020
conscious experiences

49:10.020 --> 49:12.020
but how can you tell

49:12.020 --> 49:14.020
one of the things I do as a mathematician

49:14.020 --> 49:16.020
very often if I am trying to understand something

49:16.020 --> 49:18.020
is to understand when something isn't that

49:18.020 --> 49:20.020
it's a very good way to flip the question

49:20.020 --> 49:22.020
take an animal

49:22.020 --> 49:24.020
which of these animals around us

49:24.020 --> 49:26.020
which species are actually conscious

49:26.020 --> 49:28.020
how many of these animals if you stick them in front of the mirror

49:28.020 --> 49:30.020
a cat, a dog, a rabbit

49:30.020 --> 49:32.020
would know that what they are looking at

49:32.020 --> 49:34.020
is themselves

49:34.020 --> 49:36.020
so here's a chimpanzee looking

49:36.020 --> 49:38.020
is that

49:38.020 --> 49:40.020
is he just admiring himself or doing a few

49:40.020 --> 49:42.020
funky moves

49:44.020 --> 49:46.020
now here's a test

49:46.020 --> 49:48.020
that Gordon Gallup came up with an animal behaviourist

49:48.020 --> 49:50.020
he said ok maybe you put a mark on somebody's forehead

49:50.020 --> 49:52.020
if you look in the mirror and you see something

49:52.020 --> 49:54.020
oh that's a bit weird

49:54.020 --> 49:56.020
you put your hand up to your forehead

49:56.020 --> 49:58.020
so he was interested in what animals will have this similar response

49:58.020 --> 50:00.020
wondering if you've got them used to what a mirror does

50:00.020 --> 50:02.020
so here's the orangutan who's been marked

50:02.020 --> 50:04.020
looking at himself in the mirror

50:04.020 --> 50:06.020
and so what is this response

50:06.020 --> 50:08.020
to suddenly seeing

50:08.020 --> 50:10.020
oh what's that weird thing I've got on my forehead

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
so that would be

50:12.020 --> 50:14.020
if you put yourself in front of the mirror

50:14.020 --> 50:16.020
and you didn't know that somebody had put some yellow stuff

50:16.020 --> 50:18.020
on your forehead

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
you would immediately go like this

50:20.020 --> 50:22.020
you wouldn't go like this on the mirror

50:22.020 --> 50:24.020
so you can see he's really pissed off

50:24.020 --> 50:26.020
that why has this person put this great big yellow

50:26.020 --> 50:28.020
dobb in front of it

50:28.020 --> 50:30.020
so it turns out

50:30.020 --> 50:32.020
how many animals pass this test

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
very few humans do

50:34.020 --> 50:36.020
chimpanzees do

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
and orangutans do

50:38.020 --> 50:40.020
but gorillons do not

50:40.020 --> 50:42.020
it's very few species that pass this test

50:42.020 --> 50:44.020
now there's a very crude test for consciousness

50:44.020 --> 50:46.020
but it is a measure of them realising

50:46.020 --> 50:48.020
that that is themselves

50:48.020 --> 50:50.020
so what about children

50:50.020 --> 50:52.020
if you've got a fetus

50:52.020 --> 50:54.020
a fetus isn't

50:54.020 --> 50:56.020
conscious so here's a picture of me as a baby

50:56.020 --> 50:58.020
I don't think I was conscious

50:58.020 --> 51:00.020
didn't have a sense of self then

51:00.020 --> 51:02.020
but what points in my evolution

51:02.020 --> 51:04.020
as I grew older did I

51:04.020 --> 51:06.020
suddenly start to pass that mirror self recognition test

51:06.020 --> 51:08.020
and realise yeah I am a conscious being

51:08.020 --> 51:10.020
there must have been a moment when my brain

51:10.020 --> 51:12.020
did something which changed

51:12.020 --> 51:14.020
and then I had a sense of consciousness

51:14.020 --> 51:16.020
it probably wasn't here

51:16.020 --> 51:18.020
but with experiments that we've done

51:18.020 --> 51:20.020
we've seen that actually

51:20.020 --> 51:22.020
there's a transitionary moment in the brain

51:22.020 --> 51:24.020
around 18 to 24 months

51:24.020 --> 51:26.020
if you put a 16 month old

51:26.020 --> 51:28.020
in front of the mirror

51:28.020 --> 51:30.020
with a little mark

51:30.020 --> 51:32.020
generally they don't react

51:32.020 --> 51:34.020
they perhaps do something to the mirror

51:34.020 --> 51:36.020
but a 20 month year old will immediately do this

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
so something has happened in the brain

51:38.020 --> 51:40.020
that has changed that has created this consciousness

51:40.020 --> 51:42.020
and actually you can ask the same question

51:42.020 --> 51:44.020
of the universe

51:44.020 --> 51:46.020
the universe of the big bang

51:46.020 --> 51:48.020
was there any consciousness then

51:48.020 --> 51:50.020
so at what point did consciousness actually emerge

51:50.020 --> 51:52.020
and actually Julian James

51:52.020 --> 51:54.020
has a psychologist

51:54.020 --> 51:56.020
he has an interesting theory that

51:56.020 --> 51:58.020
that moment when we suddenly started hearing a voice in our heads

51:58.020 --> 52:00.020
must have been pretty frightening

52:00.020 --> 52:02.020
and that might have been the spark

52:02.020 --> 52:04.020
for something like an idea of a god

52:04.020 --> 52:06.020
maybe that's what sparked off the thought

52:06.020 --> 52:08.020
there's something else going on inside here

52:08.020 --> 52:10.020
ok so this idea of negatives

52:10.020 --> 52:12.020
let me tell you to this one

52:12.020 --> 52:14.020
the time when we all lose consciousness

52:14.020 --> 52:16.020
every day or rather every night

52:16.020 --> 52:18.020
is when we sleep

52:18.020 --> 52:20.020
so what happens in the brain every night

52:20.020 --> 52:22.020
that changes that we could see

52:22.020 --> 52:24.020
maybe what a quality of the brain

52:24.020 --> 52:26.020
that makes us conscious

52:26.020 --> 52:28.020
so here's an awake brain

52:28.020 --> 52:30.020
and you do something called TMS

52:30.020 --> 52:32.020
it's transcranial magnetic stimulation

52:32.020 --> 52:34.020
where you switch on some neurons

52:34.020 --> 52:36.020
so this is like a little computer gates

52:36.020 --> 52:38.020
because a cascade across the brain

52:38.020 --> 52:40.020
and a feedback

52:40.020 --> 52:42.020
the integrated network is actually talking

52:42.020 --> 52:44.020
to lots of other bits of the brain

52:44.020 --> 52:46.020
feeding back to the original source of the stimulation

52:46.020 --> 52:48.020
this is a sleeping brain

52:48.020 --> 52:50.020
stimulated in exactly the same area

52:50.020 --> 52:52.020
or the same TMS

52:52.020 --> 52:54.020
in deep stage 4 sleep

52:54.020 --> 52:56.020
where you have no conscious experience

52:56.020 --> 52:58.020
everything is very localised

52:58.020 --> 53:00.020
there's no communication going on across the brain

53:00.020 --> 53:02.020
as if the tide has come up

53:02.020 --> 53:04.020
and all of the network has gone down

53:04.020 --> 53:06.020
so there's now a belief that

53:06.020 --> 53:08.020
that we can somehow measure the quality

53:08.020 --> 53:10.020
of a network

53:10.020 --> 53:12.020
and there's a guy Giulio Tononi

53:12.020 --> 53:14.020
who's come up with the way a network

53:14.020 --> 53:16.020
actually feeds back and forth

53:16.020 --> 53:18.020
between each other the nature

53:18.020 --> 53:20.020
of those logic gates may have something

53:20.020 --> 53:22.020
to do with giving

53:22.020 --> 53:24.020
a network a feeling of what it's like

53:24.020 --> 53:26.020
to be itself

53:26.020 --> 53:28.020
and so Giulio Tononi has come up

53:28.020 --> 53:30.020
with this extraordinary equation

53:30.020 --> 53:32.020
a coefficient of consciousness

53:32.020 --> 53:34.020
now I've got to love this

53:34.020 --> 53:36.020
what makes me me is now an equation

53:36.020 --> 53:38.020
and the varying quality

53:38.020 --> 53:40.020
of this equation as we go through the day

53:40.020 --> 53:42.020
and the night or we go into a coma

53:42.020 --> 53:44.020
that this can measure

53:44.020 --> 53:46.020
something about your conscious experience

53:46.020 --> 53:48.020
to the extent interestingly that you can create

53:48.020 --> 53:50.020
a zombie

53:50.020 --> 53:52.020
a zombie is something that has no conscious experience

53:52.020 --> 53:54.020
but behaves exactly as a human would do

53:54.020 --> 53:56.020
so here are two networks

53:56.020 --> 53:58.020
they have eight neurons

53:58.020 --> 54:00.020
they're wired up in different ways

54:00.020 --> 54:02.020
but without put behaviour

54:02.020 --> 54:04.020
of both of these networks

54:04.020 --> 54:06.020
it's exactly the same so if you interacted with it

54:06.020 --> 54:08.020
you would not have any difference between the two

54:08.020 --> 54:10.020
yet one of them has a lot of feedback

54:10.020 --> 54:12.020
in it and has a high level of consciousness

54:12.020 --> 54:14.020
with this coefficient but the one on the right

54:14.020 --> 54:16.020
has no feedback

54:16.020 --> 54:18.020
and it has a zero consciousness

54:18.020 --> 54:20.020
according to this equation and so this will be

54:20.020 --> 54:22.020
an example of a zombie network

54:22.020 --> 54:24.020
now of course

54:24.020 --> 54:26.020
I'm going to skip Wittgenstein

54:26.020 --> 54:28.020
sorry

54:28.020 --> 54:30.020
actually I will tell you about Christof

54:30.020 --> 54:32.020
Christof is one of the people who got very interested

54:32.020 --> 54:34.020
in this equation

54:34.020 --> 54:36.020
and I talked to him he's my

54:36.020 --> 54:38.020
I skyped him so I was never quite sure

54:38.020 --> 54:40.020
whether actually my conversation with an avatar

54:40.020 --> 54:42.020
or something whether he was really there

54:42.020 --> 54:44.020
but he got very frustrated with me trying to

54:44.020 --> 54:46.020
push him on whether we could ever answer

54:46.020 --> 54:48.020
this problem of consciousness and eventually he said

54:48.020 --> 54:50.020
what sort of research project is it Marcus

54:50.020 --> 54:52.020
where you throw up your hands and say forget about it

54:52.020 --> 54:54.020
I can't understand it ever it's hopeless

54:54.020 --> 54:56.020
that's defeatism and I think we have a very

54:56.020 --> 54:58.020
schizophrenic relationship with this idea

54:58.020 --> 55:00.020
of the unknown

55:00.020 --> 55:02.020
and one sense

55:02.020 --> 55:04.020
the unknown is what drives us as scientists

55:04.020 --> 55:06.020
the known things are great

55:06.020 --> 55:08.020
but what we spend our life trying to understand

55:08.020 --> 55:10.020
are the things that we don't know

55:10.020 --> 55:12.020
so in one way the things we don't know

55:12.020 --> 55:14.020
are our lifeblood

55:14.020 --> 55:16.020
but the things that will remain forever

55:16.020 --> 55:18.020
unknown

55:18.020 --> 55:20.020
those are the kind of nemesis of the scientists

55:20.020 --> 55:22.020
so it is a belief I think most of us

55:22.020 --> 55:24.020
kind of feel like no you have that arrogance

55:24.020 --> 55:26.020
that we are a species that could know everything

55:26.020 --> 55:28.020
and I think that's really what drives me

55:28.020 --> 55:30.020
when I throw the dice

55:30.020 --> 55:32.020
why do I keep on looking

55:32.020 --> 55:34.020
it's my desire that I want to know how this is going to end

55:34.020 --> 55:36.020
a one

55:36.020 --> 55:38.020
thank you
