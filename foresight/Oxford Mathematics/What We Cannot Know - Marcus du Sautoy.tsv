20220	25540	Fe oedd ci'n byw ddifweud demen nhw – i wge achievement arall y gweithgaredd dros yma,
25540	35540	So, it's kind of exciting that, you know, you've getting a little advance glimpse of what I've been up to for the last three years in writing this book.
35540	43540	The catalyst for this book was partly the fact that I took over this new job from Richard Dawkins,
43540	46540	the professor for the public understanding of science,
46540	60020	The title always makes me laugh somehow because there is a kind of expectation with this professorship that maybe I know the whole of science and that I am here to explain it to the public.
62540	69020	Quite a few journalists seem to have this impression as well because when I first got this job I would get these phone calls from people.
69020	76020	Wrth i ddim yn gwneud o'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad deilio'r cyfnoddiad yn ymddiad yng nghymru.
76020	79020	Mae'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru yn ymddiad yng nghymru.
79020	82020	Yn cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad yn ymddiad yng Nghymru.
82020	83020	Felly, ychydig yn ymddiad yng Nghymru?
83020	85020	Felly, ymddiad yng nghymru?
85020	88020	Felly, boedd yn gwneud hynny yn eu ddweud.
88020	91020	Felly, rydyn ni eisiau yn siŵr ymddiad.
91020	99020	I'm really embarrassed to admit. You can look me up on Wikipedia, but you can look a lot of things up on Wikipedia actually.
99020	105020	So I quickly went online, pulled up telomeres, read quickly through what a telomere was,
105020	110020	and then confidently told this journalist that the pieces at the end of the DNA,
110020	114020	which control how long a piece of DNA will last.
114020	120020	So I realised this is kind of crazy. There's no way I can be expected to know it all.
121020	128020	But actually it began to make me think, is it possible at any point in history that scientists,
128020	134020	scientists might know it all? Could we answer everything? Could we know everything?
134020	138020	And so that was partly the sort of inspiration for this journey,
138020	147020	was to see whether there are any problems in science that by their very nature we will never be able to solve.
147020	151020	So actually the books are divided up into seven edges of knowledge,
151020	156020	which kind of took me on this journey outside of my own area of mathematics into different regions.
156020	160020	And I'm going to take you through a few of these stories.
160020	164020	But I think that kind of desire to know is absolutely basic.
164020	170020	And it is extraordinary how much we have discovered, or the news stories coming out each week.
170020	174020	I mean, I think since I took over this job, the sort of things we discovered,
174020	179020	we managed to land a kind of spaceship the size of a washing machine on the side of a comet.
179020	180020	Absolutely extraordinary.
180020	185020	We've got robots that we've programmed to develop their own language that we as humans can't understand.
185020	189020	We have to interact with the robots to be able to understand that language.
189020	193020	We've sequenced the DNA of a 50,000-year-old cave girl
193020	197020	and repaired the pancreas using stem cells of a diabetic patient.
197020	202020	I mean, this catalogue of things that we've achieved and the things we've discovered is extraordinary.
202020	207020	And I think that basic desire to know is almost as basic as a desire to reproduce.
207020	210020	And here's Aristotle, the beginning of metaphysics.
210020	214020	He says, everyone by nature desires to know.
214020	220020	In fact, I did a little research and the word to know is actually one of only about 100
220020	224020	which have a universal translation across all languages.
224020	229020	Not even the word eat is necessarily clearly translatable into each language.
229020	232020	So an incredibly basic desire.
232020	239020	But it's always dangerous at any point in history to declare you will never know something.
239020	242020	And I've kept in mind on my journey throughout the last three years
242020	244020	trying to find out those things that we cannot know.
244020	245020	A few stories.
245020	248020	One in particular is this guy, Auguste Comte,
248020	251020	who in the middle of the 19th century declared,
251020	256020	we shall never be able to study by any method the chemical composition of stars.
257020	260020	Now at the time, that seemed completely fair.
260020	263020	I mean, how on earth are we ever going to visit a star to dig a bit out
263020	265020	and actually find out what it's made of?
265020	270020	But of course, a few decades later, we knew exactly what stars are made out of.
270020	273020	Why? Because we don't necessarily have to go and visit the star.
273020	275020	The star is visiting us every night.
275020	280020	The light coming from the star is telling us what the star is made of.
280020	285020	So it's always dangerous and I'm sort of very clear that, you know,
285020	288020	I'm not sure whether I've got any definitive answers here about things
288020	290020	that you can absolutely say you can't know.
290020	293020	But that was the journey to try and understand
293020	297020	whether maybe you can articulate that there are things that you will never know.
297020	303020	Of course, the desire to know about the unknowable isn't restricted to science.
303020	306020	I mean, there's a very famous example of a politician
306020	312020	who got into quite a scrambled mess trying to describe his theory of knowledge.
312020	317020	Here he goes, Donald Rumsfeld trying to explain about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
317020	319020	and whether they were there or not.
319020	322020	To clear, there are known knowns.
322020	324020	There are things that we know that we know.
324020	326020	We also know there are known unknowns.
326020	329020	That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.
329020	334020	But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know.
335020	340020	Now, actually, Donald Rumsfeld got awarded the Foot in the Mouth Award
340020	343020	by the Plain English-speaking Society for this statement,
343020	345020	but I actually think it's very unfair,
345020	349020	because I think this is a wonderful statement about states of knowledge.
349020	353020	The unknown unknowns, those are those black swan events.
353020	356020	I can't tell you about the unknown unknowns else they'd be known.
356020	359020	I'm going to try and tell you about the known unknowns,
359020	362020	whether we can know what those unknowns are.
362020	365020	There's another category here that I think he missed, though,
365020	368020	which I think is very interesting when it comes to a politician,
368020	371020	which is, of course, the unknown knowns,
371020	374020	which Slavoj Žižek actually pointed out,
374020	377020	was those Freudian things that you actually know,
377020	379020	but you don't deny that you know them,
379020	381020	but they come out and somehow,
381020	386020	and I think probably those are the most relevant to a politician as the unknown knowns.
386020	393020	So this journey to try and find the unknown unknowns,
393020	396020	I wanted to try and apply my mathematical mind
396020	398020	to see whether I could articulate
398020	402020	whether there were any questions in the science.
402020	404020	Another inspiration for this book
404020	408020	actually came from the person that I took over this job,
408020	411020	as a Somoni Professor for the Public Understanding of Science,
411020	414020	because my predecessor was Richard Dawkins.
414020	417020	Now, you, of course, know that Richard spent a lot of time
417020	420020	not just talking about biology and evolution,
420020	422020	but also about God.
422020	427020	His God Delusion book was probably one of his most popular books.
427020	431020	So I kind of braced myself when I took over this job
431020	434020	for getting a lot of questions, not about telomeres,
434020	438020	but about what my beliefs about religion were and God's were.
438020	443020	Now, I was quite keen to just create a sort of distance between me and Richard.
443020	446020	There were very different things scientifically.
446020	449020	So I kind of prepared this response to journalists
449020	451020	who would phone up and say,
451020	453020	what are your religious beliefs?
453020	456020	I would tell them I'm a deeply religious man.
456020	459020	My religion happens to be the arsenal.
459020	462020	I have faith every year,
462020	465020	and it's been tested once again
465020	468020	that next season we will win the premiership.
468020	471020	I go to my temple every Saturday or Sunday,
471020	473020	this weekend it will be Sunday.
473020	476020	I sing songs to my idols and I worship them.
476020	479020	And so I hoped that this would kind of bat away
479020	481020	these questions about religion.
481020	484020	But some of these journalists were very persistent.
484020	487020	So I remember one instance on,
487020	491020	it was a Sunday morning on BBC Northern Ireland Radio.
491020	494020	There was a programme about philosophy and religion,
494020	497020	and I said I'm quite happy to talk about philosophy and science and things like that,
497020	499020	but I really don't want to talk about religion.
499020	501020	Of course, as soon as we got on air,
501020	503020	that went out the window and he was like,
503020	506020	some artist, do you believe in God?
506020	508020	He wasn't from India, sorry.
508020	511020	I would stop doing that.
511020	514020	So he just kept on pressing me,
514020	517020	and it became quite an aggressive interview
517020	520020	to the point that as a mathematician you see,
520020	522020	if you're asking me whether something exists,
522020	525020	actually we spend a lot of time at the Math Institute here
525020	527020	proving things exist,
527020	529020	maybe without being able to know what they look like,
529020	531020	but we can prove that they exist,
531020	533020	or often we prove that things don't exist.
533020	536020	Andrew Wild, who this building is named after,
536020	539020	proved that there aren't solutions to Fermat's occasions.
539020	542020	He had a way to prove these things do not exist.
542020	545020	So I said, OK, I'm quite happy to engage in this.
545020	548020	If you give me a definition that I can start to engage
548020	550020	my mathematical mind with.
550020	552020	So he said, ah, well, God,
552020	555020	that's something which transcends human understanding.
556020	559020	Ah, you've just played me out of the game.
559020	561020	I mean, how can I engage with that?
561020	563020	So it seemed to me, so I got brave.
563020	566020	I said, well, how can we stop with the debate with that?
566020	569020	But actually, that definition sort of stuck in my mind,
569020	571020	as quite an intriguing one.
571020	573020	So as the years went on,
573020	576020	and I sort of decided to engage a little bit more perhaps
576020	579020	with this kind of the bridge between science and religion,
579020	582020	I began to think about that as a definition.
582020	585020	But what about the definition of God being the things
585020	587020	that we cannot understand,
587020	590020	the things that we cannot know, the things which transcend us?
590020	595020	So can I apply my scientific mind to what that God would be like?
595020	598020	And I talked to a philosopher in my college, in New College,
598020	601020	Stephen Mulhall, just before I was doing an event
601020	603020	with a chief rabbi actually about,
603020	606020	he's got a wonderful book called Science and Religion,
606020	608020	The Great Partnership.
608020	610020	And he referred me to this guy Herbert McCabe,
610020	614020	and here in Oxford, who actually a Marxist theologian.
614020	617020	Get that, you know, that's quite a cool title.
617020	620020	But he's got quite a lot of crazy articles
620020	622020	about Christian kind of traditions and things,
622020	626020	but he had this one article which Stephen Mulhall referred me to,
626020	628020	and in there he says,
628020	630020	to assert the existence of God is to claim
630020	634020	that there is an unanswered question about the universe.
634020	637020	So I thought that's quite an interesting definition,
637020	639020	and I sort of, through the book,
639020	641020	I run with sort of just exploring a little bit about
641020	645020	what sort of idea that is as a God.
645020	648020	Herbert McCabe says, you know, religion basically committed
648020	653020	iconoclism by giving this very abstract high concept
653020	655020	too many properties it just didn't have.
655020	657020	And of course as kids that's what we get introduced to,
657020	661020	all the silly things, and then we sort of discard that.
661020	665020	So I sort of wanted to have a perhaps a more nuanced engagement
665020	667020	with this question by defining something
667020	669020	of abstract like this.
669020	671020	Now there is this term, the God of the gaps,
671020	673020	which you may have heard of,
673020	675020	but that's actually used by religious people
675020	677020	as a kind of negative thing.
677020	679020	A lot of religious people will say,
679020	681020	no, you're meant to attempt to know God,
681020	683020	so actually the God of the gaps is something
683020	686020	that they sort of use as a kind of negative statement.
686020	688020	But I want to try and reclaim that maybe
688020	690020	and just explore through this book
690020	692020	and a little bit with you now
692020	694020	as we go through these attempts
694020	696020	to find out what is it that could transcend
696020	700020	our understanding forever.
700020	702020	So as I said, the book is divided up
702020	704020	into these seven edges of knowledge,
704020	706020	seven areas that I've sort of explored,
706020	708020	which go from trying to understand
708020	711020	the nature of the universe, is it infinite,
711020	713020	whether we can infinitely divide matter,
713020	716020	what's going on inside our brain.
716020	718020	So I'm going to take you on a little tour
718020	720020	of a few of these to give you a sort of feel
720020	722020	for what might be unknowable
722020	725020	and whether we can know that sort of thing.
725020	727020	I think one of the ultimate symbols
727020	731020	of the unknowable is in fact the dice.
731020	734020	A dice would not make a fun game
734020	736020	if you could actually predict
736020	738020	what this was going to do next.
738020	740020	So the first edge that I explored
740020	743020	is about the nature of the future.
743020	746020	Can we predict the future?
746020	748020	And in fact mathematics at its heart
748020	750020	is very much trying to do that.
750020	752020	I'll call a mathematician a pattern-searcher.
752020	754020	What we do is look at patterns in the past
754020	756020	and try and use those to extrapolate
756020	759020	to understand patterns into the future.
759020	762020	So how powerful is my language of mathematics
762020	765020	in being able to predict what is going to happen next?
765020	767020	So actually each of the edges is accompanied
767020	769020	by an object which kind of sparks
769020	771020	my journey into the unknown.
771020	774020	So the object for this particular edge
774020	776020	is the casino dice.
776020	778020	And this is in fact a casino dice
778020	781020	that I picked up when I was in Vegas.
781020	784020	I was trying to use my maths to make a lot of money
784020	786020	and I've lost so much money
786020	788020	but they let me keep the dice.
788020	790020	That's nice of them.
790020	792020	Now it's a thing of beauty.
792020	794020	You can come and look at it afterwards.
794020	797020	Because it has to be incredibly fair,
797020	800020	it's a pretty much perfect cube.
800020	802020	The edges are just beautifully sharp
802020	806020	and the paint has the same density,
806020	808020	the acetate, it's really...
808020	810020	It is a thing of beauty
810020	812020	and it also is something that I absolutely hate.
812020	814020	Because I cannot...
814020	816020	My desire to do mathematics was partly
816020	818020	about wanting to know, with 100% certainty
818020	820020	that something was true.
820020	822020	And here was this thing
822020	824020	which when I roll it, I just don't know
824020	826020	what I got to one that time.
826020	828020	I might be able to...
828020	830020	I've got the equations for this thing
830020	832020	but how can I tell what it's going to do next?
832020	834020	So that was a kind of challenge.
834020	836020	Actually maybe if I worked hard enough
836020	838020	I could know what this was going to do.
838020	840020	And I guess the hero on my journey
840020	842020	to try and use mathematics
842020	844020	to be able to predict the future
844020	846020	is Isaac Newton.
846020	848020	Because Isaac Newton came up
848020	850020	with the laws of motion, the physical laws of motion,
850020	852020	the idea of calculus.
852020	854020	He showed us how the universe can be controlled.
854020	856020	We can predict when an eclipse is going to happen.
856020	858020	We were able to predict that Mercury
858020	860020	was going to go across the sun just recently.
860020	862020	And that's all thanks to
862020	864020	this revolution that Newton started.
864020	866020	Which kind of revealed
866020	868020	that the universe may be
868020	870020	a kind of clockwork universe
870020	872020	controlled by these equations.
872020	874020	If you know how things are set up,
874020	876020	you run the equations, you can know
876020	878020	what's going to happen into the future.
878020	880020	Well, if Newton is my hero,
880020	882020	my nemesis in this whole desire
882020	884020	to know the future is this guy here,
884020	886020	Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician
886020	888020	who at the beginning of the 20th century
888020	890020	said, yeah, well,
890020	892020	universe may be controlled by equations.
892020	894020	It may be that
894020	896020	if you know the absolute start-up
896020	898020	of any system you run the equations,
898020	900020	you'll know exactly what's going to happen in the future.
900020	902020	But he said, unfortunately,
902020	904020	you're never going to have that complete knowledge
904020	906020	of how a system is set up.
906020	908020	Because there's always a little bit of error.
908020	910020	If you're measuring how the solar system is set up,
910020	912020	then how can you be sure
912020	914020	that you've got the 50th decimal place right?
914020	916020	And what Poincaré showed
916020	918020	is that just a very small change
918020	920020	in maybe the 50th decimal place
920020	922020	may cause a dramatically different outcome.
922020	924020	Now, one of my favourite examples
924020	926020	of chaos in motion,
926020	928020	and this is an illustration
928020	930020	that even something very simple
930020	932020	can have a very difficult
932020	934020	future to try and predict.
934020	936020	So this is a pendulum.
936020	938020	Now, a pendulum is generally something so simple
938020	940020	and predictable, we use it to keep track of time.
940020	942020	But this is a slightly different pendulum.
942020	944020	So this is what I call a double pendulum.
944020	946020	So it's jointed,
946020	948020	so it's a little bit like a leg.
948020	950020	So it's just two metal pieces here.
950020	952020	So the, you know,
952020	954020	it's a very simple geometric description
954020	956020	and the equations are equally quite simple.
956020	958020	But being able to predict
958020	960020	the behaviour of this thing
960020	962020	is almost impossible.
962020	964020	So let's set this off.
964020	966020	And...
966020	968020	You see, why are you laughing?
968020	970020	Because it's so hilariously funny
970020	972020	that you can't predict it.
972020	974020	It's very interesting.
974020	976020	It always makes me laugh.
976020	978020	I've had a little notch there,
978020	980020	so the point is I'm going to try and repeat that behaviour.
980020	982020	I'm going to try and start it off
982020	984020	in exactly the same starting position.
984020	986020	Then it's...
986020	988020	Wow!
988020	990020	It's a completely different behaviour that time.
990020	992020	I think I've tightened it a little bit too fast
992020	994020	because it's...
994020	996020	Let's do a big one here.
998020	1000020	This is my favourite desktop toy.
1000020	1002020	I can play with this for absolutely hours.
1002020	1004020	But it sort of illustrates
1004020	1006020	that even very simple systems
1006020	1008020	you make a very small change to the conditions
1008020	1010020	and it can go in a completely different direction.
1010020	1012020	And this is the signature of something called chaos.
1012020	1014020	Another of my favourite desktop toys
1014020	1016020	is this one here.
1016020	1018020	I use this to make all my decisions about life.
1018020	1020020	So you can see it has
1020020	1022020	different options.
1022020	1024020	Ask a friend, try again, no way.
1024020	1026020	Definitely maybe yes.
1026020	1028020	And what you do is...
1028020	1030020	I'll show you the little video of this.
1030020	1032020	So this is one set up in a lab.
1032020	1034020	You start this thing off and try to predict this.
1034020	1036020	So I'm going to ask it,
1036020	1038020	shall I go to have a beer in the pub
1038020	1040020	after this lecture?
1040020	1042020	Let's see...
1042020	1044020	Oh, definitely!
1044020	1046020	Oh great, so that's good. Excellent.
1046020	1048020	I think I've...
1048020	1050020	It always says definitely when I ask it about the beer.
1050020	1052020	It's really great. Thanks.
1052020	1054020	But you can see from this that
1054020	1056020	just if I run that again,
1056020	1058020	trying to see beforehand
1058020	1060020	which magnet that's going to end up in.
1060020	1062020	So there are three magnets here
1062020	1064020	and the thing is just being pulled around.
1064020	1066020	It's a bit like an asteroid flying around three planets
1066020	1068020	and which planet is it going to hit
1068020	1070020	will eventually go for this one here.
1070020	1072020	And here's three computer simulations
1072020	1074020	I did where I actually just changed
1074020	1076020	something like the sixth decimal place
1076020	1078020	of the coordinate where the pendulum
1078020	1080020	started.
1080020	1082020	And you can see...
1082020	1084020	So I've coloured the magnets up now.
1084020	1086020	So I've got blue magnet, a yellow magnet
1086020	1088020	and just a very small change
1088020	1090020	caused a completely different behaviour,
1090020	1092020	a different path, different planet
1092020	1094020	that the asteroid hit.
1094020	1096020	And here is a computer simulation
1096020	1098020	which tells you, helps you to predict
1098020	1100020	maybe
1100020	1102020	where the pendulum is going to end up.
1102020	1104020	So there are some regions which are very predictable.
1104020	1106020	So if you're close to the yellow magnet
1106020	1108020	so the idea is if you start the pendulum
1108020	1110020	off
1110020	1112020	over a particular point
1112020	1114020	you look at the colour under that point
1114020	1116020	where the pendulum is going to end up.
1116020	1118020	So if I start near a yellow magnet
1118020	1120020	then the thing just wobbles about
1120020	1122020	and goes back to the yellow magnet.
1122020	1124020	But there are other regions
1124020	1126020	which are a little bit further away.
1126020	1128020	So here's a very large swath of red.
1128020	1130020	You start there, it'll swing out
1130020	1132020	but will then end up at the red magnet.
1132020	1134020	So small changes are not going to be
1134020	1136020	cause any dramatic difference
1136020	1138020	in where the magnet will end up.
1138020	1140020	But I was starting that magnet
1140020	1142020	in the top left-hand corner
1142020	1144020	in this region you have what's called a fractal.
1144020	1146020	So this is a shape
1146020	1148020	which has infinite complexity.
1148020	1150020	So as I zoom in on it, it never simplifies.
1150020	1152020	It never becomes a single colour.
1152020	1154020	So it means that
1154020	1156020	however
1156020	1158020	accurately I try and measure this thing
1158020	1160020	just a few more decimal places
1160020	1162020	can kick it quite easily
1162020	1164020	from going from the yellow to the red magnet.
1164020	1166020	So this is saying that
1166020	1168020	unless I have complete
1168020	1170020	description of how the universe
1170020	1172020	is set up, I cannot know the future
1172020	1174020	in this region. Just a small change
1174020	1176020	in a decimal place will cause a completely
1176020	1178020	different outcome to happen.
1178020	1180020	Now I also
1180020	1182020	was accompanied on my journey into
1182020	1184020	these edges of knowledge
1184020	1186020	by a few experts.
1186020	1188020	I chose a lot of areas I'm not expert at all
1188020	1190020	and it's very much was a learning curve for me some of this.
1190020	1192020	And in this chapter
1192020	1194020	about chaos I actually chose
1194020	1196020	a colleague of ours here
1196020	1198020	in Oxford. This is Bob May
1198020	1200020	Lord May as he's there.
1200020	1202020	And he actually discovered
1202020	1204020	this idea of chaos theory
1204020	1206020	affects so much of what we're trying
1206020	1208020	to predict about the future. The reason
1208020	1210020	that I wasn't sure whether it was going to be a monsoon
1210020	1212020	out there, I mean yesterday
1212020	1214020	we had monsoons kind of weather hitting us
1214020	1216020	being able to predict the weather
1216020	1218020	five days in advance is impossible
1218020	1220020	because just a very small change
1220020	1222020	in some of those measurements of the wind speed
1222020	1224020	temperature can cause within five days
1224020	1226020	things to go dramatically different.
1226020	1228020	Now the planets too
1228020	1230020	are very sensitive but on a
1230020	1232020	fortunately on a longer scale than five days.
1232020	1234020	I mean we're talking sort of five billion years
1234020	1236020	a very small change can actually cause
1236020	1238020	the solar system to do something completely different.
1238020	1240020	But Bob May has
1240020	1242020	discovered that not only in
1242020	1244020	these kind of physical systems but also in
1244020	1246020	biology as well. He's a mathematical
1246020	1248020	biologist. He discovered that
1248020	1250020	trying to keep track of population dynamics
1250020	1252020	is also controlled by chaotic
1252020	1254020	equations. So just a very
1254020	1256020	small change you put in one extra animal
1256020	1258020	and the dynamics can be completely different.
1258020	1260020	You can have the whole system collapsing
1260020	1262020	whilst without that animal you can have
1262020	1264020	a very healthy
1264020	1266020	pack of animals the next year.
1266020	1268020	And in fact now he's working
1268020	1270020	he's a cross-party member in the House of Lords
1270020	1272020	and he spends a lot of time
1272020	1274020	actually working on the banking crisis
1274020	1276020	and trying to understand whether that was an example
1276020	1278020	of a chaotic behaviour.
1278020	1280020	And sure enough
1280020	1282020	people in economics there are regions
1282020	1284020	like those yellow regions where things are very predictable
1284020	1286020	and then it can go
1286020	1288020	into very strange unpredictable regions.
1288020	1290020	And he said this to me whilst we were talking
1290020	1292020	I went to him and had lunch with him at the House of Lords
1292020	1294020	and he said not only in research
1294020	1296020	but in the everyday world of politics and economics
1296020	1298020	it would be better off if more people
1298020	1300020	realised that simple systems do not
1300020	1302020	necessarily possess simple
1302020	1304020	dynamic properties.
1304020	1306020	And I asked him how are you getting on
1306020	1308020	in trying to persuade your fellow
1308020	1310020	politicians about the importance of knowing
1310020	1312020	about chaos theory.
1312020	1314020	And he said Marcus there are just egos here
1314020	1316020	nobody's interested in what I said
1316020	1318020	it's just they're all interested in their careers
1318020	1320020	so he was very down on that.
1320020	1322020	But I think that is one of the important things
1322020	1324020	when you're trying to do policy
1324020	1326020	is knowing when you can be confident
1326020	1328020	about what's going to happen next.
1328020	1330020	I'm not saying that mathematics is completely useless
1330020	1332020	we've been able to land that spaceship
1332020	1334020	on the side of a comet because
1334020	1336020	of Newton's equations.
1336020	1338020	But it's also important to know
1338020	1340020	maybe in the top left hand corner
1340020	1342020	of that fractally picture
1342020	1344020	where now you can say you can't know.
1344020	1346020	So it's almost as important to know
1346020	1348020	when you can't know as to know
1348020	1350020	when you can know because then you can be
1350020	1352020	conservative and hunker down and kind
1352020	1354020	of avoid
1354020	1356020	the mess that might emerge.
1356020	1358020	So I came back to my dice and I was
1358020	1360020	very interested okay well what about this
1360020	1362020	is this just chaotic
1362020	1364020	or if I knew this
1364020	1366020	to a certain amount of detail could I actually
1366020	1368020	predict what it was going to do next.
1368020	1370020	I have the laws of motion which control
1370020	1372020	how this falls, how it hits the table
1372020	1374020	and I
1374020	1376020	actually discovered a recent piece
1376020	1378020	of research done by four Hungarians
1378020	1380020	which revealed that actually this is more
1380020	1382020	predictable than I thought it was going to be.
1382020	1384020	So what they've done is
1384020	1386020	I mean I had that picture with the three magnets
1386020	1388020	which I had three colours for
1388020	1390020	so now we've got six sides
1390020	1392020	and so we've got six colours to keep track of
1392020	1394020	so we can draw a picture of how we start
1394020	1396020	off a dice and what
1396020	1398020	what that effect will have
1398020	1400020	on the outcome, which coloured face will it
1400020	1402020	land on and it turns out that
1402020	1404020	if the table that you're throwing it on
1404020	1406020	is
1406020	1408020	that dissipates quite a lot of energy
1408020	1410020	so it's sort of when it falls the energy
1410020	1412020	kind of gets sucked out of it so like a carpet
1412020	1414020	for example then actually
1414020	1416020	the behaviour of this is described
1416020	1418020	by the picture in the top left
1418020	1420020	hand corner so actually
1420020	1422020	if the energy is being dissipated so if I throw
1422020	1424020	this on the floor here
1424020	1426020	it doesn't bounce very much
1426020	1428020	and actually it turns out
1428020	1430020	that we don't have this fractal quality
1430020	1432020	there's sways of yellow
1432020	1434020	sways of green, sways of blue
1434020	1436020	and so a small change is not going to change
1436020	1438020	where that dice is going to land up
1438020	1440020	so here's a tip do you want to know which way it's going to land
1440020	1442020	what you need to look at is the bottom
1442020	1444020	number because it's more likely to land
1444020	1446020	when you throw it like that
1446020	1448020	on the bottom number
1448020	1450020	in fact I had a one on the bottom and it came up one
1450020	1452020	so there you are, quids in
1452020	1454020	but if you think about it
1454020	1456020	at the craps table in the
1458020	1460020	you've got to sort of felt on there
1460020	1462020	it's dissipating some sort of energy
1462020	1464020	but here this is very hard this table
1464020	1466020	so as you move through here
1466020	1468020	the rigidity of the table is increasing
1468020	1470020	and so it's losing less energy as you go through
1470020	1472020	so let's try and do that again
1472020	1474020	so down in here we get a very fractal region
1474020	1476020	so now a very small change
1476020	1478020	so
1478020	1480020	so it landed a four
1480020	1482020	whilst I had the one on the bottom
1482020	1484020	at that time
1484020	1486020	so it depends on the circumstances
1486020	1488020	but there are regions where I can
1488020	1490020	know what this dice is going to do next
1490020	1492020	and actually that's kind of your
1492020	1494020	one thought is
1494020	1496020	I've sort of brought up on the universe is controlled
1496020	1498020	by equations and if you know the complete setup
1498020	1500020	you should be able to know exactly
1500020	1502020	what's going to happen next
1502020	1504020	of course we may not know the complete setup
1504020	1506020	of the universe
1506020	1508020	a small change means that you might lose a lot of
1508020	1510020	knowledge about what's happening next
1510020	1512020	but in fact there's part of science which says
1512020	1514020	even if you know the complete setup
1514020	1516020	of the universe
1516020	1518020	there are still certain circumstances
1518020	1520020	where there's no way you're going to know
1520020	1522020	what's going to happen next
1522020	1524020	and one of them is
1524020	1526020	the chapter that I explored
1526020	1528020	next
1528020	1530020	was trying to predict the behaviour
1530020	1532020	of a pot of uranium
1532020	1534020	on the internet
1534020	1536020	so this pot of uranium
1536020	1538020	I audited it over the internet
1538020	1540020	and I'm assured it's
1544020	1546020	I'm assured that it's completely safe
1546020	1548020	but the instructions say
1548020	1550020	don't eat it
1550020	1552020	but this actually
1552020	1554020	at its heart
1554020	1556020	is the question of when this
1556020	1558020	is going to radiate
1558020	1560020	at the side it says
1560020	1562020	it's going to emit 984
1562020	1564020	counts of radiation
1564020	1566020	so if you have a Geiger counter
1566020	1568020	you get 984 counts per minute
1568020	1570020	so it's got some sort of
1570020	1572020	estimate of what it's going to do
1572020	1574020	but that's only an approximate estimate
1574020	1576020	so it says over a minute
1576020	1578020	on average that's what you'll get
1578020	1580020	what it can't tell me is
1580020	1582020	when it's going to emit an alpha particle
1582020	1584020	for example
1584020	1586020	and the extraordinary thing is
1586020	1588020	the current state of physics says
1588020	1590020	how the universe is
1590020	1592020	that there is no mechanism
1592020	1594020	nothing that we can do
1594020	1596020	which is going to tell us
1596020	1598020	when this uranium is going to emit
1598020	1600020	it's next particle
1600020	1602020	that this we say is random
1602020	1604020	but that's actually just an expression
1604020	1606020	of our lack of knowledge of the startup
1606020	1608020	this seems to be something
1608020	1610020	which the physics says is genuinely random
1610020	1612020	and actually the person at the heart
1612020	1614020	of trying to explain what this bit of uranium
1614020	1616020	is doing, why it's emitting at particular points
1616020	1618020	this is a picture of Heisenberg
1618020	1620020	I'm trying to embrace and love Heisenberg
1620020	1622020	but he's another person I don't really like
1622020	1624020	and this equation
1624020	1626020	so you've probably heard of this thing
1626020	1628020	Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
1628020	1630020	Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
1630020	1632020	almost embeds the idea that
1632020	1634020	there are things you cannot know
1634020	1636020	that you will never be able to know
1636020	1638020	about a physical system
1638020	1640020	and it's not a vague wishy-washy
1640020	1642020	thing about cats and Schrodinger
1642020	1644020	it's actually a very explicit mathematical formula
1644020	1646020	and follows out of the mathematics
1646020	1648020	so these two terms here
1648020	1650020	delta x and delta p
1650020	1652020	this is about a position and momentum
1652020	1654020	so basically
1654020	1656020	these two things are kind of paired up
1656020	1658020	and the more knowledge you get
1658020	1660020	about the position of something
1660020	1662020	the less you know about the potential momentum
1662020	1664020	the momentum you remember
1664020	1666020	is how something is travelling
1666020	1668020	it involves the speed of the thing
1668020	1670020	and in fact
1670020	1672020	I've got to tell you one of my favourite jokes
1672020	1674020	Heisenberg is storming down the autobahn
1674020	1676020	in Germany and the police
1676020	1678020	pull him over and they get him
1678020	1680020	out of the car and say
1680020	1682020	sir do you know how fast you were going
1682020	1684020	there's no but I know exactly where I was
1684020	1686020	now that's good
1686020	1688020	a good sign that you're all laughing
1688020	1690020	because if anyone who didn't laugh
1690020	1692020	and I now have to explain the joke a little bit
1692020	1694020	is that there's a trade-off here
1694020	1696020	and this is what this equation says
1696020	1698020	the more I know about
1698020	1700020	the position of something
1700020	1702020	that's the delta x is controlling
1702020	1704020	what the error is so the more I know
1704020	1706020	about it and the smaller the error
1706020	1708020	in order to make this equation true
1708020	1710020	the momentum has to increase
1710020	1712020	the uncertainty
1712020	1714020	in the momentum has to increase
1714020	1716020	the knowledge I have of the momentum
1716020	1718020	I lose knowledge about it
1718020	1720020	and actually it's perfectly summed up
1720020	1722020	in some of these lovely experiments
1722020	1724020	now you might have heard about this thing
1724020	1726020	called the double slit experiment
1726020	1728020	where you send an electron through
1728020	1730020	and it doesn't really decide
1730020	1732020	it seems to go through both slits at the same time
1732020	1734020	and actually this thing about uncertainty
1734020	1736020	is even revealed with just one single slit
1736020	1738020	so all I'm going to do
1738020	1740020	is to take my uranium off in a very far distance
1740020	1742020	so that's going to be my particle gun
1742020	1744020	I'm going to have say
1744020	1746020	an alpha particle shooting out of here
1746020	1748020	and I've got this a large distance away
1748020	1750020	I've got a screen
1750020	1752020	with a slit in it
1752020	1754020	and it means that if a particle passes through there
1754020	1756020	then there can be
1756020	1758020	no momentum in the up-down direction
1758020	1760020	because any momentum in the up-down direction
1760020	1762020	would push it off
1762020	1764020	and it would hit the screen and not go through
1764020	1766020	so if any particle that goes through
1766020	1768020	that slit
1768020	1770020	I know has almost
1770020	1772020	zero momentum
1772020	1774020	in the vertical position
1774020	1776020	because that's the only way
1776020	1778020	if it had any momentum it would not go through that slit
1778020	1780020	because the distance I've made very large
1780020	1782020	but as soon as it goes through that slit
1782020	1784020	I also have now gained
1784020	1786020	a very tight knowledge
1786020	1788020	about where that particle is
1788020	1790020	because it's gone through that slit
1790020	1792020	so I seem to have got the trade-off
1792020	1794020	I know exactly the momentum
1794020	1796020	and I know exactly the position of this thing
1796020	1798020	but as soon as I know the position
1798020	1800020	it causes a sudden uncertainty to occur
1800020	1802020	in the momentum
1802020	1804020	so sunny this thing gains momentum
1804020	1806020	when it didn't have it before
1806020	1808020	and the uncertainty is expressed here
1808020	1810020	so this is actually experimental data
1810020	1812020	where they took particles
1812020	1814020	the smaller the slit
1814020	1816020	the more information I have
1816020	1818020	about where that particle is
1818020	1820020	which means there must be a larger trade-off
1820020	1822020	in the spread of momentum
1822020	1824020	and you can see this
1824020	1826020	the narrower slit is the bottom
1826020	1828020	graph and then suddenly the momentum is spread
1828020	1830020	all over the place so where the particle arrives
1830020	1832020	on the screen could be in a wide
1832020	1834020	range of possible values
1834020	1836020	but as I lose information about
1836020	1838020	position by widening the slit
1838020	1840020	the momentum comes back in again
1840020	1842020	and I have more information about the momentum
1842020	1844020	now this is absolutely extraordinary
1844020	1846020	it kind of says that I can't know
1846020	1848020	these two things together
1848020	1850020	but actually
1850020	1852020	some physicists have started to interpret this
1852020	1854020	and saying actually this is a mistaken language
1854020	1856020	that actually
1856020	1858020	these particles don't have
1858020	1860020	a momentum and a position
1860020	1862020	we're so hooked on the way Newton thought about the world
1862020	1864020	we just think yes
1864020	1866020	you've got this electron, it's got some position
1866020	1868020	it is somewhere
1868020	1870020	in the momentum and you use that to try and make predictions
1870020	1872020	but physicists now say
1872020	1874020	no you shouldn't think of it like that
1874020	1876020	it's a wrong language
1876020	1878020	so often some of these kind of unknowns
1878020	1880020	turn out to be just that we aren't able to use language properly
1880020	1882020	and so
1882020	1884020	people now think that you should say
1884020	1886020	well that electron doesn't have
1886020	1888020	a position
1888020	1890020	an identifiable position until you observe
1890020	1892020	where it is and so we have this scene now
1892020	1894020	called a quantum wave
1894020	1896020	which actually describes the probability
1896020	1898020	that where you'll find that electron
1898020	1900020	should you
1900020	1902020	or that particle, alpha particle
1902020	1904020	should you want to observe it
1904020	1906020	so you should think of this thing as not having a position
1906020	1908020	it's got a sort of probabilistic position
1908020	1910020	spread out over space
1910020	1912020	the peaks of this wave function
1912020	1914020	tell you it's more likely to be there
1914020	1916020	the troughs tell you it's less likely to be there
1916020	1918020	and this is all you can know
1918020	1920020	and you can't know where that
1920020	1922020	where that electron is going to be
1922020	1924020	more dramatically you can't know
1924020	1926020	when you observe it
1926020	1928020	where it's going to be
1928020	1930020	it could be in any of these kind of peaks
1930020	1932020	or even in the troughs as well
1932020	1934020	and so quantum physics at the moment
1934020	1936020	has at its heart this belief
1936020	1938020	that it doesn't matter what you do
1938020	1940020	you will not be able to know and predict
1940020	1942020	and you can run the experiment over and over again
1942020	1944020	and you'll get different answers
1944020	1946020	with the same setup
1946020	1948020	if you could ever start the thing in the same way
1948020	1950020	and actually this is responsible for the uranium
1950020	1952020	emitting particles
1952020	1954020	you know a lot about the momentum
1954020	1956020	of the things inside the nucleus of this uranium
1956020	1958020	which causes an uncertainty in the position
1958020	1960020	such that at some points
1960020	1962020	suddenly the particle would say
1962020	1964020	hey I seem to be outside the nucleus
1964020	1966020	I'm not inside it anymore and it goes flying off
1966020	1968020	so this is actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
1968020	1970020	helps to understand
1970020	1972020	why this thing is actually emitting particles
1974020	1976020	now there are some people who just believe
1976020	1978020	this can't be how the universe is really behaving
1978020	1980020	surely this just can't be random
1980020	1982020	about what this is doing
1982020	1984020	and there must be some mechanism
1984020	1986020	for deciding ok it might look probabilistic
1986020	1988020	the same as the dice
1988020	1990020	the best things we had to predict the dice
1990020	1992020	is probability but we know that there are laws of physics
1992020	1994020	controlling what that dice is going to do
1994020	1996020	and one of those who really believed
1996020	1998020	this just can't be the answer
1998020	2000020	was Einstein and Einstein had this famous quote
2000020	2002020	quantum mechanics is very impressive
2002020	2004020	and it certainly is
2004020	2006020	it's one of the most well tested theories
2006020	2008020	we have on the scientific books
2008020	2010020	it was such accuracy that
2010020	2012020	we know we're on to something
2012020	2014020	but an inner voice tells me
2014020	2016020	that it is not yet the real thing
2016020	2018020	the theory produces a good deal
2018020	2020020	but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the old one
2020020	2022020	I am at all events convinced
2022020	2024020	that he does not play dice
2024020	2026020	and I think
2026020	2028020	maybe it's the mathematician in me
2028020	2030020	I also
2030020	2032020	I'm still with Einstein with this
2032020	2034020	that surely we will come
2034020	2036020	to a point where we have a new theory
2036020	2038020	a new Einstein that tells us something
2038020	2040020	about the mechanism which is going on
2040020	2042020	which is controlling this
2042020	2044020	but we know that the mechanism is going to be really
2044020	2046020	freaky
2046020	2048020	we know this thing called entanglement
2048020	2050020	which shows us that any mechanism
2050020	2052020	there can't be a little internal clock in there
2052020	2054020	which is just saying now you're spitting out
2054020	2056020	now you're not whenever you look
2056020	2058020	this system if it is there
2058020	2060020	we know must be spread across the whole
2060020	2062020	of the universe which is controlling
2062020	2064020	what this thing is doing
2064020	2066020	now I mentioned right at the beginning
2066020	2068020	that part of this exploration was about this idea
2068020	2070020	of God being the things that we cannot know
2070020	2072020	so here is something that apparently
2072020	2074020	we are not able to know
2074020	2076020	when this thing is going to spit out
2076020	2078020	a bit of its nucleus
2078020	2080020	so the
2080020	2082020	actually the person I took on my journey
2082020	2084020	to this edge of knowledge
2084020	2086020	is a quantum physicist
2086020	2088020	but he's also a priest
2088020	2090020	so this is John Polkinghorn
2090020	2092020	he likes to call himself a vegetarian butcher
2092020	2094020	how can somebody be a quantum physicist
2094020	2096020	and also a priest at the same time
2096020	2098020	John Polkinghorn he has incredibly good credentials
2098020	2100020	he's trained with Dirac
2100020	2102020	in Cambridge then went and trained with Feynman
2102020	2104020	he made great discoveries
2104020	2106020	about quarks
2106020	2108020	and then halfway through
2108020	2110020	his scientific life
2110020	2112020	he then decided that he wanted to be ordained
2112020	2114020	so I was very intrigued to talk to him
2114020	2116020	about how
2116020	2118020	does he believe
2118020	2120020	his God works in the world
2120020	2122020	because there are a lot of religious scientists
2122020	2124020	and I must say although I believe in the arsenal
2124020	2126020	I am an atheist at heart
2126020	2128020	and I will declare that
2128020	2130020	but there are quite a lot of religious scientists
2130020	2132020	but they divide into two groups
2132020	2134020	and one are the Daists
2134020	2136020	and one are the Theists
2136020	2138020	the Daists say okay look
2138020	2140020	I don't know where this universe came from
2140020	2142020	I don't know what started it
2142020	2144020	or what created it but once it's been created
2144020	2146020	there's no okay I'm going to call that God
2146020	2148020	because I really don't know what it is
2148020	2150020	but after that
2150020	2152020	basically the laws of physics take over
2152020	2154020	and the whole thing is now something I can talk about
2154020	2156020	and so they don't think God
2156020	2158020	acts in this world in any sort of meaningful way
2158020	2160020	but John Paul Kinghorn is a theist
2160020	2162020	and he really believes
2162020	2164020	whatever this thing God is
2164020	2166020	that it acts in the world
2166020	2168020	and so I was trying to press him
2168020	2170020	okay well how, you're a scientist
2170020	2172020	how is he acting in the world
2172020	2174020	how is this thing it acting in the world
2174020	2176020	and you know we're thinking of it as the unknowns
2176020	2178020	so that's very interesting
2178020	2180020	so here we have an unknown quantum physics
2180020	2182020	I don't know when this particle
2182020	2184020	is going to emit or where
2184020	2186020	I'm going to find a particle
2186020	2188020	is that an unknown that can have influence in the world
2188020	2190020	well yes it can
2190020	2192020	I mean whether it has any sort of
2192020	2194020	belief
2194020	2196020	whether there's any sort of meaning
2196020	2198020	to what that action is
2198020	2200020	so I was intrigued you know are you going to say
2200020	2202020	maybe your God is using quantum physics
2202020	2204020	so it can make a decision
2204020	2206020	that the electron here and here
2206020	2208020	and that might actually have a dramatic effect
2208020	2210020	on the universe because chaos says that
2210020	2212020	small changes can have big effects
2212020	2214020	so I thought he was going to say yes
2214020	2216020	quantum physics perfect place my God
2216020	2218020	to act in the world
2218020	2220020	but he wasn't going to buy that a toy
2220020	2222020	so no no no because that really depends
2222020	2224020	all of these
2224020	2226020	observations
2226020	2228020	decisions about where the electron is going to be
2228020	2230020	depend on an observation
2230020	2232020	it depends on interacting with the thing
2232020	2234020	my wave function
2234020	2236020	a deterministic wave function
2236020	2238020	and actually we're all part of a system
2238020	2240020	so surely what is an observation anyway
2240020	2242020	surely we're all just part of some huge great big universal wave function
2242020	2244020	so he wasn't into using
2244020	2246020	quantum physics as the way that his God
2246020	2248020	was acting in the world
2248020	2250020	so I said okay well how are you doing this
2250020	2252020	how is it doing it
2252020	2254020	and he actually went back to chaos theory
2254020	2256020	intriguingly so his theory is that
2256020	2258020	as humans we can never know
2258020	2260020	the setup of a system
2260020	2262020	with complete accuracy
2262020	2264020	there will always be decimal places
2264020	2266020	which we don't know about
2266020	2268020	and he believes that that's where
2268020	2270020	a God could act and tinker with things
2270020	2272020	and change things so it could be different
2272020	2274020	as the thing evolves
2274020	2276020	actually Newton used to think this as well
2276020	2278020	and Leibniz who was his great competitor
2278020	2280020	over the calculus just said that's totally ridiculous
2280020	2282020	why on earth would he have to tinker
2282020	2284020	why because he just set the whole thing up
2284020	2286020	and let it go running in the way that it was meant to
2286020	2288020	at the beginning
2288020	2290020	so he knew exactly what was going to happen anyway
2290020	2292020	so
2292020	2294020	it was a kind of intriguing journey
2294020	2296020	talking to him about how would you use
2296020	2298020	science to kind of
2298020	2300020	marry up with your theistic beliefs
2300020	2302020	in a God acting in the world
2302020	2304020	but the interesting thing is that I went into this journey
2304020	2306020	is that one of that reason
2306020	2308020	that a lot of the scientific religious people
2308020	2310020	who are daest to say okay I don't know
2310020	2312020	where all of this came from
2312020	2314020	let's call that creator
2314020	2316020	a God and then I'm just going to do science
2316020	2318020	and so that unknown
2318020	2320020	because it is you know we don't know
2320020	2322020	where it all came from
2322020	2324020	but actually this Heisenberg uncertainty principle
2324020	2326020	gives us a chance to actually see
2326020	2328020	where this stuff came from
2328020	2330020	because okay where did my pot of uranium come from
2330020	2332020	well I went on Amazon
2332020	2334020	so I bought it on Amazon
2334020	2336020	so that's its first source
2336020	2338020	and actually it's amazing kind of reviews
2338020	2340020	you can find on Amazon
2340020	2342020	so glad five stars
2342020	2344020	so glad I don't have to buy this from the Libyans
2344020	2346020	in the parking lot at the mall anymore
2346020	2348020	there were some others complaining
2348020	2350020	about the fact that the thing had disappeared
2350020	2352020	you know gone down by half
2352020	2354020	he was so good
2354020	2356020	you're laughing and I don't have to explain about half-lifes
2356020	2358020	oh that's so good
2358020	2360020	anyway so yeah
2360020	2362020	but if I trace this back okay
2362020	2364020	as I talked to somebody on Tuesday about this
2364020	2366020	and he said he was a miner
2366020	2368020	and he said well it's clear it came from a mine
2368020	2370020	okay yeah but where did it come from
2370020	2372020	before the mine and you trace it back
2372020	2374020	so it was made in a star
2374020	2376020	the most amazing thing you know how stars make all of these extraordinary
2376020	2378020	atoms
2378020	2380020	but what about before that so we trace it back
2380020	2382020	where did all of this stuff come from
2382020	2384020	and it turns out that actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
2384020	2386020	might be
2386020	2388020	the equation
2388020	2390020	which helps us to get something from nothing
2390020	2392020	this is one of the big unsolved questions
2392020	2394020	why is there something
2394020	2396020	rather than nothing
2396020	2398020	and actually if you've got two things
2398020	2400020	that things get measurements get paired up
2400020	2402020	if it sort of matters what order I do it in
2402020	2404020	so a measuring position and momentum
2404020	2406020	somehow it matters what order I do
2406020	2408020	and they get combined in an uncertainty principle
2408020	2410020	but there's another uncertainty principle
2410020	2412020	which combines energy and time
2412020	2414020	so this is expressed here
2414020	2416020	so any increase in the amount
2416020	2418020	if you want to narrow in on a little window of time
2418020	2420020	the energy within that window
2420020	2422020	becomes less certain
2422020	2424020	so if you've got a region where there's nothing going on there
2424020	2426020	so you've got no energy
2426020	2428020	but actually if you decrease the window of time
2428020	2430020	that means that the energy uncertainty
2430020	2432020	must increase and so nothing might suddenly become
2432020	2434020	a little bit of something
2434020	2436020	a little bit of error
2436020	2438020	and of course Einstein said
2438020	2440020	energy equals mc2
2440020	2442020	energy is equivalent to mass
2442020	2444020	so you've got mass inside here
2444020	2446020	so as we look in a little window
2446020	2448020	actually we can suddenly get these quantum fluctuations
2448020	2450020	where nothing can suddenly give rise
2450020	2452020	to matter
2452020	2454020	and this is actually
2454020	2456020	you may know what Stephen Hawking
2456020	2458020	is famous for
2458020	2460020	he's famous for predicting that black holes
2460020	2462020	another place actually where we seem to lose information
2462020	2464020	if you go past the horizon
2464020	2466020	of a black hole inside
2466020	2468020	we seem to not be able to know what is going on inside a black hole
2468020	2470020	because information can't get out
2470020	2472020	one theory has it
2472020	2474020	but Hawking thinks there may be a way things can get out
2474020	2476020	and it's because of the uncertainty principle
2476020	2478020	at the horizon is that
2478020	2480020	although there's nothing there
2480020	2482020	every now and again
2482020	2484020	this quantum fluctuation can cause a particle
2484020	2486020	an antiparticle to appear out of nothing
2486020	2488020	it's a bit like taking the equation 0
2488020	2490020	equals 1 minus 1
2490020	2492020	so you can have nothing and then suddenly get 1
2492020	2494020	and minus 1 and that antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole
2494020	2496020	makes it a little bit smaller
2496020	2498020	and the particle gets emitted out
2498020	2500020	so we believe in this thing Hawking radiation
2500020	2502020	we haven't measured it yet which is why he hasn't got
2502020	2504020	a Nobel Prize yet but when we do measure it
2504020	2506020	he will because this is a way that
2506020	2508020	black holes will actually kind of evaporate
2508020	2510020	and may give back information
2510020	2512020	we think that there's
2512020	2514020	something called the information paradox
2514020	2516020	that black holes may be somewhere where we lose information
2516020	2518020	but actually this leaking
2518020	2520020	according to this equation
2520020	2522020	equation might be a way of us getting back information
2522020	2524020	but here is an equation
2524020	2526020	which then gives us a way of getting uranium out of nothing
2526020	2528020	now you might say
2528020	2530020	well yeah but that isn't really nothing because you've got space there
2530020	2532020	space just vacuum
2532020	2534020	isn't nothing it's a three dimensional
2534020	2536020	space and so that is something still
2536020	2538020	and as a mathematician I certainly
2538020	2540020	believe that it is a something
2540020	2542020	so that isn't really nothing so where did that something
2542020	2544020	where did that empty space
2544020	2546020	where did that empty geometry come from
2546020	2548020	but even now as we push
2548020	2550020	one of the big mysteries is how to equate
2550020	2552020	relativity and quantum physics
2552020	2554020	and the idea of quantum gravity
2554020	2556020	fluctuations in quantum gravity
2556020	2558020	mean that even space itself
2558020	2560020	might emerge as a fluctuation
2560020	2562020	out of genuinely something which is nothing
2562020	2564020	so actually
2564020	2566020	it might be that our desire
2566020	2568020	for some creator
2568020	2570020	is well actually the creator is just mathematics
2570020	2572020	mathematics is outside of time
2572020	2574020	it's been there forever will be there forever
2574020	2576020	and this is a way of just
2576020	2578020	blowing something into those equations
2578020	2580020	and then you get something out of nothing
2580020	2582020	so you know often they say God is a mathematician
2582020	2584020	I would reverse that and say no no mathematics
2584020	2586020	is the God which started all of this
2586020	2588020	so that's a couple of the
2588020	2590020	unknowns so
2590020	2592020	let me just give you a little guide
2592020	2594020	through a couple more and then I'll show you one of my
2594020	2596020	so let's see
2596020	2598020	one of the other ones is I
2598020	2600020	dig down into my uranium and ask
2600020	2602020	how far can you go can you infinitely divide uranium
2602020	2604020	if you go inside it that atom
2604020	2606020	is made out of electrons and quarks
2606020	2608020	we think that's the bottom layer but
2608020	2610020	how do we know that and we'll maybe
2610020	2612020	we thought atoms were the bottom layer
2612020	2614020	so that one's
2614020	2616020	we might keep on dividing space
2616020	2618020	although we think there's a little quantized space
2618020	2620020	beyond which you can't divide anything
2620020	2622020	what about going out is the universe infinite
2622020	2624020	if it is could we ever know that
2624020	2626020	so that's one of my other edges
2626020	2628020	time
2628020	2630020	what about time itself
2630020	2632020	so you know we think time
2632020	2634020	had a beginning the big bang
2634020	2636020	but can we talk about what happened before
2636020	2638020	the big bang
2638020	2640020	now I was brought up in this department
2640020	2642020	on the kind of idea you can't
2642020	2644020	it doesn't make sense because you need time
2644020	2646020	to say before and so if there wasn't
2646020	2648020	any time you can't say before
2648020	2650020	that's really clever
2650020	2652020	I like that and they would always go
2652020	2654020	yeah so what's north of the north pole
2654020	2656020	and you go yeah I get that
2656020	2658020	there's kind of nothing there
2658020	2660020	but actually people are beginning to wonder
2660020	2662020	that maybe you can talk about time before the big bang
2662020	2664020	the weird thing is that time
2664020	2666020	it's time infinite
2666020	2668020	is it going to go on forever
2668020	2670020	when it turns out that it may also run out
2670020	2672020	at the other end as well which is kind of frightening
2672020	2674020	so time may
2674020	2676020	we know we're all finite
2676020	2678020	but what if the universe is finite
2678020	2680020	that's pretty frightening
2680020	2682020	and it turns out that everything's kind of decaying
2682020	2684020	like these black holes and all we'll be left with
2684020	2686020	is photons and gravitons
2686020	2688020	and photons and gravitons have no sense of time
2688020	2690020	and so time will disappear
2690020	2692020	they won't be able to measure things
2692020	2694020	but actually this seemed deeply depressing
2694020	2696020	so I went and talked to Roger Penrose
2696020	2698020	who's my journeyman on this journey into time
2698020	2700020	and he's come up with a lovely
2700020	2702020	positive way of viewing this
2702020	2704020	that then you can rescale the universe
2704020	2706020	because you've lost a sense of time
2706020	2708020	and that will be the beginning of a new eon
2708020	2710020	and a new big bang
2710020	2712020	so it was more hopeful, I love Roger
2712020	2714020	and I love Roger as well because he changed his mind
2714020	2716020	he was one of these people I was brought up on
2716020	2718020	who said you can't talk about time before the big bang
2718020	2720020	and now he's changed his mind
2720020	2722020	I love that in a scientist
2722020	2724020	so I'm going to take you
2724020	2726020	actually into a journey
2726020	2728020	I'll talk for another
2728020	2730020	I'll talk quarter two
2730020	2732020	because I wasn't allowed to start
2732020	2734020	if that's okay
2734020	2736020	because I do want to take you into this edge
2736020	2738020	to see me outside my comfort zone
2738020	2740020	which is the question
2740020	2742020	about what's happening inside your head
2742020	2744020	it's called the hard problem of consciousness
2744020	2746020	you're all sitting there
2746020	2748020	and you're all doing
2748020	2750020	most of you doing a pretty good impression
2750020	2752020	of a conscious being
2752020	2754020	I can see some of you sort of
2754020	2756020	fair enough it's very sunny
2756020	2758020	but you know I do believe that most of you
2758020	2760020	are having a conscious experience
2760020	2762020	but is that conscious experience
2762020	2764020	anything like the conscious experience I'm having
2764020	2766020	how can I ever know
2766020	2768020	that you really are conscious
2768020	2770020	or maybe you've just sent an avatar down here
2770020	2772020	and you know
2772020	2774020	you're doing such a good impression
2774020	2776020	and so actually the
2776020	2778020	objects I took on my journey
2778020	2780020	into the hard problem of consciousness
2780020	2782020	is in fact
2782020	2784020	well it's a chatbot app
2784020	2786020	that I downloaded onto my smartphone
2786020	2788020	so I think it's a really interesting question
2788020	2790020	when will my smartphone become conscious
2790020	2792020	and could I ever know that
2792020	2794020	maybe it already is
2794020	2796020	so
2796020	2798020	it's perfectly encapsulated in this kind of touring
2798020	2800020	question
2800020	2802020	the problem of
2802020	2804020	talking to a machine
2804020	2806020	and determining at what point you say
2806020	2808020	this thing is conscious
2808020	2810020	so I actually did a little experiment with this
2810020	2812020	it's called Cleverbot you can download it for free
2812020	2814020	and you have a conversation with it
2814020	2816020	and you sort of try to think
2816020	2818020	whether is it somebody on the other end typing these things in or not
2818020	2820020	so here's a little exercise for you
2820020	2822020	I asked a few questions
2822020	2824020	I asked questions of Cleverbot
2824020	2826020	and I also did this a bit earlier
2826020	2828020	and I asked some questions of my son
2828020	2830020	my son's doing physics in Bristol at the moment
2830020	2832020	he's 20 years old just to give you some context
2832020	2834020	so I asked them both questions
2834020	2836020	and I want you to listen to the questions
2836020	2838020	and think can you work out which one is the machine
2838020	2840020	and which one is my son
2840020	2842020	so we kicked off with
2842020	2844020	do you have a girlfriend
2844020	2846020	so response A came back
2846020	2848020	do you want me to have a girlfriend
2848020	2850020	response B came back
2850020	2852020	mind your own business
2852020	2854020	so is that the machine
2854020	2856020	and the machine of course learns
2856020	2858020	it's an example of machine learning
2858020	2860020	because every conversation you have with it
2860020	2862020	is banked and becomes a conversation
2862020	2864020	it will have with somebody else
2864020	2866020	okay the next one what is your dream
2866020	2868020	so response A was my dream is to become a famous poet
2868020	2870020	response B
2870020	2872020	to make lots of money
2872020	2874020	who was going to want to do that one
2874020	2876020	yes my son was born in the Thatcheride Age
2876020	2878020	question 3
2878020	2880020	are you conscious
2880020	2882020	now both of these responses are intriguing
2882020	2884020	because they played on this idea of Descartes
2884020	2886020	I think therefore I am
2886020	2888020	so response A was if I wasn't
2888020	2890020	I don't think I
2890020	2892020	it was quite convoluted
2892020	2894020	but this one is Descartes' response
2894020	2896020	which says the only thing I can be certain of
2896020	2898020	and this goes
2898020	2900020	one of the topics of this book is
2900020	2902020	how can you know anything
2902020	2904020	and Descartes said the only thing I can be sure of
2904020	2906020	is that I am conscious
2906020	2908020	so there you are
2908020	2910020	which one of those is a machine
2910020	2912020	and which one is my son
2912020	2914020	and if we got the machine better
2914020	2916020	how can we ever know whether it was having a conscious world
2916020	2918020	of course some of you may be synesthetic
2918020	2920020	anyone's synesthetic here
2920020	2922020	yes there's a finger going up at the back there
2922020	2924020	what are you synesthetic with
2924020	2926020	numbers and colours
2926020	2928020	my wife is similarly synesthetic like this
2928020	2930020	and so they are having a genuinely different conscious experience
2930020	2932020	because when they see a number
2932020	2934020	it gets coloured up
2934020	2936020	I did some wonderful work
2936020	2938020	with a piece of Messien
2938020	2940020	Messien was synesthetic with sound and colour
2940020	2942020	so when he listened to music
2942020	2944020	his music it was full of colour
2944020	2946020	so we know that people do have genuinely
2946020	2948020	different responses
2948020	2950020	conscious experiences
2950020	2952020	but how can you tell
2952020	2954020	one of the things I do as a mathematician
2954020	2956020	very often if I am trying to understand something
2956020	2958020	is to understand when something isn't that
2958020	2960020	it's a very good way to flip the question
2960020	2962020	take an animal
2962020	2964020	which of these animals around us
2964020	2966020	which species are actually conscious
2966020	2968020	how many of these animals if you stick them in front of the mirror
2968020	2970020	a cat, a dog, a rabbit
2970020	2972020	would know that what they are looking at
2972020	2974020	is themselves
2974020	2976020	so here's a chimpanzee looking
2976020	2978020	is that
2978020	2980020	is he just admiring himself or doing a few
2980020	2982020	funky moves
2984020	2986020	now here's a test
2986020	2988020	that Gordon Gallup came up with an animal behaviourist
2988020	2990020	he said ok maybe you put a mark on somebody's forehead
2990020	2992020	if you look in the mirror and you see something
2992020	2994020	oh that's a bit weird
2994020	2996020	you put your hand up to your forehead
2996020	2998020	so he was interested in what animals will have this similar response
2998020	3000020	wondering if you've got them used to what a mirror does
3000020	3002020	so here's the orangutan who's been marked
3002020	3004020	looking at himself in the mirror
3004020	3006020	and so what is this response
3006020	3008020	to suddenly seeing
3008020	3010020	oh what's that weird thing I've got on my forehead
3010020	3012020	so that would be
3012020	3014020	if you put yourself in front of the mirror
3014020	3016020	and you didn't know that somebody had put some yellow stuff
3016020	3018020	on your forehead
3018020	3020020	you would immediately go like this
3020020	3022020	you wouldn't go like this on the mirror
3022020	3024020	so you can see he's really pissed off
3024020	3026020	that why has this person put this great big yellow
3026020	3028020	dobb in front of it
3028020	3030020	so it turns out
3030020	3032020	how many animals pass this test
3032020	3034020	very few humans do
3034020	3036020	chimpanzees do
3036020	3038020	and orangutans do
3038020	3040020	but gorillons do not
3040020	3042020	it's very few species that pass this test
3042020	3044020	now there's a very crude test for consciousness
3044020	3046020	but it is a measure of them realising
3046020	3048020	that that is themselves
3048020	3050020	so what about children
3050020	3052020	if you've got a fetus
3052020	3054020	a fetus isn't
3054020	3056020	conscious so here's a picture of me as a baby
3056020	3058020	I don't think I was conscious
3058020	3060020	didn't have a sense of self then
3060020	3062020	but what points in my evolution
3062020	3064020	as I grew older did I
3064020	3066020	suddenly start to pass that mirror self recognition test
3066020	3068020	and realise yeah I am a conscious being
3068020	3070020	there must have been a moment when my brain
3070020	3072020	did something which changed
3072020	3074020	and then I had a sense of consciousness
3074020	3076020	it probably wasn't here
3076020	3078020	but with experiments that we've done
3078020	3080020	we've seen that actually
3080020	3082020	there's a transitionary moment in the brain
3082020	3084020	around 18 to 24 months
3084020	3086020	if you put a 16 month old
3086020	3088020	in front of the mirror
3088020	3090020	with a little mark
3090020	3092020	generally they don't react
3092020	3094020	they perhaps do something to the mirror
3094020	3096020	but a 20 month year old will immediately do this
3096020	3098020	so something has happened in the brain
3098020	3100020	that has changed that has created this consciousness
3100020	3102020	and actually you can ask the same question
3102020	3104020	of the universe
3104020	3106020	the universe of the big bang
3106020	3108020	was there any consciousness then
3108020	3110020	so at what point did consciousness actually emerge
3110020	3112020	and actually Julian James
3112020	3114020	has a psychologist
3114020	3116020	he has an interesting theory that
3116020	3118020	that moment when we suddenly started hearing a voice in our heads
3118020	3120020	must have been pretty frightening
3120020	3122020	and that might have been the spark
3122020	3124020	for something like an idea of a god
3124020	3126020	maybe that's what sparked off the thought
3126020	3128020	there's something else going on inside here
3128020	3130020	ok so this idea of negatives
3130020	3132020	let me tell you to this one
3132020	3134020	the time when we all lose consciousness
3134020	3136020	every day or rather every night
3136020	3138020	is when we sleep
3138020	3140020	so what happens in the brain every night
3140020	3142020	that changes that we could see
3142020	3144020	maybe what a quality of the brain
3144020	3146020	that makes us conscious
3146020	3148020	so here's an awake brain
3148020	3150020	and you do something called TMS
3150020	3152020	it's transcranial magnetic stimulation
3152020	3154020	where you switch on some neurons
3154020	3156020	so this is like a little computer gates
3156020	3158020	because a cascade across the brain
3158020	3160020	and a feedback
3160020	3162020	the integrated network is actually talking
3162020	3164020	to lots of other bits of the brain
3164020	3166020	feeding back to the original source of the stimulation
3166020	3168020	this is a sleeping brain
3168020	3170020	stimulated in exactly the same area
3170020	3172020	or the same TMS
3172020	3174020	in deep stage 4 sleep
3174020	3176020	where you have no conscious experience
3176020	3178020	everything is very localised
3178020	3180020	there's no communication going on across the brain
3180020	3182020	as if the tide has come up
3182020	3184020	and all of the network has gone down
3184020	3186020	so there's now a belief that
3186020	3188020	that we can somehow measure the quality
3188020	3190020	of a network
3190020	3192020	and there's a guy Giulio Tononi
3192020	3194020	who's come up with the way a network
3194020	3196020	actually feeds back and forth
3196020	3198020	between each other the nature
3198020	3200020	of those logic gates may have something
3200020	3202020	to do with giving
3202020	3204020	a network a feeling of what it's like
3204020	3206020	to be itself
3206020	3208020	and so Giulio Tononi has come up
3208020	3210020	with this extraordinary equation
3210020	3212020	a coefficient of consciousness
3212020	3214020	now I've got to love this
3214020	3216020	what makes me me is now an equation
3216020	3218020	and the varying quality
3218020	3220020	of this equation as we go through the day
3220020	3222020	and the night or we go into a coma
3222020	3224020	that this can measure
3224020	3226020	something about your conscious experience
3226020	3228020	to the extent interestingly that you can create
3228020	3230020	a zombie
3230020	3232020	a zombie is something that has no conscious experience
3232020	3234020	but behaves exactly as a human would do
3234020	3236020	so here are two networks
3236020	3238020	they have eight neurons
3238020	3240020	they're wired up in different ways
3240020	3242020	but without put behaviour
3242020	3244020	of both of these networks
3244020	3246020	it's exactly the same so if you interacted with it
3246020	3248020	you would not have any difference between the two
3248020	3250020	yet one of them has a lot of feedback
3250020	3252020	in it and has a high level of consciousness
3252020	3254020	with this coefficient but the one on the right
3254020	3256020	has no feedback
3256020	3258020	and it has a zero consciousness
3258020	3260020	according to this equation and so this will be
3260020	3262020	an example of a zombie network
3262020	3264020	now of course
3264020	3266020	I'm going to skip Wittgenstein
3266020	3268020	sorry
3268020	3270020	actually I will tell you about Christof
3270020	3272020	Christof is one of the people who got very interested
3272020	3274020	in this equation
3274020	3276020	and I talked to him he's my
3276020	3278020	I skyped him so I was never quite sure
3278020	3280020	whether actually my conversation with an avatar
3280020	3282020	or something whether he was really there
3282020	3284020	but he got very frustrated with me trying to
3284020	3286020	push him on whether we could ever answer
3286020	3288020	this problem of consciousness and eventually he said
3288020	3290020	what sort of research project is it Marcus
3290020	3292020	where you throw up your hands and say forget about it
3292020	3294020	I can't understand it ever it's hopeless
3294020	3296020	that's defeatism and I think we have a very
3296020	3298020	schizophrenic relationship with this idea
3298020	3300020	of the unknown
3300020	3302020	and one sense
3302020	3304020	the unknown is what drives us as scientists
3304020	3306020	the known things are great
3306020	3308020	but what we spend our life trying to understand
3308020	3310020	are the things that we don't know
3310020	3312020	so in one way the things we don't know
3312020	3314020	are our lifeblood
3314020	3316020	but the things that will remain forever
3316020	3318020	unknown
3318020	3320020	those are the kind of nemesis of the scientists
3320020	3322020	so it is a belief I think most of us
3322020	3324020	kind of feel like no you have that arrogance
3324020	3326020	that we are a species that could know everything
3326020	3328020	and I think that's really what drives me
3328020	3330020	when I throw the dice
3330020	3332020	why do I keep on looking
3332020	3334020	it's my desire that I want to know how this is going to end
3334020	3336020	a one
3336020	3338020	thank you
