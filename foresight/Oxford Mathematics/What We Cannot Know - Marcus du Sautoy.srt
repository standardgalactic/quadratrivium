5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:35,540
So, it's kind of exciting that, you know, you've getting a little advance glimpse of what I've been up to for the last three years in writing this book.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:43,540
The catalyst for this book was partly the fact that I took over this new job from Richard Dawkins,

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,540
the professor for the public understanding of science,

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:01:00,020
The title always makes me laugh somehow because there is a kind of expectation with this professorship that maybe I know the whole of science and that I am here to explain it to the public.

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,020
Quite a few journalists seem to have this impression as well because when I first got this job I would get these phone calls from people.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,020
Wrth i ddim yn gwneud o'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad deilio'r cyfnoddiad yn ymddiad yng nghymru.

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,020
Mae'r cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru yn ymddiad yng nghymru.

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,020
Yn cyfnoddiad yng Nghymru, mae'r ymddiad yn ymddiad yng Nghymru.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
Felly, ychydig yn ymddiad yng Nghymru?

14
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,020
Felly, ymddiad yng nghymru?

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Felly, boedd yn gwneud hynny yn eu ddweud.

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Felly, rydyn ni eisiau yn siŵr ymddiad.

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,020
I'm really embarrassed to admit. You can look me up on Wikipedia, but you can look a lot of things up on Wikipedia actually.

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,020
So I quickly went online, pulled up telomeres, read quickly through what a telomere was,

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,020
and then confidently told this journalist that the pieces at the end of the DNA,

20
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,020
which control how long a piece of DNA will last.

21
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,020
So I realised this is kind of crazy. There's no way I can be expected to know it all.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,020
But actually it began to make me think, is it possible at any point in history that scientists,

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,020
scientists might know it all? Could we answer everything? Could we know everything?

24
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,020
And so that was partly the sort of inspiration for this journey,

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:27,020
was to see whether there are any problems in science that by their very nature we will never be able to solve.

26
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,020
So actually the books are divided up into seven edges of knowledge,

27
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,020
which kind of took me on this journey outside of my own area of mathematics into different regions.

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,020
And I'm going to take you through a few of these stories.

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,020
But I think that kind of desire to know is absolutely basic.

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,020
And it is extraordinary how much we have discovered, or the news stories coming out each week.

31
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,020
I mean, I think since I took over this job, the sort of things we discovered,

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,020
we managed to land a kind of spaceship the size of a washing machine on the side of a comet.

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Absolutely extraordinary.

34
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,020
We've got robots that we've programmed to develop their own language that we as humans can't understand.

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
We have to interact with the robots to be able to understand that language.

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,020
We've sequenced the DNA of a 50,000-year-old cave girl

37
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,020
and repaired the pancreas using stem cells of a diabetic patient.

38
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,020
I mean, this catalogue of things that we've achieved and the things we've discovered is extraordinary.

39
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,020
And I think that basic desire to know is almost as basic as a desire to reproduce.

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,020
And here's Aristotle, the beginning of metaphysics.

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,020
He says, everyone by nature desires to know.

42
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,020
In fact, I did a little research and the word to know is actually one of only about 100

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,020
which have a universal translation across all languages.

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Not even the word eat is necessarily clearly translatable into each language.

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,020
So an incredibly basic desire.

46
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:59,020
But it's always dangerous at any point in history to declare you will never know something.

47
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,020
And I've kept in mind on my journey throughout the last three years

48
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,020
trying to find out those things that we cannot know.

49
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
A few stories.

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,020
One in particular is this guy, Auguste Comte,

51
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,020
who in the middle of the 19th century declared,

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,020
we shall never be able to study by any method the chemical composition of stars.

53
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Now at the time, that seemed completely fair.

54
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,020
I mean, how on earth are we ever going to visit a star to dig a bit out

55
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
and actually find out what it's made of?

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,020
But of course, a few decades later, we knew exactly what stars are made out of.

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Why? Because we don't necessarily have to go and visit the star.

58
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,020
The star is visiting us every night.

59
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,020
The light coming from the star is telling us what the star is made of.

60
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,020
So it's always dangerous and I'm sort of very clear that, you know,

61
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm not sure whether I've got any definitive answers here about things

62
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,020
that you can absolutely say you can't know.

63
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,020
But that was the journey to try and understand

64
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,020
whether maybe you can articulate that there are things that you will never know.

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Of course, the desire to know about the unknowable isn't restricted to science.

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,020
I mean, there's a very famous example of a politician

67
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,020
who got into quite a scrambled mess trying to describe his theory of knowledge.

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Here he goes, Donald Rumsfeld trying to explain about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq

69
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
and whether they were there or not.

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,020
To clear, there are known knowns.

71
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
There are things that we know that we know.

72
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
We also know there are known unknowns.

73
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,020
That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.

74
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know.

75
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Now, actually, Donald Rumsfeld got awarded the Foot in the Mouth Award

76
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,020
by the Plain English-speaking Society for this statement,

77
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
but I actually think it's very unfair,

78
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,020
because I think this is a wonderful statement about states of knowledge.

79
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,020
The unknown unknowns, those are those black swan events.

80
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,020
I can't tell you about the unknown unknowns else they'd be known.

81
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm going to try and tell you about the known unknowns,

82
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,020
whether we can know what those unknowns are.

83
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
There's another category here that I think he missed, though,

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,020
which I think is very interesting when it comes to a politician,

85
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,020
which is, of course, the unknown knowns,

86
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,020
which Slavoj Žižek actually pointed out,

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,020
was those Freudian things that you actually know,

88
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
but you don't deny that you know them,

89
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
but they come out and somehow,

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,020
and I think probably those are the most relevant to a politician as the unknown knowns.

91
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:33,020
So this journey to try and find the unknown unknowns,

92
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,020
I wanted to try and apply my mathematical mind

93
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
to see whether I could articulate

94
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,020
whether there were any questions in the science.

95
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Another inspiration for this book

96
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,020
actually came from the person that I took over this job,

97
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,020
as a Somoni Professor for the Public Understanding of Science,

98
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,020
because my predecessor was Richard Dawkins.

99
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Now, you, of course, know that Richard spent a lot of time

100
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,020
not just talking about biology and evolution,

101
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
but also about God.

102
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,020
His God Delusion book was probably one of his most popular books.

103
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,020
So I kind of braced myself when I took over this job

104
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,020
for getting a lot of questions, not about telomeres,

105
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,020
but about what my beliefs about religion were and God's were.

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Now, I was quite keen to just create a sort of distance between me and Richard.

107
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
There were very different things scientifically.

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
So I kind of prepared this response to journalists

109
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
who would phone up and say,

110
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
what are your religious beliefs?

111
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I would tell them I'm a deeply religious man.

112
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
My religion happens to be the arsenal.

113
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
I have faith every year,

114
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,020
and it's been tested once again

115
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,020
that next season we will win the premiership.

116
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,020
I go to my temple every Saturday or Sunday,

117
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
this weekend it will be Sunday.

118
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,020
I sing songs to my idols and I worship them.

119
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,020
And so I hoped that this would kind of bat away

120
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
these questions about religion.

121
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,020
But some of these journalists were very persistent.

122
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,020
So I remember one instance on,

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,020
it was a Sunday morning on BBC Northern Ireland Radio.

124
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,020
There was a programme about philosophy and religion,

125
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,020
and I said I'm quite happy to talk about philosophy and science and things like that,

126
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
but I really don't want to talk about religion.

127
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Of course, as soon as we got on air,

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
that went out the window and he was like,

129
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,020
some artist, do you believe in God?

130
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
He wasn't from India, sorry.

131
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,020
I would stop doing that.

132
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,020
So he just kept on pressing me,

133
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,020
and it became quite an aggressive interview

134
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
to the point that as a mathematician you see,

135
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
if you're asking me whether something exists,

136
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,020
actually we spend a lot of time at the Math Institute here

137
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
proving things exist,

138
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,020
maybe without being able to know what they look like,

139
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
but we can prove that they exist,

140
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
or often we prove that things don't exist.

141
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Andrew Wild, who this building is named after,

142
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,020
proved that there aren't solutions to Fermat's occasions.

143
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,020
He had a way to prove these things do not exist.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,020
So I said, OK, I'm quite happy to engage in this.

145
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,020
If you give me a definition that I can start to engage

146
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
my mathematical mind with.

147
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
So he said, ah, well, God,

148
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,020
that's something which transcends human understanding.

149
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Ah, you've just played me out of the game.

150
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
I mean, how can I engage with that?

151
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
So it seemed to me, so I got brave.

152
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,020
I said, well, how can we stop with the debate with that?

153
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,020
But actually, that definition sort of stuck in my mind,

154
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
as quite an intriguing one.

155
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,020
So as the years went on,

156
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,020
and I sort of decided to engage a little bit more perhaps

157
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,020
with this kind of the bridge between science and religion,

158
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
I began to think about that as a definition.

159
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,020
But what about the definition of God being the things

160
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
that we cannot understand,

161
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,020
the things that we cannot know, the things which transcend us?

162
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,020
So can I apply my scientific mind to what that God would be like?

163
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,020
And I talked to a philosopher in my college, in New College,

164
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,020
Stephen Mulhall, just before I was doing an event

165
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
with a chief rabbi actually about,

166
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
he's got a wonderful book called Science and Religion,

167
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
The Great Partnership.

168
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
And he referred me to this guy Herbert McCabe,

169
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,020
and here in Oxford, who actually a Marxist theologian.

170
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Get that, you know, that's quite a cool title.

171
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,020
But he's got quite a lot of crazy articles

172
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
about Christian kind of traditions and things,

173
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,020
but he had this one article which Stephen Mulhall referred me to,

174
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
and in there he says,

175
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
to assert the existence of God is to claim

176
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,020
that there is an unanswered question about the universe.

177
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,020
So I thought that's quite an interesting definition,

178
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
and I sort of, through the book,

179
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
I run with sort of just exploring a little bit about

180
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,020
what sort of idea that is as a God.

181
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,020
Herbert McCabe says, you know, religion basically committed

182
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,020
iconoclism by giving this very abstract high concept

183
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
too many properties it just didn't have.

184
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
And of course as kids that's what we get introduced to,

185
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,020
all the silly things, and then we sort of discard that.

186
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,020
So I sort of wanted to have a perhaps a more nuanced engagement

187
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
with this question by defining something

188
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
of abstract like this.

189
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Now there is this term, the God of the gaps,

190
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
which you may have heard of,

191
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,020
but that's actually used by religious people

192
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
as a kind of negative thing.

193
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
A lot of religious people will say,

194
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
no, you're meant to attempt to know God,

195
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,020
so actually the God of the gaps is something

196
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,020
that they sort of use as a kind of negative statement.

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
But I want to try and reclaim that maybe

198
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
and just explore through this book

199
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
and a little bit with you now

200
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
as we go through these attempts

201
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
to find out what is it that could transcend

202
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,020
our understanding forever.

203
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
So as I said, the book is divided up

204
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
into these seven edges of knowledge,

205
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
seven areas that I've sort of explored,

206
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
which go from trying to understand

207
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,020
the nature of the universe, is it infinite,

208
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
whether we can infinitely divide matter,

209
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,020
what's going on inside our brain.

210
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
So I'm going to take you on a little tour

211
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
of a few of these to give you a sort of feel

212
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
for what might be unknowable

213
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
and whether we can know that sort of thing.

214
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,020
I think one of the ultimate symbols

215
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,020
of the unknowable is in fact the dice.

216
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,020
A dice would not make a fun game

217
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
if you could actually predict

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
what this was going to do next.

219
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
So the first edge that I explored

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,020
is about the nature of the future.

221
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Can we predict the future?

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
And in fact mathematics at its heart

223
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,020
is very much trying to do that.

224
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,020
I'll call a mathematician a pattern-searcher.

225
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
What we do is look at patterns in the past

226
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
and try and use those to extrapolate

227
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,020
to understand patterns into the future.

228
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
So how powerful is my language of mathematics

229
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,020
in being able to predict what is going to happen next?

230
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
So actually each of the edges is accompanied

231
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
by an object which kind of sparks

232
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
my journey into the unknown.

233
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,020
So the object for this particular edge

234
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
is the casino dice.

235
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
And this is in fact a casino dice

236
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
that I picked up when I was in Vegas.

237
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,020
I was trying to use my maths to make a lot of money

238
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
and I've lost so much money

239
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
but they let me keep the dice.

240
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
That's nice of them.

241
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Now it's a thing of beauty.

242
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
You can come and look at it afterwards.

243
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,020
Because it has to be incredibly fair,

244
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,020
it's a pretty much perfect cube.

245
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
The edges are just beautifully sharp

246
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,020
and the paint has the same density,

247
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,020
the acetate, it's really...

248
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
It is a thing of beauty

249
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
and it also is something that I absolutely hate.

250
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Because I cannot...

251
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
My desire to do mathematics was partly

252
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
about wanting to know, with 100% certainty

253
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
that something was true.

254
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
And here was this thing

255
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
which when I roll it, I just don't know

256
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
what I got to one that time.

257
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
I might be able to...

258
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
I've got the equations for this thing

259
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
but how can I tell what it's going to do next?

260
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,020
So that was a kind of challenge.

261
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,020
Actually maybe if I worked hard enough

262
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
I could know what this was going to do.

263
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
And I guess the hero on my journey

264
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,020
to try and use mathematics

265
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
to be able to predict the future

266
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
is Isaac Newton.

267
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
Because Isaac Newton came up

268
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,020
with the laws of motion, the physical laws of motion,

269
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
the idea of calculus.

270
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
He showed us how the universe can be controlled.

271
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
We can predict when an eclipse is going to happen.

272
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
We were able to predict that Mercury

273
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
was going to go across the sun just recently.

274
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
And that's all thanks to

275
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
this revolution that Newton started.

276
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Which kind of revealed

277
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
that the universe may be

278
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
a kind of clockwork universe

279
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
controlled by these equations.

280
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
If you know how things are set up,

281
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
you run the equations, you can know

282
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,020
what's going to happen into the future.

283
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
Well, if Newton is my hero,

284
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
my nemesis in this whole desire

285
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
to know the future is this guy here,

286
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician

287
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
who at the beginning of the 20th century

288
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
said, yeah, well,

289
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
universe may be controlled by equations.

290
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
It may be that

291
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
if you know the absolute start-up

292
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
of any system you run the equations,

293
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
you'll know exactly what's going to happen in the future.

294
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
But he said, unfortunately,

295
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
you're never going to have that complete knowledge

296
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
of how a system is set up.

297
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Because there's always a little bit of error.

298
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
If you're measuring how the solar system is set up,

299
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,020
then how can you be sure

300
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
that you've got the 50th decimal place right?

301
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
And what Poincaré showed

302
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,020
is that just a very small change

303
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
in maybe the 50th decimal place

304
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
may cause a dramatically different outcome.

305
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Now, one of my favourite examples

306
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,020
of chaos in motion,

307
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
and this is an illustration

308
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
that even something very simple

309
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
can have a very difficult

310
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
future to try and predict.

311
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
So this is a pendulum.

312
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Now, a pendulum is generally something so simple

313
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
and predictable, we use it to keep track of time.

314
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
But this is a slightly different pendulum.

315
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,020
So this is what I call a double pendulum.

316
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
So it's jointed,

317
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
so it's a little bit like a leg.

318
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
So it's just two metal pieces here.

319
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
So the, you know,

320
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
it's a very simple geometric description

321
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
and the equations are equally quite simple.

322
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
But being able to predict

323
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
the behaviour of this thing

324
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
is almost impossible.

325
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
So let's set this off.

326
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
And...

327
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
You see, why are you laughing?

328
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Because it's so hilariously funny

329
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,020
that you can't predict it.

330
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
It's very interesting.

331
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
It always makes me laugh.

332
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
I've had a little notch there,

333
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
so the point is I'm going to try and repeat that behaviour.

334
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,020
I'm going to try and start it off

335
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
in exactly the same starting position.

336
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Then it's...

337
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Wow!

338
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
It's a completely different behaviour that time.

339
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
I think I've tightened it a little bit too fast

340
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
because it's...

341
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Let's do a big one here.

342
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
This is my favourite desktop toy.

343
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
I can play with this for absolutely hours.

344
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
But it sort of illustrates

345
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
that even very simple systems

346
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
you make a very small change to the conditions

347
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
and it can go in a completely different direction.

348
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
And this is the signature of something called chaos.

349
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Another of my favourite desktop toys

350
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,020
is this one here.

351
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
I use this to make all my decisions about life.

352
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
So you can see it has

353
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
different options.

354
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Ask a friend, try again, no way.

355
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
Definitely maybe yes.

356
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
And what you do is...

357
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
I'll show you the little video of this.

358
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
So this is one set up in a lab.

359
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
You start this thing off and try to predict this.

360
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
So I'm going to ask it,

361
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
shall I go to have a beer in the pub

362
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
after this lecture?

363
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
Let's see...

364
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Oh, definitely!

365
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Oh great, so that's good. Excellent.

366
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
I think I've...

367
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
It always says definitely when I ask it about the beer.

368
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
It's really great. Thanks.

369
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,020
But you can see from this that

370
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
just if I run that again,

371
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,020
trying to see beforehand

372
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
which magnet that's going to end up in.

373
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,020
So there are three magnets here

374
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
and the thing is just being pulled around.

375
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
It's a bit like an asteroid flying around three planets

376
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
and which planet is it going to hit

377
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
will eventually go for this one here.

378
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
And here's three computer simulations

379
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
I did where I actually just changed

380
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
something like the sixth decimal place

381
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
of the coordinate where the pendulum

382
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,020
started.

383
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
And you can see...

384
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
So I've coloured the magnets up now.

385
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
So I've got blue magnet, a yellow magnet

386
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
and just a very small change

387
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
caused a completely different behaviour,

388
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
a different path, different planet

389
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
that the asteroid hit.

390
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
And here is a computer simulation

391
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
which tells you, helps you to predict

392
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,020
maybe

393
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
where the pendulum is going to end up.

394
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
So there are some regions which are very predictable.

395
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
So if you're close to the yellow magnet

396
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
so the idea is if you start the pendulum

397
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,020
off

398
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
over a particular point

399
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
you look at the colour under that point

400
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
where the pendulum is going to end up.

401
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
So if I start near a yellow magnet

402
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,020
then the thing just wobbles about

403
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,020
and goes back to the yellow magnet.

404
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,020
But there are other regions

405
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
which are a little bit further away.

406
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
So here's a very large swath of red.

407
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
You start there, it'll swing out

408
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
but will then end up at the red magnet.

409
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
So small changes are not going to be

410
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
cause any dramatic difference

411
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
in where the magnet will end up.

412
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
But I was starting that magnet

413
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,020
in the top left-hand corner

414
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
in this region you have what's called a fractal.

415
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
So this is a shape

416
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
which has infinite complexity.

417
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
So as I zoom in on it, it never simplifies.

418
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
It never becomes a single colour.

419
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
So it means that

420
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,020
however

421
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,020
accurately I try and measure this thing

422
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,020
just a few more decimal places

423
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
can kick it quite easily

424
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
from going from the yellow to the red magnet.

425
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
So this is saying that

426
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
unless I have complete

427
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
description of how the universe

428
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
is set up, I cannot know the future

429
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
in this region. Just a small change

430
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,020
in a decimal place will cause a completely

431
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,020
different outcome to happen.

432
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Now I also

433
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
was accompanied on my journey into

434
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,020
these edges of knowledge

435
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
by a few experts.

436
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,020
I chose a lot of areas I'm not expert at all

437
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
and it's very much was a learning curve for me some of this.

438
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020
And in this chapter

439
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
about chaos I actually chose

440
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
a colleague of ours here

441
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
in Oxford. This is Bob May

442
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
Lord May as he's there.

443
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
And he actually discovered

444
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,020
this idea of chaos theory

445
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
affects so much of what we're trying

446
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
to predict about the future. The reason

447
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
that I wasn't sure whether it was going to be a monsoon

448
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
out there, I mean yesterday

449
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
we had monsoons kind of weather hitting us

450
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
being able to predict the weather

451
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
five days in advance is impossible

452
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
because just a very small change

453
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
in some of those measurements of the wind speed

454
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
temperature can cause within five days

455
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
things to go dramatically different.

456
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Now the planets too

457
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,020
are very sensitive but on a

458
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
fortunately on a longer scale than five days.

459
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
I mean we're talking sort of five billion years

460
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
a very small change can actually cause

461
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
the solar system to do something completely different.

462
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,020
But Bob May has

463
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
discovered that not only in

464
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
these kind of physical systems but also in

465
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
biology as well. He's a mathematical

466
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
biologist. He discovered that

467
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
trying to keep track of population dynamics

468
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
is also controlled by chaotic

469
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
equations. So just a very

470
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
small change you put in one extra animal

471
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
and the dynamics can be completely different.

472
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
You can have the whole system collapsing

473
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
whilst without that animal you can have

474
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
a very healthy

475
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
pack of animals the next year.

476
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
And in fact now he's working

477
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
he's a cross-party member in the House of Lords

478
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
and he spends a lot of time

479
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
actually working on the banking crisis

480
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,020
and trying to understand whether that was an example

481
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
of a chaotic behaviour.

482
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
And sure enough

483
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
people in economics there are regions

484
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
like those yellow regions where things are very predictable

485
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
and then it can go

486
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
into very strange unpredictable regions.

487
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
And he said this to me whilst we were talking

488
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
I went to him and had lunch with him at the House of Lords

489
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,020
and he said not only in research

490
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
but in the everyday world of politics and economics

491
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
it would be better off if more people

492
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
realised that simple systems do not

493
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
necessarily possess simple

494
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
dynamic properties.

495
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
And I asked him how are you getting on

496
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,020
in trying to persuade your fellow

497
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
politicians about the importance of knowing

498
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
about chaos theory.

499
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
And he said Marcus there are just egos here

500
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
nobody's interested in what I said

501
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
it's just they're all interested in their careers

502
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
so he was very down on that.

503
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
But I think that is one of the important things

504
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
when you're trying to do policy

505
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
is knowing when you can be confident

506
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
about what's going to happen next.

507
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm not saying that mathematics is completely useless

508
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
we've been able to land that spaceship

509
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
on the side of a comet because

510
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
of Newton's equations.

511
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
But it's also important to know

512
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
maybe in the top left hand corner

513
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
of that fractally picture

514
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
where now you can say you can't know.

515
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
So it's almost as important to know

516
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
when you can't know as to know

517
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
when you can know because then you can be

518
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
conservative and hunker down and kind

519
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
of avoid

520
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
the mess that might emerge.

521
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
So I came back to my dice and I was

522
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
very interested okay well what about this

523
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
is this just chaotic

524
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
or if I knew this

525
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
to a certain amount of detail could I actually

526
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
predict what it was going to do next.

527
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
I have the laws of motion which control

528
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
how this falls, how it hits the table

529
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
and I

530
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,020
actually discovered a recent piece

531
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
of research done by four Hungarians

532
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
which revealed that actually this is more

533
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
predictable than I thought it was going to be.

534
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
So what they've done is

535
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
I mean I had that picture with the three magnets

536
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
which I had three colours for

537
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
so now we've got six sides

538
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
and so we've got six colours to keep track of

539
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
so we can draw a picture of how we start

540
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
off a dice and what

541
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
what that effect will have

542
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
on the outcome, which coloured face will it

543
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
land on and it turns out that

544
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
if the table that you're throwing it on

545
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
is

546
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
that dissipates quite a lot of energy

547
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
so it's sort of when it falls the energy

548
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
kind of gets sucked out of it so like a carpet

549
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
for example then actually

550
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
the behaviour of this is described

551
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
by the picture in the top left

552
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
hand corner so actually

553
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
if the energy is being dissipated so if I throw

554
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
this on the floor here

555
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
it doesn't bounce very much

556
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
and actually it turns out

557
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
that we don't have this fractal quality

558
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
there's sways of yellow

559
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
sways of green, sways of blue

560
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
and so a small change is not going to change

561
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
where that dice is going to land up

562
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
so here's a tip do you want to know which way it's going to land

563
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
what you need to look at is the bottom

564
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
number because it's more likely to land

565
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
when you throw it like that

566
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
on the bottom number

567
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
in fact I had a one on the bottom and it came up one

568
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
so there you are, quids in

569
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
but if you think about it

570
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
at the craps table in the

571
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
you've got to sort of felt on there

572
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
it's dissipating some sort of energy

573
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
but here this is very hard this table

574
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
so as you move through here

575
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
the rigidity of the table is increasing

576
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
and so it's losing less energy as you go through

577
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
so let's try and do that again

578
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
so down in here we get a very fractal region

579
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,020
so now a very small change

580
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
so

581
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
so it landed a four

582
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
whilst I had the one on the bottom

583
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
at that time

584
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
so it depends on the circumstances

585
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
but there are regions where I can

586
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
know what this dice is going to do next

587
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
and actually that's kind of your

588
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
one thought is

589
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
I've sort of brought up on the universe is controlled

590
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
by equations and if you know the complete setup

591
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
you should be able to know exactly

592
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
what's going to happen next

593
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
of course we may not know the complete setup

594
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
of the universe

595
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
a small change means that you might lose a lot of

596
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
knowledge about what's happening next

597
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
but in fact there's part of science which says

598
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
even if you know the complete setup

599
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
of the universe

600
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
there are still certain circumstances

601
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
where there's no way you're going to know

602
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
what's going to happen next

603
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
and one of them is

604
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
the chapter that I explored

605
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
next

606
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
was trying to predict the behaviour

607
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,020
of a pot of uranium

608
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,020
on the internet

609
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
so this pot of uranium

610
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
I audited it over the internet

611
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,020
and I'm assured it's

612
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm assured that it's completely safe

613
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,020
but the instructions say

614
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
don't eat it

615
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
but this actually

616
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
at its heart

617
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
is the question of when this

618
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
is going to radiate

619
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
at the side it says

620
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
it's going to emit 984

621
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
counts of radiation

622
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
so if you have a Geiger counter

623
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
you get 984 counts per minute

624
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
so it's got some sort of

625
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
estimate of what it's going to do

626
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,020
but that's only an approximate estimate

627
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
so it says over a minute

628
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,020
on average that's what you'll get

629
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
what it can't tell me is

630
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
when it's going to emit an alpha particle

631
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,020
for example

632
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
and the extraordinary thing is

633
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
the current state of physics says

634
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,020
how the universe is

635
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,020
that there is no mechanism

636
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
nothing that we can do

637
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
which is going to tell us

638
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,020
when this uranium is going to emit

639
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
it's next particle

640
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,020
that this we say is random

641
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,020
but that's actually just an expression

642
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
of our lack of knowledge of the startup

643
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
this seems to be something

644
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020
which the physics says is genuinely random

645
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
and actually the person at the heart

646
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
of trying to explain what this bit of uranium

647
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
is doing, why it's emitting at particular points

648
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
this is a picture of Heisenberg

649
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm trying to embrace and love Heisenberg

650
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
but he's another person I don't really like

651
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
and this equation

652
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
so you've probably heard of this thing

653
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

654
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

655
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
almost embeds the idea that

656
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
there are things you cannot know

657
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
that you will never be able to know

658
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
about a physical system

659
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
and it's not a vague wishy-washy

660
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,020
thing about cats and Schrodinger

661
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,020
it's actually a very explicit mathematical formula

662
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
and follows out of the mathematics

663
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,020
so these two terms here

664
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,020
delta x and delta p

665
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
this is about a position and momentum

666
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
so basically

667
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
these two things are kind of paired up

668
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,020
and the more knowledge you get

669
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,020
about the position of something

670
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
the less you know about the potential momentum

671
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,020
the momentum you remember

672
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
is how something is travelling

673
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
it involves the speed of the thing

674
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
and in fact

675
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,020
I've got to tell you one of my favourite jokes

676
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Heisenberg is storming down the autobahn

677
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
in Germany and the police

678
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
pull him over and they get him

679
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,020
out of the car and say

680
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,020
sir do you know how fast you were going

681
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
there's no but I know exactly where I was

682
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
now that's good

683
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
a good sign that you're all laughing

684
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
because if anyone who didn't laugh

685
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
and I now have to explain the joke a little bit

686
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
is that there's a trade-off here

687
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
and this is what this equation says

688
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
the more I know about

689
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
the position of something

690
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
that's the delta x is controlling

691
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
what the error is so the more I know

692
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
about it and the smaller the error

693
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
in order to make this equation true

694
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
the momentum has to increase

695
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
the uncertainty

696
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
in the momentum has to increase

697
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
the knowledge I have of the momentum

698
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
I lose knowledge about it

699
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
and actually it's perfectly summed up

700
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
in some of these lovely experiments

701
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
now you might have heard about this thing

702
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
called the double slit experiment

703
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
where you send an electron through

704
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
and it doesn't really decide

705
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
it seems to go through both slits at the same time

706
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
and actually this thing about uncertainty

707
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
is even revealed with just one single slit

708
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
so all I'm going to do

709
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
is to take my uranium off in a very far distance

710
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
so that's going to be my particle gun

711
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I'm going to have say

712
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
an alpha particle shooting out of here

713
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
and I've got this a large distance away

714
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I've got a screen

715
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
with a slit in it

716
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
and it means that if a particle passes through there

717
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
then there can be

718
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
no momentum in the up-down direction

719
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
because any momentum in the up-down direction

720
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
would push it off

721
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
and it would hit the screen and not go through

722
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
so if any particle that goes through

723
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
that slit

724
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
I know has almost

725
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
zero momentum

726
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
in the vertical position

727
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
because that's the only way

728
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
if it had any momentum it would not go through that slit

729
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
because the distance I've made very large

730
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
but as soon as it goes through that slit

731
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
I also have now gained

732
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
a very tight knowledge

733
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
about where that particle is

734
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
because it's gone through that slit

735
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
so I seem to have got the trade-off

736
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
I know exactly the momentum

737
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
and I know exactly the position of this thing

738
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
but as soon as I know the position

739
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
it causes a sudden uncertainty to occur

740
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
in the momentum

741
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
so sunny this thing gains momentum

742
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
when it didn't have it before

743
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
and the uncertainty is expressed here

744
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
so this is actually experimental data

745
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
where they took particles

746
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
the smaller the slit

747
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
the more information I have

748
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
about where that particle is

749
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
which means there must be a larger trade-off

750
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
in the spread of momentum

751
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
and you can see this

752
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
the narrower slit is the bottom

753
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
graph and then suddenly the momentum is spread

754
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
all over the place so where the particle arrives

755
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
on the screen could be in a wide

756
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
range of possible values

757
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
but as I lose information about

758
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
position by widening the slit

759
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
the momentum comes back in again

760
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
and I have more information about the momentum

761
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
now this is absolutely extraordinary

762
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,020
it kind of says that I can't know

763
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
these two things together

764
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,020
but actually

765
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
some physicists have started to interpret this

766
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
and saying actually this is a mistaken language

767
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
that actually

768
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
these particles don't have

769
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
a momentum and a position

770
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,020
we're so hooked on the way Newton thought about the world

771
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
we just think yes

772
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
you've got this electron, it's got some position

773
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
it is somewhere

774
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
in the momentum and you use that to try and make predictions

775
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
but physicists now say

776
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,020
no you shouldn't think of it like that

777
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
it's a wrong language

778
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
so often some of these kind of unknowns

779
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
turn out to be just that we aren't able to use language properly

780
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
and so

781
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
people now think that you should say

782
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
well that electron doesn't have

783
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
a position

784
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,020
an identifiable position until you observe

785
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
where it is and so we have this scene now

786
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
called a quantum wave

787
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,020
which actually describes the probability

788
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,020
that where you'll find that electron

789
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,020
should you

790
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,020
or that particle, alpha particle

791
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
should you want to observe it

792
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
so you should think of this thing as not having a position

793
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
it's got a sort of probabilistic position

794
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
spread out over space

795
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
the peaks of this wave function

796
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
tell you it's more likely to be there

797
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,020
the troughs tell you it's less likely to be there

798
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
and this is all you can know

799
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
and you can't know where that

800
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
where that electron is going to be

801
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
more dramatically you can't know

802
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
when you observe it

803
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
where it's going to be

804
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
it could be in any of these kind of peaks

805
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
or even in the troughs as well

806
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
and so quantum physics at the moment

807
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
has at its heart this belief

808
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
that it doesn't matter what you do

809
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
you will not be able to know and predict

810
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
and you can run the experiment over and over again

811
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
and you'll get different answers

812
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
with the same setup

813
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
if you could ever start the thing in the same way

814
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
and actually this is responsible for the uranium

815
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
emitting particles

816
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
you know a lot about the momentum

817
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
of the things inside the nucleus of this uranium

818
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,020
which causes an uncertainty in the position

819
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,020
such that at some points

820
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
suddenly the particle would say

821
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
hey I seem to be outside the nucleus

822
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
I'm not inside it anymore and it goes flying off

823
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
so this is actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

824
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,020
helps to understand

825
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
why this thing is actually emitting particles

826
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
now there are some people who just believe

827
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
this can't be how the universe is really behaving

828
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
surely this just can't be random

829
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
about what this is doing

830
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
and there must be some mechanism

831
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
for deciding ok it might look probabilistic

832
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,020
the same as the dice

833
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
the best things we had to predict the dice

834
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,020
is probability but we know that there are laws of physics

835
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,020
controlling what that dice is going to do

836
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
and one of those who really believed

837
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
this just can't be the answer

838
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
was Einstein and Einstein had this famous quote

839
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
quantum mechanics is very impressive

840
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
and it certainly is

841
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
it's one of the most well tested theories

842
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,020
we have on the scientific books

843
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,020
it was such accuracy that

844
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,020
we know we're on to something

845
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
but an inner voice tells me

846
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,020
that it is not yet the real thing

847
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
the theory produces a good deal

848
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the old one

849
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
I am at all events convinced

850
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,020
that he does not play dice

851
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020
and I think

852
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
maybe it's the mathematician in me

853
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020
I also

854
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
I'm still with Einstein with this

855
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
that surely we will come

856
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,020
to a point where we have a new theory

857
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,020
a new Einstein that tells us something

858
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,020
about the mechanism which is going on

859
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
which is controlling this

860
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,020
but we know that the mechanism is going to be really

861
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
freaky

862
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
we know this thing called entanglement

863
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
which shows us that any mechanism

864
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
there can't be a little internal clock in there

865
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,020
which is just saying now you're spitting out

866
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
now you're not whenever you look

867
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
this system if it is there

868
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
we know must be spread across the whole

869
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,020
of the universe which is controlling

870
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
what this thing is doing

871
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
now I mentioned right at the beginning

872
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,020
that part of this exploration was about this idea

873
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
of God being the things that we cannot know

874
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
so here is something that apparently

875
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
we are not able to know

876
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
when this thing is going to spit out

877
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,020
a bit of its nucleus

878
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,020
so the

879
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
actually the person I took on my journey

880
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,020
to this edge of knowledge

881
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
is a quantum physicist

882
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
but he's also a priest

883
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
so this is John Polkinghorn

884
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
he likes to call himself a vegetarian butcher

885
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,020
how can somebody be a quantum physicist

886
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,020
and also a priest at the same time

887
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
John Polkinghorn he has incredibly good credentials

888
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,020
he's trained with Dirac

889
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
in Cambridge then went and trained with Feynman

890
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
he made great discoveries

891
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
about quarks

892
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
and then halfway through

893
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
his scientific life

894
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
he then decided that he wanted to be ordained

895
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
so I was very intrigued to talk to him

896
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
about how

897
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
does he believe

898
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,020
his God works in the world

899
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
because there are a lot of religious scientists

900
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
and I must say although I believe in the arsenal

901
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
I am an atheist at heart

902
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,020
and I will declare that

903
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
but there are quite a lot of religious scientists

904
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
but they divide into two groups

905
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
and one are the Daists

906
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
and one are the Theists

907
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,020
the Daists say okay look

908
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
I don't know where this universe came from

909
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,020
I don't know what started it

910
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,020
or what created it but once it's been created

911
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
there's no okay I'm going to call that God

912
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
because I really don't know what it is

913
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
but after that

914
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
basically the laws of physics take over

915
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
and the whole thing is now something I can talk about

916
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
and so they don't think God

917
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
acts in this world in any sort of meaningful way

918
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
but John Paul Kinghorn is a theist

919
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
and he really believes

920
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,020
whatever this thing God is

921
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
that it acts in the world

922
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,020
and so I was trying to press him

923
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,020
okay well how, you're a scientist

924
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,020
how is he acting in the world

925
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,020
how is this thing it acting in the world

926
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
and you know we're thinking of it as the unknowns

927
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
so that's very interesting

928
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
so here we have an unknown quantum physics

929
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
I don't know when this particle

930
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
is going to emit or where

931
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
I'm going to find a particle

932
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
is that an unknown that can have influence in the world

933
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
well yes it can

934
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
I mean whether it has any sort of

935
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
belief

936
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
whether there's any sort of meaning

937
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
to what that action is

938
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
so I was intrigued you know are you going to say

939
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
maybe your God is using quantum physics

940
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,020
so it can make a decision

941
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,020
that the electron here and here

942
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
and that might actually have a dramatic effect

943
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
on the universe because chaos says that

944
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020
small changes can have big effects

945
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,020
so I thought he was going to say yes

946
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
quantum physics perfect place my God

947
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
to act in the world

948
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
but he wasn't going to buy that a toy

949
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
so no no no because that really depends

950
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
all of these

951
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
observations

952
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
decisions about where the electron is going to be

953
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
depend on an observation

954
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
it depends on interacting with the thing

955
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
my wave function

956
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
a deterministic wave function

957
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
and actually we're all part of a system

958
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
so surely what is an observation anyway

959
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
surely we're all just part of some huge great big universal wave function

960
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
so he wasn't into using

961
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,020
quantum physics as the way that his God

962
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
was acting in the world

963
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,020
so I said okay well how are you doing this

964
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
how is it doing it

965
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
and he actually went back to chaos theory

966
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
intriguingly so his theory is that

967
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
as humans we can never know

968
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
the setup of a system

969
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
with complete accuracy

970
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
there will always be decimal places

971
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
which we don't know about

972
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
and he believes that that's where

973
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
a God could act and tinker with things

974
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
and change things so it could be different

975
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
as the thing evolves

976
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
actually Newton used to think this as well

977
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
and Leibniz who was his great competitor

978
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
over the calculus just said that's totally ridiculous

979
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
why on earth would he have to tinker

980
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
why because he just set the whole thing up

981
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
and let it go running in the way that it was meant to

982
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
at the beginning

983
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
so he knew exactly what was going to happen anyway

984
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
so

985
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
it was a kind of intriguing journey

986
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
talking to him about how would you use

987
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
science to kind of

988
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
marry up with your theistic beliefs

989
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
in a God acting in the world

990
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
but the interesting thing is that I went into this journey

991
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
is that one of that reason

992
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
that a lot of the scientific religious people

993
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,020
who are daest to say okay I don't know

994
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
where all of this came from

995
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,020
let's call that creator

996
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
a God and then I'm just going to do science

997
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
and so that unknown

998
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,020
because it is you know we don't know

999
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
where it all came from

1000
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
but actually this Heisenberg uncertainty principle

1001
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
gives us a chance to actually see

1002
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
where this stuff came from

1003
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
because okay where did my pot of uranium come from

1004
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
well I went on Amazon

1005
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
so I bought it on Amazon

1006
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
so that's its first source

1007
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
and actually it's amazing kind of reviews

1008
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
you can find on Amazon

1009
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
so glad five stars

1010
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
so glad I don't have to buy this from the Libyans

1011
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
in the parking lot at the mall anymore

1012
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
there were some others complaining

1013
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,020
about the fact that the thing had disappeared

1014
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,020
you know gone down by half

1015
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
he was so good

1016
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
you're laughing and I don't have to explain about half-lifes

1017
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
oh that's so good

1018
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
anyway so yeah

1019
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,020
but if I trace this back okay

1020
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
as I talked to somebody on Tuesday about this

1021
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
and he said he was a miner

1022
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
and he said well it's clear it came from a mine

1023
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
okay yeah but where did it come from

1024
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
before the mine and you trace it back

1025
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
so it was made in a star

1026
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
the most amazing thing you know how stars make all of these extraordinary

1027
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,020
atoms

1028
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
but what about before that so we trace it back

1029
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
where did all of this stuff come from

1030
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
and it turns out that actually Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

1031
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,020
might be

1032
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
the equation

1033
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
which helps us to get something from nothing

1034
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
this is one of the big unsolved questions

1035
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
why is there something

1036
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
rather than nothing

1037
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
and actually if you've got two things

1038
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
that things get measurements get paired up

1039
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
if it sort of matters what order I do it in

1040
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
so a measuring position and momentum

1041
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
somehow it matters what order I do

1042
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
and they get combined in an uncertainty principle

1043
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
but there's another uncertainty principle

1044
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,020
which combines energy and time

1045
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,020
so this is expressed here

1046
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,020
so any increase in the amount

1047
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
if you want to narrow in on a little window of time

1048
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,020
the energy within that window

1049
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,020
becomes less certain

1050
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
so if you've got a region where there's nothing going on there

1051
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
so you've got no energy

1052
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,020
but actually if you decrease the window of time

1053
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,020
that means that the energy uncertainty

1054
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
must increase and so nothing might suddenly become

1055
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
a little bit of something

1056
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
a little bit of error

1057
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,020
and of course Einstein said

1058
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
energy equals mc2

1059
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
energy is equivalent to mass

1060
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
so you've got mass inside here

1061
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
so as we look in a little window

1062
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
actually we can suddenly get these quantum fluctuations

1063
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
where nothing can suddenly give rise

1064
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
to matter

1065
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
and this is actually

1066
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
you may know what Stephen Hawking

1067
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
is famous for

1068
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
he's famous for predicting that black holes

1069
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
another place actually where we seem to lose information

1070
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
if you go past the horizon

1071
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
of a black hole inside

1072
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,020
we seem to not be able to know what is going on inside a black hole

1073
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,020
because information can't get out

1074
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
one theory has it

1075
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
but Hawking thinks there may be a way things can get out

1076
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,020
and it's because of the uncertainty principle

1077
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
at the horizon is that

1078
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,020
although there's nothing there

1079
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
every now and again

1080
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,020
this quantum fluctuation can cause a particle

1081
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,020
an antiparticle to appear out of nothing

1082
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,020
it's a bit like taking the equation 0

1083
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
equals 1 minus 1

1084
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
so you can have nothing and then suddenly get 1

1085
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
and minus 1 and that antiparticle gets sucked into the black hole

1086
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
makes it a little bit smaller

1087
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
and the particle gets emitted out

1088
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
so we believe in this thing Hawking radiation

1089
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
we haven't measured it yet which is why he hasn't got

1090
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
a Nobel Prize yet but when we do measure it

1091
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,020
he will because this is a way that

1092
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
black holes will actually kind of evaporate

1093
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
and may give back information

1094
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
we think that there's

1095
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,020
something called the information paradox

1096
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
that black holes may be somewhere where we lose information

1097
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
but actually this leaking

1098
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
according to this equation

1099
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
equation might be a way of us getting back information

1100
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
but here is an equation

1101
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
which then gives us a way of getting uranium out of nothing

1102
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,020
now you might say

1103
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,020
well yeah but that isn't really nothing because you've got space there

1104
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,020
space just vacuum

1105
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
isn't nothing it's a three dimensional

1106
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
space and so that is something still

1107
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,020
and as a mathematician I certainly

1108
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,020
believe that it is a something

1109
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,020
so that isn't really nothing so where did that something

1110
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,020
where did that empty space

1111
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
where did that empty geometry come from

1112
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,020
but even now as we push

1113
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
one of the big mysteries is how to equate

1114
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
relativity and quantum physics

1115
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
and the idea of quantum gravity

1116
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
fluctuations in quantum gravity

1117
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,020
mean that even space itself

1118
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
might emerge as a fluctuation

1119
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
out of genuinely something which is nothing

1120
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
so actually

1121
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
it might be that our desire

1122
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
for some creator

1123
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,020
is well actually the creator is just mathematics

1124
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,020
mathematics is outside of time

1125
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
it's been there forever will be there forever

1126
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
and this is a way of just

1127
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,020
blowing something into those equations

1128
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
and then you get something out of nothing

1129
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
so you know often they say God is a mathematician

1130
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
I would reverse that and say no no mathematics

1131
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,020
is the God which started all of this

1132
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
so that's a couple of the

1133
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,020
unknowns so

1134
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,020
let me just give you a little guide

1135
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
through a couple more and then I'll show you one of my

1136
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,020
so let's see

1137
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
one of the other ones is I

1138
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,020
dig down into my uranium and ask

1139
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
how far can you go can you infinitely divide uranium

1140
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,020
if you go inside it that atom

1141
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,020
is made out of electrons and quarks

1142
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,020
we think that's the bottom layer but

1143
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,020
how do we know that and we'll maybe

1144
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,020
we thought atoms were the bottom layer

1145
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,020
so that one's

1146
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
we might keep on dividing space

1147
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
although we think there's a little quantized space

1148
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
beyond which you can't divide anything

1149
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
what about going out is the universe infinite

1150
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
if it is could we ever know that

1151
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,020
so that's one of my other edges

1152
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,020
time

1153
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
what about time itself

1154
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
so you know we think time

1155
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
had a beginning the big bang

1156
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
but can we talk about what happened before

1157
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
the big bang

1158
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,020
now I was brought up in this department

1159
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
on the kind of idea you can't

1160
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
it doesn't make sense because you need time

1161
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
to say before and so if there wasn't

1162
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
any time you can't say before

1163
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
that's really clever

1164
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I like that and they would always go

1165
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
yeah so what's north of the north pole

1166
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
and you go yeah I get that

1167
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
there's kind of nothing there

1168
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
but actually people are beginning to wonder

1169
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
that maybe you can talk about time before the big bang

1170
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
the weird thing is that time

1171
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
it's time infinite

1172
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,020
is it going to go on forever

1173
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
when it turns out that it may also run out

1174
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
at the other end as well which is kind of frightening

1175
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,020
so time may

1176
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,020
we know we're all finite

1177
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,020
but what if the universe is finite

1178
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
that's pretty frightening

1179
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,020
and it turns out that everything's kind of decaying

1180
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,020
like these black holes and all we'll be left with

1181
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
is photons and gravitons

1182
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,020
and photons and gravitons have no sense of time

1183
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
and so time will disappear

1184
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
they won't be able to measure things

1185
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,020
but actually this seemed deeply depressing

1186
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,020
so I went and talked to Roger Penrose

1187
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,020
who's my journeyman on this journey into time

1188
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
and he's come up with a lovely

1189
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
positive way of viewing this

1190
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
that then you can rescale the universe

1191
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
because you've lost a sense of time

1192
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
and that will be the beginning of a new eon

1193
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
and a new big bang

1194
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,020
so it was more hopeful, I love Roger

1195
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
and I love Roger as well because he changed his mind

1196
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
he was one of these people I was brought up on

1197
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
who said you can't talk about time before the big bang

1198
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,020
and now he's changed his mind

1199
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
I love that in a scientist

1200
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
so I'm going to take you

1201
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
actually into a journey

1202
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
I'll talk for another

1203
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,020
I'll talk quarter two

1204
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,020
because I wasn't allowed to start

1205
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,020
if that's okay

1206
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,020
because I do want to take you into this edge

1207
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,020
to see me outside my comfort zone

1208
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,020
which is the question

1209
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
about what's happening inside your head

1210
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,020
it's called the hard problem of consciousness

1211
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
you're all sitting there

1212
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
and you're all doing

1213
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
most of you doing a pretty good impression

1214
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,020
of a conscious being

1215
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,020
I can see some of you sort of

1216
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,020
fair enough it's very sunny

1217
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
but you know I do believe that most of you

1218
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,020
are having a conscious experience

1219
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,020
but is that conscious experience

1220
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
anything like the conscious experience I'm having

1221
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,020
how can I ever know

1222
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
that you really are conscious

1223
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,020
or maybe you've just sent an avatar down here

1224
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,020
and you know

1225
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,020
you're doing such a good impression

1226
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,020
and so actually the

1227
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,020
objects I took on my journey

1228
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,020
into the hard problem of consciousness

1229
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,020
is in fact

1230
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,020
well it's a chatbot app

1231
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,020
that I downloaded onto my smartphone

1232
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,020
so I think it's a really interesting question

1233
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,020
when will my smartphone become conscious

1234
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,020
and could I ever know that

1235
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020
maybe it already is

1236
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,020
so

1237
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,020
it's perfectly encapsulated in this kind of touring

1238
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,020
question

1239
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
the problem of

1240
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,020
talking to a machine

1241
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,020
and determining at what point you say

1242
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,020
this thing is conscious

1243
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,020
so I actually did a little experiment with this

1244
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,020
it's called Cleverbot you can download it for free

1245
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,020
and you have a conversation with it

1246
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
and you sort of try to think

1247
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,020
whether is it somebody on the other end typing these things in or not

1248
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,020
so here's a little exercise for you

1249
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,020
I asked a few questions

1250
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,020
I asked questions of Cleverbot

1251
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,020
and I also did this a bit earlier

1252
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,020
and I asked some questions of my son

1253
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,020
my son's doing physics in Bristol at the moment

1254
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,020
he's 20 years old just to give you some context

1255
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,020
so I asked them both questions

1256
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,020
and I want you to listen to the questions

1257
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,020
and think can you work out which one is the machine

1258
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
and which one is my son

1259
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,020
so we kicked off with

1260
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,020
do you have a girlfriend

1261
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,020
so response A came back

1262
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,020
do you want me to have a girlfriend

1263
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,020
response B came back

1264
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,020
mind your own business

1265
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,020
so is that the machine

1266
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,020
and the machine of course learns

1267
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,020
it's an example of machine learning

1268
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
because every conversation you have with it

1269
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,020
is banked and becomes a conversation

1270
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,020
it will have with somebody else

1271
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,020
okay the next one what is your dream

1272
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
so response A was my dream is to become a famous poet

1273
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,020
response B

1274
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,020
to make lots of money

1275
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,020
who was going to want to do that one

1276
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,020
yes my son was born in the Thatcheride Age

1277
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,020
question 3

1278
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,020
are you conscious

1279
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,020
now both of these responses are intriguing

1280
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,020
because they played on this idea of Descartes

1281
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,020
I think therefore I am

1282
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,020
so response A was if I wasn't

1283
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,020
I don't think I

1284
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,020
it was quite convoluted

1285
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
but this one is Descartes' response

1286
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,020
which says the only thing I can be certain of

1287
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
and this goes

1288
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,020
one of the topics of this book is

1289
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020
how can you know anything

1290
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,020
and Descartes said the only thing I can be sure of

1291
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,020
is that I am conscious

1292
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,020
so there you are

1293
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,020
which one of those is a machine

1294
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,020
and which one is my son

1295
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
and if we got the machine better

1296
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,020
how can we ever know whether it was having a conscious world

1297
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,020
of course some of you may be synesthetic

1298
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,020
anyone's synesthetic here

1299
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,020
yes there's a finger going up at the back there

1300
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,020
what are you synesthetic with

1301
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,020
numbers and colours

1302
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,020
my wife is similarly synesthetic like this

1303
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,020
and so they are having a genuinely different conscious experience

1304
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
because when they see a number

1305
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
it gets coloured up

1306
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,020
I did some wonderful work

1307
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
with a piece of Messien

1308
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,020
Messien was synesthetic with sound and colour

1309
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,020
so when he listened to music

1310
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,020
his music it was full of colour

1311
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,020
so we know that people do have genuinely

1312
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,020
different responses

1313
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
conscious experiences

1314
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,020
but how can you tell

1315
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,020
one of the things I do as a mathematician

1316
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,020
very often if I am trying to understand something

1317
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
is to understand when something isn't that

1318
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,020
it's a very good way to flip the question

1319
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
take an animal

1320
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,020
which of these animals around us

1321
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,020
which species are actually conscious

1322
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,020
how many of these animals if you stick them in front of the mirror

1323
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,020
a cat, a dog, a rabbit

1324
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,020
would know that what they are looking at

1325
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,020
is themselves

1326
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,020
so here's a chimpanzee looking

1327
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,020
is that

1328
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,020
is he just admiring himself or doing a few

1329
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,020
funky moves

1330
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,020
now here's a test

1331
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,020
that Gordon Gallup came up with an animal behaviourist

1332
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
he said ok maybe you put a mark on somebody's forehead

1333
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,020
if you look in the mirror and you see something

1334
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,020
oh that's a bit weird

1335
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,020
you put your hand up to your forehead

1336
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,020
so he was interested in what animals will have this similar response

1337
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,020
wondering if you've got them used to what a mirror does

1338
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
so here's the orangutan who's been marked

1339
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,020
looking at himself in the mirror

1340
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,020
and so what is this response

1341
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,020
to suddenly seeing

1342
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,020
oh what's that weird thing I've got on my forehead

1343
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
so that would be

1344
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
if you put yourself in front of the mirror

1345
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,020
and you didn't know that somebody had put some yellow stuff

1346
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,020
on your forehead

1347
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,020
you would immediately go like this

1348
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,020
you wouldn't go like this on the mirror

1349
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,020
so you can see he's really pissed off

1350
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,020
that why has this person put this great big yellow

1351
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,020
dobb in front of it

1352
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,020
so it turns out

1353
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,020
how many animals pass this test

1354
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
very few humans do

1355
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
chimpanzees do

1356
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
and orangutans do

1357
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
but gorillons do not

1358
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
it's very few species that pass this test

1359
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,020
now there's a very crude test for consciousness

1360
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,020
but it is a measure of them realising

1361
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,020
that that is themselves

1362
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
so what about children

1363
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
if you've got a fetus

1364
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,020
a fetus isn't

1365
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,020
conscious so here's a picture of me as a baby

1366
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,020
I don't think I was conscious

1367
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,020
didn't have a sense of self then

1368
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,020
but what points in my evolution

1369
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,020
as I grew older did I

1370
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
suddenly start to pass that mirror self recognition test

1371
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,020
and realise yeah I am a conscious being

1372
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
there must have been a moment when my brain

1373
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,020
did something which changed

1374
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
and then I had a sense of consciousness

1375
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
it probably wasn't here

1376
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
but with experiments that we've done

1377
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
we've seen that actually

1378
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
there's a transitionary moment in the brain

1379
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
around 18 to 24 months

1380
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
if you put a 16 month old

1381
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,020
in front of the mirror

1382
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
with a little mark

1383
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
generally they don't react

1384
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
they perhaps do something to the mirror

1385
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,020
but a 20 month year old will immediately do this

1386
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
so something has happened in the brain

1387
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,020
that has changed that has created this consciousness

1388
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,020
and actually you can ask the same question

1389
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,020
of the universe

1390
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
the universe of the big bang

1391
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
was there any consciousness then

1392
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
so at what point did consciousness actually emerge

1393
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
and actually Julian James

1394
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
has a psychologist

1395
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,020
he has an interesting theory that

1396
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,020
that moment when we suddenly started hearing a voice in our heads

1397
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,020
must have been pretty frightening

1398
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,020
and that might have been the spark

1399
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
for something like an idea of a god

1400
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
maybe that's what sparked off the thought

1401
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,020
there's something else going on inside here

1402
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
ok so this idea of negatives

1403
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,020
let me tell you to this one

1404
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,020
the time when we all lose consciousness

1405
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,020
every day or rather every night

1406
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,020
is when we sleep

1407
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,020
so what happens in the brain every night

1408
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,020
that changes that we could see

1409
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
maybe what a quality of the brain

1410
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,020
that makes us conscious

1411
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,020
so here's an awake brain

1412
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,020
and you do something called TMS

1413
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,020
it's transcranial magnetic stimulation

1414
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
where you switch on some neurons

1415
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
so this is like a little computer gates

1416
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,020
because a cascade across the brain

1417
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,020
and a feedback

1418
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,020
the integrated network is actually talking

1419
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,020
to lots of other bits of the brain

1420
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,020
feeding back to the original source of the stimulation

1421
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,020
this is a sleeping brain

1422
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
stimulated in exactly the same area

1423
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,020
or the same TMS

1424
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,020
in deep stage 4 sleep

1425
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,020
where you have no conscious experience

1426
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,020
everything is very localised

1427
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
there's no communication going on across the brain

1428
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
as if the tide has come up

1429
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
and all of the network has gone down

1430
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,020
so there's now a belief that

1431
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,020
that we can somehow measure the quality

1432
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,020
of a network

1433
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,020
and there's a guy Giulio Tononi

1434
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,020
who's come up with the way a network

1435
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,020
actually feeds back and forth

1436
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,020
between each other the nature

1437
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
of those logic gates may have something

1438
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
to do with giving

1439
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,020
a network a feeling of what it's like

1440
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
to be itself

1441
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,020
and so Giulio Tononi has come up

1442
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,020
with this extraordinary equation

1443
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,020
a coefficient of consciousness

1444
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,020
now I've got to love this

1445
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,020
what makes me me is now an equation

1446
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,020
and the varying quality

1447
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,020
of this equation as we go through the day

1448
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
and the night or we go into a coma

1449
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,020
that this can measure

1450
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
something about your conscious experience

1451
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,020
to the extent interestingly that you can create

1452
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
a zombie

1453
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
a zombie is something that has no conscious experience

1454
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
but behaves exactly as a human would do

1455
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
so here are two networks

1456
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
they have eight neurons

1457
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
they're wired up in different ways

1458
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,020
but without put behaviour

1459
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,020
of both of these networks

1460
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,020
it's exactly the same so if you interacted with it

1461
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,020
you would not have any difference between the two

1462
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,020
yet one of them has a lot of feedback

1463
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,020
in it and has a high level of consciousness

1464
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,020
with this coefficient but the one on the right

1465
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,020
has no feedback

1466
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,020
and it has a zero consciousness

1467
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,020
according to this equation and so this will be

1468
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,020
an example of a zombie network

1469
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,020
now of course

1470
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,020
I'm going to skip Wittgenstein

1471
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,020
sorry

1472
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,020
actually I will tell you about Christof

1473
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,020
Christof is one of the people who got very interested

1474
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,020
in this equation

1475
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,020
and I talked to him he's my

1476
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,020
I skyped him so I was never quite sure

1477
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,020
whether actually my conversation with an avatar

1478
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,020
or something whether he was really there

1479
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,020
but he got very frustrated with me trying to

1480
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,020
push him on whether we could ever answer

1481
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,020
this problem of consciousness and eventually he said

1482
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,020
what sort of research project is it Marcus

1483
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,020
where you throw up your hands and say forget about it

1484
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,020
I can't understand it ever it's hopeless

1485
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,020
that's defeatism and I think we have a very

1486
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
schizophrenic relationship with this idea

1487
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,020
of the unknown

1488
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
and one sense

1489
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,020
the unknown is what drives us as scientists

1490
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,020
the known things are great

1491
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
but what we spend our life trying to understand

1492
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,020
are the things that we don't know

1493
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,020
so in one way the things we don't know

1494
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
are our lifeblood

1495
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
but the things that will remain forever

1496
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
unknown

1497
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,020
those are the kind of nemesis of the scientists

1498
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
so it is a belief I think most of us

1499
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
kind of feel like no you have that arrogance

1500
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,020
that we are a species that could know everything

1501
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,020
and I think that's really what drives me

1502
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,020
when I throw the dice

1503
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,020
why do I keep on looking

1504
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,020
it's my desire that I want to know how this is going to end

1505
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,020
a one

1506
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,020
thank you
