0	13900	The
13900	18720	world to come will be different from our expectations.
18720	25460	The arc of human history informs the trajectory of our future.
25460	33740	We need to know who we are and how we got here, the ecology, biology, and physics.
33740	40300	To know which paths remain open to us and which lead to dead ends.
40300	46220	Four and a half billion years ago, stardust coalesced to form a planet.
46220	51220	A billion years later, simple life emerged.
51220	59460	By 500 million years ago, a profusion of life had exploded on our blue-green planet.
59460	65140	Fast forward to 66 million years ago, and dinosaurs were taken out by our planet's
65140	70980	most recent mass extinction.
70980	76980	And small shrew-like survivors continued an evolutionary line that would eventually
76980	80540	become us.
80540	88860	Of all our hominid ancestors, one species would ultimately remain homo sapiens, a creature
88860	100300	variously curious, creative, kind, cruel, cooperative, competitive, combative, and clever.
100300	106540	When Earth's climate warmed and stabilized around 10,000 years ago, homo sapiens tribes
106540	115540	who pivoted en masse to agriculture and pastoralism out-reproduced their hunter-gatherer cousins.
115540	122660	Unbeknownst to them and to most of us, this was a planet-changing event.
122660	128060	Sustained by new agricultural surplus, these early humans slowly spread out around the
128060	133900	globe, expanding trade and technology.
133900	139460	For thousands of years, the average annual growth in the size of the human economy would
139460	144580	be unnoticeable from one generation to the next.
144580	151380	By the 16th century, however, more complex social organization and advanced navigational
151380	157620	technology kick-started a unique period in human history.
157700	164300	Yet even with these advances, human cultures remained powered by biomass in the muscles
164300	169700	of humans and our draft animals, limiting growth.
169700	176940	Until in the early 19th century, 10,000 years after the agricultural revolution, humans
176940	183420	discovered how to extract fossil energy and materials from under-Earth's surface to
183420	186740	boost their economies.
186740	194460	This new discovery of geologically stored sunlight in the form of coal, oil and gas
194460	198180	changed everything.
198180	203460	For the first time, human and animal labor played second fiddle to the power of these
203460	207180	new energy sources.
207180	213180	When combined with a machine, a gallon of gasoline could output the same work in a few
213180	218500	minutes as a person laboring for an entire month.
218500	227060	We increasingly replaced manual human tasks with machines at a tiny fraction of the cost.
227060	228740	The result?
228740	234540	Higher profits, higher wages and cheaper goods.
234540	241300	Sudden access to this bank account of stored carbon energy turbocharged our populations,
241300	248380	access to good services and technology, and quadrupled our economic growth rate.
248380	252820	Yet humanity's great acceleration was still ahead.
252820	258460	In the latter half of the 20th century, with this new power source and an upgrade from
258460	265300	coal to higher quality liquid oil, the human economy's average growth rate doubled yet
265300	266660	again.
266660	274020	To now over 30 times what it had averaged during the last few thousand years.
274020	280980	Compared to a global labor force of around 5 billion real humans, the machines and work
280980	289020	powered by access to buried carbon energy added the equivalent power of 500 billion
289020	292100	human workers.
292100	298100	Access to these fossil energies and materials brought billions more humans into existence
298100	306740	and brought billions more out of poverty and led to the creation of new myths, institutions
306740	310220	and expectations.
310220	317020	Our ancestors' lives were tightly linked to the natural flows of the earth, the sun,
317020	320020	the rain and the soil.
320020	326860	But during this moonshot of growth and consumption, our fundamental tether to nature was first
326860	331420	neglected and then forgotten.
331420	336620	The main inputs to our economies were now mostly free.
336620	343540	We nearly had to pay for the cost of their extraction, not the cost of their creation,
343540	347420	their true worth, nor their pollution.
347420	353940	To our ancestors, the benefits from carbon energy would have appeared indistinguishable
353940	356780	from magic.
356780	364300	And instead of appreciating this giant one-time windfall, we developed stories that our new
364300	371060	found wealth and progress had emerged purely from human ingenuity.
371060	378740	We had become energy blind.
378740	383980	Energy is and always will be the currency of life.
383980	386700	Animals were the first investors.
386700	392980	Obtaining a larger energy surplus gives an animal a competitive advantage for survival
392980	395420	and reproduction.
395420	402300	This role of surplus energy is a core driver of the natural world and dictates what can
402300	404900	and can't happen.
404900	411260	We rarely think about it or talk about it, but we're all alive during the carbon pulse,
411260	416900	the few hundred years where humans are drawing down earth's energy battery millions of times
416900	422300	faster than it was trickle-charged by daily photosynthesis.
422300	429140	Chemical hydrocarbons at a vast scale have enormously increased the surplus energy available
429140	433340	to human economies.
433340	436980	Pulses, by definition, don't last forever.
436980	441900	High-quality ores and energy deposits are now mostly things of the past.
441900	448140	Plenty remains, but it's of lower quality and both more costly and ecologically destructive
448140	450300	to extract.
450300	455740	In nature, there are countless examples where energy exists, but the effort to obtain it
455740	461300	is so large that the meal is effectively off the menu.
461300	468300	In our lifetimes, society will have to redirect increasing amounts of our energy surplus towards
468300	474660	obtaining the surplus itself, leaving less affordable energy to support many of our current
474660	477900	economic activities.
477900	484660	One day, the energy it will cost to extract energy will be so large it won't make sense
484660	489060	to do so, even though resources remain.
489060	495540	Energy depletion will act as a growing tax on human societies.
495540	502980	In this unprecedented era of large surplus, we have excelled at combining energy and materials
502980	507860	into technology and inventions that improve the human experience.
507860	513660	New technology can allow us to use resources more efficiently or it can transform natural
513660	515740	flows into energy.
515740	522860	But mostly, technology just creates new ways for humans to consume and builds higher future
522860	526460	requirements for energy and materials.
526460	530380	Things that are more complex require more energy.
530380	536500	When we add nodes to a supply chain, each connection requires energy to maintain.
536500	543020	The complexity of our globally interconnected system currently requires the equivalent of
543020	552940	170 billion light bulbs constantly turned on, burning brightly, powered by the carbon pulse.
552940	559620	Even rebuildable technology that harnesses the sun and the wind grows our total consumption
559620	565340	and has not yet reduced the use of carbon energy globally.
565340	571260	Most people believe that money is real wealth, yet everything we spend money on requires
571260	578420	energy to mine, create, deliver, run, maintain, and dispose of.
578420	585220	In this way, money is ultimately a direct claim on energy and resources.
585220	591700	More economic stories assert that with more money, we can create more of anything.
591700	595960	The truth is, we cannot create energy.
595960	602220	We both extract it and burn it faster by using technology and printing money.
602220	608940	Natural capital, particularly energy, is the true foundation of our monetary systems.
608940	617060	As we create more money, we don't create more resources, we merely access them faster.
617060	623620	The highest sustained growth rate of human economies ever before and likely ever again
623620	629460	peaked 50 years ago when oil production growth was at its highest.
629460	635180	But rather than living within our means, we found creative ways to extend growth for a
635180	637420	while longer.
637420	643140	We created complex supply chains, outsourcing the heavy lifting to countries with cheaper
643140	644460	labor.
644460	650420	We turned to debt in a large way to maintain high levels of consumption, a behavior that
650420	656380	accelerated in 2008 and has gone into overdrive since 2020.
656380	662300	Debt allows us to spend resources from the future and call it economic growth.
662300	667780	This phenomenon has become so pervasive in the last 50 years that we think it's normal
667780	671860	to consume today and pay tomorrow.
671860	677460	The developed world is now using debt to enable the extraction of things we couldn't otherwise
677460	679460	afford to extract.
679460	684100	To produce things we otherwise couldn't afford to consume.
684100	690100	This strategy has an expiration date because all this new money will one day be spent on
690100	694940	real things requiring energy.
694940	702660	Enabled by an extraordinary but temporary energy surplus, the human economy is now over
702660	708340	1,000 times bigger than it was just five centuries ago.
708340	715140	Most of the benefits of this one-time geological surplus now flow to a fraction of people,
715140	720700	not to the rest of living humans, nor future generations.
720700	726260	As we extract minerals and burn fossil carbon to support modern living standards, their
726260	732260	waste streams are in turn diminishing the life support systems of other species and
732260	734940	future beings.
734940	742900	The impact of our global energy metabolism on nature has been tragic and is now accelerating,
742900	749060	resulting in, among other things, animal bird and fish populations dropping by 50% since
749060	756300	the 1970s, plastic now weighing more than all animals on land and in the sea, and a
756300	764220	child born today being expected to outlive Earth's coral reefs.
764220	772580	As a culture, we have recently, but almost entirely, financialized the human experience.
772580	778940	Not only have we parsed the rich fabric of human life into a single monetary marker,
778940	783500	but in doing so, we've used the wrong prices.
783500	789780	The price of money is wrong, because we grow it with a keystroke with no tether to finite
789780	792380	natural capital.
792380	799020	The price of energy is wrong, because we don't treat it as the extraordinary, irreplaceable
799020	804860	resource it is, non-renewable on any human timescale.
804860	811140	And in setting prices on everything, we've lost sight of the large cost their use has
811140	814220	on Earth's ecosystems.
814220	821500	This biophysical story is all connected in an emergent and unexpected way.
821500	828700	As the carbon pulse boosted our economies, our institutions and governments self-organized
828700	832140	around expectations of growth.
832140	840140	Now, 8 billion members of a social species collectively seek profits, which are linked
840140	845620	to energy, which is linked to fossil hydrocarbons and minerals.
845620	852940	Growth, as measured by increases in GDP, is now required for stability.
852940	859220	We have arrived at a place where we as a culture have outsourced our decisions and
859220	862580	planning to the financial system.
862580	871620	The market's compulsion to grow now outcompetes any alternative paths of wisdom or constraint.
871620	876340	The system is no longer in anyone's control.
876340	885300	The human species, at least to this point, has become a mindless, insatiable, energy-hungry
885300	891300	superorganism.
891300	899820	The superorganism is an emergent phenomenon of the animals that comprise it, us.
899820	904500	Human beings are related to all other creatures on Earth.
904500	911220	We are the product of an unbroken chain connecting to the first life, which means that hidden
911220	917260	beneath our stated motivations of what we do every day in industrial society, we are
917260	923740	driven to pursue the same neurochemical brain rewards our ancestors pursued.
923740	930900	This has huge implications for our behaviors, our economies and our futures.
930900	935500	Reaching for our phone to see if someone liked our Facebook post or to see if Bitcoin
935500	939380	is up or down, aren't really our goals.
939380	946220	We are in reality just seeking the same brain rewards that led to success for our hunter-gatherer
946220	948220	ancestors.
948220	956180	Dopamine is a molecule that in animals and in humans leads to motivation and action.
956180	963780	In a materially rich modern world, the habituation to the action of consumption leads to the
963780	971780	wanting of things, culture-wide, being stronger than the reward we get from having them.
971780	977540	This is a fundamental problem for an economic system that's turning billions of barrels
977540	983940	of oil into microliters of dopamine.
983940	991500	As a carryover from ancestral tribal life, we are highly tuned to social signals, comparing
991500	997660	ourselves to others seeking approval, acceptance and jockeying for status.
997660	1004740	With material and now digital wealth as today's primary status signal, consumerism is now
1004740	1012260	largely based on having as much or more than those around us, rather than focusing on what
1012340	1017580	we may actually need.
1017580	1020580	Modern humans are still tribal beings.
1020580	1026420	We staunchly support those in our in-groups and easily ostracize out-groups, from trivial
1026420	1033260	divisions like sports teams to political affiliation, race or nationality.
1033260	1040020	Our evolution has primed us to blame other humans for situations we don't like or understand.
1042900	1052020	We have rich, creative and colorful imaginations that reside in the virtual worlds of our minds.
1052020	1060100	The human brain can imagine and verbalize limitless combinations of physical impossibilities,
1060100	1066900	sustainable outposts on Mars, self-perpetuating energy machines, and an economy based on
1066900	1073780	physical consumption growing continually for centuries.
1073780	1080940	In ancestral times, these virtual worlds overlapped with the physical worlds we inhabited, making
1080940	1084780	us more content and effective as a tribal unit.
1084780	1092140	But in a culture of vast material wealth, information overload and social media, it's
1092140	1098580	increasingly difficult for us to separate fantasy from reality.
1098580	1105500	When these individual virtual worlds connect with the virtual worlds of others, the result
1105500	1112580	is widespread shared beliefs that money is real, that our current wealth is due mostly
1112580	1121220	to our cleverness, and that technology will lead to limitless growth.
1121220	1127180	When we look to others to try and understand our complex modern world, as social beings
1127180	1134780	who said it, becomes more important than logic or the quality of the evidence, celebrity
1134780	1141460	and group affiliation now matter more than truth.
1141460	1147220	Our stone age brains are no match for the social media algorithms that now constantly
1147220	1150060	hijack our attention.
1150060	1156620	Modern media outlets prey on our evolutionary inclinations for novelty and in-group defense,
1156620	1164780	via capturing our attention and turning clicks and shares into consumption.
1164780	1171020	Computer algorithms optimized for profit are splintering our society by reducing attention
1171020	1179220	spans, accelerating addiction, polarization, apathy, and mistrust in science.
1179220	1187140	A metaphorical technology worm driven by exponentially improving artificial intelligence
1187140	1193500	is silently eating our minds.
1193500	1196780	Humans are creatures with finite lifespans.
1196780	1200380	The future is not a priority to us emotionally.
1200380	1207460	Instead, we are focused on the very short term, this weekend's plans, this quarter's
1207460	1208460	earnings.
1208460	1214740	In this term's election, the next set of compelling images were urged to scroll to.
1214740	1222780	We often promise to make big changes starting tomorrow, until tomorrow becomes today, and
1222780	1229420	the cycle repeats delaying any actual change.
1229420	1236900	Like other biological organisms, humans seek gains and are averse to losses.
1236900	1243340	We look for undervalued stocks to invest in, sales on new shoes, or two-for-one cocktails
1243340	1244980	at happy hour.
1244980	1251260	Unlike squirrels or cheetahs, we are an extremely social species.
1251260	1259700	We coordinate as families, small businesses, corporations, and nation states to maximize
1259700	1267300	our virtual surplus, dollars, which we then spend on real things.
1267300	1276020	Our core economic and environmental challenges stem from a mismatch of hunter-gatherer minds
1276020	1280740	inhabiting a competitive consumer growth culture.
1280740	1288980	Together, these human universals have led to incentives and behaviors which have created
1288980	1296620	a metabolic superorganism whose objective is disconnected from the well-being of its
1296620	1301180	parts, us.
1301180	1309260	It is tempting to look at how we live today and conclude that this is how humans are.
1309260	1315700	But modern society is only a single brief example out of thousands of successful arrangements
1315700	1317860	in human history.
1317860	1323100	Humans alive today don't choose to be hierarchical or greedy.
1323100	1331380	Many of our choices are constrained by the economic system we were born into.
1331380	1337700	Our current high consumption, high inequality, high technological distraction, and low levels
1337700	1346180	of daily human connection are a direct product of the carbon pulse.
1346180	1352420	Though human brains don't change quickly under the right circumstances, our behaviors
1352420	1356300	and cultural norms can move at lightning speed.
1356300	1362420	Our species is incredibly adaptive when we're challenged.
1362420	1369700	The way we've been living is an anomaly, but we take it for granted because as individuals,
1369700	1373540	it's all we've ever known.
1373540	1380900	Going forward, a lifestyle adapted to lower energy use will reconnect our virtual and
1380900	1382780	physical worlds.
1382780	1390340	By necessity, our lives will become less global, more interpersonally engaged, and more tethered
1390340	1395940	to natural flows.
1395940	1401500	As a species, a global superorganism is not our destiny.
1401500	1405260	Who we are has brought us to this precipice.
1405260	1412660	Who we are capable of becoming as individuals and as a society will be the question of our
1412660	1417020	time.
1417020	1423340	We are alive at a time of wonder, peril, and possibility.
1423340	1429500	Ahead are a million unknown destinations, some dark and foreboding, and some welcoming
1429500	1431580	and beautiful.
1431580	1438180	Many of us sense that something is different, something is coming, but we lack a shared
1438180	1444780	understanding of the path that brought us here and of the terrain ahead.
1444780	1451660	Each future we expect depends upon which lens we use to see the road.
1451660	1458980	Modern society is polarized, stressed, and overwhelmed with information, good and bad.
1458980	1466260	As a result, common points of view are lenses, focused on the road just in front of us.
1466260	1472140	For the view to the future, we defer to culturally accepted guides who are confident they know
1472140	1475220	the way forward.
1475220	1480860	Through the lens of an economist, for example, we see a glorious road leading to growth that
1480860	1482700	never stops.
1482700	1489620	Any scarcity of energy or material inputs will be solved by price signals, creating incentives
1489620	1493140	which increase our productivity and growth.
1493140	1501900	The economic lens shows us that human ingenuity and the market will solve everything.
1501900	1509260	A financial lens translates stock markets at all time highs as a sign of society's health,
1509260	1512740	pretending a rich and virtuous future.
1512740	1519420	With enough financial capital, we'll be able to build roads to anywhere.
1519420	1526060	A technology lens promises a shiny road of comfort, novelty, and prosperity, enabled
1526060	1528260	by future inventions.
1528260	1534220	Innovation, artificial intelligence, and a vibrant metaverse will sidestep any energy
1534220	1536580	or resource constraints.
1536580	1542260	We envision future humans breaking free from the confines of Earth and enjoying high-tech
1542260	1547580	lifestyles where the biggest problem is runaway robots.
1547580	1552380	These lenses are all optimistic, but misguided.
1552380	1556220	All these lenses are energy blind.
1556220	1563220	The real paths ahead can only be seen by integrating energy awareness with biology,
1563220	1568060	sociology, physics, and everything science has discovered.
1568060	1571980	We need a systems lens to read the map.
1571980	1579100	A systems lens reveals the holistic story that explains humanity's path.
1579100	1585740	In pursuit of the same emotional experiences of our ancient ancestors, we transform materials
1585740	1591780	and energy into technologies that make our lives more comfortable and fun.
1591780	1597980	We keep score of our progress using money, which has become a psychological stand-in
1597980	1601460	for all the things our ancestors valued.
1601460	1608660	The massive scale of humanity's consumption is evidenced by the excess CO2 being absorbed
1608660	1612020	by Earth's oceans and atmosphere.
1612020	1620700	The emergent result is a metabolic superorganism, with oil as its hemoglobin transporting goods
1620700	1625300	through the arteries and veins of a global supply network.
1625300	1631660	Like a shark needing to swim to get oxygen flowing through its gills, our current economic
1631660	1638540	system has an imperative to grow in order to satisfy prior financial commitments.
1638540	1644260	We can't stop, nor can we slow down, or the system will crash.
1644260	1650700	A systems lens reveals that the road ahead is closed to our current cultural expectations,
1650700	1654300	yet we continue to bear down on the accelerator.
1654300	1662460	Wearing systems lenses removes the blind spots created by any single issue lens.
1662460	1667660	Global economic growth will never meaningfully decouple from energy consumption.
1667660	1675620	It cannot, because the world's GDP, by definition, has always been a proxy for how much energy
1675620	1677180	we burn.
1677180	1683420	If we were to grow the global economy at 3% a year, as most governments and institutions
1683420	1691100	expect, we would use as much energy and materials in the next 30 years as we have in the past
1691100	1694540	10,000.
1694540	1700620	Stock markets are poor guideposts for prosperity when inflated by government and central bank
1700620	1702120	support.
1702120	1708860	All the cash, stocks, bonds, and pension funds in the world will need energy and materials
1708860	1713340	to be cashed out and turned into real wealth.
1713340	1719980	Creativity and innovation will be central to human futures, but modern technology requires
1719980	1724860	huge amounts of energy to build and to operate.
1724860	1733900	As long as GDP is our goal, efficiency gains from new technology will serve the superorganism.
1733900	1740260	Transitioning from fossil hydrocarbon to rebuildable energy won't change this dynamic.
1740260	1748620	Ultimately, in addition to using different energy, we'll need to use energy differently.
1748620	1753820	Bringing our future through a systems lens changes everything.
1753820	1760460	We have spent the last century harnessing enormous amounts of fossil energy to build
1760460	1765180	a world of complexity like nothing seen before.
1765180	1773020	In the coming century, humanity will experience a great simplification.
1773020	1780260	There will always be energy on earth as long as the sun burns, but the amount of surplus
1780260	1785420	energy available to human societies will soon be diminished.
1785420	1791040	As the extraction of geologically stored energy becomes more difficult, everything we're
1791040	1796580	used to in society will become more costly or less available.
1796580	1801220	We are not planning for this because it's never happened before.
1801220	1807180	The onset of the great simplification will be financial and economic turbulence followed
1807180	1808940	by contraction.
1808940	1814980	When we can no longer grow fast enough to maintain all the increased financial claims,
1814980	1821340	economies will recede to a scale that can again be supported by physical flows without
1821340	1823260	credit.
1823260	1828860	Complex global supply chains, the related high consumption lifestyles, and many of
1828860	1834660	the conveniences and freedoms we take for granted in this era of abundant energy surplus
1834660	1836860	will diminish.
1836860	1843060	The ensuing simplification will be among the most significant events ever experienced
1843060	1845620	by our species.
1845620	1852260	Those who look through a systems lens can serve as early visionaries of a simpler life with
1852260	1860620	new ways of relating to technology, to consumption, to each other, and to earth's ecosystems.
1860620	1865740	There are many pathways wending through a great simplification.
1865740	1871060	Some are wise, humane, and even preferable to what we have now.
1871060	1878940	Some are so dark as to be nearly unthinkable, yet it is precisely thinking about these pathways
1878940	1886140	and actively choosing among them, which offers the only realistic hope for a long and meaningful
1886140	1888420	human future.
1888420	1895060	Nature has gifted us with a productive and beautiful home, the ability to understand
1895060	1902020	how we got here, and the creativity to imagine which paths are possible.
1902020	1905500	The future need not be dystopian.
1905540	1911420	But cleverness alone will no longer suffice for the next leg of our journey.
1911420	1920380	We will need imagination, foresight, empathy, and above all, wisdom to navigate the path
1920380	1923540	to the future that is arriving.
1923540	1925300	The great simplification.
