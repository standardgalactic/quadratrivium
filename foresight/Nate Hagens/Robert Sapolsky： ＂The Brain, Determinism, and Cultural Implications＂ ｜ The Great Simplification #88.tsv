0	7600	We don't change. We don't choose to change, but we sure are changed. And we have to make use
7600	12480	of our knowledge about how that change comes about, because if we don't think the change happens,
12480	20960	we're totally screwed. It is an honor to introduce my next guest, Professor Robert Sapulski,
21600	27600	who at Stanford University is a professor of biology, neurology, and neurosurgery,
27680	34480	as well as a research associate at the Institute of Primary Research at the National Museum of Kenya.
35120	39920	Over the past 30 years, Professor Sapulski has divided his time between the lab,
40480	46080	where he studies how stress hormones can damage the brain, as well as in East Africa,
46080	50960	where he studies the impact of chronic stress on the health of baboons.
51600	60560	Robert is the author of numerous books, of which I have all of them, including his new book
60560	69520	out in October called Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will. This was a wide-ranging,
69520	77440	intense, and challenging conversation, one of my favorite ever. Robert has had a big influence
77440	82720	on my thinking these last 20 years, and it was a real treat to talk to him in person,
82720	88400	even though when I scheduled the interview, I didn't know his next book was on free will.
90160	97920	I'm still making my mind up on what I think on this topic, but this guy has been working on
97920	105520	this for 40 years, and this is an amazing conversation with insight into the constraints
105520	121440	that biology poses for the great simplification. Please welcome Professor Robert Sapulski.
125680	128480	Professor Sapulski, welcome to the program.
129200	131280	Well, thanks for having me here.
132800	138960	I know you well enough to call you Robert, but I've learned so much from you over the last
138960	142560	couple decades that I feel Professor Sapulski is more appropriate.
143120	152240	Well, all that does is make me feel elderly and having a large prostate, so Robert's just fine.
152240	160800	Okay, Robert, it is. You have a new book coming out called Determined, A Science of Life Without
160800	169120	Free Will, and we're going to get to that, but it is very hard for me as someone who has all of
169120	176080	your books, has watched almost all of your online biology lectures to pass over your decades of
176080	181920	scholarship on the human brain and behavior that's relevant to the subject of this podcast,
181920	188480	which is the great simplification. I know you watched my movie earlier, so let's start with
188480	196000	this, though. How and when did you first realize that you wanted to be a biologist and study animals
196000	204080	and behavior? I was about eight years old when I decided I wanted to be a primatologist,
204800	212480	go study primates in the wild. I've run across a lot of field work people over the years,
213200	219040	not surprisingly, and about two-thirds of them grew up someplace exotic.
220160	228160	Their parents were field researchers or missionaries or some governmental NGO thing in some exotic
228160	236080	place, and then the remaining third would be people who grew up in some god-awful urban,
238240	244400	I'm trying not to use hellhole, but in some ways, yes, and then at some point they stumbled into
244400	250240	the Natural History Museum and imprinted on something, and that was my version of it,
250240	256720	the American Museum of Natural History, and in retrospect, I probably could just as easily have
257280	264880	imprinted on geckos or horseshoe crabs if I had taken a left or instead of a right in the hallway,
264880	272080	but I wound up in the primate exhibit and that's it. I decided I wanted to go live with
272960	282960	primates, non-human ones, forever after. You wrote a primate's memoir and why zebras don't
282960	288960	get ulcers, but recently for a long time you've been at Stanford. When's the last time you've
288960	296560	been to Africa and do you miss that type of work? Let's see, the rhythm I maintained was
296560	302640	nine months a year in a laboratory being a neurobiologist with a lab coat, and during the
302640	309440	summer's three months a year back out in a tent with baboons in the Serengeti, I managed to keep
309440	319520	that going for 33 summers until 13, 12 years ago when things just fell apart there on a whole
319520	327920	bunch of fronts and it was time to pack it in and decide 33 was pretty damn lucky. Yeah, I miss it.
328640	336160	Yeah, I've been to Africa four times, including Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Botswana, Zambia, and I
336720	341840	was enthralled every single time and I wish I could have in a different lifetime
343040	353600	done something like you did. So we are getting into the brain and behavior. Humanity and the
353600	361440	biosphere are facing multiple interconnected challenges. In my own writing and speaking,
361440	367680	I point out and have for 20 years that we don't so much have an environmental problem
367680	375040	or an economic problem, but rather that most of our challenges emanate from a mismatch of the human
375040	383440	brain, modern human brain from our ancestral environment. What do you think about that broadly?
384400	392480	I love your emphasis on that and your work. I mean, it's a obligatory cliche in my field to
392480	399440	like once every 10 minutes start a sentence by saying, well, realizing that for 99% of human
399440	405680	history was spent in small hunter-gatherer bands, it's a total cliche because it's true and it's
405840	414640	incredibly important. Not only are microwaves like a relatively recent invention that don't
414640	423120	particularly fit with our evolutionary past, but agriculture isn't either. Living in sedentary,
423120	430400	settled communities isn't either. All of that is in a blink of an eye. The notion that culture
430400	440160	evolves faster than brains do is at the core exactly of a huge amount of what ails humans.
440960	446720	So historically, culturally, it's been common to think of our emotions, our psyche,
447360	454800	and human personalities as completely separate from the body and physiology. Back 30, 40 years ago,
454800	461520	there was the standard social science model, but a lot of emerging work in the past decades,
461520	468240	including yours, has suggested that that's not true and that these two things are in fact deeply
468240	474800	intertwined. Where did this separation come about in the first place?
476160	481920	Well, you know, everybody has to pull out Descartes at this point who was going on about how
481920	488400	animals are machines and humans have souls and that sort of set up the basic dichotomy
488400	496240	that people have run with ever since between humans and other species or between the brain and the
496240	503040	body or between the brain and the mind. And what everybody's very fond of saying now is Descartes
503040	509520	was totally wrong, which is animals have emotions and empathy and all of that also.
509520	516800	My take is Descartes was totally wrong because, yeah, animals are biological machines and so
516800	524000	are we. We're just really much more complicated versions, but we're built out of the same stuff.
524800	533600	And where the mismatches become most interesting is when we're working with the exact same blueprint
534400	539200	and the brain and the hormones, all of that of any other species out that were just like them,
539200	546160	that were just like them. And then we go use it in a way that like no orangutan could ever dream of.
548080	550000	And there you have the mismatch.
551520	557520	It's so bizarre having a conversation with you. I just realized something as you were speaking
557600	564400	that in reading your latest book determined when I'm reading, your voice is in my head
564400	570000	reading the words like your voice and your diction. And I didn't realize it till just now,
570000	574960	but it's interesting because I've listened to so many of your lectures. I wonder if that's true
574960	584080	for a lot of people. So building on your point in our culture, in our polarized social media
584080	591600	addicted soundbite culture on the conservative side, a lot of humans don't actually believe in
591600	598800	evolution. And on the more liberal side, anything that is explained as having biological origins
598800	605680	or biological explanations can now get you canceled. What do you think about that? And
605680	612240	will it ever be possible for a plurality or a majority of society to have a broad
612240	615600	understanding of the biological origins of human behaviors?
616400	623920	Well, just to be pessimistic, I think there's always going to be a divide. And it's often going
623920	633760	to be able to be framed in terms of a conservative versus a progressive orientation or a made excited
633760	640240	by novelty versus made anxious by novelty sort of dichotomy. Amid that though, there's like
640240	650400	interesting stuff like a standard progressive stance is to have apoplexy when people start
650400	658000	talking about biological roots, genetic roots, genetic inevitability of something like intelligence.
658640	666640	And obviously, all sorts of right wing ideologues have run with the pseudoscience of like genetic
666640	672800	determinism of IQ, things like that. So that's exactly the dichotomy you've set up there. On the
672800	683840	other hand, when it comes to sexual orientation, the left has been pioneering in the notion that
683840	691360	like being gay is not a choice, let alone a choice that soils your extensive soul or whatever.
691360	696320	It's a biological trait on a continuum. While in this case, it's the right that says there's no
696320	704000	biology there at all. So it's a little bit a function of what the topic is. But all of that is
704000	711920	within, yes, indeed, this very narrow edge that one has to walk on these days between
712720	727920	being canceled and going in a left position that places a humane ideology way above scientific
727920	733040	facts now and then, and then all the folks who want to burn science textbooks.
733680	737920	So do you find it teaching at one of the premier universities in the world
738160	746080	more difficult today than it was 10 or 15 years ago to discuss the biological origins of many
746080	756640	human behaviors? Yes, maybe a little bit. Every other year, I teach this big class. It's been
756640	762960	getting like five, 600 students per round in sort of the last decade or so about the biological
763040	769520	roots of human behavior, human social behavior. And I always say for the next to last lecture,
769520	778240	one of the biological roots of religiosity. And like I realized after a while that I didn't record
778240	786080	it because it came back and bit me in the rear in some ways. And inevitably, you know, my theme
786080	793760	and it was, you know, religious belief or the lack of capacity for religious belief or biological
793760	798800	phenomena, just like anything else. And they're interesting to analyze and they've got all sorts
798800	804480	of unexpected twists and it's complicated as hell or all that. But we're biological organisms.
805120	814240	And inevitably, there's always some religious students who are offended. Very nicely inevitably,
814240	822240	there's always some religious students who instead have an epiphany. And usually earlier in the
822240	829200	quarter come to me and say, oh, my God, I'm like kind of having a crisis here. And I say, me too,
829200	835360	that's what that's what I had as well. At least they're not hostile. No one's condemning me to
836560	843840	Hades. What I've noticed is the pattern instead is a few weeks later when they graduate, they
843840	848800	leave me a little gift, which is always like a little pocket Bible saying, please, please,
848800	854400	please read this. I'm really concerned for you. So if that's my version of getting in trouble,
854400	860480	that's okay by me. It's education at this level is kind of like selling insurance. You have to
860480	868000	make 100 calls to get 10 meetings to have one sale and changing minds about the state of the
868000	874960	world is difficult. On that note, I also taught for nine years a class called Reality 101. I'm
874960	883760	just curious, you've been teaching what 40 years now almost, do you have people from your classes
883760	890480	20, 30 years ago that reach out to you and say this was a foundational epiphany for me and it
890480	898240	changed my life and my worldview? I imagine you do. You know, I'd love to hear that every day,
898240	904560	but more than more often than I've had any reasonable expectation of that sort. But
905760	910960	yeah, and it's it's very pleasurable. It's nice. It's nice to see my ex students who are like
910960	916960	chairs of psychiatry or this or that at med school. It's like even more nice to see
917920	924080	someone who's using a biological model now in the social work they've been doing for the last 25
924080	932080	years. I've got two ex students who are senators now and one of them I take complete credit for
932080	939520	and the other I run from in a panic. So that counts as a net zero there and I won't use names, but
940320	946960	you know, education is kind of a cool thing. My father was a professor architectural history
947600	953920	in New York City and at his death sort of we went through the number crunching to figure out
953920	959680	14% of New York City's licensed architects had been in a class of his at some point
960320	965440	and that felt really damn good to see. So that's cultural evolution?
965680	975920	Yeah. And in a very exciting way, you know, students have learned all sorts of stuff about
975920	981040	stress hormones from me. I've learned all sorts of interesting vocalizations from baboons.
982640	990000	Yeah, culture rolls along and it involves acquiring new behavioral characteristics.
990960	997520	So let's get into this. This is a difficult interview for me to have because if we weren't
997520	1002480	time or energy constrained, it would probably go on for five or six hours because there's
1002480	1008320	so much to cover in your work that's relevant to the coming decades of humanity. So let's do
1008320	1016720	just a real quick flash round on three hormones that seem prominent in your research on the brain
1016720	1022240	and behavior. Dopamine, serotonin, sorry, well, you could include serotonin, dopamine,
1022240	1028400	testosterone and oxytocin. So could you briefly maybe tell a little story about what are the
1028400	1034800	common misconceptions of these neurotransmitter slash hormones and what roles do they actually
1036080	1037840	play in shaping our behavior?
1038560	1044000	Great. And you're absolutely right to say the slash because it used to be testosterone
1044000	1049440	only belong to the endocrinologists, but then it's due in something neurotransmitter is in the
1049440	1054800	brain and dopamine used to only belong to the neurocanus. So yeah, it's on a continuum, of course.
1055600	1060000	Testosterone, everybody knows exactly what testosterone is about, which is the hormone
1060000	1065920	that makes you aggressive. It explains why males the world over in species after species are such
1065920	1072240	pains in the asses because testosterone causes aggression. Testosterone does not cause aggression.
1072240	1079120	What testosterone does mostly is it amplifies, it increases the volume
1079120	1083680	on the aggression that's already there, the aggression that's been socially learned.
1084560	1092400	And that's a very different story. A perfect example of it, you take five male monkeys,
1092400	1098160	they've formed a dominance hierarchy, number one, trashes two through five, two trashes three
1098160	1103280	through five, all of that. So you take number three in the hierarchy and shoot them up with
1103280	1109440	testosterone, shoot them up with like so much of it, like he's growing out or something.
1109440	1115520	And does he get in more fights? Absolutely. Whoa, testosterone causes aggression.
1115520	1120560	But what you might speculate at that point is as a result of that testosterone,
1120560	1127200	number three is suddenly like confronting numbers two and one and maybe toppling the
1127200	1133280	nah, you never see that. He still is just as brown nosing with them as he used to be.
1133280	1137600	All that happens is he's become a total nightmare to numbers four and five.
1138640	1144080	All the testosterone has done is amplify the social learning that was there already.
1144080	1149680	One and two, you have to pretend you like they're like haircuts. Four and five, you can do anything
1149680	1155760	you want to. So let's do it 10 times as much as normal. Testosterone doesn't cause aggression.
1155760	1162880	Testosterone amplifies what's already been socially learned. And testosterone even more so
1164080	1171360	is about defending challenges to your status. But then humans have come up all sorts of
1171360	1177600	circumstances where defending your status does not involve aggression. Just look at a bunch of
1177600	1185120	rich half-drunk people at a charity auction and they're competing for status over who could
1185120	1190400	give away the most money conspicuously. That one doesn't make a whole lot of sense when
1190400	1197680	testosterone is all about aggression. And in studies where people get status by being more
1197680	1204400	generous, you give people testosterone and they become more generous. It's not about making you
1204400	1210480	aggressive. It's a making about amplifying whatever you've learned is good for holding on to status
1210480	1217520	in your little sliver of the universe. That's fascinating. I didn't know that. And how we get
1217520	1223520	status in our culture is probably going to have to change away from conspicuous consumption,
1223520	1230400	et cetera. So testosterone will play a role. Exactly. And I mean, what that tells us at the
1230400	1235600	end of the day with like human aggression, testosterone isn't the problem. The problem
1235600	1243920	is that we hand out so damn much social status for aggression. That's the thing that needs to be
1243920	1250640	solved. And as you know, that's immediately intertwined with who's got how many toys and how
1250640	1258080	conspicuously can you display it, et cetera, et cetera. We may not be economically rational,
1258080	1264720	but we are economically competitive and testosterone just feeds into that in ways no other
1264800	1275600	ape can make sense of. And what about dopamine? Dopamine, totally great, exciting neurotransmitter.
1276240	1281920	Another one where everybody knows what dopamine is about, which is dopamine is about reward.
1281920	1289840	It's about pleasure. Cocaine works on the dopamine system, various euphorians. You like give somebody
1289840	1295360	cocaine and they're releasing a thousandfold more dopamine than like some key parts of the
1295360	1301920	brain ever do. And whoa, it's amazing. Dopamine is about reward. It's about pleasure. And
1301920	1308800	superficially, it seems that way. You take a person or a monkey or a rat and you give them a
1308800	1314400	reward from completely out of nowhere and they have a rush of dopamine. Yeah, that's great.
1315200	1320720	Then you look more closely. And what you do is you take a paradigm and it works this way in a
1320720	1326880	human or a monkey or a rat. You like train the individual that, okay, we put you in a room and
1326880	1333280	as soon as the little light comes on, it means every time you press this lever 10 times, you're
1333280	1342000	going to get a little reward. Signal work reward, signal work reward. So the organism learns that
1342560	1349520	the college freshman in psych 101 or the lab or whatever, and they learn this. So you put them
1349520	1355120	in the situation, the light comes on, they do the work and they get the reward. When did dopamine
1355120	1362960	rise? And if dopamine is just about reward, it rises after you get the reward. That's not what
1362960	1370960	you see. It rises when the little light comes on. What's that about? That's you sitting there saying,
1370960	1376400	yeah, I'm all over this. I know about this lever pressing stuff. This is going to be great. I'm
1376400	1382960	like completely master of the universe at this lever pressing. Dopamine isn't about reward as
1382960	1389680	much as it's about the anticipation of reward. And we sure know endless ways in life in which the
1389680	1395760	anticipation turned out to be better than the actual thing. And most importantly, if you block
1395760	1401440	dopamine from being released at that time, you don't get the lever pressing. It's about the
1401440	1407840	anticipation and it's about the motivation and the goal directed behavior that's generated by that
1407840	1415120	anticipation. And our entire economic system is turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight
1415120	1422640	into micro leaders of dopamine in anticipating what is better than the actual result of consuming
1422640	1429040	all these non-renewable natural resources. So it really is at part of the core of our current
1429840	1434240	superorganism, energy, hungry dynamic of human society.
1434960	1439440	Absolutely. And a weird human specific feature of the dopamine system
1440000	1446480	explains, you know, if you want to be grandiose, 99% of what's going wrong with this, which is
1446480	1453040	like you're a baboon. What are your sources of pleasure in life? You get to hassle somebody
1453040	1458640	lower ranking than you. You get to have sex. You're hungry and you eat something good. That's
1458640	1465040	about it. Like if you're human, all of those things feel good, but also like solving
1465040	1474400	Fermat's last theorem feels good. And like reading about, you know, acts of random kindness on the
1474400	1480720	and seeing an arousing scene in a movie involving characters who aren't even real and listening
1480720	1488240	to a symphony and smelling a flower in early and spring to all of that. We've got a system
1488240	1496720	that has to incorporate responding to rewarding things that range from like remembering a line
1496720	1504320	of poetry to quadruple orgasms. And the only way you can get a dopamine system that could handle
1504320	1512800	that large of a range is it's got to reset quickly. It's got to habituate quickly. It's
1512800	1519520	got to be able to go from okay, we're now going from the good to bad poetry range. We're now going
1519520	1525680	to the good or bad outcome of a billion dollar lottery and my one ticket range. It's got to
1525680	1533040	reset frequently. And there's some totally cool research showing some weirdo wiring things about
1533040	1538720	the human dopamine system that's very unique that probably explains the rapid resetting.
1539440	1545280	So that's great, but it sets you off for exactly the problem you've spent all your time thinking
1545280	1553440	about, which is if the dopamine system quickly resets by definition, whatever was an amazing
1553440	1560240	reward that came out from nowhere yesterday is going to be what you feel like you're entitled to
1560240	1569280	today and is going to feel insufficient tomorrow. And that's your whole world of like what has gone
1569280	1577440	wrong. We inevitably habituate to unexpected good stuff. And before you know it, not only is it like
1577440	1584560	the norm, it's not enough anymore. We get hungry again. Can that can that be trained? I don't
1584560	1591840	know you very well. So I don't know your own social media and internet habits. But being a
1591840	1600560	professor of neuroscience and being a dopamine expert, have you created a firewall in your own
1600560	1609760	behaviors so that your dopamine can, you know, your superhighway can reset to normal things
1609760	1614240	like flowers in the spring or playing with your dog or going for a walk in the forest?
1614240	1624000	Or what do you do about that? Well, I try a little bit of a Luddite. So I think I'm protected from
1624640	1631840	an awful lot of that pumbling. And I think it's sufficiently large and upper generations away
1631840	1636960	from where the culture is at that like not only don't I know how to access that stuff, but it
1636960	1644400	probably isn't going to do dopamine things to me that it does for 18 year olds. But in retrospect,
1644400	1651680	in some ways, that's what spending three months a year alone in a tent in the Serengeti would do.
1652800	1658480	The nearest electric outlet was like 90 miles away. Mail would be dropped off once every two weeks.
1659440	1666320	We got water from a river. There was no electricity, all of that. And, you know,
1666320	1672720	you do that and, you know, baboons are interesting. But I think what kept me spending
1673360	1679600	now 50% of my life going there back and forth is like at the end of the day,
1680560	1687520	you are so damn tired from the physical work and from the bright sun and from the cool things that
1687520	1694320	you saw. And whatever rice and beans you're eating for dinner, you cannot believe how good it tastes.
1694320	1702960	And it's hot as hell midday, but there was a breeze and you're like euphoric. That's the resetting.
1703440	1710240	And of course, what I would find is, you know, back in this world, that would have wonderfully
1710240	1715840	protective residual effects for about six and a half days. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.
1716640	1723040	I'm trying to do this Silent Saturdays thing now, just because as the podcast gets more popular,
1723040	1728720	I have so many emails and social media and stuff and it's becoming becoming a little much. So I'm
1728720	1735840	trying to ratchet down my baseline a little bit and just do mundane things on Saturday
1735920	1739680	with limited success so far, because I don't have free will, but we're going to get to that.
1742000	1749360	So and oxytocin, what about oxytocin? Okay, oxytocin, it's the grooviest hormone on earth.
1749360	1759120	Oxytocin is about love and trust and social intelligence and all of that. Oxytocin is
1759120	1765200	this amazing hormone, best evidence is it's about 100 million years old. And what it first evolved
1765200	1770000	for was like the most basic thing that mammals were getting around to doing, which was making
1770000	1775760	mothers get attached to their kids and kids attached to their mothers, which is really essential
1775760	1781120	if you're going to do that mammal dependent on mom stuff. So that's been around for about 100
1781120	1788000	million years. Best evidence is about 30, 20 million years ago, it then got, you know,
1788000	1796560	refigured and started being used as well for pair bonding, you know, monogamy. And it's just a
1796560	1803200	tiny percentage of social mammals that are monogamous, but they make heavy use of oxytocin.
1803200	1809440	And whether we are one of those species is a really interesting topic in and of itself because
1810000	1816080	we're not, but we're kind of a little bit and we're very confused. And then I don't know,
1816080	1822800	maybe in the last five million years, oxytocin then got reconfigured again for things like
1822800	1829680	trust and social cooperation and generosity and game theory settings and all that.
1829680	1835760	Here's the naughtiest thing we've done with oxytocin, this 100 million year old hormone.
1835760	1843520	And in the last 20,000 years, we've reconfigured it again so that we secrete it and our dogs
1843520	1851600	secrete it when we're looking into each other's eyes. Like, whoa, we're now using oxytocin for
1851600	1857760	feeling attached to our ex wolves, like 20,000 years, a blink of an eye and now we use it for that
1857760	1863520	and you give a dog oxytocin and it looks at its human longer. Okay, so everything about oxytocin
1863520	1868640	there is great. And if we could just dump oxytocin in the water supply, this would be a wonderful
1868720	1878320	planet. Oxytocin promotes prosociality, it doesn't. Oxytocin promotes prosociality with people who
1878320	1886240	you consider to be an us, people like me. And your pet dog who you spend more on for food each
1886240	1892800	year than your Sudanese gets in a decade counts as an us. What does oxytocin do when you're
1892800	1900080	encountering thems? It makes you crappier to them. It makes you more preemptively aggressive.
1900080	1906400	It makes you less trustworthy. Oxytocin doesn't make you nice. It makes you nice to people who
1906400	1913440	already count as a you and it makes you awful to them. It just takes this us them like fracture
1913440	1919680	line we have in our heads and it just pushes it apart further. And amazing studies showing you
1919680	1924080	give people oxytocin and they become more cooperative to their team members and they
1924080	1930560	become awful to the people on the other team. It is not this groovy hormone. It is this hormone
1930560	1938640	that makes parochial, you know, provinciality more dramatic and that's not often a good thing.
1939280	1946960	It's just so obvious to me how critical biology and where these neurotransmitters originated
1947600	1955200	and why and what they're doing to our behaviors and our culture are so relevant to what we face.
1958000	1962400	What do you know about how oxytocin or anything else can change
1964080	1968800	the dynamic or who is us and who is them? How does that change?
1969520	1977200	Well, what it's really ideal for is what a lot of these hormones that expect
1978960	1984080	affect social behavior are good for. Yeah, you get someone who's super aggressive and testosterone
1984080	1989440	makes them more aggressive. You get someone who's incredibly altruistic and prosocial and oxytocin
1989440	1994800	probably makes them more so. Who you want to get are the folks in the middle when they're looking
1994800	2002000	at an ambiguous stimulus. Is this face angry, threatening or what? And most people would say
2002000	2008000	looks neutral to me and give someone testosterone and they now perceive it as being threatening.
2008000	2014400	Take a neutral face and give somebody oxytocin and they're now more likely to look at as friendly
2014400	2021600	or trustworthy. Where these hormones do their most modulatory things is the gray zone where what
2021600	2028560	you're perceiving really is much more in the eye of the beholder than the external realities of your
2028560	2036000	perceptions. It's really good at influencing interpretations in the gray zone. And that's
2038320	2044720	once again, it doesn't really require a hormone to have hated Nazis even more than you hated them
2044720	2052320	before. But depending on which politician is spouting which stuff, a hormone that turns a
2052320	2058880	neutral ambiguous signal into a strongly felt one for good or bad, that's where you really
2058880	2065520	see the interesting consequences. It's so fascinating. So I want to get to your new book.
2066320	2073600	But one of my staff members is a fan of your work and she wanted me to ask something related to
2073600	2080320	one of your books, why zebras don't get ulcers, you talked about stress. And for an individual
2080320	2087920	making a decision now, the effects of stress in the last few months of their life will, if I
2087920	2093600	understand it correctly, shrink the prefrontal cortex and enlarge the amygdala affecting whatever
2093600	2100640	decision that that individual will make. So following the logic of the great simplification
2100640	2107600	that we're approaching the peak of the carbon pulse and we're going to have less energy to power
2107600	2113840	society, if individuals who are barely having their basic needs met stressed out in terms of
2113840	2120640	survival, are those individuals less likely then to be pro-social and more prone towards
2120640	2126240	violence and effect in a society with less access to resources and lower standard of living?
2126960	2132000	Does that itself change the brains of its citizens immersed in that, causing
2132640	2138560	a negative feedbacks and less trust, etc? Yep, absolutely. And in all the bad ways,
2139520	2146640	you especially, you might imagine, it's not just in the previous few months, it's already,
2147200	2151680	you look at this, this is one of these findings where you should be up and screaming at how the
2151680	2157200	world works this way. You use some totally fancy brain imaging techniques that you could use on a
2157200	2165680	fetus. And by a third trimester fetus, their mother's socioeconomic status is already affecting
2165680	2170880	their brain development by way of the mother's stress hormones. So it was not just in the last
2170880	2176080	few months, it's starting from when you were still like mostly being fed by mom's blood and her
2176080	2184240	stress hormones. So in that regard, it's an entire lifetime worth of good or bad luck that is sculpting
2184240	2191280	your brain into a more reactive this or a sluggish that and all of that absolutely plays out.
2192720	2198640	In terms of your specific question of a world of more and more deprivation,
2199200	2211280	hunger, fear, stress, uncertainty, all of that, temperature, ambient temperature. In cities,
2211280	2217520	the ambient temperature on a particular day is a statistically significant predictor of levels
2217520	2224000	of violence. As this planet gets hotter, cities are going to be more violent. You look at people,
2224000	2229920	not where they live now, but where they grew up. And you look at people who grew up in cities versus
2229920	2235840	rural areas and their structural differences in their brain on the average. Whoa, is this
2235840	2241040	pertinent to our everyday lives? Absolutely. And I think we're three and a half years into seeing
2241040	2246800	one of the most tragic versions of it, which is for about a week or so into COVID. Everyone said,
2246800	2254240	wow, we're all in this together. And that lasted about a week. And all it has done is polarized
2254240	2260080	people and bring out the worst in an awful lot of people while bringing out the best in some people,
2260960	2268000	but exaggerating us them contrasts and making empathy totally tunnel visioned. And
2269440	2275280	that's been awful seeing that for the last three and a half years. And just to be really pessimistic,
2275280	2279760	oh my God, there's this new virus that suddenly is the most important thing in the world.
2280640	2287760	We blew it with our response to that. That's a pretty unappealing trial run for what the
2287760	2292640	equivalent's going to be when our cities are flooding and there's not enough crops being
2292640	2302240	grown anymore. Yeah, this was not a good dress rehearsal. Yeah, I hear you on that. So if it
2302240	2310800	were possible and fundable, and there was political will, if we truly cared about the
2310800	2318000	society of the future and what Palo Alto and San Francisco might look like in 2050 or any city
2318000	2329040	in the world, wouldn't it make sense to invest in third trimester security and oxytocin with groups
2329040	2335760	of happy people surrounding pregnant women so that they don't have stress? I don't know how
2335760	2341520	feasible it is, but would it pay dividends over decades if such a thing were pursued?
2343360	2350640	Actually, multiple lifetimes, which brings in this. Okay, so how did your brain construct
2350640	2355600	genes had something to do with it, but environment beginning and fuel life has something to do with?
2355600	2361920	What does that actually mean on a nuts and bolts level? Environmental stimuli starting from where
2361920	2367840	you were fetus to what you had for breakfast this morning will change which genes in your brain
2367840	2374080	are active and which are turned off. And in some cases, we'll turn some of them on permanently
2374080	2379920	and some of them off permanently. And then there's these amazing mechanisms, something that's called
2379920	2386560	non Mendelian inheritance of traits that because of something in the world you developed in,
2387920	2392960	you have a body with a certain physiological profile such that when you are pregnant,
2394240	2399680	you will pass on some of those traits to your fetus, not through genes, but because of the
2399680	2405040	hormonal environment that's been generated, things like that, where it will affect your
2405040	2410720	parenting style in a way that will produce a kid who as an adult will be just like you.
2410720	2417600	Some of these things are multi-generational. Now, amid that, you've got this like
2418800	2428160	narrow line to the sort of tread there, which an awful lot of like social progressives have to do,
2428160	2437920	which is, wow, adversity, societal adversity, social adversity, all of that is so, so bad for you
2437920	2444000	that could actually have multi-generational consequences. Wow, that's really bad. That's
2444000	2449360	really bad. But where the temptation then is to say, and these are such strong effects, there's
2449360	2456320	nothing we could do about it. The other side of it is there's very little of that biology
2456320	2462160	that winds up being written in stone. Interventions at every point in life
2462160	2468640	can undo some of those things. It's this whole like trendy sexy field called neuroplasticity.
2468640	2475760	You make the environments of 90-year-olds more sensorially stimulating and at postmortem,
2475760	2482560	they were making neuronal connections in the park. So, wow, bad stuff leaves long,
2482560	2488800	long scar tissue, but it's reversible. How do you reconcile these two that seemingly
2488800	2494880	are contradictory? Yeah, bad stuff leaves consequences for a long time afterward,
2494880	2501680	and the longer you wait to try to reverse it, to try to counter it, the more of an uphill
2501680	2508240	battle it's going to be. You want to fix somebody who has been mired in the neurodevelopmental
2508240	2513840	consequences of poverty. Do something about it when they're four years old, not when they're
2513840	2519440	applying to college. Thank you for all that. Let's move on to your new book, Determined,
2519440	2525600	A Science of Life Without Free Will, which is, as I looked this morning, is available for pre-order
2525600	2533440	on Amazon and elsewhere. Can you give an overview of the main thesis and maybe in there, please
2533440	2541200	start by defining what you mean by free will. Okay. I published this book about five years ago
2541200	2547920	called Behave, The Biology of Humans at Their Best and Worst, and it was like the original
2547920	2554240	draft was a thousand pages, and my publisher had a panic attack, and it was eventually merely an
2554240	2559840	impossible 700 pages. It was, how do you understand where social behavior comes from? Yeah, it was
2559840	2567520	caused by neurons one second ago, but it was also caused by whatever environmental stimuli in the
2567520	2572960	previous minute made those neurons do that, and it was also caused by your hormone levels this
2572960	2578640	morning that made this or that part of the brain more or less sensitive to these stimuli, and it
2578640	2584320	has to do with trauma or stimulation in the last year, and it's got to do with adolescence and
2584400	2591520	fetal life, and your genes interacting with all of that, and what's most like charming to me. It
2591520	2598640	also has something to do with what kind of culture your ancestors invented 400 years ago, because
2598640	2604880	that's going to have affected how your mother was mothering you within minutes of birth, cultural
2604880	2612640	differences with that, and thereafter. So everything from like, was there a good or bad smell in the
2612640	2621360	room just now, affects people's opinions about social politics to where your ancestors dealing
2621360	2627440	with a high infectious disease load, and thus they were spooked by foreigners coming in, and that
2627440	2632800	influences cultural differences and xenophobia today. All of that stuff matters, so you know,
2632800	2637440	I'd stand up in front of like a bunch of people and go on about this for 60 minutes, and at the
2637440	2644560	end, the ones who were like still standing, inevitably someone would say, whoa, you know,
2644560	2653040	this seems to kind of challenge the notion of free will, and like my immediate response was,
2653840	2659280	yeah, you think, you know, I haven't believed in free will since I was 13 or so, but it was
2659280	2666640	a little bit of a revelation of, okay, I got to like do son of that previous book and make
2666640	2673840	explicit, when you put all these pieces together, there is no room for free will whatsoever, we are
2673840	2680080	nothing more or less than the biology, which brought us to this moment over which we had no
2680080	2686000	control, and its interactions with environment that brought us to this moment, which over which we
2686000	2693600	had no control. So the first half of the book is like trying to, in a less screechy way, like
2693600	2700640	convince somebody of that, and basically go after all of the contemporary compatibilist
2700640	2705840	arguments where you don't have to deal with like a medium of peasant, you can deal with someone
2705840	2711200	contemporary who says, yeah, atoms exist, and molecules exist, and neurons are for real, but
2711200	2718240	here is somehow how you still pull free will out of the rabbit's hat there of like taking on the
2718240	2724800	contemporary arguments for free will. The second half of the book is the one that's been much more
2724800	2732080	challenging to me since I was 13, which is, okay, okay, you convince me there's no free will, I give
2732080	2740560	up, okay. Oh my God, what if people actually started believing this? How are we supposed to
2740560	2747920	function? What's the world supposed to look like if we all accepted that there's no free will at all,
2747920	2755360	and what the second half of the book is about is like trying to wrestle with that, and the themes
2755360	2760880	over and over and there are number one, the roof isn't going to cave in, we're not going to have
2760880	2766640	like murderers running throughout the streets, because over and over we've been able to deal with
2766640	2773680	subtracting responsibility out of our understanding of where behavior comes from, and not only doesn't
2773680	2779760	the world run amuck at that point, it's become a more humane place. Wow, witches really don't
2779760	2786720	cause hailstorms, so that is one point. Another is this sort of knee jerk responsive, oh my God,
2786720	2792160	if it's deterministic world and there's no free will, does that mean nothing can change? No, it means
2792160	2799600	this is exactly how we change. Here's the biology of how you turn Nazis into ex-Nazis 40 years later
2799600	2807840	who were remorseful, all of that, and I guess the third final theme in there is if you look at this
2807840	2815520	and this is depressing as hell, oh my God, maybe my corner office and my corporation
2815520	2820960	and my sense of self-esteem that I've gotten from that wasn't earned because there's no free will
2820960	2826960	or whatever, what a bummer, maybe this leaves a big existential void, if that's your response to
2826960	2834160	there being no free will, you're one of the lucky ones. For most humans on earth, their experience
2834160	2840560	isn't being given credit for stuff that they really aren't worthy worthy of being credited for,
2840560	2846480	for most humans it's being blamed for stuff that was out of your control, and a world in which
2846480	2853040	people stop believing in free will is going to be a hell of a lot more humane. I have a lot of
2853120	2863120	questions, Robert. I sent a note around to my inner circle about a week ago in anticipation
2863120	2869840	and preparation for this interview, and the response on this topic was very polarizing. There
2869840	2875840	were some people who thought there were three responses in three groups. One group was like,
2875840	2881280	it doesn't matter, a book is, we've been having this discussion of free will for centuries,
2881280	2885680	a book isn't going to change that. There was another camp that said this is horribly dangerous
2885680	2892160	because it could lead to nihilism at a time when we need a pro-social response from more people.
2893360	2897280	And then another camp, which was actually the majority, including my girlfriend,
2897920	2904800	they felt liberated by it because it got them off the hook of things that had been bothering them
2904800	2910240	and their content in their own lives, so it made them, this is what I'm good at, this is what I'm
2910240	2917600	doing. So it was really fascinating, three categories of response, and these are largely
2917600	2924800	intellectual, well-read people that I shared it with. But before I ask you further questions,
2924800	2933120	could you just define what you mean by free will? Is it a binary thing, yes or no, or is it a spectrum
2933120	2941360	or a continuum? Yeah, and this part of the debate itself, and apropos of that, and you're
2941360	2947520	canvassing people, it's interesting that you didn't get, in fact, the most common response,
2947520	2951840	including people who think about this a lot, including people who make a profession think
2951840	2956160	about this a lot, saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is how the brain works, this is how genes work,
2956160	2963520	this is how, but somehow, I still believe in free will and it's still there, which is very
2963520	2969760	different from your people who said, oh my god, nihilism, the people who say, well, even if there
2969760	2974560	isn't free will, we probably shouldn't tell people that because things are going to go crazy after
2974560	2981120	that. Most people somehow are, the term is, compatibilists, they're able to believe in
2981120	2987760	things like 21st century technology and science and stuff, but somehow, there's still a way of
2987760	2992960	getting free will out of there, and that's 90 to 95% of contemporary philosophers.
2995040	2999840	It's almost like a religion then, like, I'm not going to die, climate change isn't going to be
2999840	3005280	a disaster because the truth is so painful that you don't, it's like cognitive dissonance of sorts.
3005280	3013040	Yeah, and of course, the most interesting ones are these super smart philosophers who go on
3013040	3018400	and on in books that I can't understand about how, yes, yes, yes, I'm willing to admit, I believe
3018400	3024400	this is a physical universe, but here's where we get free will from, and when you really, really
3024400	3029680	look at what they're saying, and when you look at their like YouTube lectures and you look at
3029680	3035600	where their faces get sort of wincy and pain-looking and stuff, most of the time what they're saying
3035600	3040720	is, please, let's pretend there's free will, because damn, this is going to be scary if there
3040720	3049040	isn't, which puts you, you know, one of those circles of your friends. Okay, so what do I
3049040	3056640	mean by free will? People who get gummed up with free will stuff in the legal realm, it's always
3056640	3063840	stuff like, did you know you had options to behave differently? Were you aware of what the
3063840	3069440	consequences would be of the option you did choose? That's all the stuff about intent,
3071520	3077200	and that's completely boring to me. Then there's a whole school of people neurobiologists who
3077200	3083200	think about free will, and what they say is something that's sort of like the cousin of,
3083280	3090720	like the legal approach, which is when you first become aware that you intend to do something,
3091760	3098400	is it possible to show that your brain already decided to do that? Is the awareness, is your
3098400	3104400	sense of intent just a total red herring? And in fact, your brain decided before you think
3104400	3109600	you're decided, whoa, there's no free will. And this was from some landmark experiments in the
3109600	3116880	1980s, and people have been fighting about the interpretation of that ever since. And, you know,
3116880	3124880	it's not clear, and it totally bores me also, because both the legal realm and the, ooh,
3126800	3133280	when do you become aware of intent? And is that different from when you become aware of being
3133280	3138240	aware of intent? And here we're going to fight that for the next 10 years between the neuroscientists
3138320	3144320	and the philosophers. None of those people and none of the legal people ask, where did that
3144320	3151520	intent come from in the first place? And that's where things fall apart, because the intent came
3151520	3155680	from what those neurons were doing a second ago, and what the hormones were doing this morning,
3155680	3161280	and what your fetal life and genes and culture and all of that. And when you look closely at that,
3161280	3168000	there isn't a crack in that edifice of biology, interacting environment from what your ancestors
3168000	3173360	were up to, to what happened a millisecond ago. There isn't a crack in there in which you can
3173360	3178640	shoehorn in this non-biological notion that there's free will.
3180880	3189280	So one of my coaches has been talking to me about meditation and other things,
3189920	3196000	and shares this famous quote from Victor Frankel, between stimulus and response,
3196000	3204240	there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our
3204240	3209840	growth and our freedom. And I've always loved this quote. But in light of your recent book,
3209840	3220320	what are your thoughts on that quote? It's beautiful. It's clearly what was needed to sustain
3220960	3224880	people who survived concentration camps, and Victor Frankel was one of them,
3225760	3232720	but he understood the reality of it. People who became depressed and gave up and concentration
3232720	3242480	camps died. People who were able to quote, choose to hold on to what mattered to them, and you know,
3242480	3247760	there are sense of self-worth and whatever, and had these amazing abilities to resist during this
3247760	3254400	hellhole. They only survived if they had all those admirable traits, plus a hell of a lot of luck,
3255120	3259920	because if you didn't have that luck, if your number came up today, it didn't matter how,
3260960	3269200	you know, optimistic your basic temperament was. So he was taking basically the lesson that got
3269200	3276240	him through that, and it's incredibly powerful. Nonetheless, that's not how the biology of it
3276240	3283600	works. You look at somebody in a concentration camp who sunk into depression, and they were dead
3283600	3289360	two months later, even before starvation was enough to explain it. And you look at someone
3289360	3296160	like Victor Frankel, who was able to find meaning in life, which plus a hell of a lot of luck,
3296160	3300160	got him out the other end. And it's not by chance that those two people differed.
3300640	3307440	But maybe it's the belief in free will, in this case, was more important than actual free will.
3307440	3314400	Absolutely. On the other hand, if you believe you were responsible for the fact that you
3314400	3322000	haven't become rich, just because you happened to have been born poor, that's not a very good
3322000	3327600	recipe for coming out the other end, feeling good about yourself. Okay, here's a great example of
3327600	3332640	this. Like one of the stupidest ways in which we could think about, ooh, biology affects our
3332640	3340400	perceptions of us, like the shape of your skull, the shape of your skull, how symmetrical it is,
3340400	3346880	whether the zygomatic arches underneath your eyes that make your cheekbones are of a particular
3346880	3352160	shape or, you know, yeah, it's got nothing to do with free will. It's got to do, we know, bone,
3352240	3359360	morphogenic proteins and all of that. And it just so happens that in one realm,
3360000	3365600	if you luck out and you have one of these nice symmetrical faces that counts as more attractive,
3366320	3373040	people like you more. They treat you better. They unconsciously are more cooperative with you.
3373040	3378960	They're more likely to vote for you. So you get somebody who like is sitting in the corner office
3378960	3384480	and part of it is that they've got magnificent cheekbones and, whoa, there's no free will. Maybe
3384480	3388640	you shouldn't feel quite so proud of all your accomplishments because your cheekbones are just
3388640	3395920	the first of the zoolian things that you didn't control. But then in another setting, if you're
3395920	3402640	sitting in a defendancy in a courtroom and you happen to have those cheekbones that are not of
3402640	3409920	the beautiful type, you're more likely to get convicted. The attractiveness of a defendant
3411600	3417120	influences for the same exact circumstances with mock turies and experiments, the likelihood of
3417120	3426160	getting convicted. People who are more attractive, African American men who have less aphro stereotypical
3426160	3431680	features to their face are less likely to get convicted. That's not stop feeling so good about
3431680	3438480	yourself about your corner office that you were more likely to get sent to jail because of this
3438480	3444080	like dumbass business about the symmetry of your skull. What kind of world is this?
3444960	3452240	What does 18 to 20 year old listening to this podcast who does not have a symmetrical face
3452240	3460400	to make of what you just said? It sucks. It sucks because this is a very deeply ingrained
3462560	3470480	you know, primates and other animals like more attractive organisms, fruit flies,
3470480	3476800	like more symmetrical ones. And symmetrical here is just like the tip of the iceberg of all the
3476800	3488640	versions of good biological luck. It sucks. Amid that, the notion that there is an average, that
3488640	3496000	there is a norm out there. This is what a normal person is supposed to look like. This is a normal
3496000	3501280	height. This is a normal degree of extroversion. This is a normal degree of beauty. This is a
3501280	3510480	normal. Normal is an emergent artifact. There is no normal. There is no human who is normal. And
3510480	3517840	normal is an artifact that every one of those traits just to get all like chaos theory stuff
3517840	3525760	is a strange attractor. Nobody is normal. What we call normal is people whose collections of traits
3525760	3530960	are statistically closest to what we've decided counts as desirable and healthy.
3531600	3534800	There's no normal out there that you're failing to live up to.
3535360	3544240	Is there something interesting on the other side of this that someone listening to this or even
3544240	3551760	myself, when I hear you don't have free will, I'm like, hell yeah, I do. I'm going to show you.
3552400	3560000	And it actually becomes a flipping moment where it may not actually be free will, but it may become
3560000	3567280	dedication or motivation that was nationed within them towards some life of purpose or something
3567280	3572320	different that was triggered by someone telling them they didn't have free will. What do you think
3572320	3578960	about that? Yeah, here's a scenario I've experienced. Like I can almost see it coming
3578960	3585040	and I'm like not trying to sound snarky here, but like it's kind of like this. I'm sitting there. I
3585040	3590160	have office hours. Two students are there taking my class and they're saying, I don't know about
3590160	3596080	this free will stuff. But you know, what about I feel like I'm having free will and I'm saying
3596080	3601040	there's no free will. And here's the biological explanation for what you just brought up. And
3601040	3608880	at an incredibly high rate over my like 40 years of doing this, at some point, one of the students
3608880	3616560	is going to lean forward, pick up a pen and say, I just decided to pick up that pen. Are you telling
3616560	3624240	me I had no free will on this? And over these years, asking the question, which of those two
3624240	3632080	students are going to do that? And I will bet you I have about 85 90% predictability. If I know
3634480	3639120	one of them is male, one of them is female. I'm betting it's more likely to be the male.
3639840	3644880	One of them is male, who is heterosexual and the female is attractive. I'm betting it's more
3644880	3650640	likely to be the male. One of them is first generation from an immigrant group that came here
3650800	3656160	as refugees. They're less likely to challenge me. One of them hates their father and I keep
3656160	3661680	reminding them of that. They're more likely to challenge me. One of them had higher testosterone
3661680	3666400	levels this morning. They're the one who's more likely to challenge. One of them has more self
3666400	3671440	esteem problems. And the one time they stood up to a bully in middle school, they got a sense of
3671440	3677200	self esteem from that they're more likely to give me all tell me how their frontal cortex is wired.
3677200	3683200	Tell me what their fetal life was like. Tell me what culture. Tell me if their fourth generation
3683200	3688880	going to my like elite school or if they got into the first generation, fourth generation,
3688880	3695760	they're much more likely to want to take on some like dead white males sitting there. First generation,
3695760	3701920	they're more likely to feel grateful or intimidated about challenging. Like throw all those variables
3701920	3710800	together. And I got like 90% predictability with that. And that's because where did that intent
3710800	3716000	to pick up that pen just come from? Where did that intent and the other person did not pick
3716000	3720720	up the pen where it came from? It came from one second before and a decade before and a thousand
3720720	3728800	years before and all of that. Wow. I was about to tell you something that happened to me this
3728800	3734400	morning. But but then you're going to psychoanalyze me. But on the days of our podcast, I go for a
3734400	3739680	long bike ride because it oxygenates me and I came back and I was craving like protein,
3741040	3748480	an omelet with cheese. And I was opening the fridge. And I just, it wasn't like I'm going to show
3748480	3753440	Robert, it was unbidden to me. And I said, you know what, I'm not going to have an omelet. I'm
3753440	3759520	going to have an oatmeal. So I didn't want oatmeal, but I just approved myself. It's a tiny little
3759520	3766160	trivial example. But is that free will that in the moment I changed what I wanted to do,
3766160	3769760	but kind of because I wanted to prove you wrong a little bit or what's going on there?
3770320	3777840	No, of course not. There was no free will there at all. Like if you, okay, as a canonical example,
3777840	3784160	if you grow up thinking your parents are the greatest and as an adult, you wind up exactly
3784160	3790720	like them, you didn't choose to be that way. If you grow up and circumstances has caused you to
3790720	3796560	hate and despise your parents and as an adult, you make sure you do exactly the opposite of them
3796560	3803120	in every single possible domain, you're just as determined. You're just as there's no more free
3803120	3808480	will in that case than the other. Or if you've decided you love some of these attributes of them
3808480	3814000	and hate others, so you're a hybrid of them. Okay, so you this morning after the bike ride looking
3814000	3822800	in there. So first thing, where'd your self reflection come from? You didn't choose to be
3822800	3828000	someone capable of like emotionally intelligent self reflection and examination of your motives
3828000	3835920	and behaviors. Next, where did your sense of like to the extent that I represent any sort of like
3835920	3844000	neurobiological authority, where did your sense of like occasionally challenging their bullshit
3844000	3850560	come from? You're higher up on the baboon hierarchy than me. Well, in talking about how
3850560	3856080	neurons work, I definitely am. In navigating the social world, my guess is I'm definitely not, but
3856720	3862800	where did where did you become the sort of person who would want to say some version of
3864160	3870480	I'm going to show them? Where did you become somebody who would have critical thinking and
3870480	3876720	enough respect for critical thinking to think critically and say this maybe constitutes a
3876720	3885120	refutation of this stance where that didn't come from nowhere. If you had grown up marinating an
3885120	3890000	alcohol from your mom when you were a fetus, you wouldn't have been capable of that critical
3890000	3896320	self reflection. If you had grown up in a culture where they said what you were told is true and
3896320	3903840	do not challenge authority, or if you were thrown growing up in a culture where you're like ethos is
3903840	3909120	anything the man says is bullshit and you should challenge it, you didn't choose which of those
3909120	3916480	cultures and every one of those steps along the way, nor did you choose the neurochemical
3916480	3924160	makeup of the part of your brain that does starch craving versus protein craving. And depending on
3924160	3930080	how those two places were wired through no credit to you, it would have something to do with how
3930080	3934880	readily you could think about this intellectual thought experiment of taking on this stance
3934880	3938960	that there's no free will and showing that it's not really the case here by foregoing
3940720	3946640	starch instead of protein. Maybe in some other case you're the reinforcement you would get from
3946640	3952960	one of those was so powerful that you would do the I'm going to show him in some other setting.
3952960	3959760	You're going to wait for the next elevator instead of cramming in there. You see I chose to do that
3959760	3965520	because you happen to have a brain this wired for really, really liking like starch after a bike
3965520	3971520	ride. So that's not where you would have done that experiment. Every one of those steps, none of that
3971520	3978640	was free. So actually that brings up another kind of profound insight while you were speaking and I
3978640	3983680	don't I don't want to make all these examples about me. But when we're talking about free will,
3983760	3992480	I only know my own brain. So I worked on Wall Street, I was a teacher and then all of a sudden
3992480	3998880	I've got this podcast and it's becoming more popular. I'm getting emails from around the world.
3998880	4005200	I'm getting traction with people in government, with universities and it feels like my life is no
4005200	4017440	longer my own. And listening to you speaking, it makes me even more have a fiduciary responsibility
4017440	4026240	to these times and to help midwife society through to a softer landing than the defaults.
4026800	4033600	And you talking about that we don't free have free will actually makes me feel more
4034320	4041920	of of that drive and and that, you know, acting as a golden retriever,
4041920	4047520	Overton Windows sort of a vector in these conversations. What's going on there as I'm
4047520	4054560	feeling that? Well, once again, you're proving there's no free will because
4055200	4061440	lots of other people at your juncture would decide it's hopeless. And instead, you take this
4061440	4067120	information and you've turned it into some sort of moral imperative to try to like make the world
4067120	4074160	whole. That doesn't happen by chance. That's not random who's capable of doing that. Lots of people
4074160	4079840	who find out about this like collapse into like self interest or a nihilistic nothingness or
4080240	4086080	sure. Where did that response come from? That's an incredibly healthy response, especially for
4086080	4092240	all the people in the world around you. That's a great way as and that didn't come from out of
4092240	4099840	nowhere. Nothing comes from nothing. But like your dad had 14% of the architects had learned
4099840	4105920	from him, cultural evolution can happen that way, irrespective of whether there is free will or not.
4106880	4115200	Of course, but whether culture evolves isn't dependent on whether or not there's free will.
4116480	4122240	I don't think there is free will. Cultural phenomenon could be explained with the same
4122240	4125760	biology interacting with environment, blah, blah, blah, that I've been spouting.
4127040	4132240	Cultural evolution could be explained by the myth of free will as well. It's in some ways
4132240	4137440	a separate topic until you start getting into what were the nuts and bolts about how the culture
4137440	4148160	just evolved. What about free won't? About 10 years ago, I like you love dogs and I realized
4148160	4154080	that pigs were smarter than dogs or as smart. One of my favorite things to eat was bacon,
4154080	4159920	lettuce and tomato sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't eat meat and I'm giving up pork,
4159920	4166960	but it was very difficult. I created this image in my head of trucks on the highway that had pigs
4166960	4174880	in them, but instead they were dogs. I had this visceral negative response to any menu with pork
4174880	4184240	on it and I haven't had pork in 10 years. That's not free will, but I call it free won't. I decided
4184240	4190720	something that was ethically important to me and I created a way for my neocortex to
4190720	4194080	trump my limbic system in the moment. How do you explain that?
4194880	4200800	It's a little bit of a semantic issue as to what counts as free will versus free won't.
4201840	4207360	Your experience can be an example of free won't. I'm not going to eat pig anymore,
4207360	4212240	or it could be an example of free will. I'm going to stick to a moral stance of mine,
4212240	4218800	so it's a little bit semantic. Insofar as it's semantic, it's the same answer.
4219760	4227920	Where'd that free won't come from in you? First off, where'd your knowledge of what gets done
4227920	4234960	to pigs? Where did your love of dogs come from? Where did your capacity to generalize empathy
4234960	4240640	from dogs to pigs? Where did your knowledge of pig intelligence come from? Where did your frontal
4240640	4248400	cortex get the means for you to look at the bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on the menu,
4248400	4257920	and somehow to suppress the associated cravings and instead pull up an image of terrified dogs
4257920	4266240	in a transport truck? Your mother did something right by you that you have a frontal cortex that
4266240	4274080	was capable of regulating impulsive cravings to that extent, because that got constructed at you
4274080	4282160	at some point. Your brain is of a type where whatever rewards bacon gives to your the correct
4282160	4289200	neurons in there, it's not so powerful that it overwhelms your capacity for, you know,
4289200	4295120	emotional regulation, and it's quite possible that you have lurking in there a craving for
4295120	4301040	something else that you wouldn't be able to override. You have not because you lack
4301760	4308000	self-confidence, self-discipline there, but because, oh, you're wiring, you know, Ben and Jerry's
4308000	4317440	ice cream sets off neurons that will not be said no to, but bacon didn't once you set your conscious
4317440	4324960	frontal cortex to it sufficiently. So if there is free will, would it reside in the
4324960	4334480	frontal cortex? Well, again, not to sound snarky, but that's a hard one for me to answer, because
4334480	4343600	that's, in a sense, asking me if the tooth fairy existed, which much neurons would
4343600	4350960	let me rephrase the question. Let me rephrase the question. So in the Amazon bio for determined,
4351520	4358080	they write that Sapolsky mounts a full frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there is
4358080	4365520	some separate self telling our biology what to do, but couldn't biology itself in our ancestral
4365520	4373280	environment created via evolution and adaptation such a separate self from novel historical
4373280	4382320	circumstances that that is the part of a body that exerts control in certain situations in my
4382320	4396000	situation to decide not to eat pork? Well, yes and no. This puts us into sort of your area of
4396000	4402560	like thinking about emergence. This is totally cool phenomenon. One of the like most interesting
4402560	4407840	things about neuroscience is you take a neuron from a fruit fly and you take a neuron from us
4407840	4412720	and they're the same thing. They're the same cell. They use the same neurotransmitters, the same wiring.
4412720	4419600	We did not become human because we invented new parts of the brain or new types of neurotransmitters.
4419600	4426880	What happened instead is one of those more is different scenarios of we've got 100 million
4426880	4433440	neurons for every neuron that a fly has and you put that many of them together and unexpected
4434240	4441840	complicated adaptive totally beautiful stuff emerges and the interesting stuff in our brains
4441840	4447760	are a merchant phenomenon like you give a chimp as many neurons as us and it would come up with
4447760	4452640	theology. It would come up with a totally different theology and it would come up with aesthetics and
4452720	4461920	would come up with okay so why isn't free will just an emergent phenomenon? The belief in free will,
4462480	4468880	the invention of the notion, the emotional connectedness to it and dependence upon the notion
4469600	4477120	is certainly emergent but free will is not because neurons don't work that way.
4478000	4484560	Okay what do I mean by that? The coolest thing about emergence is you take an ant
4484560	4490640	and it's making no sense at all and you put 10 ants and they're just doing random incoherent
4490640	4497680	stuff and you put 10,000 of them and they build a whole society and it's not because
4497680	4504560	when you get 10,000 of them suddenly the ants understand geometry or something. They know
4504560	4512320	exactly the same simple stupid few local neighbor interaction rules that they did when there was
4512320	4519280	just three of them but when you put enough of them together out pops this and all of the models
4519280	4528800	for how free will can be an emergent property requires you to break that rule and instead allow
4528800	4534800	that once you get enough ants together all of the ants can speak French and once you get neurons
4534800	4542240	together all of them could work in ways that the physical universe doesn't allow. The coolest thing
4542240	4548800	about like emergence is you look at our brains inventing stuff and we're made out of the same
4548800	4556480	cells as Drosophila brains are and they're still doing the same stupid things. The amazingness is
4557200	4564320	what is like totally provincial three or four local neighbor rules and suddenly you throw enough
4564320	4572240	of them together and they're still just as simple. That's the thing that makes me like almost want
4572240	4580560	to weep at how cool emergence is and it explains so many things out there but any model in which
4580560	4588960	you have to speculate that the emergent meta-level property now suddenly gets the ability to reach
4588960	4596000	down to the micro level of the constituent parts and make them work differently in much cooler
4596000	4602000	ways it can't work that way and every version of free will coming out of an emergence requires that.
4602560	4609920	So my work and you watched my movie recently looks at the emergent constraints of the macro
4610400	4617120	human economy the eight billion ants eight billion humans that no one is in control and that society
4617120	4626960	at least for now is this functioning as an energy hungry super organism but your recent work suggests
4626960	4634320	the same is happening at the micro level in an individual brain of sorts so am I correct in saying
4634320	4643920	that biology constrains both our micro and our macro systems but it doesn't determine it what do
4643920	4651600	you think about that? Well of course I'm going to disagree because I don't think it just constrains
4651600	4656800	when you look at all of the biological influences from the second ago to a million years ago and
4656800	4663840	you look at all the ways that biology interacts with environment not only isn't it constraining
4663840	4671120	or facilitating that's all there is that is what's there that is who we are that is
4671120	4678320	how we arrived at being who we are at this moment there's nothing but that but you bring up
4679600	4685520	in your bringing up the micro level stuff one of the like inevitable things that people get
4685520	4691120	pulled to at this point which is oh a deterministic universe and deterministic interactions of
4691120	4697120	deterministic biology and interactive ways with deterministic environment blah blah blah etc
4697120	4704640	what about quantum indeterminacy and what's that because you that you get down at a sufficiently
4704640	4714160	micro subatomic level and events right now were not caused by the events that just came before that
4715120	4722240	there is complete unpredictable randomness about how subatomic particles work and people
4722240	4728960	still like are boggled by it and don't fully understand it and there's still like a counter
4728960	4734640	revolutionary old guard of physicists who say there's got to be actually a deterministic thing
4734640	4741440	lurking in there someplace but on a very very subatomic level things appear not to be deterministic
4741440	4747120	and are totally random and thus what do you know there's a whole school of philosophers who say
4747840	4754320	free will comes out of quantum indeterminism and that doesn't make any sense either so let me go
4754320	4761520	down a little bit of an academic rabbit hole here my phd advisor who's since passed away
4761520	4767040	trials good night was an evolutionary biologist who focused on multi-level selection the fact
4767040	4775840	that it wasn't just selfishness but it was the individual competitiveness with group behavior
4775840	4783840	with maybe some bacteria or things in your gut that our selection was happened at multiple
4783840	4792320	different levels and he called that contextual analysis so with respect to free will doesn't
4792320	4800480	it depend on multiple scales and dimensions like what's happened to an organism's life
4800480	4808000	we say organisms have will which might also describe as desire or preference so an organism
4808000	4814800	feels hunger okay so it seeks food finds it eats is satisfied then other drivers come kick in after
4814800	4822160	it's satisfied it has defense or shelter or to go to the bathroom or to mate so these are all
4822160	4828640	genetic programs with chemical rewards but what about this case the organism feels hunger
4828640	4836080	but because of the complexity of its emotions its life the society um it considers whether or not
4836080	4842880	to act on that feeling and especially if it's a human organism such a complex animal with
4842880	4849680	hundreds of millions of neurons it might weigh or defer or change the paths because of these other
4849760	4856640	contexts in its life so how does context fit in with free will especially with human animals
4858160	4864960	it's beautiful it's incredibly important and I have I have such respect for multi-level
4864960	4870320	selection people just because they were like out crying of the wilderness for such a long time
4870320	4877840	people like David Sloan Wilson and he's been on my podcast yeah okay he's great and he was like
4877840	4887360	pariah for yeah like until uh not in an active kin selection but David Sloan Wilson and EO
4887360	4892480	Wilson decided that they actually agreed on more things than they disagreed about and it was like
4892480	4898800	totally beautiful and the resolution was context in some settings this is the most appropriate
4898800	4906800	level of analysis at the level of groups in some settings it's you know genomic non-expressed DNA
4906800	4912640	and you're looking at selfish DNA at sometimes just the whole genome is sometimes and yeah it's
4912640	4921120	context dependent and context is like the most interesting thing about us because like this
4921120	4926720	was my last book was all about this uh you know the biology of our best behaviors and our worst
4926720	4935360	behaviors what's most interesting about it is you could have the exact same behavior the same
4935440	4941680	neurons telling the same muscles do the same exact thing and depending on the context you could just
4941680	4947920	be ethnically cleansing a village or you could be Mother Teresa in one setting pulling a trigger
4947920	4953680	is like self-sacrificial and amazing and in another it's like one of the most heartless things to do
4954480	4961520	like the motoric aspects of the behavior we carry out yeah that's kind of interesting
4961520	4967280	to learn the biology that there's nowhere near as interesting as what it means in that context
4967280	4976960	and that's exactly what all of this is about so your dog just shook his head and I heard the chain
4976960	4983840	and the chain reminded me that you have a golden retriever in your office and that made me happy
4983840	4989760	and it made me more positive and maybe that changed the framing of my next question so that's also
4989840	4996960	context or is that totally unrelated to free will okay so that's context that that's that's
4996960	5006080	one of the sets of webs which went all wound together and in that case context was about
5006080	5012720	five minutes long knowing I had a golden but also 30 years long since you were growing up with
5012720	5019600	goldens and 40 000 years long since you were of a culture that like likes dogs instead of eating
5019600	5028240	them all of that but yeah that's exactly where that came from so how do you define Robert the
5028240	5035120	difference between free will and agency do you feel any sort of agency in your life and how do you
5035120	5042640	still feel a drive to contribute to good in the world if you don't see us as as having free will
5043600	5051840	well this is where like there's no such thing as free will there's no such thing as agency
5052800	5059760	a criminal justice system that uses the notion of responsibility and blame and punish punishment
5059760	5067360	makes no sense whatsoever at the same time a meritocracy that runs on notions of praise and
5067360	5076960	reward makes just as little sense none of it makes any sense and someone like telling you you did
5076960	5082160	something rotten ultimately if you really really believe it makes as little sense as saying that
5082160	5087920	earthquake did something rotten and someone telling you just did something great and what a good job
5087920	5094000	makes as little sense is telling a flower that's a great like odor that do you release a fragrance
5094000	5100320	or whatever like that's the reality how in hell do you function that way how do i function that way
5100320	5108480	i function that way about one tenth of one percent of the time where i truly truly am able to think
5109360	5114800	i don't deserve anything i am not entitled to anything i have earned nothing where i truly
5114800	5120320	can think hating somebody makes as little sense as hating an earthquake yeah i could pull that
5120320	5127120	off for about three and a half seconds at a time before i fall into my lifetime of cultural training
5127120	5135280	um or framed a different way one tenth of one percent of the time i can actually function
5135280	5141760	in a way that i think is the only morally acceptable way for us to function in other words it's not
5141840	5148640	easy and like we all got a long way to go with it but at least start trying to think that way in
5148640	5156160	the domains that really matter uh when you're deciding like who gets a life sentence without
5156160	5162400	parole or when you're deciding who gets a corporate salary that's a hundred times higher than the
5162400	5168800	people working in the warehouse and like if you don't want to have to try to figure out why that
5168800	5176320	explains why you like uh you know bacon constitutively more than you like ben and jerry's that's fine
5176320	5181760	you know leave the science alone for that just go with your instincts that there's agency there
5181760	5187600	but when it comes to the big stuff if we can only pull it off some of the time that's where we have
5187600	5195520	the moral obligation to do that so what are the societal i mean you've spent years presumably
5195520	5200160	writing this book and you said that you've been since you were 13 you believe this way
5200160	5207120	so you've obviously thought about the implications of this could we use the the scientific uh
5207120	5213520	foundations that you outline and determined uh to influence the behavior or the policies the
5213520	5223520	institutions of our world in a positive way well i guess at this point am i going to sound like an
5223520	5233120	npr tote bag toting liberal or am i going to sound like someone who's much more left in my extreme
5233120	5238560	or am i going to sound someone who's so far out like i'm not even in the same playing field in
5238560	5249120	terms of lunatic fringe the only it puts you at the lunatic fringe somebody tells you nice cheek
5249120	5256720	bones and that makes this little sense to feel good afterward as somebody telling you have a good
5256720	5262880	moral philosophy and you have just used that to make a million lives better and thank you for being
5262880	5270320	that person that makes this little none of it makes any sense if you really really follow this stuff out
5271040	5277680	and the cheekbone end it doesn't really matter but getting people to think more correctly about
5277680	5286000	punishment and reward and who deserves anything um and whether hate ever makes sense at all
5286560	5292800	that's where it has some major societal consequences i mean just you know as one example of that
5293520	5300880	we understand how epilepsy works to some degree there was a time when people didn't and if somebody
5300880	5305520	had an epileptic seizure what they did to you in their 15th century village was burn you at the
5305520	5312320	stake because you were demonically possessed whoa understanding how this stuff works has societal
5312320	5321120	implications that's thousands of people who were burned at the stake understanding that schizophrenia
5321120	5328720	isn't caused by crappy psychodynamically hostile mothering and instead a neurogenetic disorder
5329360	5336160	whoa that makes a big difference in how the world works and in every one of these cases
5336160	5340880	it makes for a more humane world it's like really good that we don't burn people with
5340880	5347120	epilepsy at the stakes or tell mothers of teenagers who've just been diagnosed with schizophrenia
5347120	5354240	some Freudian bile that you caused it because unconsciously you hate your child like it's a
5354240	5359840	better world at each one of these steps so what what is the difference between a deterministic
5360720	5369200	world which you are describing and a fatalistic or nihilistic mindset or worldview great um
5371280	5379280	the fatalistic one is the worst place you could arrive from all of this stuff which is to look at
5379280	5386160	all of these biological threads around our fingers and all of these environmental and all
5386160	5391680	these biology environment interaction threads and and collectively they're much more than threads
5391680	5399040	they're a gigantic cocoon blah blah blah to conclude nothing can change so why bother
5400880	5408960	what you proved is something can change you don't eat bacon anymore um it's not really
5408960	5415840	because you chose to no longer eat bacon it's because you were you were changed previously
5415840	5422000	in life in ways that made it possible for you to learn about pig intelligence and to evoke
5422000	5428880	images of puppies and trucks we don't change we don't choose to change but we sure are changed
5429760	5435840	and we have to make use of our knowledge about how that change comes about because if we don't
5435840	5442400	think the change happens we're totally screwed nihilism is not like a very happy picture for how
5442400	5447920	we should go about looking at what else there is out there so this is really a huge call to
5448960	5454720	changing our cultural environment but really to education um and many other things because
5455680	5462720	humans can change but only if our two seconds ago one month ago five years ago 40 years ago
5463360	5470480	and we can't change the 40 years ago or the 400 years ago but we can change our cultural stimuli
5471040	5476880	at least in theory right so education and and moving in the direction of some of these pro-social
5476880	5483440	outcomes will be able to change other people and empower them to do the environmental equivalent
5483440	5491360	of giving up pork or whatever it is absolutely so you get somebody who because of environmental
5491360	5499840	events learns that something crummy is going on in Ukraine and they say wow I'm going to educate
5499840	5508000	myself about the history of like Slavic you know tribalism or whatever and they come out the other
5508000	5514800	end and tell people you know any of this Putin saying this is about NATO this is about this is
5515680	5520560	nonsense in the 19th century the Russians were saying the Ukrainians couldn't use their own
5520560	5527280	language this is centuries old what have you just done there you have been exposed to environmental
5527280	5532720	stimuli telling you that something's going on in Ukraine and you decide I'm going to learn
5532720	5539920	more about it how do you turn into the sort of person who at that juncture would say I'm even
5539920	5545760	interested in the news I want to learn more about it I'm going to use my critical thinking to see
5545760	5551520	maybe one of the stories being spouted here isn't actually all that accurate who taught you
5552080	5556960	challenge stuff like that who taught you to read who to blah blah all the ways in which you could
5556960	5563200	have been a different person in no ways that you can control and once that brought about a change in
5563200	5569200	you whoa this has nothing to do with NATO this has to do with different Slavic tribes hating
5569200	5575600	each other for half a millennium then you're capable of telling that to somebody else and
5575600	5583920	perhaps they're in a position to be changed by that as a result like on the most basic like
5583920	5589040	concrete are you kidding me you know yeah actually the world needs to work this way
5590640	5596720	if you've been listening to this podcast and you've decided this is incredibly galvanizing to you
5596720	5601200	or if you've decided this is totally wrong or if you've decided this is boring or if you've
5601200	5609280	decided you really want to get like a cookie your brain is structurally different than it was two
5609280	5616560	seconds ago because it has to be that's how it works if what you've concluded is this is boring
5616560	5621120	I'm going to get a cookie your brain has probably changed in a way that's not going to have a whole
5621120	5627200	lot of long-term consequences but somewhere in there there are three and a half synapses
5627200	5632480	that are now working differently than they were working 10 minutes ago they may no longer be
5632480	5637680	working differently 10 minutes from now it's a very transient effect or if this decides
5637680	5641840	makes you decide you're going to go out and become like a Baptist preacher or something
5642960	5650240	that change persisted but everything something just changed in your brain in a way that is
5650240	5658400	ultimately only explainable by the physical universe and thus like you go get a cookie
5658400	5664000	or thus you go devote the rest of your life to a different cause than you would have 10 minutes ago
5664960	5669840	because that's all there is there's nothing more than that in anything more you would invoke to
5669840	5678160	explain that you're invoking magic that defies how the physical universe works and how emergent
5678160	5683760	systems work and whether or not quantum indeterminacy has anything to do with what
5683760	5691680	you order on the menu it simply doesn't work that way why did you write this book it wasn't free
5691680	5697520	will you had to have an idea in your mind other than getting the science right you've been a
5697520	5704320	lifelong scholar of the human and and primate brain but what was your hope in in writing this book
5705200	5711600	um well everything ranging from
5714000	5722320	to make this a more human humane world to showing those asshole bullies when I was 14
5722320	5729680	year old in junior high and they were bullying me look what I've done to making money to having
5729680	5736800	people think I'm a kind person to having people think I have nice cheekbones because they're
5736800	5740880	confusing writing a good book with all sorts of other things that have nothing to do with it and
5740880	5747920	are not based in reality yeah all this stuff because my parents wanted me to be a doctor and
5747920	5753440	they went to their graves wanting me to be a doctor and I turned it to this instead yeah look at this
5753440	5761120	look at you see you see because they wanted me to be a critical thinker yeah look at this you see
5761760	5767520	so it had to come out this book had it was like you had to give birth to this book as a natural
5768720	5774560	continuum of your life's work yeah but in the exact same way but in a much less interesting
5774560	5780480	level that I forgot to bring the charger with me when I went from outside back to here
5781200	5787760	so I mean I love all of your books I've read about a third of this one because it's 500 pages
5787760	5798000	and 10s and I've been really busy but I can see this book striking a nerve especially with
5798640	5804240	what's going on in our social discourse today are you worried at all about the academic
5804960	5812240	public response to this book it could there be a similar drama like there was created by
5812240	5821040	Richard Dawkins's selfish gene in the 70s which was a naive interpretation of selfishness back
5821040	5826960	then but could there be a naive interpretation of the science that could rationalize apathy
5826960	5832960	and nihilism are you are you excited about that do you have some trepidation what are you what can
5832960	5842480	you share um and by the way characterizing that is naive with Dawkins is exactly one would get
5842480	5851600	from a card-carrying multi-level selectionist yeah I'm pretty pretty damn naive and uh and dogmatic
5851600	5858880	but but it but it did become popular and it was grabbed by people to rationalize look humans are
5858880	5865040	naturally this way which was an incorrect interpretation but are you worried that we might
5865040	5870880	get the same reaction with your book I don't have any free will that's what made me do it I wasn't my
5870880	5879840	fault um absolutely and some of that's exciting and some of that's terrifying because I'm just like
5879920	5889840	this torpy professor sitting someplace and if somebody decides um like maligning their religious
5889840	5896160	beliefs or at the other end of the spectrum if I'm maligning their social identity and their
5896160	5904240	validation of it or and they're gonna hate me that's gonna suck um I I have a bit of a conundrum
5904800	5912960	in that intellectually um very very combative and love it and interpersonally I am totally meek
5913600	5921760	and skittish so there's going to be an interesting balancing of those tendencies
5921760	5928720	depending on how much somebody hates my ideas versus if they wind up hating me I get it so
5928720	5935680	intellectually Robert how could you be wrong about this is there an experiment or something
5935680	5944400	that you could discover that would change your mind that humans have free will absolutely um
5944960	5952640	and conveniently it's an impossible experiment but what the hell um okay you've just done something
5953440	5959040	with like incredible consequence you've pulled a trigger as highly context-dependent like this
5959040	5967120	matters it makes a difference and it's possible to track down like the one little node of neurons
5968000	5974960	that told your muscle to do that so let's look at that node of neurons if you could show me
5975520	5982000	they would have done the exact same thing regardless of what any of the neighboring neurons
5983200	5990160	did in the previous seconds that's kind of interesting and impressive but then show me
5990160	5997200	that they would have done the exact same thing regardless of what you had for breakfast whether
5997200	6002240	you were tired scared stressed aroused whatever and then show me it would have done the same thing
6002240	6006880	no matter what your hormone levels were and show me they would have done the exact same thing
6006880	6011920	whether you grew up in an individualist or a collectivist culture and show me that if you
6011920	6017680	changed every gene inside those neurons into the set of genes that the person sitting next to you
6017680	6023760	had do all of those things and if those neurons still made you do the exact same thing you've
6023760	6037200	just proven free will go good luck yeah yeah i see um okay i i as i said i have hours of questions
6037200	6043120	for you but i want to be respectful of your time i have one more question related to your book
6043680	6049120	and your work and then and then we'll get to the closing questions that i ask all my guests so
6049360	6059760	what might be some some key components or even key questions uh in a new systems informed design
6059760	6067200	of society based on an understanding of neuroscience physiology and and no free will
6069040	6077840	um writ small a huge challenge for the field is we know a lot about how like a neuron works
6077920	6085280	or a little a little circuit of neurons and we know about like the kind of stuff that brains
6085280	6094160	produce like ideology or or love or things like that it's really tough the scaling up problem the
6094160	6101200	intermediate range is the big challenge um because traditionally you could look at the electrical
6101200	6108960	activity of three neurons at a time now these days you can canvas activity in 10 000 neurons
6108960	6115760	and look at their gene expression profiles and you get these massive bioinformatic data sets and
6115760	6122160	nobody is smart enough to be able to think in 11 dimensions at once so the connecting the two
6122160	6128240	levels okay so that's uh let's see i hope lots of grad students are able to do that in the centuries
6128240	6141520	to come um the much bigger to do is how do we get past this sense that uh judgment makes sense
6142880	6153920	and punishment makes sense and praise makes sense and that somebody really isn't responsible for the
6153920	6159360	most wondrous things you can imagine or the most damaging and how do you get past that fact
6159360	6164880	that in the right circumstances it feels really good to punish someone for righteous reasons
6165680	6173280	how are you going to do this but you know three four hundred years ago people managed to do that
6173280	6180320	in thinking about the biologically deterministic phenomenon of epilepsy and subtract satan out
6180320	6186960	of it and we've done it over and over again in all sorts of other realms this kid is having trouble
6186960	6192640	reading because of a biologically deterministic thing called dyslexia not because they're lazy
6192640	6197120	we've done it we've done it over and over we got to do it over and over again
6198160	6205840	i sometimes feel that we're in this like twilight zone movie and often in my lectures i say that
6205840	6211760	we've arrived at a species level conversation that we're the first generation of homo sapiens
6212640	6219600	to be able to not not necessarily that we are but we have the ability to figure out where we
6219600	6225840	came from how we got here what we're doing to each other to the planet what our biology is
6225840	6231840	what we actually need what our natural resource balance sheet is or that of the earth and it
6231840	6238400	feels like your story is a piece of this it's like looking in the mirror at homo sapiens and
6238400	6244640	looking all around us and are we gonna have enough time to integrate this stuff do you get that feeling
6244640	6253760	or how do you respond to what i just said absolutely uh as as a way of kind of summarizing everything
6253760	6261840	you preach about the clocks ticking and we got a lot of stuff to overcome and a lot of
6261840	6271520	it taps into this sort of frame from my view of the world what is the universe of circumstance
6271520	6279360	that has made us into a species that's insatiable why was something wonderful yesterday not enough
6279360	6286800	tomorrow why are there a few exceptions to that why are there some people who didn't turn out that
6286800	6292080	way how can we you know opportunize knowledge about that to get to save the world in time
6292880	6300000	whereas your level of solving the same problem is uh hey you know oil reserves are not going to
6300000	6306560	last forever this is an anomaly you know there's all these different levels of attacking the same
6306560	6313600	problem uh the clock is ticking we're running out of all sorts of important stuff and it's very
6313600	6324640	much in our nature to be awful to have knots when times get bad and like go for it there's no
6324640	6330800	shortage of approaches that are desperately needed to try to fix some of this stuff what what would
6330800	6337200	you like the viewers and listeners of this podcast to take away from this brief overview
6338000	6344720	a little bit of your earlier work but primarily your new book determined a science of life without
6344720	6352640	free will well how how would you like people to to take this subject on after hearing this
6352640	6362240	this isn't scary because oh my god science i hated ninth grade biology this isn't scary
6362240	6368880	because the concepts are like inaccessible this isn't scary because it means there's no purpose
6368880	6375040	in life anything but that this isn't scary because it means we're all going to run amuck
6375600	6382960	the world's going to become more humane um and this isn't scary because if you're one of the
6382960	6388800	lucky ones it's going to make you feel like you don't deserve all the great things you've gotten
6388800	6394640	you don't deserve the great things you've gotten but for most people on earth what they're going to
6394640	6400080	find out is they don't deserve to have not gotten most of the great things they were deprived so this
6400080	6408720	is a wonderful thing so this is not oh my god this is like the roof isn't going to cave in
6408720	6415600	it's going to be better afterward inter individually and on a societal level if we understand like
6415600	6422320	where we're coming from and where we're coming from is it doesn't make sense to feel like you are
6422320	6427280	entitled to be treated better than another human and it doesn't make sense to think that there's
6427280	6434720	something like evil in looking at the damaging things that this collection of atoms we call humans
6435280	6440240	are doing versus damaging things that other collections of atoms are doing like this can
6440240	6446320	only be good things and again i could manage to think this way like one percent of the time
6446320	6452880	so nobody is saying this is going to be easy but like we got to try so broader than that
6453680	6460000	not on the topic of free will but you've thought about the human condition and and have a career
6460000	6466160	choice on human behavioral biology do you have any personal advice to the viewers of this show at
6466160	6472960	this time of global inequality and anxiety and crazy politics and climate change and and other
6472960	6478400	things what some people would call the the poly crisis do you have any recommendations to to people
6479280	6485040	all i can say is it takes a hell of a lot of work not to sink into
6486960	6492880	a depression and a sense of helplessness and my basic nature is such that i do that with a second's
6492880	6506160	notice um you're not alone things can change big potentially revolutionary things could emerge
6506160	6515680	from a lot of little component parts uh coming together uh empathy goes a hell of a long way
6515680	6520400	especially when it's empathy for someone where the empathy doesn't come naturally
6521760	6531280	and if you want to be a primate and decrease your stress hormone levels it's great if people
6531280	6536800	treat you nicely and groom you but it turns out it's even better if you groom them instead
6537920	6547280	and you know maybe all these pieces together you know keeps keeps the clouds away for a few
6547280	6555200	more seconds at a time and you know take advantage of those few seconds and be proactive so you've
6555200	6562240	been teaching for 40 years or so um what recommendations do you give to your 18 to 20
6562240	6567520	year old young humans that take your class at at the end after learning about this and after also
6568080	6574400	living in a time of of environmental damage and social stress etc or do you not give them advice
6574400	6583360	at all oh i i pontificate out the wazoo i'm i'm insufferable um and most of them appropriately
6583360	6591200	glaze over at that point um what what would i tell them what do i tell them um
6593040	6599200	it looks really tough to make a change but by definition because of my privilege in life
6599200	6605680	i've wound up spending my career interacting with students who are uber privileged um so if
6605680	6611360	anyone's going to do it it's you guys yeah because not only did you get to go to one of the best
6611360	6617680	universities on earth you almost certainly don't have horrible gut parasites because you're one of
6617680	6626480	the lucky ones um maybe the next thing is this thing that fascinates me trying to make sense of
6627360	6632720	in terms of like making the world whole and one of the completely irrational things we're
6632720	6639360	capable of doing as humans and have to do the more hopeless the process the problem seems
6640320	6644720	the more you have to decide that you're one of the ones who can solve the problem
6645600	6652560	which is a version of this impossible religious stance of the less lovable the person the more
6652560	6659920	you have to find the means to love them uh you're one of the lucky ones go and do it and keep in
6659920	6665120	mind it's not going to come cheap and you're going to have to make a lot of personal choices as to
6665120	6669760	what you're willing to give up along the way uh no one said this is going to be easy
6672000	6678960	that's kind of the underlying feeling that i'm getting from this great conversation
6680720	6686320	irrespective of whether i fully buy that there's no free will or not listening to you i feel that
6686320	6692400	i am one of the lucky ones and i have to do more than i have been doing to pass the baton or at
6692400	6699040	least you know accelerate this so that's the emotion that i'm feeling listening to you on this topic
6699040	6706160	but of course i can only understand my own mind i don't understand anyone else's and to incorporate
6706160	6713520	something i have to tell myself 99 percent of the time which is when you lapse and you fail to be
6713520	6722080	that wonderful you're no less a biological machine yeah that's we're we're dealing with some tough
6722080	6730560	things here and so we have to be kind to ourselves yeah and it's like a little bit self-serving to do
6730560	6738240	that almost fatuous you have to love yourself before you can love others but it helps yeah i've
6738240	6742400	i'm told that often what do you care most about in the world robert
6745680	6760080	um the scientist in me says being able to sit quietly and see how pieces of things fit together
6760880	6770480	um the 60 something this says being able to sit quietly and see how pieces of things fit together
6771120	6781440	and there's less pain afterward yeah i hear you um if you could make i ask this of all my guests
6781440	6787680	if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one
6787680	6794640	thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures um you know knowing that you're a scientist
6794640	6800320	and you don't believe in magic wands but just hypothetically well i'll take two since this is
6800320	6810240	like imaginary one is that we habituate to good stuff more slowly um we may not invent that many
6810240	6820240	the next big things but that's probably a good thing in the long run um and i guess the other is
6824160	6835200	to be able to understand all of the circumstances in which we lose empathy and to understand why it
6835200	6841360	is that it's so much easier to make a neutral somebody into a them than to make them into an us
6842160	6849120	let alone to make a them into an us because we can do it and there's circumstances that make it easier
6849120	6858080	to do um why does adversity bring out the worst and so many of us this has been a fantastic
6858640	6864640	conversation um another thought that came to my mind is 20 years ago when i started reading
6864640	6869280	your books and watching your lectures was it predetermined that i would do a podcast with
6869280	6878240	you in 2023 um i i so value your intellect and your heart um if you were to come back in the
6878240	6886800	future on this show um the free will book determined coming out soon aside what is one topic that you
6886800	6892320	were passionate about relevant to human futures that you'd be curious or willing to take a deep
6892320	6903680	dive with me on well one that is derivative of all of this and maybe it's because i can't think of
6903680	6908400	anything these days i can't think of which socks i'm putting on without thinking about this damn
6908400	6920400	book i've been obsessing over since i was 13 um but maybe on the level of
6924080	6930320	how do we remember that no matter what amid all of these explanations and stuff
6931280	6939520	uh we're biological machines who believe they can feel sad
6941760	6947280	and because of how the world works thus we actually are sad when that's happening
6948400	6956320	and we actually are feeling less pain when our machinist has led us to that we are biological
6956400	6964560	machines who could know our machinists but it doesn't take the the emotional implications of
6964560	6971040	it away in the slightest it doesn't make pleasure any less pleasurable unhappiness and it doesn't
6971040	6978080	make pain any less painful i'm going to think about that um thank you so much uh professor
6978080	6984000	sepalski for for your time today and for your your work and we will uh post a link to your book
6984560	6990720	online and let's you and i stay in touch good let's do that this was totally fun and
6992000	6997760	meeting a a distant cousin who not only likes multi-level selection but emergence so
6998880	7004320	well we're also distant cousins from when pro console came down from the tree 17 million years ago
