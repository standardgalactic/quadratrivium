WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Bienvenue. My name is Nate Higgins. I am the director of the United States

00:06.720 --> 00:13.360
Nonprofit Energy in Our Future. I am also the host of the podcast, The Great

00:13.360 --> 00:19.040
Simplification. Yesterday, upon the invitation of my colleague in Canada,

00:19.040 --> 00:26.740
Kira Cooper, I gave a presentation to the Environmental Studies Association of

00:26.740 --> 00:33.500
Canada to the Academic Congress of Canada 2024, which next week will be viewed by

00:33.500 --> 00:42.880
some 10,000 to 15,000 professors and affiliates of universities. Kira was

00:42.880 --> 00:48.720
gracious in allowing me to speak as long as I wanted to. So of all the

00:48.720 --> 00:53.300
presentations I've done, this is the most comprehensive, most up-to-date. I forgot

00:53.300 --> 00:57.500
a few things. I'm sure I'm missing some things. The world is changing. I'm still

00:57.500 --> 01:01.900
learning. But if you're looking for one-stop-shop, it's about an hour and

01:01.900 --> 01:08.980
45-minute talk. There's a brief intro by Kira, followed by a part one, the drivers

01:08.980 --> 01:14.260
and constraints of our situation, the implications and scenarios followed by a

01:14.260 --> 01:22.260
multiple-scale portfolio of potential responses by us. It is my hope that many

01:22.420 --> 01:27.340
professors around the world start to integrate this system science of our

01:27.340 --> 01:32.860
human predicament instead of continuing to work in silos. We need the silos, but

01:32.860 --> 01:38.580
as part of a larger collective of information and cross-disciplinary

01:38.580 --> 01:45.220
sharing, I hope you learn from this presentation and share it. It will take a

01:45.220 --> 01:52.660
village. Here's Kira Abiento. Greetings et bienvenue au congrès 2024. Au nom de

01:52.660 --> 01:57.260
l'Association canadienne d'études environnementales et de nos partenaires, j'ai le

01:57.260 --> 02:02.700
grand honor de vous présenter Dr. Nate Higgins. Nate est le directeur de l'Institut

02:02.700 --> 02:06.660
for the Study of Energy and our Future et haute to podcast the great

02:06.660 --> 02:11.980
simplification. Welcome. My name is Kira Cooper and I'm the co-president of the

02:11.980 --> 02:16.060
Environmental Studies Association of Canada. I wish to acknowledge that today

02:16.060 --> 02:20.620
I'm speaking to you from the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabe

02:20.620 --> 02:25.100
and Neutral Peoples. I would also like to recognize the immense natural resources,

02:25.100 --> 02:29.620
energy and human capital that make it possible for us to be here on this call.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.860
On behalf of ESAC and our partners, I am honored to welcome Dr. Nate Higgins as

02:34.860 --> 02:40.260
our 2024 Congress keynote speaker. Nate is the co-founder and director of the

02:40.300 --> 02:44.420
Institute for the Study of Energy and our Future and host of the great

02:44.420 --> 02:49.020
simplification podcast. He is a highly respected and widely trusted thought

02:49.020 --> 02:53.940
leader and communicator extraordinaire at the nexus of energy, environment and

02:53.940 --> 02:59.300
finance. I am thrilled to have Nate join us as we discuss what sustaining shared

02:59.300 --> 03:03.940
futures means in these critical times. Without further ado, bienvenue and

03:03.940 --> 03:10.220
welcome, Nate. Merci beaucoup, Kira. Thank you for the nice introduction. This

03:10.260 --> 03:14.140
will be the longest presentation I've ever given in my life. This is a

03:14.140 --> 03:20.460
culmination of 20 years of research on multiple disciplines. I know most of you

03:20.460 --> 03:25.500
are scientists and academics and probably haven't heard some of this. Some of

03:25.500 --> 03:30.300
this can be a little bit hard hitting. There will be references on every page

03:30.300 --> 03:34.940
of my slides. You can watch the video later and research things. And Kira,

03:34.940 --> 03:40.060
I'll offer now since we'll be on a tight timeline. I know we'll have time for

03:40.060 --> 03:45.540
a few questions, but if you wanted to reconvene another time for your

03:45.540 --> 03:49.380
colleagues in Canada to have a conversation and questions, I'd be happy

03:49.380 --> 03:54.460
to do that. So I'm going to speak fast. There's a lot of slides. We are part of

03:54.460 --> 04:00.180
a systems story. If you are a member of our species, which if you're watching

04:00.180 --> 04:05.060
this, you are. In the 300,000 years we've been a species, there's about an eight

04:05.060 --> 04:10.020
to 10% chance that if you're human, you're alive right now. And we've arrived

04:10.020 --> 04:15.140
at a species level conversation, which is what I'm going to discuss today. I'm

04:15.140 --> 04:18.380
going to have five sections, a brief introduction. I'm going to describe the

04:18.380 --> 04:23.980
human ecosystem, the super organism implications and scenarios for the

04:23.980 --> 04:28.980
future. And then I've got quite a long what to do section. This isn't a

04:28.980 --> 04:35.140
prescriptive talk, but I can give ideas for direction for the world, for

04:35.180 --> 04:41.500
Canada, for civil society, for the Academy and for you as individual humans.

04:41.820 --> 04:47.020
Okay, a brief introduction. So those of you watching this, since this is a

04:47.020 --> 04:55.740
scientist plenary, you have different priorities. You also want to contribute

04:55.740 --> 04:59.660
to better futures for humanity. And you want to live a good life. I couldn't

04:59.660 --> 05:06.100
find a transparent image of a toke here. I'm going to focus on your research

05:06.100 --> 05:10.860
hat a little bit and make you think about what we need to be researching and

05:10.860 --> 05:14.540
the role of the Academy in the future. And I'll come back to that at the

05:14.540 --> 05:19.060
conclusion. We hear a lot of stories in the news about what's going right and

05:19.060 --> 05:23.900
what's going wrong with the world. And I won't spend bandwidth here. But in

05:23.900 --> 05:29.380
order to diagnose the patient and figure out what to do, we first have to

05:29.420 --> 05:34.980
understand actually what's wrong and the drivers and the constraints of what we

05:34.980 --> 05:39.380
face. And that's what this talk is going to be about. The two predominant

05:39.380 --> 05:44.500
cultural narratives, at least in North America, are a green new deal. We migrate

05:44.500 --> 05:50.500
our energy systems to 100% renewables, work towards net zero emissions, and

05:50.500 --> 05:54.220
everything will be fine. There's also business as usual. There's nothing wrong

05:54.220 --> 05:57.460
with our past model. There's no shortages for anything we need to

05:57.460 --> 06:04.860
deregulate and reduce taxes. This story is going to tell a wider and deeper

06:05.220 --> 06:12.380
history and explanation of our human predicament. From a siloed perspective,

06:12.380 --> 06:16.700
there's lots of important aspects to a more sustainable future, renewable

06:16.700 --> 06:21.140
energy. There's a lot of experts on that. But if we take an aerial view, we can

06:21.140 --> 06:27.100
see that we have islands of expertise in our world that rarely talk to each

06:27.100 --> 06:34.740
other. And that ends up meaning that we have lots of concurrent, urgent and

06:34.780 --> 06:40.980
eloquent and erudite conversations that lack the aerial view that look at how

06:40.980 --> 06:44.860
things are connected. We have islands of expertise in our cultural

06:44.860 --> 06:51.900
conversations separated by oceans of incoherence. Okay, so how do we make

06:51.900 --> 06:57.340
sense of things and put them together? The human ecosystem. I'm going to go

06:57.340 --> 07:04.140
over this in several slides. We take energy, invent things, combine it with

07:04.140 --> 07:09.660
materials, develop products, represent these in our economic system by

07:09.660 --> 07:16.500
dollars, Canadian or US or others. And we do this all to generate the same

07:16.500 --> 07:21.180
emotional states of our ancestors and the whole thing creates pollution. I'm

07:21.180 --> 07:27.260
going to first talk about the biophysical side of this. So energy is vital in

07:27.260 --> 07:33.580
nature. Nothing in nature moves without energy and energy is also vital in human

07:33.580 --> 07:39.620
systems. Every single good or service in our global economic system that results

07:39.620 --> 07:46.540
in economic growth requires energy to invent, to mine, to create, to manufacture,

07:46.580 --> 07:52.100
to package, to deliver, to maintain, to repair, to run, to dispose of. There is

07:52.100 --> 07:58.580
not a single thing that contributes to GDP that doesn't require energy. I don't

07:58.580 --> 08:03.100
know about Canada, but in the United States, the average household has over 60

08:03.100 --> 08:08.660
devices plugged in all the time, even if they're not running. And we take this

08:08.660 --> 08:14.820
for granted. We don't see the sea of energy that we are swimming in. This is a

08:14.820 --> 08:21.100
picture of me on my farm here in Wisconsin. That's a picture of my horse who

08:21.100 --> 08:26.260
does the work of about one horse, which is 10 times more work than I can do.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.980
That's my utility vehicle with a little bit of gasoline can do the work of 45

08:30.980 --> 08:36.180
horses. And that's my truck with some diesel fuel can do the work of 300

08:36.300 --> 08:42.980
horses. The next time you're taking a flight to Toronto or Vancouver, imagine

08:42.980 --> 08:50.180
100,000 horses invisibly pulling that jet across the sky. This is the power and

08:50.180 --> 08:56.460
the benefit that we get from this ancient carbon, which is oil. One barrel of

08:56.460 --> 09:03.460
oil has 5.7 million British thermal units worth of energy, which equates to

09:03.460 --> 09:09.820
around 1700 kilowatt hours worth of work potential compared to about 0.6

09:09.820 --> 09:15.500
kilowatt hours in human daily work output. And after you do the math, that's

09:15.500 --> 09:20.620
around four and a half years of physical human labor is in every barrel of oil.

09:21.180 --> 09:28.420
We use in the global economy about 100 million barrel of oil equivalents of coal

09:28.420 --> 09:34.220
oil and natural gas every year, which means we effectively have armies of

09:34.220 --> 09:40.660
fossil helpers to the tune of 400 or 500 billion human equivalents compared to

09:40.660 --> 09:48.220
around 4 to 5 billion actual human workers. So what this has done is underpin the

09:48.220 --> 09:53.100
story of industrialization, where humans have replaced things we used to do

09:53.100 --> 09:59.020
manually or with draft horses by adding machines. And those machines and various

09:59.020 --> 10:05.380
technologies are all powered by energy, mostly fossil energy. And what this has

10:05.380 --> 10:11.260
done is raised our profits and our incomes and the size of the human

10:11.260 --> 10:16.140
enterprise. Here's an example of something in Wisconsin. We still are the dairy

10:16.140 --> 10:23.460
state. We have cows. The benefits that we get massively increase our profits and

10:23.460 --> 10:29.820
our wages. A person milking a cow spends around 30 minutes manually and makes

10:29.820 --> 10:35.500
around $5 an hour. If you add an automated system, you're adding 180 times

10:35.500 --> 10:41.100
more energy with the technology, but you're boosting the profits or the wages by

10:41.100 --> 10:47.420
almost four times to $20 per hour. Then you can even take it further and add a

10:47.420 --> 10:52.060
fully automated milking machine, which is 400 times more energy than an

10:52.100 --> 10:58.220
individual human. And that boosts the profit to around $25 an hour. What's

10:58.220 --> 11:05.100
really important and one of the key takeaways from this presentation is as

11:05.100 --> 11:12.860
energy prices increase, very energy heavy processes like aircraft or aluminum

11:12.860 --> 11:18.780
smelting, many mining things, not only become less profitable, but become

11:18.820 --> 11:25.860
unprofitable. The left panel here, the blue, orange and gray are what happens to

11:25.860 --> 11:31.700
the hand milking if prices increase, nothing. The middle example shows if

11:31.700 --> 11:37.100
prices go from five cents in blue to 10 cents in orange to 15 cents a kilowatt

11:37.100 --> 11:43.180
hour in gray, there's a reduction in the profits. But as you'll see in the right

11:43.180 --> 11:48.300
panel here and a doubling of energy prices from five cents to 10 cents,

11:48.340 --> 11:55.060
there's a massive drop in the heavy industry processes. And if we triple,

11:55.060 --> 11:59.940
we're now operating at a loss. And this was started to see last year because of

11:59.940 --> 12:05.300
the Ukraine war in Europe as natural gas prices spiked. Our economies are

12:05.300 --> 12:10.460
incredibly sensitive to increases in the main input to our current global

12:10.460 --> 12:15.020
enterprise, which is energy. So because of this industrialization, we have

12:15.020 --> 12:20.700
higher wages, higher profits, lower price stuff, and economic growth for more

12:20.700 --> 12:25.820
people. We actually do have more people. In the last few hundred years, we've

12:25.820 --> 12:31.580
gone from a billion people to eight billion people alive today. But even more

12:31.580 --> 12:37.420
dramatic is the goods and services available per person. The average human

12:37.420 --> 12:42.940
today is 14 times materially wealthier than the average person 200 years ago.

12:43.180 --> 12:47.460
And the average person in the United States is 50 times as wealthy as the

12:47.460 --> 12:52.340
average human was 200 years ago. This doesn't account for inequalities and

12:52.340 --> 12:58.420
such. This is just geometric arithmetic average. If you combine these two

12:58.420 --> 13:03.300
stats, the human economy measured by the number of people times the average

13:03.540 --> 13:08.980
goods and service consumption of those people is a thousand times bigger than

13:08.980 --> 13:15.540
it was in the year 1500. But in our economic schools, our business schools

13:15.580 --> 13:21.540
at McGill University, we don't teach that energy is important. We teach that

13:21.580 --> 13:29.780
energy is its cost share of an input to a process. So $1,000 worth of oil is

13:29.820 --> 13:35.660
equal to our economy as $1,000 worth of pencils or bike helmets or water bottles

13:35.660 --> 13:41.300
or cupcakes. So in effect, our culture has become energy blind. This is a

13:41.300 --> 13:46.380
circular economy graph that's shown in beginnings, econ 101 classes that show

13:46.380 --> 13:52.420
that people demand things, corporations and the market produce the things. And

13:52.420 --> 13:58.020
there's this virtuous cycle. And that's how the economy goes forward. This

13:58.020 --> 14:02.620
cycle neglects the source of the majority of the inputs, which is the

14:03.220 --> 14:09.580
non-renewable energy and materials. And it neglects the sink, which is the carbon

14:09.780 --> 14:15.660
and other waste capacities of our planet. So our current economic system conflates

14:15.660 --> 14:21.140
the dollar value of energy with the work value. And we largely don't include the

14:21.140 --> 14:27.820
cost of pollution at all. We are energy blind. And if you look at what we are

14:27.820 --> 14:34.260
doing, we are drawing down ancient carbon millions of times faster than it was

14:34.260 --> 14:39.980
geologically sequestered and trickle charged by the son of ancient phytoplankton

14:39.980 --> 14:45.860
and algae and diatoms. So we are alive during what one day may be referred to

14:45.860 --> 14:51.100
as the carbon pulse. And we have 300,000 year history as a species and it might

14:51.100 --> 14:56.660
look like this. Zooming in on a 20,000 year horizon, the carbon pulse might

14:56.660 --> 15:01.300
look like this of all the coal, oil and natural gas stacked on top of each other.

15:01.900 --> 15:07.620
Out of 1000 year period, it might look like this. And we are near the top of

15:07.620 --> 15:12.580
this carbon pulse. We're somewhere between the yellow star and the red star.

15:12.860 --> 15:17.700
Because energy is so important and vital from an economic perspective, we hope

15:17.700 --> 15:22.340
we're near the white, the yellow star, because that means we have more decades

15:22.340 --> 15:27.940
ahead of this cheap fossil armies to support our technology and consumption.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.980
From a biosphere climate, which I'm going to talk about a little later

15:31.980 --> 15:36.300
standpoint, we hope we're at the red star because we've been emitting this

15:37.020 --> 15:42.660
this warming effect, a thermal blanket from adding this ancient carbon so fast

15:42.660 --> 15:48.020
to the atmosphere that we don't want to continue to do that. But this carbon

15:48.020 --> 15:55.220
that we've taken for granted is finite. We take out the best first, then we get

15:55.220 --> 16:01.060
complicated tools to get more. But it is finite and depleting quite rapidly.

16:01.100 --> 16:07.340
The graph on the left shows a story of humans overcoming energy depletion

16:07.340 --> 16:12.540
with technology. The United States peaked in oil production in 1970, decline,

16:12.860 --> 16:18.220
decline for 40 years, and then we discovered how to frack and technology

16:18.220 --> 16:24.780
overcame depletion. Well, a different story is using the exact same data and

16:24.820 --> 16:30.180
charts, but broken out by geological province. The green shows the lower

16:30.460 --> 16:36.660
48 states, the conventional oil. The orange shows Alaska, which is separated

16:36.660 --> 16:42.340
from the United States by Canada. It's not even a contiguous part of our

16:42.340 --> 16:47.020
country. The blue is offshore oil. It's not on the land. It's underneath the

16:47.020 --> 16:53.260
Gulf of Mexico. And this red is what has been fracked, the light tight oil.

16:53.700 --> 16:58.180
The light tight oil depletes at 80% in the first 18 months, and you have to

16:58.260 --> 17:04.460
continue to drill to find more. And there's nothing left after the tight

17:04.460 --> 17:08.940
oil. This is the source rock for where all the other oil originated.

17:09.660 --> 17:15.740
And what ends up happening is, I'll go through this really quickly, the gray

17:15.740 --> 17:22.460
here shows the decline rate of all the oil wells drilled in the United

17:22.460 --> 17:27.540
States before 2014. The orange shows the decline rate, and it's a little bit

17:27.540 --> 17:35.140
steeper for 2014, all the way up to 2019 in the red. And you can see every year

17:35.140 --> 17:38.900
we add more and more wells, and the United States has drilled more wells

17:38.900 --> 17:43.540
than the rest of the world combined, and the decline rate becomes steeper. So

17:43.540 --> 17:49.660
we are having to run faster and faster in place just to stay in place. So what

17:49.660 --> 17:56.820
ends up happening is technology, in the case of shale oil, acts as a larger

17:56.820 --> 18:01.540
straw. Largely the same amount of original oil is there, but we're just

18:01.540 --> 18:06.420
getting it out faster and becoming that much closer to the slurping sound,

18:06.540 --> 18:10.940
which we hear at the end of the milkshake. Yes, new technology does

18:10.980 --> 18:15.940
access some resources that we wouldn't have been able to, but largely it just

18:15.940 --> 18:20.620
takes things out faster than we would have got without technology. What

18:20.620 --> 18:25.980
about so-called renewable energy? So one of the important concepts of energy

18:25.980 --> 18:32.900
blindness is the fact that all energy is not fungible. It's not equal. It's not

18:32.900 --> 18:37.340
interchangeable. So here are a few points on renewable energy. First of all,

18:37.340 --> 18:44.460
renewable energy isn't. It's a meme. Renewable energy is rebuildable. Oak

18:44.460 --> 18:50.620
tree is renewable. A chicken is renewable. As long as we find an acorn or a male

18:50.620 --> 18:55.900
and female chicken to make an egg, they are renewable. Wind turbines, solar

18:55.900 --> 19:02.820
panels, etc. are complicated machinery with polysilicon and a global supply

19:02.820 --> 19:07.260
chain. They are no more renewable than a pickup truck. The sun and the wind are

19:07.260 --> 19:12.140
renewable, but the devices we use to make them are not. Another point is renewable

19:12.140 --> 19:16.980
energy produces electricity, but only 20% of global energy use at the present

19:16.980 --> 19:20.820
moment is electric. There are lots of things that because of the energy

19:20.820 --> 19:25.940
density don't run on electricity. They could in the future, but only at a much

19:25.940 --> 19:30.540
higher cost. And I showed you early the impact of profits and viability from a

19:30.540 --> 19:39.380
higher cost. There is also all of our plans for a techno utopia future kind

19:39.380 --> 19:44.460
of wave away the fact that we've been growing, growing, growing our energy every

19:44.460 --> 19:48.500
single year with the exception of recessions for the last 100 years. This

19:48.500 --> 19:53.100
at some point in the near future will change. And what will renewable energy

19:53.100 --> 19:59.260
and other technology do on the downslope of the carbon pulse? Once these 500

19:59.260 --> 20:06.020
billion fossil workers start to retire. Also higher full system cost means lower

20:06.020 --> 20:11.060
economic benefits. As I said before, there's a difference between a technology

20:11.060 --> 20:17.300
being viable and being affordable and scalable. Also, there are around 6000

20:17.300 --> 20:23.420
other products that are generated from oil and natural gas. And, you know, we

20:23.420 --> 20:28.900
have asphalt and plastic and medicines and tires and all kinds of medical

20:28.900 --> 20:34.300
devices, etc. These all come from oil. So if we stopped using oil, we would need

20:34.300 --> 20:40.140
to find alternatives for many of these 6000 inputs that are byproducts of our

20:40.140 --> 20:46.620
current barrel of oil. So far, the energy transition has not been. It's been more

20:46.620 --> 20:53.300
of an energy addition. If you look at the last 200 years of human energy use, the

20:53.300 --> 20:58.980
green is biomass, the brown is coal, the black is oil, the dark blue is gas,

20:59.020 --> 21:05.020
nuclear, etc. Solar and wind end up being about two and a half percent of final

21:05.020 --> 21:09.540
consumption. They are growing quite rapidly, but in an absolute and they're

21:09.580 --> 21:15.460
growing faster than fossil fuels. But on an absolute basis, globally fossil

21:15.460 --> 21:20.220
fuels are still growing. They've grown 55 percent in the last 15 years. So far,

21:20.220 --> 21:24.900
there has not been a green revolution, only a green addition. And by the way,

21:24.900 --> 21:32.300
we are now using more biomass shown in green here than we were in the year 1850,

21:32.300 --> 21:38.860
which was before we started using fossil fuels. Lastly, it is true that

21:38.860 --> 21:46.460
renewable energy is much more efficient than coal or oil in various processes.

21:46.780 --> 21:53.300
However, society doesn't maximize energy use or maximize efficiency. We

21:53.300 --> 21:59.580
maximize power, which is energy use per unit time that creates work. This is

21:59.580 --> 22:03.900
called the fourth law of thermodynamics, which is the maximum power principle,

22:04.220 --> 22:09.740
which is we operate in nature at intermediate states between efficiency

22:09.780 --> 22:14.780
and full resource use. And usually that's at an intermediate state. And the

22:14.780 --> 22:20.900
implications for this is that this is an average load at three different times

22:20.900 --> 22:27.740
during the year. This is what our societal demands require. And this is what

22:27.740 --> 22:31.340
we work during the day and there's a spike and then we go to sleep at night,

22:31.340 --> 22:35.780
but we still have a lot of baseline things that are going. But society

22:35.780 --> 22:41.540
cares about creating this graph. And the best thing for that is potential

22:41.540 --> 22:45.580
energy that is stored that we can burn at a flick of a switch and meet these

22:45.580 --> 22:51.540
demand curves. We can use solar and wind better than we are doing now, but

22:51.540 --> 22:56.380
it's going to look like a much different society. Okay, briefly on materials,

22:56.820 --> 23:05.500
energy and GDP are 99% correlated globally. Materials and GDP are 100%

23:05.500 --> 23:11.300
correlated. So if you look at the red line here is global GDP. The purple line

23:11.300 --> 23:15.580
is the material footprint, which is a composite of energy and materials. And

23:15.580 --> 23:19.780
you can see they're incredibly tightly linked. We are growing renewable

23:19.780 --> 23:23.900
energy faster than we're growing fossil fuels, which is why the global CO2

23:23.940 --> 23:30.340
continues to increase, but increases at a lower rate than energy and GDP, but

23:30.340 --> 23:36.100
they're very tightly linked. The problem is, is as we decarbonize, we're going

23:36.100 --> 23:43.380
to have to rematerialize because renewable energy is very copper, metal,

23:43.580 --> 23:49.940
rare earth dependent. Another issue is much of these materials like cobalt

23:49.940 --> 23:54.020
and nickel and lithium and copper are found in countries that are in the

23:54.020 --> 23:58.820
global south. They are poorer material countries. They already have civil

23:58.940 --> 24:03.580
strife and they're going to be experiencing higher wet bulb temperatures

24:03.860 --> 24:09.500
and chaos and uncertainty from a warming climate. This is a real problem for

24:09.500 --> 24:16.980
the scaling of the current net zero EV plans. This graph shows the blue lines

24:16.980 --> 24:22.500
are the production of the country of Chile of copper and the red line are the

24:22.500 --> 24:29.980
consumption of energy. In the United States, we used to have 20% ore grade in

24:29.980 --> 24:36.860
the 19th century that went down to 2% ore grade and now is two tenths of 1%. So

24:36.860 --> 24:41.700
we have to get more and more rock and overburden to get the same amount of

24:41.700 --> 24:47.940
copper. The point here is that even in materials and in every aspect of society,

24:47.980 --> 24:52.300
everything we do will become more expensive if we can't reduce the energy

24:52.300 --> 24:57.020
consumption of various processes faster than energy prices grow. Okay, what

24:57.020 --> 25:01.980
about technology? How does technology fit into this? Well, every unit of GDP has

25:01.980 --> 25:07.740
three things in common, energy, materials and information or the technology.

25:08.060 --> 25:14.220
There are no exceptions. So there are two types of technology. The first type is

25:14.260 --> 25:22.180
ways to make energy use more efficient or a new energy technology like a better

25:22.180 --> 25:30.500
solar panel. The other type of technology type two is creating devices that replace

25:30.500 --> 25:36.540
what humans used to do manually or new inventions that our prior ancestors never

25:36.540 --> 25:41.620
had access to. The vast majority of technology in our world today is of this

25:41.620 --> 25:47.140
type two, which ends up increasing the baseline for more energy requirement the

25:47.140 --> 25:55.780
following year. So this graph shows that humans get better at inventions and we

25:55.780 --> 26:02.140
get more efficient in our energy use over time, around 1.2% a year more

26:02.140 --> 26:07.100
efficient over the last 200 years. However, during that same time, this is

26:07.100 --> 26:15.220
another color chart showing the energy stack of various energies over the last

26:15.220 --> 26:21.820
200 years. We continue to grow our total energy. In fact, energy efficiency has

26:21.820 --> 26:28.820
increased 36% in the last 35 years. But during that time, our energy consumption

26:29.060 --> 26:35.380
has increased 63%. This is called the rebound effect or Jevons paradox that as

26:35.380 --> 26:40.340
we make more profits because we got more efficient, we funnel those profits back

26:40.340 --> 26:46.420
into economic growth, which is a draw on energy. What about money? Money is what

26:46.420 --> 26:51.540
makes the world go round, right? Well, money is actually a claim on energy. When

26:51.620 --> 26:59.020
you spend your loony at Tim Hortons or any other thing in our daily lives, every

26:59.020 --> 27:05.140
time we spend something, it's a call on energy. Economic textbooks tell us that

27:05.140 --> 27:11.780
money is lent out from existing capital at banks. This is incorrect. The reality is

27:11.780 --> 27:17.140
is that the vast majority of money is lent into existence. Banks don't lend

27:17.140 --> 27:23.020
money. They create it. And when they create it, the financial system is in

27:23.020 --> 27:28.020
balance. There's the same amount of assets and liabilities. But the bio

27:28.020 --> 27:33.580
physical world is not because when 10 million Canadian dollars come into the

27:33.580 --> 27:39.460
system from a bank, the same amount of timber or moose or copper or dolphins or

27:39.460 --> 27:47.340
trees exist. So here's a conceptual showing from time from left to right

27:47.700 --> 27:54.300
that we had sustainable flows of the biogeochemical use of nature, the soil,

27:54.300 --> 28:01.300
the sun and the wind. And in around the 1700s, we hit a capacity on that. There's

28:01.300 --> 28:06.580
a different sort of curve, which is a Gaussian or normal curve, which is for

28:06.620 --> 28:11.620
finite resources. And we started to access things like oil and copper and

28:11.620 --> 28:15.620
coal. These were buried underground, but they're finite. And we started to add

28:15.620 --> 28:19.900
them to our economic system. But there will be a peak and a decline of these

28:19.900 --> 28:25.540
like their will on the carbon pulse. Overlaid on all that is a monetary thing,

28:25.540 --> 28:30.540
which is a cultural creation by our species that we create monetary markers

28:30.540 --> 28:35.780
for all this stuff. And if you put all these three things together, they create

28:35.780 --> 28:40.220
this little graphic. And with access to these, this ancient sunlight, which is

28:40.460 --> 28:45.620
indistinguishable from magic on human time scales, our economic system grew so

28:45.620 --> 28:50.020
fast and large that land no longer explained our wealth. And gradually,

28:50.020 --> 28:54.740
the economics profession parsed our explanations into capital and labor.

28:55.380 --> 29:01.300
And using the social construct of credit, which is largely run by central banks

29:01.300 --> 29:06.460
in the world right now, we pulled resource consumption forward in time. Now

29:06.460 --> 29:12.020
our world views our future and our culture through a financial lens. We have

29:12.020 --> 29:16.580
not only financialized the human experience, but also the explanation of

29:16.580 --> 29:22.580
it. Okay, that's the energy material tech part of the story. Now, what about

29:22.580 --> 29:28.100
the environment? What about the pollution that comes from our economic system?

29:29.100 --> 29:34.380
This could be its own two hour talk, but I'll just give the highlights right

29:34.380 --> 29:40.140
here. It's not just climate, but there are many aspects that the human system

29:40.140 --> 29:47.580
is affecting the natural world. This shows the last 400,000 years of CO2 in

29:47.580 --> 29:51.860
the atmosphere shown in green, global temperatures shown in the middle panel

29:51.860 --> 29:58.100
in red, and sea level rise shown in the bottom in blue. We have already had

29:58.100 --> 30:03.580
400 feet of sea level rise in the last 20,000 years, and we are in uncharted

30:03.580 --> 30:10.100
territories from any time before the emion. We are now going into a warmer

30:10.100 --> 30:15.020
period than at any time when humans lived on this planet. And I could argue

30:15.020 --> 30:20.580
that humans are changing climate today, but climate change actually caused

30:20.620 --> 30:26.900
humans. The red chart in the bottom is expanded here in the last 20,000 years.

30:27.900 --> 30:34.060
Around 15,000 years ago, the climate warmed and stabilized, unbelievably

30:34.060 --> 30:38.580
stable for the last 10,000 years, which is when we expanded around the world

30:38.580 --> 30:43.780
with agriculture and settlements and hierarchy and technology, etc. And now

30:43.780 --> 30:48.140
we're moving out of that stable band into the unknown. The only known is

30:48.140 --> 30:53.580
it's barring a nuclear holocaust. It's likely to be warmer to much warmer.

30:53.780 --> 31:00.340
So this carbon pulse that we are living through, yet it's invisible to us, is

31:00.340 --> 31:07.060
really distinctly important because many, most of the prior mass and many

31:07.060 --> 31:13.820
extinctions were correlated with carbon pulses. The blue spikes here show the

31:13.820 --> 31:18.500
percentage of the genus level extinctions on Earth over the last

31:18.500 --> 31:24.780
300 million years. And the magenta bars are when there were large outgassings

31:24.780 --> 31:32.220
of volcanic provinces that were near term pulses of carbon. And this ended up

31:32.220 --> 31:38.100
being disastrous for species on the planet. Unlike most mass extinctions

31:38.100 --> 31:43.780
linked to volcanic pulses, our pulse is not from volcanoes, but from Volkswagen's

31:43.820 --> 31:50.340
and vacations and deforestation and other things. This is a monthly graph of

31:50.340 --> 31:55.860
the temperature anomaly from the pre-industrial baseline. You can see

31:55.860 --> 32:04.700
that many of the hottest divergences are this year, 2024. One could argue that

32:04.700 --> 32:08.860
this would be the coolest year of the rest of your lives. I'm not sure that's

32:08.860 --> 32:15.220
entirely valid because this is an El Nino year, but you can see that the heat

32:15.260 --> 32:21.420
is on. Part of the climate discussion that is not often discussed is the impact

32:21.420 --> 32:25.780
on oceans and there are many, many ocean risks. There's ocean acidification.

32:26.180 --> 32:34.380
There is the erosion of coastlines since the sea level is going to rise as the

32:34.420 --> 32:41.660
glacier and ice melts. There's overfishing. There is the loss of some calcium

32:41.660 --> 32:47.580
carbonate in shells. There's the impact on food webs. Ocean oxygen content is

32:47.580 --> 32:54.820
already declined by 2% and 20% in the shallows. There are many, the AMOC, the

32:54.820 --> 32:58.980
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, has

32:58.980 --> 33:05.340
slowed already 15%. This is all because the oceans are absorbing 90% of the

33:05.340 --> 33:12.300
heat from the extra thermal warming from fossil fuels. Beyond climate itself

33:12.340 --> 33:16.380
and climate is the key because it affects all the other things I'm talking

33:16.380 --> 33:21.140
about, we neglect our impact on the other 10 million species we share this

33:21.140 --> 33:27.620
planet with, what I refer to as the real stock market. Since I was born, we have

33:27.620 --> 33:34.340
lost almost 70% of the animal populations on this planet and it's

33:34.340 --> 33:38.460
probably worse than that because that's status is six years old. We don't see

33:38.460 --> 33:45.100
that that much in North America because we've only lost 25% here, but in Asia

33:45.100 --> 33:51.100
and Latin and South America, it's much more extreme. This chart shows on the

33:51.100 --> 33:57.780
left the estimated biomass of wild animals 100,000 years ago relative to

33:57.780 --> 34:04.220
the orange of wild animals today, relative to the light pink, which is our

34:04.220 --> 34:10.580
cows, pigs and sheep and humans. So humans in our livestock now outweigh wild

34:10.580 --> 34:16.260
mammals at a ratio of 50 to 1. It's not only animals, insects are declining at

34:16.260 --> 34:22.260
1 to 2% a year in biomass. This is trillions of tiny robots doing tasks

34:22.260 --> 34:27.300
humans couldn't do without them that we take for granted. Birds eat insects.

34:27.580 --> 34:32.380
Birds are also declining. These are Canadian statistics here showing the

34:32.380 --> 34:38.260
percentage decline of various types of birds. One thing that's increasingly in

34:38.260 --> 34:43.540
the media is the impact not only of plastics like plastic bottles and the

34:43.580 --> 34:49.500
fact that plastic now outweighs all animals on earth and will eventually

34:49.500 --> 34:54.220
outweigh all the fish in the ocean, but microplastics. There's something called

34:54.220 --> 34:59.260
PFAS, which is a forever chemical. We don't, scientists don't really understand

34:59.500 --> 35:05.780
the endocrine disrupting impacts. However, sperm count in humans and in other

35:05.780 --> 35:10.980
animals is declining at an accelerated pace globally. Sperm count is dropping at

35:10.980 --> 35:17.580
around 2.5% a year. Right now, one couple in seven cannot have a baby because

35:17.580 --> 35:22.660
of lack of sperm motility. And that's shocking. But what's even more shocking

35:22.660 --> 35:27.220
is 20 years ago, it was zero in seven. And there are some estimates by 2050

35:27.220 --> 35:32.300
under current trends that we won't be able to have babies. Okay, that's a

35:32.300 --> 35:36.580
pretty rugged little summary I went through there. And it's as many times as I

35:36.580 --> 35:40.700
say it, I still get kind of a pit in my stomach as I'm sharing this with

35:40.700 --> 35:45.340
strangers online, because many of you are aware of those things. But if you

35:45.340 --> 35:49.660
haven't heard those things before, it can feel like a punch to the gut. And I

35:49.660 --> 35:55.460
will just empathize with you that that is a normal, totally acceptable reaction.

35:55.500 --> 36:00.020
And if that is your reaction, I offer you a brief apology, but these are the

36:00.020 --> 36:03.340
times we're alive. This is why I'm sharing this stuff, because I think most

36:03.340 --> 36:08.060
people, more people need to understand and engage with these issues. Okay, let's

36:08.060 --> 36:13.940
moving on to the core driver of this stuff, which is the human human behavior,

36:14.300 --> 36:21.620
starting with our feelings. So we are related to every single other creature

36:21.620 --> 36:27.380
on earth. We share a common universal ancestor. If you look on the tree of

36:27.380 --> 36:33.100
life, there's humans way down here in the corner. We're 99.9% related to all

36:33.100 --> 36:38.460
other humans, including Canadians, were 98% related to other apes, bonobos and

36:38.460 --> 36:44.940
chimpanzees, 90% related to cats, 85% genetically related to mice, 80% to

36:44.940 --> 36:51.740
cows, 60% to fruit flies, 60% to chickens, and we are 50% genetically related to

36:51.740 --> 36:56.300
mushrooms. We are kin with everything else on this blue green earth. And we

36:56.300 --> 37:01.940
often forget that. We go through our life, like other biological organisms,

37:01.940 --> 37:08.260
trying to match the same emotional states of our successful ancestors. So

37:08.260 --> 37:14.020
bagging a gazelle on the Pleistocene savanna. Today we make a stock trade or

37:14.020 --> 37:21.620
make a Bitcoin profit and with the same areas in our brain light up. Humans are

37:21.620 --> 37:27.540
intensely social and status conscious. This has to do with the concept of sexual

37:27.580 --> 37:34.980
selection in nature, which in the case of a peacock, this giant ornate tail has

37:34.980 --> 37:41.260
three fitness hits to the peacock. It is a cost of all its minerals and

37:41.260 --> 37:46.580
calories going to this tail. It makes it more apparent and obvious to a predator

37:46.580 --> 37:51.300
and if a predator chase it, it's harder to get away. All three of those were

37:51.300 --> 37:56.900
overcome by the preference from the female peacock for such a display. And

37:56.980 --> 38:01.060
are we that different than this? This picture here shows Tiger Woods, who's a

38:01.060 --> 38:06.740
billionaire, his yacht pulling into a marina where his ex-wife's boyfriend's

38:06.740 --> 38:13.220
yacht is 10 feet longer than his. So we constantly compare ourselves to others

38:13.220 --> 38:21.300
at various scales, planet wide. We also have neural circuitry that hijacks our

38:21.300 --> 38:26.500
ancestral reward system and tricks us into thinking that the things we're

38:26.500 --> 38:32.020
doing are actually good for us and good for our status and our respect in our

38:32.020 --> 38:37.860
tribe. For instance, some students may be watching this presentation, might play

38:37.860 --> 38:45.380
Overwatch or some video game and their brains feel like they're bagging a

38:45.380 --> 38:49.940
gazelle for their tribe, but they're actually sitting in a couch in their mom's

38:49.940 --> 38:55.060
basement accessing a coal-fired server. The dopamine superhighway is really

38:55.060 --> 38:59.700
central to planetary overshoot and our consumption because what ends up

38:59.700 --> 39:04.580
happening, shown in this graph, there's academic research reference on the

39:04.580 --> 39:10.660
bottom, that we get the signal and the signal causes the behavior and we do

39:10.660 --> 39:15.380
the work and then we get the reward. We don't get the dopamine when the reward

39:15.380 --> 39:20.340
happens, but before it's the anticipation of reward. But what ends up

39:20.340 --> 39:25.060
happening in our culture is energy has become so cheap and we have such a

39:25.060 --> 39:30.100
smorgasbord of consumption that our work and our behavior is disconnected from

39:30.100 --> 39:34.020
the reward because we get reward all over the place all the time without doing

39:34.020 --> 39:39.860
the work. So we end up in a situation and this is a picture of my storage shed

39:40.580 --> 39:47.220
where the ghost of dopamine past ends up buying things constantly and the

39:47.220 --> 39:53.220
wanting of things ends up being a more powerful driver of our behavior than

39:53.220 --> 39:57.220
the having of them. All of you go home this weekend and look in your

39:57.220 --> 40:02.660
garage, in your storage shed, etc. We got short-term dopamine hits for those

40:02.660 --> 40:07.540
purchases, but they weren't sustainable and we had to buy more to feel the

40:07.540 --> 40:13.300
same way at some point in the future. So important point, our brains are flow-based,

40:13.860 --> 40:19.380
but our world, our economic system is stock-based and we're driving down the

40:19.380 --> 40:25.460
stocks of non-reluable energy and resources millions of times faster than

40:25.460 --> 40:30.500
they were built up in order to get ephemeral dopamine. In effect, we're

40:30.500 --> 40:35.940
turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight into microliters of neurotransmitters.

40:35.940 --> 40:42.100
We also have different belief systems and the human brain can utter millions of times

40:43.140 --> 40:49.460
more sentences than can exist in biophysical reality. So the virtual world in our minds

40:50.500 --> 40:56.420
is really more powerful than our biophysical reality and this is why science in the academy

40:56.900 --> 41:04.100
are hopefully can play a vital role in our path going forward because science is

41:04.100 --> 41:10.900
a light in the dark and can distinguish fantasy from reality. It's the best tool that we have.

41:12.420 --> 41:20.180
We are incredibly in-group and out-group oriented. We quickly and strongly form groups and we defend

41:20.180 --> 41:25.620
and support our group and tend to ostracize and root against others. Groups could be a few people

41:25.620 --> 41:31.860
or they could be nation-state size. Shown here is Canada beating the U.S. in hockey.

41:33.060 --> 41:41.380
We are very social. We're ultra-social so our behaviors are plastic but we copy other humans

41:41.380 --> 41:47.620
and this is good news because cultural evolution happens at lightning speed versus biological

41:47.620 --> 41:55.460
evolution. Okay so those are the the primary drivers of the human ecosystem. How do those

41:55.460 --> 42:00.980
fit together? How does the whole system fit together into a narrative that explains our

42:00.980 --> 42:07.780
current reality? I'm sure you've seen starlings in nature. Starlings follow three simple rules.

42:07.780 --> 42:14.500
Do what your neighbor does. Don't get too close and fly towards the center. Those three simple

42:14.500 --> 42:21.460
rules result in this emergent behavior of these beautiful murmurations of birds in the sky that

42:21.460 --> 42:27.620
look like they're choreographed but they're not. It's an emergent property. Humans do something

42:27.620 --> 42:34.260
similar. In our current world importantly this is not the way that it always was and it's not the

42:34.260 --> 42:41.860
way that it has to be in the future but we coordinate in our families, in our small businesses,

42:41.860 --> 42:49.940
in our corporations, even as entire nations to acquire financial surplus which is linked to energy.

42:49.940 --> 42:56.420
We spend the surplus and we pursue culturally accepted behaviors. The emergent property of that

42:56.420 --> 43:06.820
is this vast interconnected material and energy hungry system of human habitation and commerce

43:06.900 --> 43:13.300
across the planet. If you look at this, the brake lights and the headlights in this aerial view of a

43:13.300 --> 43:20.900
city are not biophysically too dissimilar than the veins in the arteries of a human body and the

43:20.900 --> 43:26.820
hemoglobin that is being passed through these veins and arteries is gasoline and diesel fuel

43:26.820 --> 43:33.540
from oil and we have a global transport system. This is the airline routes through the earth.

43:34.420 --> 43:40.740
So our culture keeps score of this system by gross domestic product. If you add up all the

43:40.740 --> 43:49.620
countries in the world it's gross world product. Well GWP given the 99% correlation between energy

43:49.620 --> 43:59.460
and GDP could rightly be named gross world burning because energy and GDP are and will remain tightly

43:59.460 --> 44:07.700
linked. So my economic research, my academic research has likened human culture to an energy

44:07.700 --> 44:16.500
dissipating structure, a mindless superorganism akin to a blind hungry amoeba. So human society

44:16.500 --> 44:23.860
has a metabolism and metabolism has a waste product in the form of CO2 and other things.

44:24.580 --> 44:31.940
So the global north has been trying to go to renewable energy, getting rid of coal although

44:31.940 --> 44:37.940
we're still using natural gas, but the developing world especially China and India are growing

44:37.940 --> 44:45.300
as much energy as they can. So since the 2015 Paris Agreement we actually have a global increase

44:45.300 --> 44:51.860
in coal use. China is building six times more new coal plants. India plans to double their coal

44:51.860 --> 44:56.740
production. They are aware of climate. India is going to be one of the most susceptible countries

44:56.740 --> 45:00.900
to climate. The reason they're doubling their coal is because it's the cheapest thing that they can

45:00.900 --> 45:07.620
do and they need more air conditioning and fans. So trying to mitigate climate change within our

45:07.620 --> 45:14.580
existing economic structure is like arguing with a forest fire. This is an uncomfortable conclusion

45:15.380 --> 45:21.300
but it's one that I've come to believe. There is no one driving the bus of our economic system,

45:21.300 --> 45:29.220
not politicians, not billionaires, not the rich and powerful. The market is pulling us forward

45:29.220 --> 45:34.980
and we have outsourced our wisdom and decision making to the financial markets. So this is kind

45:34.980 --> 45:42.020
of a metaphor from Lord of the Rings, the Tower of Sauron. I've graphically shown here the history

45:42.020 --> 45:49.620
of humans and technology. Shown in the bottom is we left our hunter-gatherer ancestry and started

45:49.620 --> 45:56.260
to produce agriculture which created agricultural surplus which we could trade. We had hierarchy

45:56.260 --> 46:02.980
then. We had mayors and kings and artisans and warriors and accountants and then a couple hundred

46:02.980 --> 46:10.020
years ago we accessed the power in flammable fossils and then we turbocharged this faster by

46:10.580 --> 46:16.420
creating fiat currency that were markers for real things and we accelerated the whole thing

46:16.500 --> 46:23.620
and now we're using artificial intelligence to make all these processes even faster and this whole

46:23.620 --> 46:32.740
thing is this Borg or this Eye of Sauron pulling this economic system forward and it's my opinion

46:32.740 --> 46:38.420
and there's ample evidence in the last few months to underpin this is under our current

46:38.420 --> 46:45.540
economic aspirations and goals which are of course fluid in our lifetimes. Artificial intelligence

46:45.540 --> 46:52.180
is going to much like shale fracking act as a larger draw on the energy in the environment and

46:52.180 --> 46:57.940
that doesn't include it doesn't focus only on how much energy the servers are. Today a news story

46:57.940 --> 47:03.700
came out that said that just the data servers alone in the United States are going to use as much

47:03.700 --> 47:11.700
energy between now and 2030 as 150 million electric vehicles. That's not the point. The point is that

47:11.780 --> 47:16.660
AI is going to make energy extraction. It's going to make alternative energy. It's going to make

47:16.660 --> 47:23.380
all the processes in our world more efficient potentially and all of that is going to accelerate

47:23.380 --> 47:28.260
impact on the environment. Okay we're getting nearer to the conclusions of this part one.

47:29.140 --> 47:32.740
Under the framing that I presented here what is not likely to happen?

47:33.380 --> 47:37.780
Growing the economy and mitigating climate change and the six mass extinction.

47:38.580 --> 47:43.860
Growing the economy by replacing fossil fuels with renewables we're actually adding.

47:44.740 --> 47:51.460
Culture en masse choosing to leave fossil carbon in the ground and governments embracing limits

47:51.460 --> 47:57.940
to growth before limits to growth are well past. Under this framing what is likely to happen?

47:57.940 --> 48:04.340
A growth in gross energy while net energy declines. Massive money creation and financial

48:04.340 --> 48:10.980
market support by central banks and governments. Wider and deeper poverty globally and more inequality.

48:11.700 --> 48:17.780
AI is going to accelerate the energy and environmental problems unless we shift our goals.

48:18.580 --> 48:25.860
A right word shift in politics because as things get scary and uncertain people tend to get more

48:25.860 --> 48:31.540
conservative and want ways things to be the way they used to be in the past. This is happening

48:31.540 --> 48:37.780
rapidly in Europe. We're yet to see what's going to happen in North America. A reduction paradoxically

48:37.780 --> 48:43.140
in global environmental regulations and under the superorganism framing it's going to be

48:43.140 --> 48:49.860
pedal to the metal until we hit some sort of a crisis or hit a wall. Implications and scenarios

48:50.420 --> 48:58.420
of all this. So there are generally four scenarios that are discussable. One is a green growth future

48:58.420 --> 49:04.500
that we use technology and create more productivity in the world and we become

49:04.500 --> 49:09.220
so profitable and productive that we can use the excess to heal the environment.

49:10.740 --> 49:16.900
The second scenario is what I refer to as the Mordor economy which is we are going to continue

49:16.900 --> 49:25.460
to grow but more and more of our economic energy and materials will be directed to the energy and

49:25.460 --> 49:32.660
mining sector of the economy meaning there will be less available for hospitals and universities

49:33.220 --> 49:40.340
and entertainment and travel and things like that because our economy will instead of using

49:40.340 --> 49:45.700
five percent of our energy to get the energy materials it'll be 10 percent and 15 percent and

49:45.700 --> 49:52.740
18 percent leaving less for discretionary society. I call this the Mordor economy and I would say

49:52.740 --> 49:59.620
this is the default. We're also going to need more and more energy and money to mitigate environmental

49:59.620 --> 50:08.580
problems like droughts and floods and hurricanes and heat problems etc. Let me explain the trajectory

50:08.580 --> 50:16.500
of the Mordor economy using this chart. The red line on the far left is when Reverend Thomas Malthus

50:16.500 --> 50:24.740
lived on the planet and he said that the geometric production of humans would outstrip our arithmetic

50:24.740 --> 50:31.700
production of food and he was wrong. He was wrong because he didn't know about fossil fuels that were

50:31.700 --> 50:38.420
underneath the ground. Fast forward to 1969 and Paul Ehrlich wrote a book called The Population Bomb

50:38.420 --> 50:44.820
saying many similar things and he was wrong at least about that at that time because he didn't

50:44.820 --> 50:52.740
know about debt that we have increased our debt faster than we've increased our GDP in every single

50:52.740 --> 50:59.940
year since 1969 and he didn't know about globalization that we could outsource the production of things

50:59.940 --> 51:07.620
to the least cost areas in the world. Fast forward to 2009 the next red line and we had a great financial

51:07.620 --> 51:14.420
crisis that was bailed out by the central banks taking over the role of monetary creation from

51:14.420 --> 51:21.140
the commercial banks. We had COVID in 2020 again the bazooka of the Federal Reserve and other

51:21.140 --> 51:31.220
financial guarantees and what will be the next can to kick. If we grow at 3% a year that means the

51:31.220 --> 51:39.540
energy and materials given the stats I said earlier will double every 30 years so if there is a 15

51:39.540 --> 51:46.100
year old watching this presentation by the time she is 75 there will not only be a doubling but

51:46.100 --> 51:54.500
a quadrupling in the energy and material use of the human economy. Is that possible? Is that desirable?

51:54.500 --> 51:58.900
What happens if that happens? What happens if it doesn't happen? These are some of the central

51:58.900 --> 52:05.620
questions of our time. So that is the Mordor economy. The third category which is what I've

52:05.700 --> 52:11.940
named my podcast in my work is called the great simplification which is we will not continue

52:11.940 --> 52:19.540
to grow but we manage a graceful descent. The average person in America uses 100 times more

52:19.540 --> 52:25.620
energy than our bodies need in terms of calories. If we went down to 70 or 60 or 50 it wouldn't

52:25.620 --> 52:33.060
necessarily be a bad thing. So the great simplification is at some point in coming decades

52:33.060 --> 52:39.780
when we remove this ubiquitous credit with a shift to more costly energy and resources

52:39.780 --> 52:45.780
and a return to solar inputs and renewables which are viable but more costly in a system wide

52:45.780 --> 52:51.220
perspective we will no longer be able to maintain our system of financial claims and one of the

52:51.220 --> 52:57.860
next three recessions will be a depression. There is a musical chair element to our current

52:57.860 --> 53:03.700
system of claims and I refer to this as a great simplification shown here as one trajectory out

53:04.820 --> 53:11.220
for the next 30 years. Lastly there would be the fourth quadrant would be the Mad Max scenario

53:11.220 --> 53:18.900
which is that we decline and there is no stability and social contract holding things together and

53:18.900 --> 53:24.500
I'm sure you've seen enough movies about that scenario. However in our social discourse the

53:24.500 --> 53:30.020
vast majority of people talk about this one scenario and the other three scenarios are really

53:30.020 --> 53:37.620
not given that much discourse. I would argue that the true odds are more like the areas of

53:37.620 --> 53:45.140
these shapes shown here and I'm advocating that we should consciously try towards a great simplification

53:45.140 --> 53:52.740
which is a smaller more local economy that still has the benefits of civilization but different

53:52.740 --> 53:59.460
relationships with each other with the natural world and hopefully less pollution to the other

53:59.460 --> 54:06.980
species and ecosystems. Between here and there however we have some constraints that are now

54:07.780 --> 54:13.300
unavoidable and I want to briefly talk about what I call the four horsemen of the 2020s

54:14.260 --> 54:20.260
which I have recently changed the five horsemen. The first one is a financial bend or break moment.

54:20.260 --> 54:26.740
We keep papering over our problems with more credit and central bank largesse. In the past 10

54:26.740 --> 54:32.820
years government debt has grown 60 percent to 83 trillion dollars. Corporate debt household debt have

54:32.820 --> 54:39.540
also grown. We are in a new era where every few months we're increasing the debt in the United

54:39.540 --> 54:46.340
States by a trillion dollars. We're just adding that we're transmuting wealth into income. We have

54:46.340 --> 54:53.060
this natural endowment of resources energy and ecosystems and we're creating new claims on that

54:53.060 --> 55:02.180
at an accelerating rate. So we create debt much more faster than GDP but we're stretching this

55:02.180 --> 55:09.140
relationship to our underpinning reality and there's going to be a snapback at some point because

55:09.140 --> 55:15.220
all these financial claims that we're creating will eventually have to be paid back in energy and

55:15.220 --> 55:20.660
materials and ecosystem services. The reason that you don't hear talks like this is there is no

55:20.660 --> 55:26.980
credible institution or government body in the world that is specifically planning for an end

55:26.980 --> 55:32.100
to growth because it's a very uncomfortable conversation to have. So in the meantime we're

55:32.100 --> 55:37.540
papering over our problems with more and more credit while the energetic and material basis for

55:37.540 --> 55:44.100
our currencies deplete. So we don't think of it this way but when we take on debt as a nation,

55:44.100 --> 55:49.940
as a company or as a person, the debt must be paid back with energy but as I said earlier our

55:49.940 --> 55:56.660
energy, our high quality energy is starting to flatline and will eventually start to decline

55:56.660 --> 56:00.420
but at the same time we're growing the red line which is our monetary markers.

56:01.620 --> 56:09.780
Okay second horseman of the next decade is geopolitics. This is June 7th. There are Russian

56:09.780 --> 56:16.180
warships headed to the Caribbean. Russia announced yesterday they're going to be selling weapons to

56:16.180 --> 56:23.460
countries that are antagonistic to the West. We are approaching this biophysical shift from a world

56:23.460 --> 56:30.500
that focused on money and technology to one that focuses on energy and ecology and a lot of the

56:30.500 --> 56:36.900
energy in the world is in countries that aren't necessarily so friendly to us. Around two-thirds

56:36.980 --> 56:44.820
of the remaining oil is within 600 miles of Israel. Around half of the world's purchasable oil

56:44.820 --> 56:51.700
navigates this strait of Hormuz, this two-mile wide strait between Iran and Saudi Arabia every

56:51.700 --> 56:59.860
day. These are things that we take for granted. In the, I would say unlikely, I don't know how

56:59.860 --> 57:06.980
unlikely it is, it's certainly possible but we have between the United States and Russia about

57:06.980 --> 57:15.060
12,000 nuclear warheads and if there were to be an exchange or a strategic escalation this graph

57:15.060 --> 57:20.580
shows the impact on climate. This is one way that the climate would actually cool is if there were

57:20.580 --> 57:26.180
enough nuclear weapons sent into the atmosphere that the soot blocked out the sun. This would be

57:26.180 --> 57:32.580
the absolute worst Armageddon disaster scenario of all because although the climate would ultimately

57:32.580 --> 57:38.820
be cooler it would wipe out most of complex life in the process. This is a crappy thing to say to

57:38.820 --> 57:44.740
a bunch of Canadian scientists but this is something that our society has shrugged under the carpet

57:44.740 --> 57:49.780
and is a very real risk in our world. People were really worried about it 50, 60 years ago

57:50.740 --> 57:59.140
and now it's really not in part of our discourse. Also we have to realize that we have a six

57:59.140 --> 58:09.060
continent supply chain, this globally interconnected economy that is just in time products. 80% of our

58:09.060 --> 58:14.820
pharmaceutical ingredients are made in China and India for the United States which has 4%

58:14.820 --> 58:20.500
of the world's population and 50% of the world's medical prescriptions. We have many many just in

58:20.500 --> 58:27.060
time supply chains that some complicated part is made in South Korea and ends up in Toronto

58:27.060 --> 58:32.980
three days later that without that part we couldn't do some industrial process so this is something

58:32.980 --> 58:38.580
that we take for granted. Also the social contract I don't know how things are in Canada

58:39.460 --> 58:45.620
but things are really starting to get a little uncomfortable in the United States.

58:45.620 --> 58:50.180
There is an enormous partisan divide in the media in the United States. Very few people

58:50.900 --> 58:56.340
read the same news sources, we have different facts, artificial intelligence is making it

58:56.340 --> 59:02.100
difficult to believe what is true or what is not which is another reason that the academy is vital

59:02.100 --> 59:08.660
for coming decades because we trust in scientists is declining but it's still among the highest

59:08.660 --> 59:15.460
trust that people have is in science. The fifth horseman which if you live in British Columbia

59:15.460 --> 59:22.180
and other places you're already aware of is the ongoing impacts of climate change on our ecosystem.

59:23.140 --> 59:27.940
There are droughts, there are floods, there are fires, there are wet bulb temperatures where

59:27.940 --> 59:36.980
people can't survive. The other day in Delhi, India it was 129 degrees in early June.

59:38.020 --> 59:43.540
Climate is warming right now and this is going to be a story for the rest of our lives. I promise

59:43.540 --> 59:49.460
you that I'm going to leave you with some actionable ideas and directions but I do think

59:49.460 --> 59:54.340
it's important to understand the landscape of what we face. Here are some summary points

59:54.340 --> 01:00:01.700
of the first part of this presentation. Long term growth was not the norm. We are living through a

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:10.180
unique exponential period of economic growth for our species. There were several periods in the last

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:18.260
2,000 years that lasted for hundreds of years with flat to declining growth. All of our economic

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:25.700
rules and explanations of how the world works were created in this little red bubble here

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:31.220
and what does that pretend for the future. Cheap abundant fossil energy underpins our

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:37.620
societies and our society's expectations. This is a stock that we have culturally treated as a flow.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:45.220
It is principle we're drawing down, not interest. We have completed the proximate drivers of

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:50.660
progress and growth with the ultimate drivers. Most people think that politics, technology,

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:58.500
and money are what drive our economic systems but they are sitting on top of a large

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:08.100
flux of around half a billion fossil worker equivalents and on the living, breathing

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:14.660
biosphere of which we're all dependent. We don't pay for the ecosystem services of Mother Earth.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:21.700
As long as growing GDP is our global goal, better technology is going to tend to grow and

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:27.620
not shrink CO2 emissions and impact because of the rebound effect and Jeven's paradox.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:35.460
Technology could be really important for future decades but it's going to have to be stuff that

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:40.420
is appropriate for our economies and we're going to have to change our economic system

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.140
if this is no longer going to be the case. In other words, the energy transition which is

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:51.220
oft lauded in the press is not really about energy. It's ultimately about how we relate to

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:57.060
each other, how we relate to the natural world, our levels of consumption, our change in consciousness,

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:02.180
and all that. Yes, energy will also play a role but it's not the driver. Barring a new

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.460
boost in productivity which is possible. It's kind of on the come. I don't know from artificial

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:13.860
intelligence. Growth is likely soon over and when that happens there is a musical chair situation

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:19.620
and the first challenge is going to be responding to a financial recalibration. At that moment we

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:25.940
should aim for bending which is holding the system together and landing at a lower material

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:32.660
throughput scale as opposed to breaking. Breaking would be bad. Rather than choose austerity,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.940
governments and central banks will continue to print and monetize debt eventually leading

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:45.300
to currency debasement and possibly currency reform. We do not actually face a resource

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:52.260
shortage but rather a longage of expectations. As I said earlier, the average American uses

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:59.460
100 times more energy than our bodies need. Most of the best things in life are free after basic

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:07.060
needs are met. Here's me reading a story to my dog at bedtime with two of my college friends

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.460
talking about birds and doing bird songs with a bunch of kindergarteners in India

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:18.820
and some friends I met. I just got back from India a couple months ago. Another point,

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.980
we do need renewables and technology but the way they're touted now,

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:30.260
the renewables are the right answer to the wrong question. The question is how do we land the

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:37.380
plane this century with viable technology that supports ecosystems and a thriving human population?

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:44.260
Right now we're just using renewables as kind of an appendage to the global super organism,

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:51.220
not as a construction of a new system. There is a biophysical phase shift occurring in global

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:58.260
politics, alliances and agreements. This means there's a shift between, as I said earlier,

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:03.860
money and technology narratives to energy and material narratives and that is going to change

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:09.300
the power structure and the international agreements and the trade and the economic growth

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:15.540
in the future. Climate change is not the problem but climate change is one of many

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:21.300
symptoms of a much larger dynamic dysfunction which is the ecological concept of overshoot

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:27.220
which is a species, in this case ours, has overshot the carrying capacity of the planet

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:34.020
given our current population and consumption levels. This is a scene from the movie Don't

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:41.220
Look Up which was so spot on that I included it in this presentation. This presentation that I'm

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:48.500
telling you all today cannot be voiced aloud in politics and media because it's too strange,

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.940
it's too complex, it's too abstract, it's too threatening, there are no easy answers and if

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:59.940
senior people verbally share that they agree with this, what are the solutions? It becomes

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:05.140
politically dicey and uncomfortable. That doesn't mean we shouldn't discuss it, we have to discuss

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.940
it behind the scenes to create blueprints, a break glass in case of emergency and other

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:19.060
paths forward. Last point here is our current resource tech situation can power a great culture

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:26.420
and a meaningful civilization, just not this one, not at this size and scale. The current system uses

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:36.180
19 terawatts of power continuously which is 190 billion light bulbs turned on 24-7,

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:43.940
that is not sustainable. What do we do to get out of this? I think the only way out is through

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:51.780
and here are some thoughts at various scales of what we should do. I no longer talk about solutions,

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:58.740
I prefer to talk about responses and there are million possible responses. Each of you sitting

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:04.740
in the audience or sitting at your office or at your home, just briefly think about what do you

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:10.420
think the solution is? What do you think some of the responses should be to the human predicament

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:16.660
that I've just laid out the choreography of? And by the way, I may have some pieces of it wrong

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:22.500
and I learn stuff every day and I may be missing some important things, but I think if you squint

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:28.980
and look at how the pieces fit together, I think what I've described will roughly hold its shape

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:36.340
in the coming decades. So if you think about what would be the responses to what I just described,

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:42.900
they are different to different people based on what they care about, where they live,

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:50.660
what their value system is. There are a list of solutions for rich or well off people or

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:56.580
rich or well off countries. There is a list of solutions for poorer countries and people.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.500
There is a list of responses and solutions for other species and other ecosystems.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:09.300
And there's a list of unborn humans of future generations and unborn of other species of the

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:16.500
10 million currently species we share the planet with. So there's not one size fit all responses.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:22.500
So keeping that in mind, most people care about themselves. The only thing we might care about

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:28.260
more than ourselves is our children. But beyond that, our family, our community, our region,

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:34.340
our nation, our world, other species, other generations get exponentially less care and

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:40.820
our economic decisions. This is also something that we have to recognize when we talk about responses.

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:49.300
So in effect, we are somewhere between the yellow star and the red star. And all of our cultural

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:58.900
stories are about the green arrow continuing forward in time. So here is the way that I

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:06.260
think about this. There are three distinct timelines for interventions. The red is the

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:14.340
time now before the crises arrive that we have to prepare as best as we can as individuals,

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:21.620
as universities, as communities, as nations, given the synthesis I've laid out. The yellow

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:27.700
is the time where there this financial recalibration happens that could be as soon as three months or

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:37.220
15 years. I don't know. But that is when there's going to be a currency bond financial reckoning.

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.460
And I think we have to focus in that moment and now in preparing for that moment to bend

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:50.660
and not break. And then where do we land this plane metaphorically? What are the sustainable

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:59.540
practices that Canadians and humans around the earth should start practicing for the longer term?

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.340
Because that's what's going to be more sustainable. So there are people that should be working on all

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:11.300
three of these timelines and everyone's preference is different. But it's not just let's do one thing.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:16.100
There are three timelines. And not only are there different timelines, but there are different

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:22.660
scales. And I'm going to briefly give a list here of some some categories of response at the global

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:29.620
level, the civil society community level for the academy and universities and for individual humans.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.260
So culturally, we have a road closed sign ahead of us. And many of us are starting to

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:43.620
see that in the distance that what we're doing is unsustainable. So what is the goal of a talk

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:50.180
like this? What is the goal of my podcast and my work? It's to normalize the conversations around

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:56.420
these topics. So we get more people involved in discussing them, being pro-social and being creative

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:01.860
and rolling up their sleeves and getting engaged. What we're trying to do now is change the initial

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:08.900
conditions of the future moments when these events start to ensue. So what we're doing is kind of

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:15.620
creating a time capsule to imagine what are the things we're going to be need to be doing in coming

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.300
decades. So here's some categories to consider. At the global level, first of all, as I mentioned

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:28.340
earlier, we are moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. And what are the governance

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:34.420
structures and ways of doing things that will allow a peaceful navigation through that period?

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:41.220
Another is our incentives. We look at the prices of things, and then we make economic decisions.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:50.900
But everything that our culture aspires to is linked to GDP, monetary surplus, and growth. And

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:57.300
if we change our incentives to include nature and human health and well-being and the ecosystem

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:03.140
health of the world, that's going to mean different incentives, different prices, and different

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:10.340
signals. So one thing that I don't know how viable it is to do right now, but we could add

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:18.020
a tax to anything that is an input to our economic system that is non-renewable in nature. Not only

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:26.420
carbon, but copper or fossil water aquifers or lithium or anything like that. If we add a tax to

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:34.500
these things, what will happen is our devices will be much more expensive, but we will give

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:41.540
signals to consumers to conserve things that are mostly non-renewable. And we will give signals to

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:47.220
inventors and innovators about the real cost of depleting things, and they will use these

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:55.140
scarcer resources more sparingly. So we will conserve and innovate at a better level. The main

01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:01.620
input to renewables is human labor. So if we added a tax and we taxed everything that was

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.820
non-renewable, we would remove all taxes on individuals and corporations. We would have to

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:14.580
have some sort of a regressive help for that would be a regressive tax scheme, but it would

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:20.980
favor renewable buildout and other things that weren't dependent on non-renewable inputs.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:26.100
In addition to changing the incentives, we need to change the aspirations. So this graph is from

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:32.580
Canadian Voslav Smil, who is at Winnipeg, showing that the energy supply used per capita

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:40.900
gives us a massive increase in well-being and a human development index from low levels. But once

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:47.540
we're at around 100 gigajoules per capita, any additional increase in energy consumption per

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:54.100
capita doesn't give us that much. The United States uses almost three times as much energy per

01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.420
capita as Italy or Japan, yet we're about the same on the human development index, and we're

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:08.980
actually declining in life expectation and other diseases of despair in my nation. So to move beyond

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:18.820
GDP, again, most of the best things in life are free after basic needs are met. If I asked you

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:24.500
while watching this presentation, what are your five best memories of your life, most of you would

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:30.740
not say that they required a lot of money or energy, but it would be playing cards at a slumber party

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:37.700
with your friends or fishing on Lake of the Woods with your family or time in nature in the beautiful

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:43.940
forests in Canada with your dogs or things that don't require a lot of energy and money in our

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:49.860
society. Our individuals recognize this, but our society, because we've outsourced things to the

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:58.180
market, do not. We need an icon to represent the future of the 3000-some emojis on our phone. There

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:06.420
is no icon to represent the future. My colleague, DJ White and I created this tee with an arrow,

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:13.220
just as a suggestion, but we need something to represent the future. Another category is advanced

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.780
policy. The reason that it's called advance and not policy is the things that we're going to need to

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:25.700
do as a governing body in Canada and the US and the world can't be happening at the margin because

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:32.100
they're too politically or socially difficult now. So we need to have something like a council of

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:38.900
elders that is building break glass plans or blueprints or in case of emergency do this ahead

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:45.220
of time so we know what to do when some of these events come to pass. Like the Bender Break moment,

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:51.860
I talked about the rubber band snapping back in the financial system. From the perspective of

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:58.260
the carbon pulse, what governance structures best fit after the red star? I don't know the answer to

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:05.620
that, but democracy and communism and things like that were designed for small groups of people,

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:13.060
not necessarily 8 billion people. This is a conversation for a political scientist to integrate

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:20.020
the biophysical story that I'm telling here. We need different technology. Technology is vital,

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:26.820
but the technology that we have now is just feeding the hungry ghost of the economic super

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:33.060
organism. As I said earlier, solar panels can power a wonderful civilization, just not this one.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:38.980
So from the perspective of the carbon pulse, what are the top four human inventions of all time?

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:46.340
According to Nate, the bicycle is the most energy efficient invention ever made to get a person from

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:52.420
point A to point B using the least amount of energy is a bicycle. The story or playing Dungeons

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:58.260
and Dragons or anything that is in the virtual world of our mind, sitting with other humans,

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:04.740
the unexpected reward and novelty of listening to other people is free, and it's an amazing

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:10.500
invention. Number two is the dog, which really isn't an invention. It's a co-evolution. This is my

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:19.380
Golden Retriever Quinn. They give us unlimited oxytocin, serotonin, and some dopamine,

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:26.500
and what a wonderful thing. By the way, I could not do this work without having a Golden Retriever

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:31.780
around because it's pretty intense. And the number one invention could be music because we are,

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:38.100
can be transformed again with not a lot of energy and materials into a different mental

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:47.300
state and emotional state and physical state from music. So Homo sapiens is wise man. So far,

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:53.460
we've been much more clever than wise. What sort of technology will be most suited for the downslope

01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:01.460
of the carbon pulse? I think something that I would refer to as Goldilocks tech, which is not

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:09.300
some fancy drone gadget and not going back to the Stone Age, but something in between that's

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:16.820
scalable and affordable and sensible. For instance, instead of lithium mining in Bolivia, we can make

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:22.180
batteries from sodium, which is from salt. It's a simpler material. It's not as powerful,

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:30.660
not as great as lithium, but it's a Goldilocks tech. There are many, many such things like that,

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:35.700
and I think we should start thinking two or three steps ahead about that sort of technology.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:42.100
Of course, the market and the superorganism will continue forward and do all kinds of fancy dopamine

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:50.180
creating expensive splashes of technology, but we need to at the same time simultaneously be

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:55.860
building out these alternative technologies and using them and scaling them in communities around

01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:03.940
the world. Globally, we also need to change our culture towards more of a regenerative society,

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:11.060
and that means right now we are not only the regeneration that hits the earth and net primary

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:17.620
productivity all over the earth, how much plants grow every year. We're taking 40% of that and adding

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:24.420
it to the human system, leaving 60% for the other 10 million species, but in addition to that, we're

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:29.860
taking millions of years of stored productivity and adding it to the system. This is patently

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:38.100
unsustainable, and for instance, we need to have global cooling shown on the left is whale poop.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:43.700
Whale poop acts as a carbon sink in the ocean because the phytoplankton bloom and then drop

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:50.980
to the bottom and they sequester carbon. Shown here is biochar, a new farming technology that

01:18:53.460 --> 01:19:02.420
absorbs carbon into the soil, so we need a whole new culture shift in the way that we think about

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:09.300
our economic system. I would offer, especially to the young people watching this, that we have

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:17.780
arrived at a species-level conversation where we know GDP is ultimately self-terminating either

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:26.020
ecologically or with war on our current path. I offer perhaps we could aspire to a life ethic,

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:32.180
and I'll briefly read the components of that. Life existing is preferable to no life existing.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:39.380
More kinds of life existing is preferable to fewer. Vibrant, complex ecosystems are preferable to

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:45.940
small, fragmented, brittle ecosystems. Ecosystems with large, complex life are preferable to

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:51.860
ecosystems with only microscopic life. Ecosystems supporting conscious minds, which are the

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:59.380
virtual worlds of human minds and gorillas and dolphins, etc., are preferable to ecosystems

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:05.700
without them. It is preferable to maximize existence, happiness, love, and understanding,

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:12.820
and to minimize the suffering of minds in the universe. The future, both near and far, is real

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:19.220
in the same sense that now is real, and via causality is determined by what is done now.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:25.060
Things which are preferable by this definition may be considered good. Things which are less

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:31.460
preferable may be considered evil. We should maximize good and minimize evil since the universe

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:37.540
does not. So it's one of my wishes is to educate and inspire humans, to culturally extend,

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:44.340
not narrow our circle of care. This is happening around the world with ecosystem restoration,

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:50.260
and there are a lot of humans that are trying to step towards a regenerative culture.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:57.620
That's at the top scale. What about civil society? We need better education, shown here

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:08.580
as a civilian land core of young people learning ecological skills and how to sequester carbon

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:16.580
and grow food and other things. We are headed for a simplification. We see this road close sign

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:22.100
ahead. All many of us feel it. I call it the walking worried, and yet there's still all this

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:28.580
entertainment and smorgasbord and Amazon brown truck deliveries and cool vacation junkets and

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:33.700
hockey games and all this stuff. In the meantime, so we get distracted. But if you look two or three

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:39.220
steps ahead, all this information, especially if you understand human behavior, you know that

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:44.900
en masse as a culture, we're not going to voluntarily tighten our belt, which means we will eventually

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:52.100
hit a wall. What can we do to simplify ahead of that time? By simplify, I mean reduce complexity,

01:21:52.100 --> 01:22:00.580
reduce energy consumption, and any individual, any town, any country that voluntarily reduces

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:09.780
complexity first will be outcompeted by other individuals, towns and nations, which is something

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:17.380
called a multipolar trap. But some nations or towns will be forced to do this because maybe

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:24.580
there's a natural gas pipeline is shut off to Germany, etc. So there is a short term cost to

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:32.260
simplifying, but a long term gain because those people, towns, universities, nations that do this

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:38.260
first, while everything holds together are going to develop new models and new ways of doing things

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:46.180
that those that are still the the rabbit running around at the high consumption level won't have

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:53.300
time to do it once things change. Supply chains, again, showing this Byzantine structured

01:22:54.900 --> 01:23:01.860
Rube Goldberg machine, which is the global supply chain, as things become more sensitive

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:07.940
and fragile in the global system, and as energy becomes more expensive, and as credit becomes

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:13.540
less available, the world is beginning to going to become a larger place again. So localizing,

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:20.900
on shoring, near shoring, regionalizing supply chains, especially for basic goods and important

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:28.500
things is going to be important. Shown here is the red circle. I think Toronto is within that

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:34.740
circle. I'm not even sure. And, you know, that would be the real core stuff. And then the blue

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:41.780
circle is, you know, you trade with with other areas. But those areas are much easier to get to

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:49.220
than China or India or South Korea, etc. A shadow council, one of my favorite movies was

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:54.740
Contact with Jody Foster, and they built a machine that would travel to outer space. But there was

01:23:54.740 --> 01:24:00.100
a religious fundamentalist that sabotage the machine, and we thought the movie was over.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:07.700
But lo and behold, they had another machine that they built not telling anyone in Hokkaido, Japan,

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:13.860
and Jody Foster, spoiler alert, ended up traveling to another dimension. In the same way,

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:20.820
our city councils and the high status humans at universities as well will be resistant to the

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:29.300
information in this presentation for many very valid reasons. So to construct a shadow council,

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:34.180
which ostensibly doesn't have the power and the authority as the regular city council,

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:38.260
but they can be talking about these things and learning and building social capital and

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:43.940
creating ideas ahead of time. It's something that's working off to the side that's unofficial,

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.940
but it's still working towards a great simplification. I can't speak to Canada, but the

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:58.420
United States is really bifurcated. We have echo chambers, many, many of them. Here's a list of

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:05.460
memetic tribes from left to right politically. There are many different social groups that

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:11.060
really don't talk to each other, and we're going to need diplomats that can suppress their own

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:16.500
political agendas and the things that they care about in order to host discussions

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:21.940
with wider groups of humans, because without that, we're really in trouble. So we need to have

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:28.980
diplomacy and facilitation with people that don't agree with us. Transmutation,

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:36.660
a word from King Midas who everything he touched turned to gold. Everything we've been doing is

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:48.100
transmuting the natural world over time into money over time. So while we can change monetary

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:54.180
markers into real capital, real capital is natural capital, which is our forests and our

01:25:54.180 --> 01:26:00.420
healthy soil and our rivers. Social capital is our friends, our relationships. Here's two of my dogs.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:07.300
That dog shown there, Maisie, is going to be 14 in September, by the way. This is my house,

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.900
built capital. There's solar panels and chainsaws and an aloe vera plant and human capital, which is

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:20.660
our health and our knowledge and our skills. These are real capital, and we should use our

01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:30.740
monetary markers to turn into more of these things. Healing. We have, most of our population

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:37.460
has experienced trauma. Some of you are probably experiencing trauma watching this presentation.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:43.700
We are increasingly an unhealthy society, and in order to address some of the challenges I'm

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:49.780
presenting today, I suggest we need in every community across Canada and in the United States

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:57.140
and in the world libraries, but we also need libraries of healing, where we have mental health,

01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:04.900
buttressing and meditation and exercise and healthy food and dance and community events and

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:11.460
social interactions. I spent six weeks in India earlier this year, and I was surrounded with 30

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:17.460
people for six weeks, and we chanted and sang every morning and did calisthenics. Then we had

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:25.300
lectures, and we've become so rich as a culture, on average, that we just live in our own little

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:30.900
castles and order stuff online, and we don't need people anymore. But in the near future,

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:37.620
we're going to need people again, and we're going to need to have healing of people. I think mental

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:43.540
health, as we approach the Great Simplification, is going to be a huge issue. There are many people

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:51.220
who are qualified, who are watching this show, this presentation right now, in Canada that have

01:27:51.220 --> 01:28:00.180
abilities to make this happen. A life brigade, again, this is my appeal to an animist respect

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:09.060
of nature. We need a cultural change, some of us, to say, no, the superorganism is not allowed

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:16.660
in this corner of Canada, in this part of my community in Saskatchewan or in Ontario. This

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:23.220
part is sacred, and the economic superorganism is not allowed here. This is not an economic

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:30.420
statistical argument. This is an argument from the heart that we treat these things as sacred.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:38.500
As this entire economic system has increased, and now including artificial intelligence,

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:46.500
are we in service of power or of life is a central question for the coming decades.

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:55.140
Moving to the academy, and again, I have a PhD, but I'm not affiliated with the university now. I

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:59.700
used to teach at the University of Minnesota. These are just some suggestions of the importance

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.380
that the universities around the world and in Canada can play towards this story.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:12.980
First of all, is we need to realize the context of our lives. So, again, the global human economy

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:19.700
is a thousand times bigger than it was five centuries ago. Most of the science about humans

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:25.940
and about human societies, especially social science, was developed during this very anomalous

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:32.420
period. I think the academy needs to understand the carbon pulse and the moment that we're at

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:40.260
because it informs all of our futures, and so this should be a driving backdrop for all

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:48.260
people at universities is to understand some part of the system's story. So, instead of silos,

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:54.820
academic silos, we really need to integrate the disciplines at universities around the world and

01:29:54.820 --> 01:30:02.660
have people horizontally doing horizontal and vertical research and sharing and integrating

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:08.580
because it's the system science integration that matters. The time of reductionist

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:16.180
expertise is over. We still need that, but only as part of a larger narrative.

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:23.060
What does education look like? What are the things that we need to be teaching young people

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:31.700
as we approach the nadir of the carbon pulse? What are some of the things we teach at universities

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:37.860
that are really trivia and facts and figures that are no longer relevant to the future? What are the

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:44.100
things that are going to matter to the young humans that will live during the 21st century?

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:53.860
I think it's an incredible opportunity for the privileged academic curious people who are professors

01:30:54.580 --> 01:31:02.020
to apply whatever their knowledge is with a passion and intensity that matches the scale

01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:08.020
and stakes of our time, and so still be scientists, be the best scientists you can be,

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:13.700
but also be warriors at the same time because you have a contribution to make. Maybe it's

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:21.620
developing an alternative to PFAS chemistry in our products, or maybe it's a new

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:28.260
collective governance system, or maybe it's a regenerative agricultural technology. I mean,

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:34.900
there's vast contributions that the academy can make, but we need to wake up and really rise to

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:41.700
the occasion because the academy has more degrees of freedom than a lot of areas of our culture.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:47.060
I suggest that for those professors that are approaching retirement,

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:54.900
that in the last few years before they retire, they do a pro-social capstone that is relevant

01:31:54.900 --> 01:32:02.180
to this biophysical story of humans in our future, that is a contribution to the future of humanity

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:09.700
given their domain and their expertise. And lastly, I suggest that many social

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:15.940
contracts have occurred in the past. This is 20,000 years ago, the Cave of the Hands in Lascaux,

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:27.540
but in my experience, the vibrance and curiosity and revolutionary spirit often happens in cities

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:34.260
that have universities. And it's at a university that the mitochondria of something to replace the

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:41.700
superorganism may be born. And as stewards and chaperones of these young humans, I think you,

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:50.740
as professors, can breathe life into this new mitochondria. Last but not least, you are professors,

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:57.940
you are citizens, but you're also humans. And I'm going to finish with some recommendations

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:03.220
of how to take this all on board in your own life. First category is being. How do you be

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:11.220
during this time? First of all, it is totally normal to grieve of the future that we thought

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:18.420
existed, but now you're starting to understand that a different future lies ahead. And if you're

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:24.260
sad about this, it's totally normal. What's not normal is you're dismissive or laughed about this

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:32.100
or felt indifferent. Grieve is appropriate to what we face. So give yourself some time to reflect

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:40.020
on this. And by the way, don't believe me in what I'm saying this. Research for yourself and come

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:45.220
to your own conclusions. But even if you think I have a 10% chance of being right in what I've

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:52.020
said today, I hope you will integrate some of these ideas into your work. Remember to keep

01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:57.860
perspective. If we're alive at the top of the carbon pulse, that seems like a really scary thing.

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:04.980
But what about the Inuits in Nunavut or the Yukon or up in the north of Canada? If you told them,

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:10.820
if you told a human, I'm going to set you out on a minus 50 degrees Celsius ice flow,

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.060
you would think that's a death sentence. But to the people living up there, it's just another

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:22.340
normal day. So we have to keep perspective of how much amazing opportunity we have. We have

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:28.340
access to all the information ever acquired by our species for free at our fingertips to give

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:33.860
one example. Don't forget to live. I forget this a lot because this is stressful toxic stuff that

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:40.580
I've chosen as my job to teach. But we have to live and love and play music and dance and play with

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:48.260
baby ducks and go on hikes and take naps and all the things that humans do. And not forget to have

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:55.540
gratitude every day for all the amazing things in this time that we have, these perilous risks,

01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:01.940
but there's a lot to be grateful for. And I'm grateful for a lot in my life. We have to remember

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:07.380
that this is a marathon and not a sprint and to nourish our own bodies and souls and minds

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:16.820
with healthy food, with exercise, with timeouts. We have to heal our amygdala and our fight or

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:24.900
flight response of our reptilian system and pause and reflect and be healthy. I think in addition

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:32.180
to Goldilocks tech, inner tech is going to be a necessity, something I will benefit from myself.

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:39.700
I need to walk the talk before I really advise this, but we are faced with a smorgasbord of different

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:47.620
advice and opportunities and dopamine and consumption and travel. But really our culture

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:52.900
has shortened and shortened our attention spans and dopamine has become a predominant

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:58.980
neurotransmitter in our behaviors. And especially young people, they increasingly have lower

01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:04.900
attention spans. They can't read a book. They can only watch short TikTok videos. And my advice,

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:11.060
especially to the young humans watching this, is to avoid the shallows and make sure to have dates

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:18.180
where you set technology aside, dates and windows and times, because your brain is your most important

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:23.300
asset going forward. And you want to have the attention span to be able to plant gardens

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:29.700
and read a book and do longer term projects. So the real asset allocation shift isn't necessarily

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:37.300
from money into real capital. It's also from our focus on dopamine into a more healthy portfolio

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:44.020
of neurotransmitters like serotonin, endorphins and oxytocin. Doing, what do we do with all this

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:50.100
information? Well, you simplify first and beat the rush. Most of the best things in life are free

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:56.020
after basic needs are met. And to simplify, if you really understand that society is not going to do

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:02.260
these things ahead of time, that gives you an interesting impulse on the back end because it

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:08.900
empowers you to do things now because you know that society probably won't. And to simplify your own

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:18.180
life and don't be reliant on a large house that's going to be a lot of money to heat or cool or a

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:24.580
boyfriend in Holland or any, well, if you really want a boyfriend in Holland, I'm not going to

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:29.620
gainsay you, but my point is that energy and money are going to become more expensive in the

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:36.740
not too distant future. Learn skills. You can imagine what skills are going to be needed in

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:44.740
coming decades. And a lot of us are neglecting physical skills because our culture is so rich

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:50.420
that we can outsource the skills to someone else. Ask yourself if half of what I'm saying comes to

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:55.380
pass. What is a skill that you could contribute to in your own community that you're kind of good

01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:00.740
at and are interested in? Avoid the consensus trance. We are such social creatures that we

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:07.860
look to others to confirm what's true and have as academics, you're probably not as prone to this,

01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:15.540
but avoid group think and what other people think you should do and think what is our reality

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:21.380
and come to your own conclusions. Intermittence. Humans don't need baseload energy. We are

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:27.940
baseload energy, so we get massive energy benefits from the first few of the 100

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:38.100
light bulbs we have invisibly behind us. The first few have sufficiency, and then there's enough,

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.740
and then there's plenty, and our current cultural goal is more and more and more stuff. So we have

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:48.820
to remember that we don't have a true resource scarcity, but rather a longage of expectations.

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:54.900
Carrying dissonance. Uncertainty is physically uncomfortable for humans, which is why people

01:38:55.540 --> 01:39:00.260
tend to gravitate towards really polarized positions, because then they don't have to

01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:08.660
devote any mental energy towards other what-ifs. So the natural response to a presentation like this,

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:13.780
if you haven't studied it, is, oh my gosh, technology will solve it. This is too Malthusian.

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:18.660
We'll figure something out. There's no problem. Or, oh my god, we're screwed. It's Mad Max.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:25.380
But the reality is going to be in the middle, and we have to become more comfortable with

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:34.580
uncertainty and navigate the pathways between fantasy and doom. Find the others. This is a

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:38.900
scene from Lord of the Rings, and one of the reasons that I love the book, and many people love

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:44.820
the book, is the fellowship. The fact that these nine, they're not even people. They were

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:51.380
hobbits and men and dwarves, and they got together and shared an experience. We need to do the same

01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:57.220
thing. We are on a runaway train where the market and the superorganism is shoveling fuel into the

01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:03.540
engine car. So we need to meet with others in the dining car and have conversations about what

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:10.260
matters and work on things that we're passionate about, and just enjoy life with people and find

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:18.260
the others that are on the same moral, intellectual, educational pathway that you are.

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:26.180
Sharpen the sword. We have the agenda of the gene as biological organisms. We are a product of what

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:31.700
worked in the past. We're walking forward, but our eyes are looking backward. But we don't have to

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.940
follow the agenda of the gene. It is not our friend. So sharpening the sword is improving

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:44.020
yourself towards a direction that you care about and you're capable of, and sharpen the sword because

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:51.380
the sword is you. We are an intense comparing social species. We compare ourselves to others.

01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:57.380
I talked about Tiger Woods and his wife's new boyfriend, but we do this all the time. We flex

01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:03.140
and do other things just to raise our status. But we have to keep in mind that on an absolute

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.860
basis, the average person in North America is richer materially than kings and queens of old

01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:15.700
from an energy and material standpoint. And yet, a lot of us feel like we're failing because we're

01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:23.300
comparing ourselves to the advertisements on television. So consider the absolute wealth that

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:29.460
you have in the access to things that you have instead of comparing yourself all the time to

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:38.740
others. Lastly, being, doing, and we, we need to expand the definition of self to be commensurate

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:48.500
with our times. So one pro-social thing we can do is there is a autocorrelation with negative

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:56.420
sentiments and negative emotions and anger and distrust. One person smiling and changing the

01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:02.180
behavior can break the chain of this. So don't be afraid to be kind and smile at strangers

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:09.460
and do unexpected behaviors of grace because you never know what sort of chain you're going to

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.820
disrupt and start a new chain in a new direction. We don't know what's going to happen in the future.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:21.140
I think this presentation might have put some new walls on the probability distribution of what's

01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:26.980
possible. But one suggestion I have is to wend your way towards something that you're passionate

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:32.740
about and care about. This is my good friend and colleague, DJ White, who ended up being the co-founder

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:40.660
of Greenpeace International and he ran Earth Trust. This is when he was 22. He was a geologist living

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:48.420
in Indiana and he didn't really know much about the world except he loved dolphins and whales.

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.500
But he determined there were no dolphins and whales in Indiana and he bought a one-way ticket to

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:59.220
Hawaii and volunteered cleaning dolphin poop out of aquariums. And within 15 years, he was the

01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:06.900
single most effective environmental activist of our time. He stopped the drift nets in the oceans.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:14.900
He did the Flipper dolphin safe tuna at Starkist. He stopped a dolphin drive kill in Taiwan

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:20.740
and many other success stories just because he took a step in a direction without a plan of

01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:27.940
something he was passionate about. So I recommend that you wend yourself towards something that

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:34.580
you feel passionate about with a purpose. Towards that end, give yourself a 24-hour vacation from

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:39.700
other people and technology in a place you personally find meaningful and ask yourself,

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:45.940
who do I wish to be in this life? Why do I wish that? And how might that may be made real?

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:55.060
And the answers are for you alone, but you might be glad to have them. Intrinsic. We often get

01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:02.740
validation externally for our behaviors and our self-worth, but given the stakes of everything

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:08.660
I've described today, we have to follow our own moral compass of what feels right and what feels

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:15.780
wrong and what feels rewarding and meaningful and follow a true north moral compass according to you,

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:22.340
not according to other people, and be intrinsically motivated. Do something for the benefit of someone

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:29.300
else that nobody else, including the person or animal or forest, will ever know. Examine closely

01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:35.860
the complex feelings this causes to arise within you as a first step in sorting social motivation

01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:41.780
from personal altruism, especially for the younger people. Rocks in the river metaphorically,

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:48.340
as the water starts rushing in our economic systems, many people who are not grounded are

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:54.980
going to metaphorically tumble downstream. And if you have resources and you are psychologically

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:03.140
sound and have a pro-social outlook, try to ground yourself as a large rock in the river of your

01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:08.980
community that other people can rely on. And if enough people do this, we can actually not only

01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:15.620
help our community and our university, but we can redirect the flow of the water. Maximize your

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:20.820
impact. Once we hear about climate change and all the negative things going on in the biosphere,

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:27.140
there's a tendency to try to be perfect and not eat meat and drive electric cars and not travel

01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:32.660
and recycle. And the list gets endless. And I think that all those things are good personal

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.260
hygiene at these times. But I would much rather you, especially as universities in a wealthy

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:44.820
country of Canada, to take this opportunity to maximize your impact on the planet as opposed to

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:51.460
just being one eighth billionth of a slightly smaller part of a problem. So this is the list

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:59.060
of advice I have for you. I'll close with this quote from Ilia Priogen, an ecological economist.

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:06.260
When a system is far from equilibrium, small islands of coherence can shift the entire system.

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:10.260
Maybe some of those islands of coherence could be universities in Canada

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:17.460
as a mitochondria of a new cultural social system. Thank you all. So Kira, you

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.540
had no idea what I was going to say. You know my work. I hope this wasn't too much for your

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.980
colleagues in Canada. This is the longest talk I've ever given, but I do think it's important to see

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:34.100
the bird's eye picture. And we've got some time for some questions if you have any.

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:41.620
I have tons of questions, but I want to respect your time as well. One of the things that really

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:46.740
jumped out on me in this talk and some more recent talks I've heard you give is around this idea of

01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:52.900
libraries of care. And why this is really salient, I think when I'm educating in this space, one of

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:58.180
the hardest things, hardest questions that I hear from students is what's the point? And that breaks

01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:03.620
my heart in a million different directions. What's the point from the sense of like an apathy or a

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:09.060
system overload where they're witnessing the foreclosure of nature. They're seeing the horsemen

01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:14.980
come in. They are watching war, live streaming war on their phones and they say, what's the point?

01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:19.940
Or I can't do anything. Or on the flip side, they'll say something like, what's the point? Technology

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:26.660
will save us. And that is baked into this very short-sighted dopamine reward system that they're

01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:32.340
working within. When you brought up the idea of libraries of care, I immediately thought, well,

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:39.700
the institution is this incredible library. We have many libraries on campus, but how can we

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:44.020
nurture a different kind of library? And what would that look like for healing and building

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:50.900
capacity and resilience that would really support the young people who will be alive much longer

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:57.540
than we will, who will be inheriting the mess we're giving them? I think you kind of answered

01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:03.140
your own question. I mean, we need people organically to step up and say, this is what our

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:10.420
young humans need as part of a university of experience. There needs to be a feeling of community

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:18.260
that goes beyond competition for grades and getting a resume, but actually involves meditation

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:31.540
and cooking and singing and outdoor group activities. And I think the antidote to apathy

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:38.660
is finding other people in a community, because as I mentioned, I deal with this toxic stuff a

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:47.140
lot. And the thing that supports me and leads me away from apathy is the dozens and now hundreds

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:53.140
and growing to be more than that, people that have my back that I talk to about this and feel

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:58.900
as passionate about it as I do, and we're sharing ideas and working on projects, and we're rolling

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:04.740
up our sleeves. And doing it alone feels like what's the point, but doing it in a small group

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.140
as Margaret Mead said, it's small groups of humans are the only thing that can change the

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:21.460
planet. Or something she said, I forgot the exact words. But I think we need to heal our

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:31.220
reptilian and emotional systems as a precursor to the intellectual thing, because our cognitive

01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:40.900
brain that perceives facts and studies for tests sits atop a much larger pyramid of things going on

01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:46.980
that in our modern age, we're not that healthy or regulated, we're constantly in a

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:55.860
fight or flight mode and our amygdalas are activated. And so universities need to, I think,

01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:04.820
and communities have to have places to go that aren't scarlet letters, stigma for people that

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:09.940
have, oh, they went to the mental health clinic. It's not like that. It's actually, this is where

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:16.020
I go to be human. It should be promoted. And I want to go there and be with these other humans,

01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:20.340
because we're talking about all this stuff, and we're doing cool things and activities,

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:27.300
and we need to exercise and good food. And I don't know the university structure, the way it is now,

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:31.860
how to go from here to there. But something like that is sorely needed.

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:40.100
Hmm. Another thing that comes to mind is how can we widen our boundaries for imaginaries and

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:46.100
possibilities? We're working in these silos, literally the climate control, everything is

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:52.420
within these boxes. Do you have any ideas as an educator, as a communicator? Do you think getting

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:58.180
people outside, maybe outdoors? Is there anything you can think of that might be helpful there?

01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:04.020
Well, first of all, ask what would nature do? Spend as much time in nature as you can.

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:12.980
It calms your nervous system. It grounds you. And living in Canada, you have plenty of access

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:20.260
to that that some people in the world don't. I think we need tangible examples. We need more

01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:28.180
examples and pilots of people doing cool, interesting things. There's research shown that

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:34.420
if someone sees another person doing an act of altruism, they're 300% more likely to do

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:40.020
an altruistic thing themselves. So I think the problem with many of these lectures and these

01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:45.620
concepts is they're all a bunch of scary facts. And then another to-do list of what to do in

01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:53.220
your own life without tangible examples. But the people listening to this, we need to start doing

01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:59.380
those tangible examples and promoting them and showing that life doesn't have to be a disaster

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:07.860
if we're using less energy and less stuff. And so I think just start by doing more things with

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:16.660
other people in the direction of a simplification. Very cool. And a question for Nate Hagins as a

01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:22.100
human, not a communicator and an educator. But you know, I always like to ask you, what are the

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:26.340
coolest birds you've seen lately? And also, what is growing in your garden right now?

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:35.620
Well, I see a lot of birds. And as you know, I think I told you I have the Merlin

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:43.380
Cornell thing on my phone that identifies them. And yesterday and the day before, I identified a

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:49.540
black-billed cuckoo, which you can look it up. I've never seen one, but I hear it now,

01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:53.700
two days in a row, and I'm trying to see it. And I looked it up online. And sure enough,

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:58.340
that is the sound that I'm hearing. I see pilliated woodpeckers every day.

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:05.540
I will give you an honest answer about my garden. My girlfriend is growing a lot of things, garlic,

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:15.060
and tomatoes, and onions, and spinach, and kale. I'm responsible for potatoes. And the potato

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:20.260
patch looks like the Tasmanian devil went through there, because I've been so freaking busy that

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:25.780
the weeds are larger than the potato plants. So I will be frequenting my farmer's market this fall.

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:31.700
But it is a failing of mine that I've been working too much this spring,

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:41.220
because not only is the produce itself yummy and rewarding in the fall, but it's the act of being

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:51.700
out in the soil with my birds, my chickens, and ducks, and guinea fowl, and dogs. So my garden

01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:57.460
is not as it should be this year, Kira, but I endeavor to change that in the future.

01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.860
Through a great simplification.

01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:09.380
Well, it's a challenge, right? Because I know this is coming, and I'm trying to affect it with our

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:16.420
work of our channel and our communication. And in doing that, I've complexified my own life at

01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:21.940
a same time that I know a simplification is coming. And I'm sure many people can relate to that.

01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:27.380
But I have grown a wonderful garden in past years, so I at least have the skills.

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:34.900
And I can still cook this stuff. But to be totally blunt and honest, we were just talking about this

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:41.060
last week. Red Wing, Minnesota, where I live, has a huge farmer's market. And in September,

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:49.700
in between traveling, I'm going to go there and support the local CSAs and put away our V8 and

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:55.380
our tomato sauce and our pumpkins and squash and the root cellar and things like that.

01:54:56.260 --> 01:55:03.940
Amazing. Nate, it has been an honor, a pleasure, and I am super grateful for your time on behalf

01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:09.220
of the Environmental Studies Association of Canada and our partners. Thank you very much.

01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:15.780
Nothing but amazing things to say about your work. Thank you also to the people behind the scenes,

01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:21.380
to Leslie, to Luke, and to Misty, everyone who's contributed today. Deep thanks from Canada. We

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:26.740
are very grateful. Good day, my friend. Merci beaucoup.
