00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
One of the main things in life is purpose, and most people born in the history of man

00:08.320 --> 00:13.540
have not had particular purpose other than staying alive.

00:13.540 --> 00:20.360
We have an opportunity to not just stay alive, earn a living, feed yourself, but we have

00:20.360 --> 00:28.800
an opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out for more or less

00:28.800 --> 00:31.200
ever.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.560
Today I'm pleased to welcome Jeremy Grantham to the great simplification.

00:35.560 --> 00:42.760
Jeremy almost 50 years ago founded the investment firm GMO, where the G stands for Grantham,

00:42.760 --> 00:49.960
and by societal metrics he is now a billionaire, though in this conversation he corrects me

00:49.960 --> 00:53.040
on the definition of that.

00:53.160 --> 01:01.280
An amazing mind, and I long ago followed him because in his GMO research notes back

01:01.280 --> 01:08.680
when I oversaw the oil drum, he was writing about phosphorus and about oil and about

01:08.680 --> 01:15.320
climate change and integrating lots of the same topics in the biophysical economics

01:15.320 --> 01:20.160
field where I reside.

01:20.160 --> 01:27.760
It's very encouraging to me to have such a financially successful person, almost fully

01:27.760 --> 01:34.240
dedicated to environmental causes, particularly climate change, endocrine disrupting chemicals,

01:34.240 --> 01:44.240
plastics, population, and I hope this conversation can act as an overton window or a siren song

01:44.240 --> 01:52.320
to more people of means to look at the big picture of how energy, humans, and the environment

01:52.320 --> 01:54.040
fit together.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.920
There is no greater story.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.600
Please welcome Jeremy Grantham.

01:58.600 --> 02:17.520
I have so many questions for you because you are what I might refer to as everything

02:17.520 --> 02:22.320
bagel as far as understanding the human predicament.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.080
Not only are you an expert in finance and stock market and conventional investing, but

02:28.080 --> 02:35.200
you also deeply care about the environment, including but not limited to climate change.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.720
Let me start by asking you this.

02:36.720 --> 02:43.560
We live in a culture that the last generation or so has rewarded reductionist experts like

02:43.560 --> 02:53.400
real estate developers or physicists, and we don't really reward generalists who know

02:53.400 --> 02:59.240
something about everything and how things fit together other than maybe librarians and,

02:59.240 --> 03:01.720
in your case, hedge fund managers.

03:01.720 --> 03:07.600
How did you begin your lifelong career interest and how everything fits together in multiple

03:07.600 --> 03:14.680
subjects and when and why did you start to integrate specifically energy, ecology, and

03:14.680 --> 03:17.800
the environment into your worldview?

03:17.920 --> 03:27.120
There are people like us that when confronted with any situation, eventually get around

03:27.120 --> 03:35.360
to saying, what are the bigger issues that circle around the outside of what we're doing

03:35.360 --> 03:37.720
and how do they interrelate?

03:37.720 --> 03:45.400
And then gradually your familiarity expands outwards and if you're curious enough, you

03:45.400 --> 03:52.240
keep on going and whether you like it or not, you're thereby becoming a generalist

03:52.240 --> 03:58.880
because you want to know what causes, what causes, what causes and you work your way,

03:58.880 --> 04:06.080
in my case, quite slowly from the stock market, what drives the stock market, what drives

04:06.080 --> 04:12.040
people, what are the big issues, what are the weaknesses of human beings, what are the

04:12.040 --> 04:19.360
problems, therefore, that come out of our weaknesses and pretty soon you arrive at nature

04:19.360 --> 04:26.080
and then you get into the whole thing about what we owe to nature, what it contributes

04:26.080 --> 04:37.520
to our well-being, to a true benefit GDP, if you will, as opposed to the actual GDP,

04:37.520 --> 04:42.920
which is a list of costs when you get down to it, not benefits.

04:42.920 --> 04:54.200
And so onwards and upwards, aspects of nature, limitations, Kenneth Balding, the finiteness

04:54.200 --> 05:02.040
of the world, spaceship earth, hurtling through space with only what it has.

05:02.040 --> 05:11.280
There are no space stations to go and reload with fuel or torpedoes or anything, you've

05:11.280 --> 05:17.240
only got what you've got and if you think about what rules and regulations you would

05:17.240 --> 05:24.200
need for a multi-generational space trip in a rocket, it gives you some ideas of what

05:24.200 --> 05:33.980
rules you really should have on planet earth and you keep on going until you end up with

05:33.980 --> 05:41.000
my self-described job at work, which is underrated long-term problems.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.680
And that has been a fabulously rewarding era for about 15 years because they are the things

05:50.680 --> 05:57.600
that are really interesting, obviously they are the things that really matter and they

05:57.600 --> 06:05.160
are bottomless pits, so you'll never know too much, you keep trying and you still only

06:05.160 --> 06:16.400
know a tiny fraction of the problem and pretty soon you're on a podcast with you.

06:17.400 --> 06:24.840
Well, since we both have financial backgrounds, let me follow with this question.

06:24.840 --> 06:33.240
We don't have prices or incentives to solve most of those underrated long-term problems.

06:33.240 --> 06:40.880
So I've had a lot of financial people that understand energy on this podcast and I know

06:40.880 --> 06:48.800
a lot of them in my circles, but it seems that the more financially focused people are,

06:48.800 --> 06:54.080
the less they're focused on the environment, not so much in your case.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.440
How do you integrate what's going on there?

06:57.440 --> 07:03.520
Because a lot of financial people are almost to the point of cognitive dissonance dismissing

07:03.520 --> 07:06.400
climate change and other environmental risks.

07:06.400 --> 07:18.800
I am absolutely shocked over the last 30 years at how little interest my fellow financial

07:18.800 --> 07:28.600
types have throughout the industry in these issues on which our long-term well-being absolutely

07:28.600 --> 07:30.680
depends.

07:30.680 --> 07:38.640
It is cognitive dissonance and it's surprising because some of them are unbelievably smart

07:38.640 --> 07:43.920
and yet missing whatever it is.

07:43.920 --> 07:54.840
I don't know if it's wisdom or if it's peripheral vision being wider, but they're just not interested.

07:54.840 --> 08:01.360
It is enough for them to become expert in fiddling and diddling with finance and making

08:01.360 --> 08:06.080
a lot of money.

08:06.080 --> 08:12.920
I think I have mentioned to you before that I got into finance for a very profound reason

08:12.920 --> 08:19.360
and that was I asked which of my classmates from business school were having the most

08:19.360 --> 08:27.840
fun and back then in 1968 by a very wide margin the guys in the stock market were having the

08:27.840 --> 08:35.520
most fun and so I thought, well, I don't want to miss out on that and then I was amazed

08:35.520 --> 08:46.240
that I was earning $12,000 in consulting and up from 10 in a year and they hired me into

08:46.240 --> 08:53.600
the financial business in Boston at 18 and that was the going rate, just 50% higher.

08:53.600 --> 09:02.560
50% higher I might add than they needed to pay me, I would have gone for 10, forget 12,

09:02.560 --> 09:11.960
forget 18 and so that was very much a secondary discovery.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.680
They were not only having more fun but they were getting paid a hell of a lot more money,

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
not to like about that.

09:16.920 --> 09:24.360
Well, we're going to get into some of the deeper issues on the environment and endocrine

09:24.360 --> 09:35.440
disrupting chemicals, climate change and other things but let me ask you this, energy underpins

09:35.440 --> 09:41.080
the natural world and it underpins human systems and I think people are starting to understand

09:41.080 --> 09:47.400
that a little more but finance is a layer on top of that because money is a claim on

09:47.400 --> 09:51.600
energy and debt is a claim on future energy.

09:51.600 --> 10:04.040
So if we're really going to change the extractive growth ecosystem, destructing human enterprise,

10:04.120 --> 10:12.000
the people at the helm of finance need to be the ones to change, doesn't that have to

10:12.000 --> 10:13.320
change somehow?

10:13.320 --> 10:22.480
Yeah, we're not going to win what I call the race of our lives without huge government

10:22.480 --> 10:32.520
backing and without the governments finding a way to encourage corporations to act more

10:32.520 --> 10:39.960
responsibly and I think we may do that but we may not.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.960
It's a hard call.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.800
Yeah, so we'll get back to that.

10:47.800 --> 10:53.800
I want to focus on climate, energy and the environment in this conversation but you were

10:53.800 --> 11:01.520
on record recently in your main vocation regarding stock market levels saying that we

11:01.520 --> 11:05.480
are in a super bubble.

11:05.480 --> 11:10.800
I think most people are aware of you and your acumen in the financial sphere, not in the

11:10.800 --> 11:12.720
environmental one.

11:12.720 --> 11:17.240
What is a super bubble and why are we in one?

11:17.240 --> 11:26.880
A super bubble is typically about two and a half sigma.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.800
All bubbles in my opinion, we had to define them arbitrarily so we took the historical

11:31.800 --> 11:37.480
data and we said every two sigma event which is in a random world every 44 years and the

11:37.480 --> 11:44.400
stock market world every 35, close enough for government work, we would call that a bubble

11:44.400 --> 11:53.240
and we went through every asset class in the database, took us months and in the end we

11:53.240 --> 11:56.960
had a couple of hundred two sigma bubbles.

11:56.960 --> 12:05.160
There was a handful of interesting paradigm shifts that didn't break such as the whole

12:05.160 --> 12:14.200
Indian economy making a phase change from real peasant economy to a more complicated

12:14.200 --> 12:19.960
industrial economy, exactly the kind of exceptions you might think.

12:19.960 --> 12:30.320
So oil appeared to go through a paradigm shift back in the first opaque shock and never

12:30.320 --> 12:39.200
regrouped from that level whereas the rest of commodities continued down for the 20th

12:39.200 --> 12:41.120
century.

12:41.120 --> 12:46.800
Oil you could say really was flat slightly up and that was the great exception and a

12:46.800 --> 12:49.480
very important exception.

12:49.480 --> 12:56.360
And again very plausible, you might think that oil would show the first signs of beginning

12:56.360 --> 13:01.200
to run out before other things and I believe it did.

13:01.200 --> 13:06.560
But I saw a podcast with you a few months ago that you say we're in a super bubble now

13:06.560 --> 13:11.600
in the stock market and that's more based on your conventional analysis.

13:11.600 --> 13:22.560
Okay, no everything is critical to what is a bubble, a two sigma and they in the developed

13:22.560 --> 13:32.680
world they all went back to the previous trend prior to the bubble starting and a classic

13:32.680 --> 13:41.400
bubble is two or three years up, two or three years down and in the stock market they've

13:41.400 --> 13:43.240
been very well behaved.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.920
A super bubble is kind of much more interesting because that has penetrated through the two

13:49.920 --> 13:57.560
sigma territory of a badly overpriced market and continues up.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.000
It also has a second criteria.

14:01.000 --> 14:12.120
It has to have really crazy speculation increase in all sorts of financial activity, people

14:12.120 --> 14:18.640
have to start thinking that it will go on forever, that it's a new paradigm, that they

14:18.640 --> 14:25.080
only worry about missing out, they buy stocks because they're going up not because of anything

14:25.080 --> 14:27.120
to do with the fundamentals.

14:27.160 --> 14:34.560
The classic being the meme stocks, probably one of the greatest examples in modern times

14:34.560 --> 14:39.680
of 2020 and 2021.

14:39.680 --> 14:51.280
And there aren't many of these, 1929 was a humdinger, 1972, 74 the nifty 50 was an honorary

14:51.280 --> 14:55.560
member right on the cusp that you could put it either way.

14:55.560 --> 15:04.200
2000 was another humdinger, bigger and better than 1929, full of absolutely crazy behavior.

15:04.200 --> 15:10.720
The housing bubble was very much a housing bubble, crazy behavior, a three sigma event,

15:10.720 --> 15:19.680
a bigger remarkable breakout of housing prices even the 1929 and 2000 in stock prices.

15:19.680 --> 15:30.560
And then once again in 2021, we had a two and a half sigma and an utterly crazy behavior.

15:30.560 --> 15:38.480
I believe if you look at the scale of it, the biggest, most significant crazy behavior

15:38.480 --> 15:44.160
in recorded history of the US stock market.

15:44.680 --> 15:52.280
When you look at those, they go back to trend like all the other normal ones, but they cause

15:52.280 --> 15:57.880
a whole lot more pain because they distort the system on the way up, there is a huge

15:57.880 --> 16:00.720
income effect and wealth effect.

16:00.720 --> 16:06.080
And when they inevitably break, they're always a shock because everyone has locked into the

16:06.080 --> 16:08.880
new paradigm.

16:09.440 --> 16:15.800
They nearly always take longer than people think because they're so powerful and they

16:15.800 --> 16:21.840
didn't get there by accident, they were driven by some underlying important fundamentals.

16:21.840 --> 16:28.960
So there was lots to believe in, but they eventually come down to trend and all but

16:28.960 --> 16:32.880
one of them in history go below trend for a while.

16:32.880 --> 16:40.160
And that creates an enormous negative income effect and has always caused a recession.

16:40.160 --> 16:47.240
If you miscalculate, the recession turns into something really terrible like the depression

16:47.240 --> 16:57.160
of 1929, like the bitter recession of the nifty 50, 72, 74 of the near total financial

16:57.160 --> 17:02.240
collapse of the housing bust in 08.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.720
And one should expect something pretty bad this time.

17:06.720 --> 17:14.360
And we await to see if this follows the pattern of history or whether it is indeed that lovely

17:14.360 --> 17:17.160
creature and new paradigm.

17:17.160 --> 17:21.760
But history is not kind to the new paradigm thinking.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.200
So let me ask you a couple of follow ups to that.

17:25.240 --> 17:32.280
Your analysis of these super bubbles is based on the concept of mean reversion that we revert

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
to the trend.

17:33.280 --> 17:42.600
But the trend of the last century has been one of rising energy access globally.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.840
We're now at a 19 terawatt global metabolism.

17:46.840 --> 17:53.240
And so your analysis suggests that we're going to mean revert to the trend.

17:53.280 --> 18:02.240
But on top of that analysis, there's also peak cheap oil, geopolitical competition for

18:02.240 --> 18:09.840
a finite pie, and growing ecosystem disruptions.

18:09.840 --> 18:17.320
So I think the entire trend line might start to flatten or decline.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.360
What are your thoughts on that?

18:19.360 --> 18:28.480
Well, regrettably, you may very well be right, our last couple of papers began to spell out

18:28.480 --> 18:35.280
what we thought the fundamental problems were that could get worse.

18:35.280 --> 18:43.920
And I conclude that they are worse and more potentially dangerous than the collection

18:43.920 --> 18:52.280
of fundamental surrounding all the other super bubbles, including 1929.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.040
We were really ham-fisted in 1929.

18:55.040 --> 19:03.920
We persevered in some terrible international trade wars, which was unnecessary and destructive.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.240
And maybe we will be very clever this time.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.360
Maybe we will be stupid once again.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.720
Who knows?

19:10.720 --> 19:17.400
But there is a very dangerous set, which you were beginning to describe, but with Russia

19:17.400 --> 19:26.200
and China, Ukraine, and the resource impact of Ukraine, Russia, and so on.

19:26.200 --> 19:33.560
And with the breaking down of the world in which international trade increased to one

19:33.560 --> 19:39.800
in which international trade may very well slowly decrease, going from an increasing

19:39.800 --> 19:43.440
efficiency to an increasing inefficiency.

19:43.440 --> 19:52.280
And with the population profile shifting fairly violently by any population standard,

19:52.280 --> 19:59.000
we have never seen a shift of this magnitude, going from rapid growth to rapid decline

19:59.000 --> 20:01.520
in a 30-year window.

20:01.520 --> 20:08.640
And as recently as the early 1990s, you couldn't find people talking about a population slowing

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
down.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.320
They were going along.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.760
And now the baby cohorts are in free fall.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.240
They are dropping rapidly.

20:17.240 --> 20:25.400
And people don't realize that the global cohort of babies is below 98 now, 1998, though we

20:25.400 --> 20:29.840
peaked in about 0506 and we've been declining every year.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.560
Even though African baby cohorts are still going up, on a global basis, the total is

20:34.560 --> 20:36.320
going down.

20:36.320 --> 20:42.680
And in the developed world in China, we are having, in most countries, fewer 20-year-olds

20:42.680 --> 20:50.000
entering the workforce, and that is completely unique and could have very bad consequences.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.360
And then we have the resource component.

20:52.360 --> 20:57.240
I think my colleague and I are scooped.

20:57.240 --> 21:03.240
We've only had one scoop, and that was 2011, we wrote a paper, Time to Wake Up, The Age

21:03.240 --> 21:10.920
of Plentiful and Cheap Resources is Gone Forever, in which we made the case that, of

21:10.920 --> 21:14.760
course, in a finite world, you would eventually expect that to happen.

21:14.760 --> 21:20.560
And there were now finally signs that it was happening, but the final push over the edge

21:20.560 --> 21:32.880
had been the amazing and accelerating growth in China's demand for important resources.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.640
For the last four years, they accelerated to double digit.

21:36.640 --> 21:44.920
They were increasing at over 10% a year in their demand for cement, iron ore, coal, and

21:44.920 --> 21:49.000
one or two other things, but not oil.

21:49.000 --> 21:57.080
So you have earned deep respect in the financial community for your long-term success as an

21:57.080 --> 21:58.080
investor.

21:58.080 --> 22:06.920
I think I suspect many of your peers still look at money and technology as the driver

22:06.920 --> 22:16.320
of the human experience and may look at your views on commodities and energy and the environment

22:16.320 --> 22:20.240
as somewhat Malthusian.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.000
What are your thoughts there?

22:22.640 --> 22:28.400
My thoughts are that Malthus and what he said is a nice complicated topic that we could

22:28.400 --> 22:37.840
discuss for a minute or two, that for a year or two after our paper in 2011, as we hit

22:37.840 --> 22:46.080
the temporary cyclical setback caused by China slowing and global grain weather improving,

22:46.080 --> 22:50.720
some thought we were entertainingly wrong.

22:50.720 --> 22:56.320
And it took a few years before the long-term trend line to clearly be different.

22:56.320 --> 23:03.840
The long-term trend line for, we keep a very interesting index at GMO, 33 important equal-weighted

23:03.840 --> 23:05.000
commodities.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.040
To study the question, what is happening to commodities, not what is happening to oil

23:10.040 --> 23:12.000
and iron ore?

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
And those 33 declined by 70% in the 20th century.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.400
And yes, there were three spikes, World War I, World War II and OPEC, of course.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.120
But in between, they dropped back to the trend line, which was declining at just over 1%

23:29.120 --> 23:32.880
a year, which accumulates pretty damn fast over 100 years.

23:32.880 --> 23:39.320
So a drop in the average price of important commodities of 70%, enormous help in getting

23:39.320 --> 23:40.800
rich.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.560
And then in 2002, it shifted.

23:44.560 --> 23:50.960
And the index that had gone from 100 to 30 is back over 90.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.160
It has tripled since 2022.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.000
This is not the trend that we all grew up on.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.080
This is a new world in which we are going to have to come to terms with the finiteness

24:06.080 --> 24:07.720
of almost everything.

24:07.720 --> 24:14.000
I think for reasonable purposes, there's enough aluminum and iron ore to get the job

24:14.000 --> 24:17.040
done.

24:17.040 --> 24:23.720
But everything else, most of the metals we think of on the same level with iron ore

24:23.720 --> 24:32.240
are 100 or more often a thousandth as frequent in the Earth's crust as aluminum and iron.

24:32.240 --> 24:41.240
And I think aluminum is about 7.5%, 8% of the crust, iron ore is 4.5%.

24:41.240 --> 24:47.600
And copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel that we use for batteries and so on, they range

24:47.600 --> 24:54.200
from 0.002 to 0.006.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
That's the range.

24:55.200 --> 25:01.760
And you can take 30 of those important chemicals like nickel and copper.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.640
And add them all together and they aren't 1%.

25:06.640 --> 25:12.720
They aren't a tiny fraction of iron ore or aluminum.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.240
And nobody really gets that.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.760
And there are no reserves anymore.

25:17.760 --> 25:25.120
China pretty well bled the last great minds of these important but actually rare metals.

25:25.480 --> 25:33.480
Well, in a convoluted way, the 70% drop in that commodity basket in the 20th century

25:33.480 --> 25:43.120
was due to an expansion of fossil armies of hydrocarbons that did the work for us and

25:43.120 --> 25:49.200
all those extraction industries, the rise of the machines.

25:49.200 --> 25:54.800
So we had more access to oil and that oil and the machines that it powered gave us more

25:54.800 --> 25:59.520
access to get the overburden from the mines for copper and nickel and all the things you

25:59.520 --> 26:01.120
were mentioning.

26:01.120 --> 26:07.280
But you said that that change in 2002, I think 1999 was the all time inflation adjusted low

26:07.280 --> 26:12.800
for oil and we've been going up since and the extraction costs for oil have tripled

26:12.800 --> 26:16.400
since around that time.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
So we are in a new paradigm.

26:18.400 --> 26:24.240
There's just maybe a two decade lag before people start to notice it and puzzle it out.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
I agree.

26:25.480 --> 26:31.640
So do people in your sphere, when you go to hedge fund conferences or whatever those are

26:31.640 --> 26:41.200
nowadays, do they start to see the world through an energy lens or is that not yet happening?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.680
First of all, I don't do that.

26:42.680 --> 26:50.080
I spend more time mixing with people like you and going to green gatherings and green

26:50.080 --> 26:58.880
tech gatherings and I haven't been to a hedge fund gathering for 15 years.

26:58.880 --> 27:05.240
But I can pretty well answer for them and most of them with a few interesting exceptions

27:05.240 --> 27:08.840
do not get it at all.

27:08.840 --> 27:13.840
And it's a pretty good reason and that's because the economic establishment has never

27:13.840 --> 27:16.040
gotten it.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.360
The classical economists had their feet on the ground.

27:18.360 --> 27:23.120
They understood they lived in a real world and Keynes did.

27:23.120 --> 27:34.640
But the establishment since then basically wasted in this efficient market rational expectation

27:34.640 --> 27:36.800
nonsense.

27:36.800 --> 27:45.200
Building models to be neat and mathematical and show their physics envy, but totally

27:45.200 --> 27:46.200
useless.

27:46.200 --> 27:52.040
They completely lost the plot as Kenneth Boling who started out as a typical mainstream economist

27:52.040 --> 27:57.920
and then kind of resigned when he was about 50 because he found economics totally useless

27:57.920 --> 28:03.040
as in the direction it was heading and in my opinion, totally right.

28:03.040 --> 28:11.960
So everything you read from the mainstream economics ignores the role of energy and resources.

28:11.960 --> 28:18.480
You make a loaf of bread with capital and labor with the oven and with the worker with the

28:18.480 --> 28:22.440
great paddle to stick it in the oven.

28:22.440 --> 28:28.320
You do not apparently need any wheat and you don't apparently need any heat.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.400
It is absolutely a laughable state of affairs.

28:32.400 --> 28:37.800
But when you throw in these more difficult things, your equations become too complicated

28:37.800 --> 28:39.960
and start to break down.

28:39.960 --> 28:45.520
And when you leave them all out and you assume everything away and you assume perfect knowledge

28:45.520 --> 28:50.760
and perfect information flow and in the stock market equal knowledge on the side of the

28:50.760 --> 28:57.680
buyers and the sellers and all these ludicrous assumptions as if it isn't a kind of wilderness

28:58.160 --> 29:02.120
of psychology, the stock market.

29:02.120 --> 29:10.000
You get nonsense out of the end of their equations and big corporations and finance pick up on

29:10.000 --> 29:11.400
that.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.020
It impregnates their business.

29:14.020 --> 29:26.520
So the financial equivalent of wasted 70 years of economics is the efficient market hypothesis

29:26.520 --> 29:32.680
which ran the university finance system for 50 years.

29:32.680 --> 29:39.200
Again, a total waste of, worse than a waste, it was damaging, punishing and sending the

29:39.200 --> 29:41.120
world in the wrong direction.

29:41.120 --> 29:47.920
Eugene Fama and Ken French were my honors advisors at the University of Chicago and

29:47.920 --> 29:52.360
in the entire two years I was there, the word energy was never mentioned.

29:52.360 --> 29:58.440
Well, you demonstrated commendable restraint by standing your ground.

29:58.440 --> 30:03.640
That is a sneaky way of saying if you'd known what you were doing, you would have left and

30:03.640 --> 30:05.440
gone somewhere more sensible.

30:05.440 --> 30:10.200
I did that three years later after I started to figure it out.

30:10.200 --> 30:15.880
I was a high net worth salesman at Salomon Brothers and one of my clients eventually

30:15.880 --> 30:21.800
started to trade oil futures and I was learning about that and I was learning about how amazingly

30:21.800 --> 30:28.840
powerful this stuff is, how we don't pay for the cost of the externalities, the pollution

30:28.840 --> 30:31.640
and how it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime.

30:31.640 --> 30:37.000
So soon after that I quit and studied with Herman Daly and others.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.200
So that's how that happened.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.320
That was over 20 years ago, Jeremy.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
Yeah.

30:41.320 --> 30:49.880
No, it's surprising that you could have something so valuable as oil and metals and have them

30:49.960 --> 30:54.600
cost nothing except the cost of digging it out of the ground.

30:54.600 --> 31:02.040
And that is right there the fundamental flaw in economic theory and in our governance and

31:02.040 --> 31:07.400
expectations of our current system is we're only paying for the cost of extraction.

31:07.400 --> 31:16.920
And the sad part is looking back, all this magical pixie dust from that earth trickle

31:16.920 --> 31:22.680
charged from prior photosynthesis has been wasted, especially in the West.

31:22.680 --> 31:29.240
We don't really have anything to show for it, anything of long-term value.

31:30.680 --> 31:37.400
So piggybacking on something you said earlier that we were ham-fisted in our response to the

31:37.400 --> 31:44.920
Great Depression in 1929 and you hope that people could be more clever as opposed to

31:44.920 --> 31:47.640
not clever this time around.

31:47.640 --> 31:56.760
So with an energy lens and an ecological lens, how could we be more clever this time around

31:57.640 --> 31:58.280
in theory?

31:59.240 --> 32:00.440
That is pretty simple.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.440
You need a carbon tax.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.640
Now pigs will fly.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.480
No, that's not true.

32:07.480 --> 32:12.280
Eventually we'll all have carbon tax because we'll get desperate and everybody knows

32:12.840 --> 32:18.600
even the idiot economists get this right, that a carbon tax is far and away the most

32:18.600 --> 32:21.880
effective way of dealing with climate change.

32:23.080 --> 32:30.040
And you can bribe people into doing the right thing through subsidies, but it's very inefficient

32:30.040 --> 32:35.320
and expensive in contrast and it's just politically easier.

32:36.280 --> 32:42.440
So a carbon tax would be the first enormous step in the right direction.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.760
For two reasons.

32:44.760 --> 32:50.680
One is going to be politically unacceptable at the moment, which is half the people don't

32:50.680 --> 32:59.560
believe that climate and ocean absorption of our emissions is critical and urgent and human

32:59.560 --> 33:00.520
cost.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.240
So it will be politically difficult for that reason.

33:03.240 --> 33:07.880
But the other reason to have a carbon tax is to make this incredibly...

33:07.880 --> 33:08.840
I have to interrupt.

33:09.400 --> 33:15.400
Half of Americans, it is nothing like a half around the rest of the developed world.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.680
Good point, good point.

33:18.600 --> 33:25.880
Yeah, I read recently that if you know nothing at all and you just ask someone what their

33:25.880 --> 33:32.280
belief is on climate change, that the single biggest predictor of people's opinion on climate

33:32.280 --> 33:36.520
change is their political affiliation, which really tells you something.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.520
It's quite amazing.

33:41.240 --> 33:45.960
It tells you that we get information from different sources, among other things.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.480
Thank you for the clarification.

33:49.480 --> 33:54.120
Here's the other reason that a carbon tax would be helpful longer term.

33:55.080 --> 34:02.760
From the perspective of we're wasting this incredibly valuable substance, if there were a

34:02.760 --> 34:09.560
carbon tax, the prices would be more commensurate with its true cost and value.

34:11.560 --> 34:16.760
And so we would conserve, we would send the right signals to innovators and investors like

34:17.240 --> 34:26.600
yourself that this phone here might cost $3,000 because it's got a lot of non-renewable inputs

34:26.600 --> 34:32.760
in it, so there would be repair and different industries would crop up around that.

34:34.360 --> 34:40.920
But the challenge with such a carbon tax is we are in financial overshoot, not to mention

34:40.920 --> 34:48.440
ecological overshoot. So any realistic carbon tax today would prick the financial bubble

34:48.440 --> 34:51.160
even worse than the mean reversion you expect.

34:52.040 --> 34:58.760
Yeah, I think we shouldn't overlook the benefits of a carbon tax to government income.

35:02.280 --> 35:08.120
It would not only be a great source of income, but it would be taxing something you want people

35:08.120 --> 35:16.520
to use less of like tobacco instead of taxing labor that you want people to use more of.

35:17.320 --> 35:24.120
And it would be a much better way of raising money, but you would have to make sure that you

35:24.120 --> 35:33.320
reduced income tax on particularly the fore end of the spectrum to compensate for the tax on

35:34.280 --> 35:42.040
energy. But the rich people use 50 times more energy than the poor people around the world

35:42.840 --> 35:50.520
and maybe even within the country 10 or 20 times. As we get more desperate, sooner or later a

35:53.080 --> 35:58.680
political regime will find its way to do something that is effectively

35:59.000 --> 36:08.280
a tax on carbon. There is an 800 pound gorilla lurking around here that you're not aware of.

36:08.840 --> 36:18.840
And that is, I don't agree with only one part, one little slice of your argument as reflected

36:19.720 --> 36:31.240
so well in your 95-96 podcast. And that is the role of debt and finance in general.

36:31.800 --> 36:42.280
The good news is if you take all the people in this game of overshoot, living beyond our means

36:42.280 --> 36:49.480
is how I think of it. And you look at how much they obsess about finance and have done

36:50.360 --> 36:56.280
forever for 30, 40 years. And you go back and you take it all out of everything they ever said

36:56.280 --> 37:04.120
or ever wrote. It doesn't make any difference at all. It has not changed anything that they,

37:04.120 --> 37:11.560
in my opinion, have gotten it wrong. And it probably will continue not to change anything.

37:11.560 --> 37:17.880
So as long as they are generally heading in the right direction, everything will work out fine.

37:18.520 --> 37:28.600
But I think debt is the most misunderstood thing of all. And the reason is pretty clear.

37:29.640 --> 37:36.360
At the individual level, when you're making a list of what you're worth, you add up your assets

37:36.360 --> 37:41.960
and you subtract your debt. It is a negative. At the societal level,

37:44.040 --> 37:51.960
debt is not like gold. Debt is not like copper or like stock market, a claim on real corporations

37:51.960 --> 37:59.640
with real workers and real output. Debt is a zero entry. Debt is double entry bookkeeping.

38:00.200 --> 38:07.560
We might as well say, aren't the Japanese incredibly rich that they can lend so much money?

38:07.560 --> 38:12.920
But we don't say that. We say, look at the incredible Japanese debt. My God, they will collapse,

38:12.920 --> 38:20.920
as we have been saying for 40, 50 years, waiting for them to collapse unsuccessfully. I might add.

38:21.880 --> 38:31.320
Debt is shockingly misunderstood and exaggerated in significance. You cannot move resources through

38:31.320 --> 38:38.520
time, other than a few cans of bully beef in your basement, or at least make sure that the

38:38.520 --> 38:45.320
infrastructure is set up in good shape for your children. Other than that, you cannot move assets,

38:45.320 --> 38:52.280
you cannot move income. The Germans at least understood this with their social security.

38:52.280 --> 38:58.760
They know that it is a pay as you go. They don't pretend, as we used to, about lock boxes and

38:58.760 --> 39:07.240
social security going bust or accumulating. You only have the sum of your goods and services

39:07.240 --> 39:14.760
each year to pay your pensions. And if that goes down, you will have less either to pay the pensions

39:14.760 --> 39:21.960
or less for everybody else. It is not about debt claiming on the future. Debt does not claim on the

39:21.960 --> 39:29.880
future. What debt does is I give you my money today that I could spend and I lend it to you.

39:29.880 --> 39:35.800
That is not a claim on the future. It does not transfer income through time, but it scrambles

39:35.800 --> 39:41.960
everybody's thinking. And luckily, in this field of overshoot, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

39:42.040 --> 39:48.200
Well, you're a billionaire and I'm just a podcaster with a few rows of potatoes and a draft

39:48.200 --> 39:55.400
horse, but I am going to push back on that a little bit. Yes, you're right that so far it

39:55.400 --> 40:01.080
has not made a difference because so far we have lived in a world of rising energy access

40:02.360 --> 40:10.120
every year, with the exception of a couple of recessions. Yes, you're right that in a financial

40:10.120 --> 40:16.120
lens, it's a zero sum game. There are assets and liabilities. So from that perspective,

40:16.840 --> 40:23.640
it is a Pareto problem where the wealth gets more and more concentrated

40:24.280 --> 40:31.800
and the creditors end up having a larger share of that pie. But from a biophysical perspective,

40:32.440 --> 40:38.360
every time we create money via commercial banks or recently via central banks,

40:39.800 --> 40:46.600
there's the same amount of oil and forests and copper and dolphins. And so what ends up happening

40:46.600 --> 40:52.280
right now, the United States has increased our debt $1 trillion in the last three months.

40:52.280 --> 40:57.560
I mean, it's like almost a billion dollars an hour. Yes, that's allowing us to consume more today

40:57.560 --> 41:03.400
and it's papering over other problems and it's one of the reasons stock market and Bitcoin and

41:03.400 --> 41:10.600
other things are up. But eventually, when all this money has to be called in to be spent,

41:11.720 --> 41:17.320
that especially if we're on the downslope of oil and instead of 100 million barrels a day,

41:17.320 --> 41:24.760
we have 90 or 80 or 70, it's a musical chair sort of situation. So I agree with you that so far

41:24.760 --> 41:31.320
debt has not been a problem. But I think what it's done is it's an example of risk homeostasis

41:31.320 --> 41:36.040
that we've run a red light 10 times and nothing bad ever happened. That doesn't mean that running

41:36.040 --> 41:46.760
a red light isn't dangerous. I understand you have to protect your opinions. No, no, no, I want to

41:46.760 --> 41:52.200
learn. If you disagree, please educate me. I was counting on you saying that.

41:55.880 --> 42:01.320
Happily, I don't think it matters. So I don't want us to spend any more time because I have an

42:01.320 --> 42:09.800
eccentric view and plenty of people would think you're right. They share your view. Just one point

42:09.880 --> 42:20.920
though. I am only a billionaire by a strange and generous construction. And that is if you count

42:20.920 --> 42:29.480
the money I have given away, which is a pretty whimsical way of calculating someone's net worth.

42:29.480 --> 42:36.600
But in terms of what I actually have and could go out and buy my daughter back from being kidnapped

42:36.600 --> 42:47.640
tomorrow, I don't have a... I'm at least an order of magnitude short of that.

42:47.640 --> 42:53.640
Well, I actually think that is a wonderful way to define being a billionaire in the future,

42:53.640 --> 42:59.320
isn't it, going forward? That you count how much money you have given away towards pro-social,

42:59.400 --> 43:03.960
pro-future ends. I mean, that's a better definition, wouldn't you say?

43:04.840 --> 43:15.720
It would be conducive to better behavior, maybe. But it is important at least to get that out there.

43:17.480 --> 43:24.120
And most of what we have left, we see as a potential reserve for a rainy day.

43:25.080 --> 43:31.560
And incidentally, we have a rainy day in our foundation. Our foundation is about 1.4

43:33.000 --> 43:41.240
billion. And we have invested perhaps an unwisely large piece in venture capital,

43:41.960 --> 43:48.200
a large chunk of which is green venture capital. And the reason for that is we think that green

43:48.200 --> 43:54.840
venture capital, if you only invest in things that seem really important, and you concentrate on

43:54.840 --> 44:03.080
those that have a hard time raising the money, you'll end up with a risky portfolio, but on paper

44:03.080 --> 44:11.640
should give you, in a hundred deals, a very high return. And traditionally, it has. But every 15

44:11.640 --> 44:22.600
or 20 years, it participates in these, excuse me, in these bubbles. And so we get hammered and we

44:22.600 --> 44:30.200
become illiquid, and the companies call for the money that we've committed, and they stop funding

44:30.200 --> 44:40.360
it back, which we really count on. And that causes a liquidity squeeze. So times are tricky.

44:40.360 --> 44:48.280
I will say this, though, that I think a diversified package of important green venture capital

44:49.480 --> 44:58.760
drives the cause better than anything. Very hard for a dollar of grant to keep up with a dollar

44:58.760 --> 45:03.960
of green venture capital, because the green venture capital on average comes back with 15%

45:03.960 --> 45:11.720
profit and then goes out again, and out again, and out again. So those dollars can be really,

45:12.440 --> 45:19.240
in the long run, very, very effective. So what are some projects you're particularly excited

45:19.240 --> 45:27.160
about in the green venture capital area of your work? Well, if you started at the top end, what

45:27.160 --> 45:36.200
could be a get out of jail card from a conundrum or a potential get out of jail card, you would have

45:38.120 --> 45:49.000
infinite, cheap green energy, right? So that would be a huge help. And when solar and storage

45:50.360 --> 45:56.920
might make it, but we'd probably need an order of magnitude improvement in storage costs,

45:56.920 --> 46:05.480
a drop to 10 cents on the dollar. And we'll probably get it. It might take 10 or 20 years.

46:06.600 --> 46:19.960
And it might take, who knows, longer, shorter. But the other ones are geothermal. I am very optimistic

46:20.840 --> 46:27.400
that if we could take our incredible ingenuity and the experience and the trial and error from

46:27.400 --> 46:35.160
having drilled 200,000 racking wells, learning on the job, if we could take some of that

46:35.160 --> 46:42.280
skill set and move it to geothermal, there is a virtually infinite supply of energy

46:43.320 --> 46:49.240
under our feet. If we could learn through ingenious ways of drilling to handle the

46:49.240 --> 46:56.120
temperature, to frack it, to pick up the heat, turn it into either

46:59.800 --> 47:06.840
into electricity or even just into heat and do it here and there all over the planet,

47:06.840 --> 47:16.280
that would be huge. And next, an even more of a long shot is naturally occurring hydrogen.

47:16.920 --> 47:24.040
Hydrogen is obviously going to be incredibly useful, but getting it is energy intensive,

47:24.040 --> 47:29.960
so that really, in the current state of affairs, it's more like a battery than a source of energy.

47:29.960 --> 47:38.280
But naturally occurring hydrogen, of course, is a source of energy. And we don't know. In 10 years,

47:38.280 --> 47:46.200
it will probably be a done deal. We'll know that it's not a workable, impressive component.

47:47.240 --> 47:54.840
But it may be. And so that's pretty thrilling. And then we have fusion. There are maybe now 40

47:56.200 --> 48:02.680
diverse efforts, different efforts, and it's the difference that makes it interesting. I think

48:03.480 --> 48:10.040
one or two of them may well make it from an engineering technology point of view

48:11.000 --> 48:19.480
in a few decades. And that is, again, an infinite source of energy. What I worry about,

48:20.840 --> 48:25.560
we have a few investments, what I worry about for them is that by the time they make it,

48:26.360 --> 48:32.600
it may turn out that wind, solar, and storage has made so much steady progress,

48:32.600 --> 48:37.880
or that geothermal and naturally occurring hydrogen has, that they will not be necessary,

48:37.880 --> 48:45.240
that the capital cost will be too high to compete. But it may be fine. And we have to do it. We need

48:45.240 --> 48:52.920
to try everything. So I have a lot of follow-ups to that. If you were just an investor, I might leave

48:52.920 --> 49:01.880
it at what you just said. But I know you also are aware of the work of Patrick Ofles and ecologist

49:01.880 --> 49:09.080
William Reese, who are both on my podcast, Friends of Mine. And technology itself is necessary,

49:09.720 --> 49:15.080
but not sufficient to solve some of the larger issues. And climate change,

49:15.720 --> 49:21.160
from an ecological perspective, isn't the problem. It's a symptom of a much larger problem, which

49:21.160 --> 49:29.960
is overshoot. So in addition to technological green investments, we're also going to need

49:29.960 --> 49:36.200
something on the cultural and political side. Otherwise, the productivity from these new

49:36.840 --> 49:44.840
improvements that you're advocating and hoping for will just be fed back into a global energy

49:44.840 --> 49:49.720
and resource consumptive system, if GDP is our goal. What are your thoughts about that?

49:50.040 --> 49:58.200
So nearly infinite cheap green energy is a very helpful but not sufficient condition.

50:00.120 --> 50:10.840
I do not think there is any hope of creating a degrowth culture profound enough or quickly enough

50:10.840 --> 50:21.400
to save our bacon. I do think we can tip it slowly on the margin in that direction. What I think

50:23.480 --> 50:33.560
may save the day is population. Population, particularly in the high resource areas,

50:34.280 --> 50:43.240
is dropping rapidly. And by population standards, it's nose diving. And nobody really appreciates

50:43.240 --> 50:50.200
the speed at which it's dropping. To take the extreme case, the career has a fertility rate,

50:50.760 --> 50:58.920
South Korea, of 0.8 last year, and not much higher the five years before that. At 0.8,

50:58.920 --> 51:06.840
it means in three generations, 100 years, your baby cohort will be 6.5% of what it is today.

51:06.840 --> 51:14.680
Basically, you're out of business. And if I am right in what I see as the reasons for this,

51:14.680 --> 51:22.600
it is highly likely that the population of high energy, high resource using rich countries

51:22.600 --> 51:38.920
and China, will be substantially lower in, let us say, by 2200. I think we could drift down

51:39.960 --> 51:47.160
to about 2 billion people, which we could sustain. And it's only that piece of incredible,

51:47.160 --> 51:52.680
you could say good luck. If we can hold the system together under the stress of going to 2

51:52.680 --> 52:02.200
billion people, combined with nudging us towards a degrowth philosophy and understanding that we

52:02.200 --> 52:09.160
have to restructure ourselves to live within our limits, that gives us a decent chance of making

52:09.160 --> 52:15.080
it. And to have cheap green energy would make a big improvement in the odds.

52:15.080 --> 52:21.880
So let me clarify something. So the global population is still increasing. The global

52:21.880 --> 52:29.640
population growth rate, I think, peaked in 1965 and has been declining ever since then.

52:29.640 --> 52:37.800
But we are still, net births over deaths is around plus 80 million humans per year.

52:38.760 --> 52:44.680
And that's declining. But it's still growing, the total population. So

52:45.720 --> 52:52.520
are you saying, because Elon Musk has a much different perspective, he thinks global population

52:52.520 --> 53:00.520
decline is the biggest risk that humans face. So population is, do we have too many people or

53:00.520 --> 53:08.840
not enough? And how do you marry those two views? I'm only interested in births,

53:08.840 --> 53:19.320
because in the end, accumulating retirees doesn't really matter. The long-term well-being of the

53:19.320 --> 53:27.960
species depends on young people. Except there are some people in your sphere that are advocating

53:27.960 --> 53:33.480
for longevity and that we're going to, with AI and other things, we're going to live to be 120

53:33.480 --> 53:38.600
or 130, which would also have an ecological impact if that comes to pass.

53:39.640 --> 53:47.400
For 60, 70 years, I mean, the fact is, they die off. The dynamics that matter are the dynamics

53:47.400 --> 53:53.960
of young people and how many children they have. You can have an army of old people.

53:54.920 --> 54:03.400
And that long-term significance is negligible. Once you know the flight path of babies,

54:04.040 --> 54:08.040
you know the flight path of 20-year-olds, you know the flight path of the economy.

54:08.680 --> 54:19.000
Yes, there is a risk that dropping at this speed will stress out the economy. And we will,

54:19.560 --> 54:26.440
in 20 years, think that we're poor and that we can't afford to do the necessary things

54:26.440 --> 54:36.360
on the environment to protect our existence. That would be very sad. On the other hand,

54:36.360 --> 54:45.880
if AI is half as good as some people believe, it will mesh very well with a rapid decline

54:45.960 --> 54:52.280
in workforce. And we will have a rapid decline in workforce. I rather hope there is

54:53.400 --> 55:02.280
a brilliant development in AI so they can look after the old folk and so on. And life will go on

55:03.320 --> 55:10.600
holding together. That's the big trick. Can we hold together to 2200 to arrive in a world

55:10.600 --> 55:20.440
where there are 2 billion people, including the old fogies, and where we could be a world where

55:20.440 --> 55:27.560
at least half of the land is rewilded and we're living eventually within our means?

55:28.680 --> 55:33.480
And it may not be 2 billion, it may be 1 billion, it may be 2.5, but it's going to be something like

55:33.480 --> 55:43.080
that. I know that the advocates of AI who are aware and concerned about climate change do think

55:43.080 --> 55:49.800
that AI can solve climate change. And for the same reason I mentioned before, Jevons Paradox,

55:50.360 --> 55:56.360
artificial intelligence can make things more efficient and do demand side management for

55:56.360 --> 56:05.880
our energy use and all those things. But it can't do at least not AI, maybe AGI, it can't do wisdom.

56:05.880 --> 56:12.760
So it's not going to change our cultural objective or cultural aspirations. And I actually think the

56:12.760 --> 56:20.120
declining labor force, which you're talking about, is from smaller baby cohorts. AI is going to do that

56:20.120 --> 56:25.080
because it's going to take people's jobs away. And so I think there's a real wealth and income

56:25.080 --> 56:31.400
inequality risk with AI that gets thrown into this picture as well. Do you have any thoughts there?

56:32.040 --> 56:41.240
Yes, I'm on this topic rather pleased with myself because 15 years ago I wrote a little

56:41.240 --> 56:51.880
piece about the country club on the beach being served by androids. And the

56:54.440 --> 57:05.800
last human supervisor slash helpers has just been talked about in a message that

57:05.800 --> 57:14.280
one of the androids has sent to his fellows that Fred, a nice guy as he is, is really starting

57:14.280 --> 57:23.240
to get in the way. And after that point, there is no productivity per man hour. There is only

57:23.240 --> 57:32.760
productivity per robot hour, or if you will, return on capital. And the capital owners sit in the

57:32.760 --> 57:42.120
country club. And around the perimeter, one might think barbed wire, there are hordes of

57:43.560 --> 57:49.880
other humans who have no job and are therefore totally useless and worthless, etc., etc.,

57:50.600 --> 57:58.840
hoping for some handouts from the country club. And the real job of government in AI

57:59.560 --> 58:09.480
is an income dispersion job. Let us imagine that world in 300 years when we've been really lucky

58:09.480 --> 58:15.880
and have survived all these other existential threats. And the robots are doing all the work.

58:18.440 --> 58:24.840
Do the capital owners get everything? Do the rest just disappear and starve? Or long before that,

58:24.840 --> 58:33.240
do they revolt and get put down by the robots or vice versa? And so on. But an enlightened government

58:33.240 --> 58:40.120
will move to head that stuff off pretty quickly by making sure that there is a fairly broad,

58:40.120 --> 58:46.680
acceptable income distribution. And we are already falling foul of that. Our income distribution

58:47.480 --> 58:55.080
in the US is no longer passing that test. It has resulted in the estrangement,

58:55.640 --> 59:04.680
almost bitterness and anger of at least a third of the general public who feels they have been

59:04.680 --> 59:10.760
badly treated. And I think you could make a pretty good case that, yes, they have been royally screwed

59:10.840 --> 59:16.760
since about 1975. That's why I'm less sanguine on some of these electric car

59:18.200 --> 59:23.800
forecasts and things like that. Because as of now, as the sugar high from the COVID stimulus

59:23.800 --> 59:31.240
is waning, I think I saw a stat last week that 50% of Americans cannot afford a car payment

59:31.240 --> 59:38.120
at today's rates with higher interest rates built in. So, you know, we're one of the richest

59:38.120 --> 59:42.520
nations in the world, but the wealth is certainly not evenly distributed.

59:43.560 --> 59:50.840
Right. And if you think of car payment, much more important really is house payment. And

59:52.680 --> 01:00:01.320
buying a house, it's such a high unaffordability index now. Peak prices as a multiple of family

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:11.080
income times 7.8% mortgage. You're sitting there down in Washington with a mortgage of 2.7 real

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:20.760
story. It's pretty hard to move to Boston at 7.8 or 7.9. That is a brutal increase in your cost.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:32.040
So, cars, houses, and real life, this is not a super comfortable world for everyone below half

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:40.840
way on the income scale. And it's not that great in the last 30 years from the 50th percentile

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:52.440
till about the 20th. It's been great for the 0.1. So, most people think that all capitalism

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.040
is the same thing, but you frequently pointed out that American capitalism is unique.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.880
What do you mean by this? And what are the alternatives? And ultimately, I want to get to,

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:13.240
is there a different way that we can allocate capital, our scarce capital, which is energy,

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.040
resources, and our impact on ecosystems going forward? What are your thoughts on that?

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:28.680
We have fallen in many ways on bad times from about 1975. From about 1930 to 75,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.560
everybody got richer at about the same rate. There was a very slight tendency for the poorer

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:49.560
to outgrow the richer. And so, by about 1965 to 75, we reached, by American standards anyway,

01:01:49.880 --> 01:02:05.240
a rather egalitarian level. And people frequently quote the 4,500 CEOs earning 40 times, which

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:13.800
turns out to be about what the Japanese CEOs were earning too. And now, 50 years later, the Japanese

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:24.520
CEOs earn 40 or 50 times their worker, average worker. And we yield about 250 to 400 depending

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:32.360
on who's doing the calculating. But it is, you have to say obscene. It's unnecessary too.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:40.360
Most of these people are very average qualities. The people who start their own darn firm,

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:52.440
like Mr. Musk. And in a sense, they deserve what they get. People who start a new enterprise,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.720
when you've paid all the rent and you've paid all the salaries, what's left is yours.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.000
I get that. That's capitalism. It's the best part of capitalism. When you put a bunch of

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.960
your buddies on the board, and you decide to give yourself $200 million of stock options over

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:19.400
three years because they're your friends, that isn't capitalism. That is the stock option culture

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:31.480
gone wrong. And it has been aided and abetted by increasing monopoly. Every industry in America

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.320
has become more concentrated. And in more recent years, you have had the fashion

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:46.200
of cutting back on capex. Capex is real life. It's up and down. It's unpredictable.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.880
It makes your earnings volatile. Who needs capex? So let us use that money to buy our stock back.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.680
Buying stock bags is said to be a dividend. It has many dividend-like qualities, but it has

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.040
one incredibly significant difference. And that is a dividend goes neutrally to everybody.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:15.400
Stock buybacks constantly take out the least optimistic of your stockholders. And if you can

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:21.800
find a way month in, month out of getting rid of your least optimistic stockholders, you better

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:28.680
believe you're living in a different world from a bland, universally delivered dividend.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:34.280
And so you push the stock price up, and the evidence is completely compatible with that view.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:46.760
A combination of all these things has increased the inequality, has enabled the excessive payment

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:53.160
of most CEOs who, to be friendly, bring along a handful of their top management with them.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:03.880
And bear down quite hard and quote efficiently, or hard heartedly, you could argue, if you were a

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:11.880
humanitarian, they bear down on the workers. And in that, the government has helped them along.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:20.120
Government has allowed the inequality, the Gini ratio, to worsen in the US through every

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:28.200
administration except Bill Clinton's, where it was flat. He did not generate enough momentum

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.880
to send the pendulum swinging back a bit, but he held it for eight years.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:40.440
And nobody else, including Obama did, it continued to become more unequal. And in more

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.400
recent years, of course, the whole tax structure has been moved away from capital,

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:53.400
therefore, by default, to labor. If you lower the tax on dividends and interest, and capital gains

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:59.320
tax, you must understand that you are increasing it on everything else, which is to say the ordinary

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:07.320
people. And that has been a very profound transition. We are now as unequal as Mexico and

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.520
Brazil. And we used to use them back in the 60s and 70s as kind of the robber barons. And now

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:21.320
we're with them. It's not that they have improved, it's we have joined them in an equally unequal

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.960
society. Well, tying that back to what you said earlier, about 2002 started a tripling in commodity

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:38.120
prices that had, that acted as a tax on our society. And to stick our fingers in the dyke,

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:46.440
as it were, we went to debt and central banks started to grow their balance sheet. And via,

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:53.320
I think it's called the cantillon effect, that those that are closest to the monetary spigot

01:06:53.320 --> 01:07:01.400
gets the most benefits, that benefited asset holders and not the general public. So we're

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.640
papering over our economic problems with central bank reactions, but it's not helping the average

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:13.160
person. It's more going to the people who are ready, our asset holders.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:21.640
Yeah, I don't see it as papering over. But it is undeniable that if you push up the price

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:26.760
of assets through pushing down interest rates, you will increase inequality because the rich

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:32.040
own the assets and the poor do not. And that is precisely what happened. And I think the Federal

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:40.200
Reserve has played the biggest role in doing that Greenspan and his, it appears almost as

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:47.320
acolytes since then, they have all followed pretty much his, his flight path. So yes, that

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:54.760
increases inequality. And when you lower the rates, you also make debt available to people

01:07:54.760 --> 01:08:03.000
who can handle borrowing, that is to say, private equity and hedge funds and leverage in general.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:11.480
That is a windfall game. You're giving free money for these marginal economic activities.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:17.400
And the only purpose in which really when you look at the bottom line is the enrichment of

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:23.160
the people who run the private equity firms that the value created for society is negligible,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:28.920
according to almost every academic study. And they have, they have pretty good lives.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.200
But, and they are some of the main beneficiaries and, and they do change,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.760
they change reality by making, by bidding up the price of corporations and helping increase

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:49.400
the overpricing of the stock market. How would the United States as the example of,

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.480
of where we both reside at the moment, how could we shift away from American capitalism

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:02.280
and as even possible? Or would it have to happen during a crisis or are there policies and ways

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.360
that, that we could change it ahead of a big financial crisis?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:15.960
It used to be considered, for example, that a stock buyback was a manipulative and it was

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:25.000
illegal until the mid seventies or later, all the way from the 1930s. You know, you have to

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.920
have a policeman at the corner of broad and wall in order for things to work pretty well. You have

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:38.840
to keep an eye on them. And other things being even to have companies buy their stock back

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:49.720
whenever they feel like it. And it's, it's not a great idea. I think let them pay a dividend,

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:58.440
but let them keep their nose out of the stock market. It is too easily manipulated and was

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:05.080
banned for a very good reason and was unbanned for also a very comprehensible reason, which was to

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:11.480
be nice to corporations. And it is nice to corporations and it's a big part of the inequality

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.120
equation. But then you have reform of the Fed. I think the Fed has been given far too many

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:26.360
responsibilities. If it was just responsible for making sure there was a decent amount of

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:36.120
money available to deal with the economy of that age and allow, quote, the government to

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.640
have to worry about other things. But to have the Fed worried about inflation, about growth,

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:51.240
about this unemployment and dumb. It's to pretty well guarantee it will settle for some simple

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:57.800
policy of making rates cheap. Rates cheap was terrible for retirees. They were not getting

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.000
paid anything after adjustment for inflation, which people have forgotten all about after 20 years.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.040
They, they, they were being charged for the privilege of putting their money into fixed income.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.200
And everyone had told them that as they got older, they should have more and more

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:20.520
as a percentage in fixed income. And suddenly for the last 15 years, they have had little or no

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:28.200
return until today. Suddenly, they're now getting paid. They, they're awash with money, these people

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.240
in compared to where they were two years ago. They, you know, they're getting five, six percent,

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:41.640
seven percent, whereas they were getting nothing a few minutes ago. So I think reform of the Fed

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:51.880
and no stock buybacks. And I would be even careful about stock options. Pay people an honest amount

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.840
of money on which they pay an honest tax. And if you think they're great, pay them a lot of money.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:06.360
But stock options, stock grants, stock buybacks has created in the real world, I think,

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:14.120
a kind of rather nasty stew that is in favor of the top handful. I wouldn't mind reforming boards,

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.400
too, to make sure they had one or two worker representatives in the larger corporations,

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:26.840
and, and one or two outsiders and not, not wall-to-wall friends of the chairman.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:35.800
Or, or maybe one or two stand-ins conceptually as members of other species who have no say

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.720
in our economic decisions. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, when people say to me,

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:53.800
what should America do? My semi-frivolous answer is we should hand over our government to a

01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.040
consortium of the Scandinavian countries. Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Lord knows they have

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:05.720
to get elected. They have on paper all the problems that we have in that respect. And yet,

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.520
they have sensible policies aimed at the well-being of their people. On social measures,

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:21.160
they do better in everything than we do. The life expectancy in Sweden 30 years ago was two years

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.960
longer. And now it's eight years longer. When do we, when do we blow the whistle and say something

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.960
is going drastically wrong? But if you look at any measure, educational achievement,

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:41.480
number of women who die in childbirth, everything you could list, they score better.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.720
I was just there in Stockholm and I was really impressed. And there's just a different feeling

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:53.640
there, Jeremy, in Europe more generally as well, but in Scandinavia for sure.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:14:01.320
Let me ask you this. I didn't plan on asking you this, but it bothers me a lot.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:11.400
It seems our current culture self-selects for candidates for National Political Office

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:19.240
senators, congressmen, presidents. It almost self-selects for sociopathic type personalities

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:27.560
that care about themselves in a narcissistic profit connection power sort of way. And we've

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:36.760
gone very far away from, I want to help this country because I feel obligated to, I feel

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:44.040
a fiduciary to making the future better, like a real civic responsibility. Can the politicians

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:50.840
that we have now understand the type of things that you're saying? You mentioned earlier enlightened

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:58.600
politicians, which in our current society seems like an oxymoron to me. What are your thoughts on

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.200
that? Is there hope that we could have a different system that is commensurate with not only the

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.240
financial and resource risks that you've pointed out, but the ecological and climate ones?

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:18.200
As an individual, I tend to agree with the tone of what you're saying, but how we would get there,

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.080
I haven't a clue. Can we get there? I haven't a clue.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:35.000
It is disturbing and one should feel discouraged, and I do, but I have no idea what to do about it.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:42.120
Well, I think politicians get to be politicians because they're elected by people, so I think

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.960
we need a cultural shift, but we also need institutional change. So based on what you

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:54.520
were earlier saying, does there need to be a fundamental change in the way business is done

01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:01.880
as an alternative to the mega corporations, multinational corporations centered around

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:08.920
just shareholder value in addition to the reducing stock options and the board restrictions that

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:16.920
you mentioned earlier? Fundamentally, extraction of finite non-rubber resources turned to

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:26.440
concentrated profits is kind of our Homo sapiens 2020s model. Does that need to be shifted and how?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.080
It feels like a huge hill, doesn't it, that we've got to push this rock up?

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:41.640
And how do you improve things this basic?

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:51.400
The rather disturbing fact for me is that the older I've gotten, the more aware I've become

01:16:52.280 --> 01:17:05.560
of how little processed information the average guy has. He's concerned with Oshi,

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:15.800
that making a living, paying the rent, bombarded by political views, particularly now

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:32.520
in the world of X and so on. And I'm extremely sympathetic. In general, from a financial point

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:42.040
of view, they've been very badly treated. But the level of processed information of just

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:50.920
what passes for the hardest facts we can get out there is so little appreciated.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:59.560
It reminds me of the famous quote from Churchill about, you know, if you want to

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:06.520
be frightened about the future of democracy, try five minutes with the average voter.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:21.240
That will do it. And how do you address that? And it's the work of many decades and many governments

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:31.320
all trying to be modestly sensible. And what is the social contract in a nutshell?

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:38.680
That's the bottom line. How responsible for our neighbor's well-being do we feel?

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:48.360
How willing to sacrifice a bit for the well-being of everybody, are we? And the answer is not as

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:57.080
much as we used to. You know, back in the day, particularly in World War II, everyone pulled

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:02.040
together. Everyone knew they had to give up this, that, and the other because it was necessary,

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:09.560
because it was necessary. And everybody did. And they were not unhappy. So I grew up as a little

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.920
kid in World War II. And it was people spoke to each other a whole lot more than they did,

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:23.640
I am told, than they did a bit later. And it certainly seemed in many ways like a fairly

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.680
cheerful era, because everyone was suffering, but everyone was suffering together. Everyone was

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:40.200
trying hard. Almost everybody had a job, etc., etc. And the social contract was very strong.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:48.200
And the same in the US, the US, the UK. And it's pretty strong in Scandinavia. It's very strong

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:55.320
in Japan. You know, in Japan, got to tell you this story, because that government was incompetent

01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:01.720
on, in my opinion, on COVID. It went out of its way, and only two respects. It said,

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.760
you absolutely do not have to wear a mask if you don't want to. You absolutely do not have to be

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.000
vaccinated if you don't want to. It's your complete civic right to do what you want.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:18.360
And, and they, and that was their contribution. And what did the Japanese people do? They all

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.960
wore masks, and then they all got vaccinated. And they had the oldest population in the world.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:30.680
And we know that was the main variable for catching COVID. And they had one in 20,

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:40.040
they had 5% of the death rate that the US had. Amazing demonstration of social cohesion,

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:46.360
looking after each other, and also being generally fit and leaner than we are,

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.960
which is also, again, part of, in a way, part of the social contract, sensible behavior.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:21:01.000
I have a bunch of more questions for you. I just want to thank you briefly. I know you're very

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.080
humble on your contributions, but these are the type of conversations our culture needs.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:17.480
You're not humble? Well, you're humble relative to other people like you that I know. We'll say

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:29.960
that. Instead, I don't see, I don't see giving money away as philanthropy, because I'm not,

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:36.200
I'm not giving it to help the poor. I'm not giving it to the hospitals, not giving it to the schools.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:46.360
Right? I am saying, we have a problem. We, the people, my grandchildren, let us do whatever we

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:54.840
can to stay afloat. And, you know, poverty will always be with us, and I do care about it, but

01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:02.360
my limited resources better focus on what I think the most likely thing is to derail the whole

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:09.880
society. I consider everything we have spent to be defensive, defensive for my family,

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:17.800
and in a sense, everyone else gets a free ride. So I wouldn't want you to construe this as fabulous

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:28.280
philanthropy. I consider it sensible, long-term behavior for me and mine, and for everyone I'm

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:37.480
interested in. Fair enough. I didn't say you were generous. I said you were humble. You don't call

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:45.480
attention to your own accolades, but the reason I wanted to give you that praise is because our

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:55.560
culture rewards and lauds financial and economic success. And so you are very successful in that

01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:03.880
realm, and yet you're putting most of your investments, your wealth, into climate research,

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:12.360
climate tech, because you've determined that that is our existential risk. But beyond that, you also

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:21.480
care about bird loss and endocrine disrupting chemicals and many other environmental issues.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.080
So my reason for calling it out is you're one of the very few financial icons that is talking deeply

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:36.840
about our environmental risks. And I wish more people would integrate that into their business

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:43.240
decisions, into their values, and into their philanthropy. That's the point I was making there.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:53.960
I don't get why so few people with money do not realize the opportunities they have to improve

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.720
the situation and how desperate it is that they do that. I just don't get it because they're smart,

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:10.200
and this is not rocket science. This is really obvious. I'm also very big on toxicity and we

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:17.080
should, and I know you've covered it in a few of your... Yeah, so Seanis Wan was one of my first

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:23.320
guests, and I know you funded her research on sperm decline. Why don't you talk about that a bit,

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:30.440
Jeremy? Yeah, and she talks about it wonderfully well, which is part of the reason we support her.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:38.760
But people don't realize that toxicity is, I believe, moving faster than climate change

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:49.640
and will be more deadly. What we have done is we have created a world which is hostile to life

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.880
in almost every form, including our own.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:04.440
To take insides, the biomass is down at least 50 percent, maybe as much as 75,

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:12.680
just the weight of all of those little critters. If you talk to an insect expert, too late for

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:19.800
you to have a podcast with EO Wilson, but together with two of my colleagues, I badgered him for

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:29.160
about three hours until he was obviously weak. But he couldn't get away because it is exciting

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.360
always when you're talking to people who are thrilled by what you've spent your life doing.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:41.880
And we were asking him, can you give us some proof of the damage that will be done as insects

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:48.200
implode? And they're dropping at almost 2 percent a year. Anyone who knows anything about compounding

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:58.440
knows that that is catastrophic. And he believed profoundly. He was the ant man. He believed that

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:06.680
if we lost insects, we would probably go out of business ourselves. And he couldn't prove it.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:12.600
Why couldn't he prove it? Because there hadn't been many research programs. There was no money

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:20.120
in insects, no funding. And the interaction of all the insects is one of the most colossally

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:29.080
complicated systems out there. And very, very hard to study. But in almost every environment,

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:36.440
we measure a great loss of insects. Similarly, if you look at human sperm count,

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.240
it's dropping at the same rate of insects between one and a half, two percent a year.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:49.240
And what we did, because we can, because we're not academics, when the first Shana

01:26:49.320 --> 01:27:01.640
Swan report came out with Hagai Levine, that's kind of co-boss, we rapidly extended it backwards

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:10.920
and forwards. We extended it backwards to 1945, the age of DDT and so on, hugely damaging for

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:17.560
insects, hugely damaging for humans. And we extended it back at half the rate that they

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:26.520
had proven from 1973 to 2017. And then we extended it forward for six years at just the same rate,

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:31.800
despite the fact that Hagai Levine said that if anything, it seemed to be accelerating.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.400
And then we did fund the program for them to back it up for six years. And they found that,

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.720
indeed, it was accelerating. So our extension had been conservative. And we used half the rate

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.840
back to 1945, which is almost certainly conservative. And our total, which we'd been

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:58.840
using for years before they managed to do the follow-up, showed that there was a 60 percent

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:08.360
from 1945 to 2021, when we were talking about it, the 60 percent drop in the sperm count

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:18.200
in the developed world. And you can say, and China. And what that means is real trouble.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:27.240
Now, we were over-engineered, I like to say, like a Victorian bridge. So dropping to almost 50 percent,

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:32.600
40, 50 percent didn't matter. But beyond that, it suddenly started to matter a lot. And we have

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:39.400
gone from a rounding error of young couples having trouble getting pregnant to about 15 percent.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.840
And the international health guys come out the other day and say it's one in seven, which is

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.520
exactly what we agree with. What they didn't have the nerve to say was that 30 years earlier,

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:56.120
it was pretty well zero. That it had gone from nobody having trouble to one in seven having

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.160
trouble. And it's accelerating at 2 percent a year, which means come back in 20 years,

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:07.560
and there will be hell to pay for ordinary people around the world having children. And this is all

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:14.360
because of the stuff that was covered in China's one episode two, I think, that there's so many

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:23.240
endocrine disruptors. I believe the data suggests that pesticides on fruit and vegetables are the

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.840
main culprit. Pesticides on fruit and vegetables eaten by pregnant women are probably half of all

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:39.960
the damage done by chemicals to humans. And it is it is an enormous amount. There were a couple of

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:48.040
studies that looked at men at Harvard and Mass General, arguably best hospital or a candidate

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:56.200
in America. And yes, there were only like 800 of them. But for six months, they looked at them

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.520
whether they were eating more chemicals or less chemicals based on the kind of fruit

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:07.400
self reported. And the top quartile had twice the sperm count of the bottom quartile. And then

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:13.640
the following year, they did women having trouble showing up at the clinic. And the ones who had

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:21.480
the best diet had 65 percent successful births. And the ones who had the in the worst quarter

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:30.120
had had 38. Just shocking, amazing, with that kind of power in the data. Yes, you should have huge

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:37.160
follow up studies, no money, no follow up studies. But it suggests that we're on our way out of

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.840
business. And that's what high guy Levine says. It seems that we're going out of business. At this

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:55.080
rate, 2030, 40 years, and we hit the fan bang. And it scrambles everything else we talk about,

01:30:55.080 --> 01:31:02.040
Nate, everything we're obsessing about is affected by this by this shocking drop in in

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:08.520
fertility. So you you you were probably not surprised to know that I have many follow up

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:15.720
questions to that. So I know you know, Shawna and supported her work, her recent paper, her

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:22.600
latest paper, which was released after the podcast I did with her a show that the sperm drop

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.440
is accelerating and be that it's not just a United States thing, it's it's global.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.280
Right. And is it also extended nonhumans like to animals?

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.600
They covered that a little bit in the first study that there were some footnotes that suggested

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.960
that dogs had been tested and that they were just the same having just the same trouble.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:57.480
But we we can deduce from insect problems that that is a major impact. We can also

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:04.920
sadly deduce from the insects that we we are in the cascade effect that ear Wilson and the rest

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:14.360
of them have so worried about, which is to say, the best study was in Germany, where they had

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:24.520
thousands of citizen helpers, many of whom had PhDs and so on, by the way. And they were

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:31.320
amazingly Germanic and thorough in their study. And they put out these nets in exactly the same

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.440
part of the forest, you know, on the same day of the year sort of thing. And they and they gathered

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:43.400
them all. And they were just amazed over the passage of decades, how quickly they all declined.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:51.560
It was like 85% decline. Yes. Germany has not been particularly badly behaved in the last 20 years.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:59.400
What is happening, in my opinion, is that they are paying the price now for the massive

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.680
breakup of the countryside that went on in World War One and World War Two, where they were kind

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:13.800
of, in a sense, blockaded and beginning to starve and growing food wherever they possibly could and

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:20.040
breaking down what had been very extensive forests in Germany and and and growing food.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:27.800
And that has made Germany just less fitting for insects. And then you you tend to pull

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:35.080
the amount of pesticides you're throwing at it. Bear in mind, this study was done in forest preserves.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:41.400
So you you have to have such a mass of chemicals that it's blowing in the wind,

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.080
running in in the streams and even in the rain, to some extent.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:54.920
And and and then you have the temperature and the temperature has very little effect in Germany.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:00.840
But at the same time, they did a study in Puerto Rico. And we spoke at great lengths very quickly

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:07.640
to the person who did that study so early that he was very, very happy to talk to us.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:16.200
Later, he became quite trendy. But in this forest preserve set up by the king of Spain,

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:22.280
hundreds of years ago, in Puerto Rico, what they found was almost certainly that heat

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:29.080
is making tropical insects sterile. In the tropics, the temperature varies very seldom.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.440
So they have a spiking heat, you know, one or two days a year, and suddenly it's 12 days a year.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:42.920
And this bright spark at the University of East Anglia, grabbed one of these tropical beetles

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:48.920
and started to experiment with heat. And he exposed them to a week of abnormal heat.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.520
And and they their fertility rate halved. And then after a couple of weeks to recover,

01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:00.600
they gave them another week and they were sterile. And that element is going on in the tropics,

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:09.160
where it will be, of course, deadly because they are having this huge increase in extreme hot days.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:15.160
And it is making the insects sterile. And so all over Brazil, the insect mass

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:23.240
will be dropping just as fast. I know Shauna and many people in her network

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.360
are friends of mine. One of them is on my board. And many of them tell me that

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:36.760
endocrine disrupting chemical pollution may be a bigger risk to humans in the future than

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:45.160
climate change. So wouldn't it be something if the biggest danger of a barrel of oil and natural gas

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:52.600
isn't the emissions, but is the plastics and related things that that come from it?

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:59.160
How can this be happening with so few people in the world? Everyone's focused on GDP and

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:07.560
consumption and Netflix and smorgasbord and vacations miss the fact that we are undergoing

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:13.720
ecocide of the world's insects, which are trillions of tiny robots doing tasks that

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:22.040
humans could never replace by ourselves. Yeah, it is an incredible, almost unbelievable

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:32.760
description of homo sapiens that we would be so reluctant to face up to reality, which is,

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:38.520
in a sense, freely available. The data is there. It's very high quality data is peer reviewed.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:45.720
It's done over and over again. My conclusion is if we do not end up banning most chemicals,

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:53.400
including plastics, we will go out of business. By that, you mean human extinction?

01:36:54.040 --> 01:37:03.640
Yeah, human, the loss of a reasonably stable global civilization that we may have pockets and so on

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:11.800
here and there. But what we know of as a reasonably acceptable life will be gone. And there are

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:18.280
parts where people are not exposed to chemicals and they will do much better.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:27.080
But they are exposed to heat and some of those very parts, the heat and the humidity will get so

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:35.080
bad that they will not be able to exist in the open air doing agriculture. So they might become

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:41.880
hunter gatherers kind of in the pockets where they can deal with the humidity, keeping the shade

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:50.280
and so on and live off fruit and nuts. But life will be tough. For the stock market, by the way,

01:37:51.080 --> 01:38:01.480
long before then, you have a situation where owning chemicals will be more exposed to lawsuits

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.160
than even oil companies, which is a very high hurdle because they're getting sued all over the

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:16.120
place now because they knew and they paid money to obfuscate their knowledge just like the tobacco

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:24.680
companies did. And they may have cost us 10 or 15 years or more. And for that, they should pay a lot

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.920
to help us get out of the hole that they have helped us dig deeper than we would without them,

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.000
but if I look around my office, pretty much everything that I'm looking at with the exception

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:46.520
of maybe a glass drinking jar has plastic in it. How would we remotely begin to use bamboo and hemp

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:55.320
and other products to replace the ubiquity of plastics in our current system? It boggles the mind.

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:09.080
I have an advantage over you all in that I remember being in my bathtub as a about a four-year-old,

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:17.560
three-year-old, and my mother came in with a little Bakelite sailing ship for my bathtub,

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:24.360
and this was a mottled brown plastic boat. And that was the first plastic

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:32.760
that came across my life. Bakelite was effectively one of the first one or two plastics ever made,

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:43.800
thermosetting, hard, not flexible, soft, like polyethylene. And everything around me,

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:51.400
as in everything, everything we fought a damn war with had no plastics, guys. It can be done.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:40:02.120
And it is amazing how good we are at sucking it up and replacing and making do when we have to.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:11.640
And this is something that most people in our business, Nate, underestimate. They think we all

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:19.720
kind of lie down and die because we can't have our luxuries and our two showers a day

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:26.280
and our plastics. And it just ain't going to be so. We're going to be tough as nails pretty damn

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:33.880
quickly and we're going to get by and we're going to replace, we can replace plastics. We know that

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.280
because we lived in a pre-plastic world quite recently. And we're going to have to find a way

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:49.640
of using materials from nature. And again, you can't grow and do that. It stresses out. We don't

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:56.120
have the capabilities, the resources. But if they're combined with a declining population,

01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:07.400
we very well may. So we have to replace petroplastics with bioplastics and cellulosic fibers and so

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:13.640
on. And we can do that and have done it and the potential for more discoveries are massive.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:25.000
We can have vats of microbes doing photosynthesis and producing a cellulosic sludge or a material

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.320
sludge. And my semi-joke is you then build buildings out of cross-laminated sludge,

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:41.560
having stiffened it up a bit with this and that. But it has to be biologic and industrial scale,

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:52.520
biologic material and food. It doesn't sound very appetizing, but you can have microbes

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:59.720
generate protein sludge. And you can have raspberry flavored protein sludge guaranteed

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:08.760
not to have any plastics, guaranteed not to have any toxins. And we can do this. We can combine

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:17.400
technology and all the accumulated learning of thousands of years to the task at hand. And if

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:24.840
we do that, we will make it. And if we're dopey and slow, we won't make it. It is, as I like to say,

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.760
the race of our lives. But we do have a chance of making it.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:36.920
You're a hedge fund manager, lifelong investor, but also a philanthropist. Although you say that

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:42.520
that's selfishly for your own family and grandchildren to have a livable biosphere.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:48.840
But given what we face and the things we've discussed on this call of biophysical limits,

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:55.080
climate, endocrine disrupting chemicals, changing geopolitics, do you have advice

01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:04.120
for other philanthropists or investors who have benefited from living through a unique

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:10.040
period of the carbon pulse, but who may just be starting to open their eyes to the broader

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:19.080
the ecocide that is slowly but picking up speed happening in our world with respect to animals

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:26.120
and insects and ocean and CO2 in the atmosphere? I mean, this is the only habitable planet known

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.800
in the universe, this blue-green earth we all inhabit. Do you have advice for other people

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:39.080
who've been successful on where the world needs support that's being overlooked?

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:49.800
If you have money and you are getting older, I can assure you that this is the retirement

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:58.520
project of all retirement projects. It is capable of absorbing any unit of energy you can find.

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:07.080
It is absolutely fascinating. It has all the great important issues

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.280
and a lot of the people who are suddenly sitting on vast pools of money are very smart,

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:23.880
technologically savvy. They are ideally suited for playing a role in this area

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:34.920
and they will enjoy it. It will be part thrilling, challenging, exhausting, discouraging,

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:41.880
encouraging, all of the above, but it will not be boring. You will not be reduced to playing too

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:53.240
much golf. It is a great project and it's the only one that, it's the issue that matters most,

01:44:53.240 --> 01:45:03.400
let's put it that way. By the way, I'm not a fund manager. I play no role in investing other than

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:10.840
the meta-level issues of should you invest in climate change? Is there a bubble? I haven't

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:18.440
come close to managing a hedge fund really ever. I've only done big issue top-down topics most of

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:27.400
my life and some traditional stockpicking long ago just to get the record straight.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:35.480
Record is straight. Thank you for that. I agree with you. There is no other greater ask for society

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:42.280
right now than the human predicament as it pertains to the natural world and where we've arrived.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:54.360
However, the financial system, which you know well, is optionality on power and resources. As

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:59.720
long as we have a fungible reserve currency in the world, currently the dollar, that dollar,

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:06.280
as you maximize it and grow the amount of it, is a claim on everything else that you can quickly

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:14.360
turn it into land or a different currency or ownership in a company. To do the right thing

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:23.720
for nature and our children and the biosphere reduces one's optionality. I told you, I used

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:29.320
to work at Salomon Brothers and I had clients that had $300 million and they were going to get to

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:34.520
$500 million and they would quit. But when they got to $500 million, their buddies had more and

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:43.480
it was a compulsion to grow the amount of assets. How does that dynamic merge with

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:49.000
growing recognition of the unbelievable tragedies that are unfolding in the natural world?

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:56.120
Nate, I think it's an unanswerable question from my perspective.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:05.720
It is too profound and philosophical for my skill set, so I am going to dug that one.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:11.080
It's the right question, but I am not the right person to answer it.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:19.720
Okay, I will ask a related question. I know that you also fund work at universities,

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:26.280
especially on climate. I'm going to start asking this question of all my guests because it's my

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:34.040
belief that young humans, especially those in grad school or postdocs, are an incredible,

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:41.960
underutilized human resource to tackle some of the problems that you've integrated on this call.

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:48.360
So, but they're working within an economic structure within the academy

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.880
that is kind of linear and doesn't integrate the things that we've been discussing.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.720
So, in your field, climate, oceans, endocrine disrupting, extinctions,

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:08.440
how that fits together, can you suggest some really big questions for postdocs, grad students,

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:14.600
universities around the world that need research, need answers that are happening right now?

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:27.160
What is really the threat in epigenetic problems changing the way that

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:35.080
genes express themselves after exposure to chemicals? We really have to follow that up.

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:41.880
We really have to follow up the sperm count studies and what can be done, what is causing the

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:49.480
damage. They really don't know. You know, Shana thinks it's mainly the forever chemicals. I think

01:48:49.480 --> 01:49:00.760
it's mainly pesticides on fruit and vegetables. And it isn't known, but we should have important

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:06.360
follow-up studies. The same with insects. We may be taking, we may be teetering on the edge

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:13.960
of our own destruction and we just don't know it because no one has ever funded insect research.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:22.600
And you could take all our money, throw it at any one of these things and it would kind of

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.760
still be a drop in the bucket, although it would certainly help.

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:41.080
We have decided to throw all our money in a sense at green tech research because we think it buys

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:50.840
us time for governments and new rich people to get the point and start to change the way they

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:59.080
spend their money and the way the government spends its money by time through technology

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:07.000
to push the window away before we go off the cliff. But as you kind of implied, these are not

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:15.480
long-term cures. These are just buying time for the long-term actions to be taken. And the most

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:23.400
impressive one to me is population reduction. That I think is pretty well baked in the pie.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.920
We didn't cover one thing, which is the shockingly politically incorrect. And therefore,

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:41.640
we should probably do it. And that is the main reason for population crash. It's not a population

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:47.800
crash because of the old fogies living longer, but it's a baby cohort crash. The main reason

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:57.640
is the choice, obviously. More educated women are realizing that many children just impinge on

01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:05.080
their flexibility of their life and their ability to kind of fully realize themselves. Anyway, so

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:14.200
we have this huge correlation between female education and fertility. And secondly, postponement,

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:21.720
everyone wants quite correctly to get their career going before they interrupt it. And that makes a

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:28.520
lot of sense. But when you postpone, you're not nearly as fertile. And I believe it interacts

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:37.480
with toxicity in a nonlinear way. So it doesn't really matter if you have some toxic exposure

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:44.280
when you're a 16-year-old. And Nigerian, just to pick on a place with a very high fertility rate,

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:55.320
because you have many years to make it up. But you're a 39-year-old Parisian worker,

01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:03.720
you may find you simply can't have a child. So that's reason number two. The reason number three

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:11.480
is toxicity, reduced sperm count, increasing miscarriages, and all of the lesser problems

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:17.400
that come with chemical exposure, which is getting worse rapidly and will soon be

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:23.800
overtaking postponement into second place. And then there is the one that no one talks about.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:33.480
And that is, in addition to the measurable reduction in sperm count, etc., there is a hard

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:42.600
to measure effect on hormone interference, on your willingness, your eagerness to procreate.

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:52.840
Every study, as far as I'm aware, and I've tried to look at them, every study on sexual activity

01:52:52.840 --> 01:53:00.600
says it's going down. In each age group, pregnancies in 16-year-olds and younger,

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.080
dropping rapidly. That's a lack of willingness to procreate or a lack of willingness to do the

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:16.840
act that results in procreation? No, a lack of interest in procreation. In other words, you are

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:29.000
not motivated. You're not the 22-year-old of circa 1955. You have less interest. And

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:47.160
that was available implication of the study from Shana Swann and Haggai Levine.

01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:57.560
And it may be the most powerful force of all. 40% of South Korean 40-year-olds have not had a child.

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:11.960
And the activity in terms of dating and so on has really dwindled down so that it's the women's

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:20.760
night out and the guys playing competitive computer games on a Saturday night and not going to the

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:30.920
bar and hooking up or whatever we call it. This is, I think, potentially very profound

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:36.920
and maybe the most important single consequence of chemical exposure.

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.240
But can that be described by chemical exposure or could it also be

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:49.560
described by the subconscious recognition of climate change and limits to growth and other

01:54:49.640 --> 01:55:00.040
things that people just don't have that inner freedom and a spree decor of discovery and all

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:05.640
that, that there's just a pall and that we've become the walking worried? I don't know.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:17.400
Well, I can hazard a strong guess. As a betting man, I would put a very large bet on this. In the

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:22.440
community in which we move, we bump into people who fall into your description.

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:31.800
As a percentage of young people, I think they are pretty small and confined to certain

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:38.920
countries and socioeconomic groups. In China, for example, I would expect that to be a very small

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:50.600
fraction of the opinion. But the proof of the pudding is that in the Korea, Japan, China,

01:55:51.880 --> 01:56:02.120
and probably when measured correctly, India, they're all acting as if, forget the choice,

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.520
I'm just not interested. And that component is accelerating. And that, of course,

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:14.120
is a real threat to the species. And I think this is a real threat to the species.

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.440
But it cuts right across all the other things we're working on, doesn't it?

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:26.040
If our population is going to turn out to be substantially less than the low estimate of

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:36.280
the UN by 2100 in just 70 years, and then much less by 2200, the main things we have to worry

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:44.280
about maybe is holding society together. The demand for all the bad things like oil and copper

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:53.160
will drop like stone. But the stress on society and economy will be pretty high.

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:57.560
I don't know enough about that. I'm going to have to look into that. But you're right,

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.840
it would affect everything else, including the paying back of debt.

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:11.720
That is such an important point about the payback of debt. I started out

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.720
life studying big American industrial corporations who were in decline, international

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:25.480
harvester. And the retirees had certain obligations. And the workforce supporting them

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:34.040
were declining. The company was declining, but the retirees were static. And that is

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.680
a very similar echo here in the following way. The thing we haven't talked about

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:52.360
is the cost of doing what we have to do. We think it's 50 trillion increment to green the economy.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:58.600
And the reason it's so low is because you have to buy a car anyway, you have to build a new factory

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:06.360
anyway, you have to build up grade the grid anyway, and you combine that with greening it.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:14.360
And so it's a relative bargain, 50, maybe 75 trillion dollars. You then have the accumulated

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:22.600
damage, which between now and 100 years is probably going to be somewhere in the range of

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.960
30 to 100 trillion. It's a very wide error bar. How can we put a price tag on

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.640
insects or ecosystems or the Amazon? I'm just talking about floods,

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:43.400
floods, droughts, and food problems. In other words, old-fashioned simply measured pain,

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:49.000
which is going through the roof as we sit. But 10 years ago was really quite marginal.

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:59.080
And the biggest one of all, and that is we're going to have to end up when we get to

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:09.960
a zero carbon industrial system, we're going to end up with, we believe, about 550 parts per million

01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:16.920
plus or minus 50. That's if we do better, try harder, and have a steady stream of innovations.

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:25.800
We started out life at 280, we're at 420. If we do a better job, we might peak this out at 550,

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:32.280
but we've got to go back from 550 to 300. That's 250 parts per million. If we don't,

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:40.600
the ice caps will melt, we'll have 200 feet rise and so on, and a lot of the fires and floods and

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:45.880
transference of the Amazon to Savannah, et cetera, will keep going. So we have to do it.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:51.800
And when you're green in the economy, you have a lot of offsetting virtues. You drive, as I do,

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:57.800
a Model 3 is the best car I've ever got in. You go through Boston in an electrified world in 20

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:03.480
years. It's the cleanest Boston we'll have ever been since its inception. It will have huge health

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:08.440
payoffs, by the way, that no one talks about. So there are lots of offsetting virtues,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:17.560
but taking out 250 parts per million is an absolute dead weight for which you will not

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:23.960
see any direct advantage. Your survival depends on it, but you will not see any immediate payoff,

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:31.000
like you will with greening the economy. And we think we'll be ingenious and terrific and we'll

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.960
get the cost down to $50 a ton, and currently $500, $1,000 a ton, but we'll get it down to 50.

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:43.400
That's what we do well. When we scale this up, it will be brilliantly cheaper, $50 a ton,

02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:55.880
but it's a lot of tons. And the total cost turns out to be $125 trillion. In other words,

02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:04.120
maybe twice as much as greening the economy. And we're going to take decades to do it.

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:12.680
And if the population drops steadily, we have this pension fund problem that you're alluding to,

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:22.280
and that is, if we take a long time, and we probably will, if we peak at $550

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:29.400
one day, and the population is already, in terms of the workers, has already halved,

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:36.680
they have twice the burden. And then as they pay for it over 100 years, it halves again.

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:43.880
By the end, they've quadrupled that burden. And it's a pretty damn big burden anyway. So there is

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:50.680
an unfortunate intersection between a declining population, which is good for most things,

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:57.080
and the cost of decarbonizing and extracting the excess carbon, which will be borne by few

02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:03.080
or few people. So I'm going to have to have you back to discuss the greening of the economy,

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:08.360
because there's so many rabbit holes on that, that I would love your expertise and wisdom on.

02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:14.520
But for right now, let me ask you this. What are the most promising ways that you've come across

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:20.840
for actually subtracting carbon from the atmosphere or things on the come that haven't

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:26.840
really been proven yet that you're optimistic about? Regenerative agriculture, geoengineering,

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:34.040
cloud seeding, marine cloud brightening. Do you have any opinion or optimism in that field?

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.120
I am optimistic on everything you mentioned, actually. I think we will have to get involved

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:49.880
into cloud brightening, sort of relatively low risk, relative high payoff. Certainly,

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:59.320
geoengineering, everything to do with agriculture, we're desperate. We can't be too

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:06.040
careful. We have to be careful, but we can't be ultimately careful because we're running out of

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:14.920
time. And it's something that we can really do a good job at changing the characteristics of

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:21.160
the agricultural process and plants in general, so that they sequester a little more carbon and

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:31.640
require less energy to grow and so on. One of my favorite down to earth little projects is a robot

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:40.760
that runs slowly on its own across the field, gathering about half the corn stubble and converting

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:48.200
it at a very high temperature into biochar. The problem with biochar is wonderful for

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.920
microorganisms. It's wonderful for water retention. It really improves the soil.

02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:59.480
And the problem with it is that you have to truck biomass, which is fatal. And then when

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:06.920
you've converted it into biochar, you truck it to a farm and then you distribute it on the farm.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:14.440
It's all horrifically energy intensive, but this little machine is there. It takes the stubble

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:21.960
right there and converts it to biochar right there. And it does it potentially very cheaply.

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:33.480
Incrementally, something close to $10 a ton or maybe zero, because the value of the soil enhancement

02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:40.680
is enough to justify the process. And the carbon sequestration, which is very substantial,

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:48.600
is a free good. Think about that. So that fits in what we call the too good to be true category.

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:58.840
Which there are quite a few. I keep coming back to we're going to have to value the natural world

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:05.960
more than our current economic system does. And that is going to take money and it's going to

02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:14.360
take money and resources away from stock car driving or Las Vegas junkets or Disneyland or

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:21.960
other things in the society. So who is going to pay for that? Is it going to be investors or

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:31.320
governments or is it a cultural value shift that each of us tithe 10% of our income above a

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:36.280
certain amount towards the natural world? Because then I think there's a lot more things that become

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:43.320
possible among the things you mentioned. But until we get to that point, we're just outsourcing our

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:48.840
wisdom to the financial market and the financial market optimizes capital and not the environment.

02:05:49.640 --> 02:06:01.320
Yes. And we will either improve starting with the social contract, our attitude to we're all in

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:11.320
this together, or we will in the end probably fail. In the meantime, we're saying to ourselves,

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:23.560
that is a big ask and one with uncertain outcome. We know we can improve these things through

02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:32.840
technology. We know we can make it better. We know we can knock years off the research life span.

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:40.920
Let us do what we know we can do that fits into a system that works pretty well.

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:47.080
The venture capital world is the pride and joy of the American capitalist system, in my opinion.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:57.720
It is unlike so many things where far better to be in Denmark, it's far better to be in the US

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:04.760
for venture capital. We suck in all the very best people. We have 15 of the 20 great research

02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:11.480
universities that are integral to the flow of ideas. We take risk better than any other group on

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:20.680
the planet with maybe Australia closed behind. And this is it. This is the one little nook and

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:29.240
cranny of the system that is great. People are flocking in from around the world into green

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:35.880
tech. The green tech world is unlike any other quadrant of capitalism. They are actually thoroughly

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:43.560
concerned with the problem. And it's a big part of their driving force that this is an existential

02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:49.960
risk that they're doing something about. This is really heartening. I joke that they may get

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:56.280
drummed out of the capitalism club because they have all these benevolent attitudes.

02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:03.960
Could you imagine what green tech and the demographic you just described could accomplish

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:12.520
if we had not only a carbon tax but a tax on all non-renewable inputs to the economy

02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:18.040
that would give us the right signals for the downslope of the carbon pulse and then you

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.480
could apply all that ingenuity and creativity towards technological responses.

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:31.480
And there is also the idea of the circular economy. And in France, they're moving to make it

02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:43.560
expensive to design things that cannot be recycled, cannot be repaired. And in that sense,

02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:51.080
the French are odd ducks as we think. But they do some things very, very well. And I think this is

02:08:51.080 --> 02:09:01.720
such an enlightened attitude. And a lot of these problems are quite specific. So if you're in

02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:06.520
Denmark and you solve the chemical problem, you will simply live a lot longer and be healthier.

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:14.200
And eventually, the other people will follow you. The trouble with climate change is it's

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:23.080
fungible. And there's a free rider effect. But we really depend on these handful of people who

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.760
will set a good example and prove that it can be done. Prove that, in fact, the economy in France

02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:36.200
10 years later starts to grow a little faster than the others because they're insisting on

02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:42.680
more recycling and so on, a more circular, successful economy.

02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:49.800
Last question before I get to the final questions. There was a science article,

02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:56.760
I think around eight or nine years ago that showed that if the United States went it alone

02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:05.080
and did the Paris Accord and did everything correctly for climate, that by the year 2100,

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:11.720
it would make an infinitesimal difference into the global temperature. In other words,

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:19.240
it has to kind of be a global thing or it's not going to matter. So do you think there's

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:25.080
possibility of global cooperation on climate endocrine disrupting chemicals and other

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:30.920
environmental risks? Or does it just happen nation by nation and patchwork way?

02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:43.160
I fear that it will be patchwork and in toxicity that works because people can see who is pulling

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:53.240
ahead. However, I think as things get desperate, there is a decent chance that we will start to

02:10:53.240 --> 02:11:01.960
cooperate. People are a little stupid but they're now completely stupid and if we start to go to

02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:10.440
hell in a hand basket, will we not start cooperative ventures on a global carbon tax

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.120
equilibrating policy where every product is treated the same way? Yes, I think that will happen.

02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:26.600
In even more enlightened stuff, it may or may not. We are going to make it, on 20 of these

02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:32.440
questions, we're going to make it if we are slightly more to the enlightened side than the

02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:42.200
unenlightened side. We really exist well within a range of success and failure. I think even with

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:50.040
our deficiencies, we're inventive. Taken all together, we can make it and we can fail.

02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:58.040
This is very unusual that this is not a done job. This is not certain that we will fail. It is not

02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:05.160
certain by by any means that we will succeed and we will have hundreds of these little choices

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:11.320
where some people will be more enlightened, some people will copy them, other people will be a pain

02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:18.120
in the earth. They will send the country back for 10 years and the sum of all of these will decide

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:24.120
whether we model through or whether we don't. That is very well said and that is the conclusion

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:30.760
that I came to when I started this podcast is we need more people to see the game board and how

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:37.000
things fit together so that we can make better decisions and tilt towards the more enlightened.

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:43.720
So, final few questions, Jeremy. You've thought about these issues for a very long time. You're

02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:51.000
85 years young and you are uber focused on the things that really matter. Do you have any personal

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.560
advice to the viewers of this program who are aware of climate change, endocrine disrupting

02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:07.800
chemicals, the flatness in our economy for the people in the lower three quintiles, etc.?

02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:11.880
Do you have any personal advice? And before I answer that, I just want to say

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:21.640
to the average, to the typical viewer, I have just spent 30 or 40 hours

02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:32.680
skimming through and occasionally really listening to Nate's 95 podcast and I have

02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:40.120
by no means covered them but I've tried to select the ones most relevant to me. I have a real

02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:47.320
feeling for the style and what's going on and let me say this is the kind of effort

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:55.720
that if it takes wing, by the time you've done three or four hundred of these becomes

02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:03.720
the authoritative source that people go to get exposed to this line of reasoning.

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.200
This is one of those things that can tip the scale a bit.

02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:14.360
Well, thank you for saying that. I can't imagine doing 300 but I'll keep going.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:22.040
Of course you can imagine doing 300. What sort of thought is that? I have about four people

02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:31.080
that you should really talk to but that's only two or three years from now. That should be a

02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:36.600
piece of cake. You should be aiming at a thousand. There's just about a thousand

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.520
useful people to talk to, I should thank. The advice is

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:56.600
one of the main things in life is purpose and most people born in the history of man have not

02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:04.920
had particular purpose other than staying alive. We have an opportunity to not just stay alive,

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.480
earn a living, feed yourself, but we have an opportunity to change the outcome

02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:21.160
for future generations stretching out for more or less ever. This is the purpose of all purposes,

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:29.880
you lucky people. If you do not attach yourself to this problem, you are missing the point.

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:34.920
You are not paying attention. You're not being intelligent. You're not showing judgment.

02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.160
This is the issue that you should attach as much as your life to as you can.

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:45.960
There is something to be said from make as much money as you can and deploy the money

02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:54.840
to people who know better about other things. That's perfectly acceptable or become an expert in

02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:05.640
any one of the thousands of jobs that are required to make it out of this mess. It is a

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:15.640
wonderful time to be alive in terms of purpose. For my money, purpose is one of the two or three

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:23.400
things that make life worth living. I agree. How would you adjust that advice to a young human

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:32.280
18 to 25 listening to this, becoming aware of these things? Sure, purpose, but do you have

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:37.640
any other advice for young humans? Yeah, I mean, it's the same advice really. Just

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:47.320
pick a career that is useful. Tilt yourself to science and pick a branch of science that is

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:56.280
relevant of which many are to this field. If you're a bit older, think about running a startup

02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:06.440
and make sure the startup has a chance of being really important. Think about getting into green

02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:15.240
venture capital because you can have some leverage and raise some money and show some scale.

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:22.760
No, there are plenty of opportunities here. This is a fortunate time.

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:28.360
If you could, this is a question I ask all my guests, and if you listen to 20 or 30 of my

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:33.320
episodes, you know this, if you could wave a magic wand, Jeremy, and there was no personal

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:39.080
recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:50.120
I suppose that's easy. I would wave a magic wand and have the global population become one billion.

02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:57.560
I like to say that we live at such a finely tuned part of the race of our lives

02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:02.280
that if you imagine a world where we have the population of 1900

02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:08.040
and the technology of today, we have no problem. We've made it.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.120
If we had the technology of 1900 and the population of today, we're toast. We have no hope.

02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:21.560
The whole of this race has played out in the hundred year gap between population growth

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:28.440
and technology. It's quite remarkable. That's well stated. I hadn't heard it put that way before.

02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:36.280
Therefore, finding yourself at one billion tomorrow, I think we have enough time

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.880
and resources and talent to muddle our way through.

02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:50.760
This has been quite a conversation. I would like to have you come back maybe as a roundtable guest

02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:56.920
or to take a deeper dive. Is there a topic that we didn't cover today, maybe esoteric,

02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.440
but relevant to our futures that if you were to come back and take a deep dive on that topic,

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:10.920
does something come to mind? Well, my topics are toxicity, population,

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:19.960
and the viability of the animal world, insect world, resource limitations,

02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:28.760
particularly metals, energy, inequality, deficiencies in capitalism.

02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:40.840
We did a pretty good job of at least getting into some of that of each topic.

02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:47.080
Well, I hope this podcast is watched. And bubbles. That's my only other thing.

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:56.520
And bubbles. Well, we're in numerous bubbles at the moment. Thank you for thinking and caring

02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:03.320
about these things during your career. And thank you for your time today and to be continued,

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:10.440
I hope. And thanks, Jeremy. And thank you, Nate, the same way. Thank you for your efforts.
